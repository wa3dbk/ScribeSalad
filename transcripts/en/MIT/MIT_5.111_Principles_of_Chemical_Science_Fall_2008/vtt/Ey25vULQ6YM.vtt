00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:24.870
PROFESSOR: And this is a
question based on where we

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.730
left off on Wednesday -- we were
talking about Coulomb's

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.750
force law to describe the
interaction between two

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.330
particles, and good job, most
of you got this correct.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.910
So, what we're looking at here
is the force when we have two

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.220
charged particles, one positive,
one negative --

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.230
here, the nucleus
and an electron.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.810
So, I know this is a simple
example and I can see everyone

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.210
pretty much got it right, and
probably those that didn't

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.390
actually made some sort of
clicker error is my guess.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.410
But I wanted to use this to
point out that in this class

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.150
in general, any time you see
an equation to explain a

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.320
certain phenomenon, such as here
looking at force, it's a

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.310
good idea to check yourself by
first plugging it into the

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.220
actual equation, so you can
plug in infinity and this

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.050
equation here, and what you
would see is, of course, the

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.460
force, if you just solve the
math problem goes to zero.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.240
But you can also look at it
qualitatively, so, if you

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.060
think about the force between
the electron and the proton,

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.720
you could just qualitatively
think about what's happening.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.940
If they're close together
there's a certain force --

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.983
they're attracted because they
have opposite charges, but as

00:01:32.983 --> 00:01:35.470
that gets further and further
away, that force is going to

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.695
get smaller and smaller, and
eventually the force is going

00:01:38.695 --> 00:01:39.860
to approach zero.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.690
So, it's a good kind of mental
check as we go through this

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.130
course to remember every time
there's an equation, usually

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.820
there's a very good reason for
that equation, and you can go

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.600
ahead and just use your
qualitative knowledge, you

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.870
don't have to just always stick
with the math to check

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.640
and justify your answers.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.740
So, we can get started with
today's lecture notes.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.880
And, as I mentioned, we left
off and as we started back

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.930
here to describe the atom and
how the atom holds together

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.010
the nucleus and the electron
using classical mechanics.

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.820
And today we'll finish that
discussion, and, of course,

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.830
point out actually the failure
of classical mechanics to

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.960
appropriately describe what's
going on in an atom.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.640
So, then we'll get to turn to
a new kind of mechanics or

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.310
quantum mechanics, which will
in fact be able to describe

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.920
what's happening on this very,
very small size scale -- so on

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.980
the atomic size scale on the
order of nanometers or

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.060
angstroms, very small
particles.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.430
And the reason that quantum
mechanics is going to work

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.020
where classical mechanics
fails is that classical

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.980
mechanics did not take into
account the fact that matter

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.720
has both wave-like and
particle-like properties, and

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.700
light has both wave-like and
particle-like properties.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.280
So, we'll take a little bit of a
step back after we introduce

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.880
quantum mechanics, and talk
about light as a wave, and the

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.880
characteristic of waves, and
then light as a particle.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.070
And one example of this is in
the photoelectric effect.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.000
So, we just talked about the
force law to describe the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.090
interaction between a proton
and an electron.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.150
You told me that when the
distance went to infinity, the

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.610
force went to zero.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.300
What happens instead when the
distance goes to zero?

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.810
What happens to the force?

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:27.080
Yeah.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.010
So, the force actually goes to
infinity, and specifically it

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.910
goes to negative infinity.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.290
Infinity is the force when we're
thinking about it and

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.270
our brains, negative infinity
is when we actually plug it

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.870
into the equation here, and the
reason is the convention

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.280
that the negative sign is just
telling us the direction that

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.000
the force is coming together
instead of pushing apart.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.100
So, we can use Coulomb's force
law to think about the force

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.130
between these two particles --
and it does that, it tells us

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.720
the force is a function
of that distance.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.380
But what it does not tell us,
which if we're trying to

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.460
describe an atom we really want
to know, is what happens

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.750
to the distance as
time passes?

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.570
So, r is a function of time.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.770
But luckily for us, there's a
classical equation of motion

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.190
that will, in fact, describe how
the electron and nucleus

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.350
change position or change
their radius as

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.280
a function of time.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.390
So, that's -- does anyone know
which classical law of motion

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.370
that would be?

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.680
Yup, so it's going to be
Newton's second law, force

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.070
equals mass times acceleration
-- those of you that are quick

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.130
page-turners, have a little
one-up on answering that.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.070
And that tells us force as a
function of acceleration, we

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.070
want to know it though as a
function of radius, so we can

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.520
just take the first derivative
and get ourselves to velocity.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.570
So, force is equal to
mass times dv /dt.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.120
But, of course, we want to go
all the way to distance, so we

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.130
take the second derivative and
we have this equation for

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.670
force here.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.640
And what we can do in order
to bring the two equations

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.940
together, is to plug in the
Coulomb force law right here.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.170
So, now we have our Coulomb
force law all plugged in here,

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.930
and we have this differential
equation that we could solve,

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.020
if we wanted to figure out
what the force was at

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.470
different times t, or at
different positions of r.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.810
So, all you will have the
opportunity to solve

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.920
differential equations in
your math courses here.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.310
We won't do it in this
chemistry course.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.260
In later chemistry courses,
you'll also get to solve

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.800
differential equations.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.730
But instead in this chemistry
course, I will just tell you

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.030
the solutions to differential
equations.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.260
And what we can do is we can
start with some initial value

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.230
of r, and here I write r being
ten angstroms. That's a good

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.220
approximation when we're talking
about atoms, because

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.630
that's about the size
of and atom.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.900
So, let's say we start off
at the distance being ten

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.840
angstroms. We can plug that
into this differential

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.940
equation that we'll have and
solve it, and what we find out

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.540
is that r actually goes to zero
at a time that's equal to

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.790
10 to the negative 10 seconds.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.130
So, let's think qualitatively
for a second about what that

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.060
means or what the real
meaning of that is.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.440
What that is telling us is that
according to Newtonian

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.630
mechanics and Coulomb's force
law, is that the electron

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.460
should actually plummet into
the nucleus in 0.1

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.730
nanoseconds.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:22.590
So, we have a little bit
of a problem here.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.460
And the problem that we have
is that what we're figuring

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.310
out mathematically is not
exactly matching up with what

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.060
we're observing experimentally.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.330
And, in fact, it's often kind of
difficult to experimentally

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.540
test your mathematical
predictions -- a lot of people

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.220
spend many, many years testing
one single mathematical

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.260
prediction.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.670
But, I think all of us right
now can probably test this

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.850
prediction right here, and we're
observing that, in fact,

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.960
all of us and all the atoms we
can see are not immediately

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.140
collapsing in less than
a nanosecond.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.320
So, just, if you can take what
I'm saying for a moment right

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.140
now that in fact this should
collapse in this very small

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.290
time frame, we have to see that
there's a problem with

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.860
one of these two things, either
the Coulomb force law

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.680
or Newtonian mechanics.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:18.730
So, what do you guys think is
probably the issue here?

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:23.070
So, it's Newtonian mechanics,
and the reason for this is

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.510
because Newtonian mechanics does
not work on this very,

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.990
very small size scale.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.220
As we said, Newtonian mechanics
does work in most

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.580
cases, it does work when we're
discussing things that we can

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.920
see, it does work even
on things that are

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.090
too small to measure.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.570
But once we got to the atomic
size scale, what happens is we

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:45.880
need to be taking into account
the fact that matter has these

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.760
wave-like properties, and we'll
learn more about that

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.150
later, but essentially classical
mechanics does not

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:52.930
take that into account at all.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.330
So, we need a new kind of
mechanics, which is quantum

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.580
mechanics, which will accurately
explain the

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.590
behavior of molecules
on this small scale.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:05.530
So, as I mentioned, the real
key to quantum mechanics is

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:08.190
that it's treating matter not
just like it's a particle,

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:10.680
which is what we were just
doing, but also like it's a

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.350
wave, and it treats light
that way, too.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.340
The second important point to
quantum mechanics is that it

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:20.280
actually considers the fact that
light consists of these

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.590
discrete packets or
particle-like pieces of

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.570
energy, which are
called photons.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.300
And if you think about what's
actually happening here, this

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.840
second point that light
consists of photons is

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.840
actually the same thing as
saying that light shows

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.190
particle-like properties, but
that's such an important point

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:41.150
that I put it separately, and
we'll cover that separately as

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.780
we go along.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:48.500
So, we now have this new way
of thinking about how a

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.520
nucleus and an electron can
hang together, and this is

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.480
quantum mechanics, and we can
use this to come up with a new

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.140
way to describe our atom and the
behavior of atoms. But the

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.080
problem is before we do this,
it makes sense to take a

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.385
little bit of a step back and
actually make sure we're all

00:09:03.385 --> 00:09:05.690
on the same page and
understanding why quantum

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:09.110
mechanics is so important and
how it works, and specifically

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:12.210
understanding what we mean when
we say that light is both

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.770
a particle and a wave, and that
matter is both a particle

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:18.640
and a wave. So, we'll move on to
this discussion of light as

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.080
a wave, and we really won't
pick up into going back to

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.370
applying quantum mechanics to
the atom until Friday, but in

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.970
the meantime, we'll really get
to understand the wave

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:33.220
particle duality of light
and of matter.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.640
So, we'll start with thinking
about some properties of waves

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.430
that are going to be applicable
to all waves that

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.750
we're talking about, including
light waves.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:44.810
The easiest kind of waves for us
to picture are ocean waves

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.810
or water waves, because we can,
in fact, see them, but

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.110
they have similar properties
to all waves.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:53.820
And those properties include
that you have this periodic

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.940
variation of some property.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.320
So, when we're talking about
water waves, the property

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.650
we're discussing is just
the water level.

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:04.780
So, for example, we have this
average level, and then it can

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:08.160
go high where we have the peak,
or it can go very low.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.990
We can also discuss sound waves,
so again it's just the

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:14.060
periodic variation of some
property -- in this case we're

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.700
talking about density, so we
have high density areas and

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.730
low density areas.

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.880
So, regardless of the type of
wave that we're talking about,

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.390
there's some common definitions
that we want to

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:28.070
make sure that we're all
able to use, and

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:28.920
the first is amplitude.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.060
And when we're talking about
the amplitude of the wave,

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.820
we're talking about
the deviation from

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.290
that average level.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:38.440
So, if we define the average
level as zero, you can have

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.760
either a positive amplitude
or a negative amplitude.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.930
So, sometimes people get
confused when they're solving

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:46.430
problems and call the amplitude
this distance all

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:49.760
the way from the max to the
min, but it's only half of

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.470
that because we're only going
back to the average level.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.940
So, what we really want to
talk about here is light

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.360
waves, and light waves have the
same properties as these

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.550
other kind of waves in that
they're the periodic variation

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.080
of some property.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.280
So, when we're discussing
light waves, what we're

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.130
talking about is actually
light or electromagnetic

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.160
radiation, is what we'll
be calling it

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.400
throughout the course.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.310
And that's the periodic
variation

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:17.040
of an electric field.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.540
So, instead of having the
periodic variation of water,

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:24.040
or the periodic variation of
air density, here we're

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.810
talking about an
electric field.

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:28.940
We know what an electric field
is, it's just a space through

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.860
which a Coulomb force
operates.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.660
And the important thing to
think about when you're

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.620
talking about the fact that it's
a periodic variation, is

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.800
if you put a charged particle
somewhere into an electric

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.270
field, it will, of course, go in
a certain direction toward

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:43.990
the charge it's attracted to.

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:46.380
But you need to think about the
difference, if you have a

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.560
particle here on your wave, it
will go in one direction.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.990
But remember, waves don't just
have magnitude, they also do

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.150
have direction.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:58.250
So, if instead you put your
particle somewhere down here

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:01.520
on the electric field, or on the
wave, the electric field

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.410
will now be in the other
direction, so your particle

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:06.960
will be pushed the other way.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.460
And from physics you know that,
of course, if we have a

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.590
propagating electric field, we
also have a perpendicular

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:14.970
magnetic field that's going
back and forth.

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:18.730
But in terms of worrying about
using the concepts of a wave

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.810
to solve chemistry problems in
this course, we can actually

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:26.030
put aside the fact, and only
focus on the electric field

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:28.210
part of things, because that's
what's going to be interacting

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:32.780
with our charged particles,
such as our electrons.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:36.610
So, other properties of waves
that you probably are all

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.360
familiar with but I just want
to review is the idea of a

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.970
wavelength.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.430
If we're talking about the
wavelength of a wave, we're

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.930
just talking about the distance
that there is between

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:50.260
successive maxima, or of course,
we can also be talking

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.780
about the distance between
successive minima.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.420
Basically, we can take any point
on the wave, and it's

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:59.090
the distance to that same point
later on in the wave.

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:01.580
So, that's what we call
one wavelength.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:05.300
We also commonly discuss the
frequency of a wave, and the

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.270
frequency is just the number of
cycles that that wave goes

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.310
through per unit time.

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:13.700
So, by a cycle we'd basically
mean how many times we cycle

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.910
through a complete wavelength.

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:19.240
So, if something cycles through
five wavelengths in a

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.780
single second, we would just say
that the frequency of that

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:27.170
wave is five per second.

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:30.110
We can also mathematically
describe what's going on here

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:32.260
other than just graphing it.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.760
So, if we want to look at the
mathematical equation of a

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.450
wave, we want to describe --
again as I mention, what we're

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:40.780
describing is the electric
field, we're not worrying

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:46.050
about the magnetic field here,
as a function of x and t

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:53.540
that's equal to a cosine [
2 pi x over wavelength,

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:57.930
minus 2 pi nu t ].

00:13:57.930 --> 00:13:59.260
And note this is the
Greek letter nu.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:07.410
This is not a v. Where we have
E, which is equal to the

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:13.300
electric field, what is x?

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.090
STUDENT: Position.

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:21.610
PROFESSOR: Yup, the position of
the wave. And what about t?

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:26.600
Yeah, so we're talking about
both position and time.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.383
So what we can do if we're
talking about a wave is think

00:14:29.383 --> 00:14:31.920
of it both in terms of position
time, but if we're

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.810
trying to visualize this -- for
example if we're actually

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.760
to graph this out, the easiest
thing to do is keep one of

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:46.270
these two variables constant,
either the x or the t, and

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:49.510
then just consider the
other variable.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.290
So, for example, if we're to
hold the time constant, this

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:55.270
makes it a lot simpler of an
equation, because what we can

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:58.070
end up doing is actually
crossing out

00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:59.810
this whole term here.

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:03.370
So what we're left with is just
that the electric field

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:09.630
as a function of distance is a
times cosine of the argument

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:13.640
there, which is now just
2 pi x over wavelength.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.760
So, what we want to be able to
do, either when we're looking

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.870
at the graph or looking at the
equation up there, is to think

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:22.020
about different properties of
the wave. For example, to

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:26.340
think about at what point do we
have the wave where it's at

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:29.740
its maximum amplitude?

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.700
So, if we think about that, we
need to have a point where

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:36.020
we're making this argument of
the cosine such that the

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:39.120
cosine is going to all be equal
to one, so all we're

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.470
left with is that a term.

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:45.340
So, we can do that basically
any time that we have an

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:49.430
integer variable that is either
zero or an integer

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:51.320
variable of the wavelength.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.800
So, for example, negative
wavelength or positive

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.650
wavelength are two times the
wavelength, because that lets

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:59.650
us cross out the term with the
wavelength here, and we're

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:04.760
left with some integer
multiple of just pi.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.860
So, that's sort of the
mathematically how we get to

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.900
a, but we can also just look
at the graph here, because

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.320
every time we go one wavelength,
we can see that

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.940
we're back in a maximum.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.420
So, I mentioned we should be
able to figure out where the

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.740
maximum amplitude is.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.990
You should also just looking at
an equation, immediately be

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.980
able to figure out what that
maximum amplitude is in terms

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.470
of the height of it just by
looking at that a-term, here

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:33.200
we should also be able to know
the intensity of any light

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.780
wave, because intensity is just
the amplitude squared.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.620
So, we should immediately be
able to know how bright or how

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:42.220
intense a light is just looking
at the wave equation,

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:47.160
or just by looking at a graph.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.750
We can also do a similar
thing, and I'll keep my

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:54.900
distance from the board, but
we can instead be holding x

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:58.420
constant, for example, putting
x to be equal to zero, and

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:01.990
then all we're doing is
considering the electric field

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:03.190
as a function of t.

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.560
So, in this case we're crossing
out the first term

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.430
there, and we're left with
amplitude times the cosine of

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:13.120
2 pi nu times t.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.350
And, of course, we can do the
same thing again, we can think

00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:18.710
about when the amplitude is
going to be at its maximum,

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:22.220
and it's going to be any time
cosine of this term now is

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.490
equal to one.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:26.340
So that will be at, for example,
negative 1 over nu,

00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:28.590
or 0, or 1 over nu.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:31.090
And again, we can just look at
our graph to figure that out,

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:35.350
that's exactly where
we're at a maximum.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:39.450
So, 1 over nu is another term
we use and we call it the

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:42.750
period of a wave, and the period
is just the inverse of

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:44.200
the frequency.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.450
And if we think about frequency,
that's number of

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:48.130
cycles per unit time.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:51.450
So, for example, number of
cycles per second, whereas the

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:58.660
period is how much time it takes
for one cycle to occur.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.680
And when we talk about units of
frequency, in almost every

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.000
case, you'll be talking about
number of cycles per second.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.900
So, you can just write
inverse second, the

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:07.700
cycle part is assumed.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:13.560
But you'll also frequently see
it called Hertz, so, Hz here.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.970
So, if you're talking about five
cycles per second, you

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:18.740
can write five per second, or
you can write five Hertz.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.360
The one thing you want to keep
in mind though is that Hertz

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.250
does not actually mean
inverse seconds, it

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:24.900
means cycles per second.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.760
So, if you're talking about a
car going so many meters per

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:31.270
second, you can't say it's going
meter Hertz, you have to

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.790
say meters per second.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.590
So, this really just means
for frequency,

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:37.090
it's a frequency label.

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:38.310
Alright.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:40.920
So, since we have these terms
defined, we know the frequency

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.440
and the wavelength, it turns
out we can also think about

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.520
the speed of the wave, and
specifically of a light wave,

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.790
and speed and is just equal to
the distance that's traveled

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:53.370
divided by the time
the elapsed.

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:56.340
And because we've defined these
terms, we have ways to

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:57.790
describe these things.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:00.480
So, we can describe the distance
that's traveled, it's

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.070
just a wavelength here.

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:06.320
And we can think about how
long it takes for a wave,

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.130
because waves are, we know not
just changing in position, but

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:11.700
the whole wave is moving forward
with time, we can

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:15.610
think about how long it takes
for wave to go one wavelength.

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:18.510
So, one distance that's
equal to lambda.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:25.080
So, how much time would that
take, does anyone know?

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.170
So, would it take, for example,
the same amount of

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:33.680
time as the frequency?

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:34.910
The period, that's right.

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:38.470
So, it's going to take one
period to move that long.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:42.280
And another way we can say
period is just 1 over nu or 1

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.860
over the frequency So, now
we know both the distance

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:48.140
traveled and the time
the elapsed.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.590
So, we can just plug it in.

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:53.240
Speed is equal to the distance
traveled, which is lambda over

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.950
the time elapsed, which is 1
over nu. so, we can re-write

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:02.090
that as speed is equal to lambda
times nu, and it turns

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:04.860
out typically this is reported
in meters per second or

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.810
nanometers per second.

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:09.750
So, now we have an equation
where we know the relationship

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:14.350
between speed and wavelength
and frequency, and it turns

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:17.180
out that we could take any wave,
and as long as we know

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.160
the frequency and the
wavelength, we'll be able to

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.480
figure out the speed.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.880
But, of course, there's
something very special about

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.190
electromagnetic waves,
electromagnetic

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:28.020
radiation and the speed.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.660
And it's not really surprising
for me to tell you that

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:34.240
electromagnetic radiation has
a constant speed, and that

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.760
speed is what we call the speed
of light, and typically

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:41.880
we abbreviate that as c, and
that's from the Latin term

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.100
celeritas, which means
speed in Latin.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.970
That's one of four or five Latin
words I remember from

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:50.780
four years of high school Latin,
but it comes in handy

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:53.080
to remember speed of light.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.760
And some of you may have
memorized what the speed of

00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.250
light is in high school -- it's
about 3 times 10 to the 8

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:01.750
meters per second.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.990
This is another example of
a constant that you will

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:06.770
accidentally memorize in this
course as you use it over and

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:07.310
over again.

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:10.730
But again, that we will supply
for you on the exam just in

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:13.160
case you forget it
at that moment.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.840
And this is a very fast speed,
of course, it's about 700

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:20.570
million miles per hour.

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:22.980
So, one way to put that in
perspective is to think about

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:27.780
how long it takes for a
light beam to get from

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:28.640
earth to the moon.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:32.270
Does anyone have any guesses?

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:33.980
Eight seconds, that
sounds good.

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:37.170
Anyone else?

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.810
These are all really good
guesses, so it actually takes

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:42.500
1.2 seconds for light
to travel from the

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:43.360
earth to the moon.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.750
So, we're talking pretty
fast, so that's nice to

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:48.930
appreciate in itself.

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:53.560
But other than that point, we
can also think about the fact

00:21:53.560 --> 00:22:00.520
that frequency and wavelength
are related in a way that now

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.260
since we know the speed of
light, if we know one we can

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:03.950
tell the other.

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:06.090
So, you can go ahead and switch
us to our clicker

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:08.720
question here.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:13.110
So, we should be able to look
at different types of waves

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:16.460
and be able to figure out
something about both their

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.670
frequency and their wavelength,
and know the

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:20.570
relationship between the two.

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:23.880
So, it's up on this screen
here now, so we'll work

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.120
on the other one.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.590
If you can identify which of
these statements is correct

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.940
based on what you know about
the relationship between

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.880
frequency and wavelength
and also just

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:42.400
looking at the waves.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:42.670
Alright.

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:49.550
So, let's give ten more
seconds on that.

00:22:49.550 --> 00:23:06.670
So, ten seconds on that.

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:07.170
Alright.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:08.320
So, good job.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.920
So, most people could recognize
that light wave a

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.340
has the shorter wavelength.

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:18.240
We can see that just by looking
at the graph itself --

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.950
we can see, certainly, this is
shorter from maxima to maxima.

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:22.810
This we can't even see
the next maxima,

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:24.010
so it's much longer.

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:26.640
And then, we also know that
means that it has the higher

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.430
frequency, because our
relationship between

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:32.450
wavelength and frequency
are inversely related.

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:35.190
And also, we know the
speed of light.

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:38.410
So, if we think about if it's a
shorter wavelength, we'll be

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:40.840
able to get a lot more
wavelengths in, in a given

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.450
time, than we would for
a longer wavelength.

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:47.400
So, we can switch back to the
notes and think about what

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.230
this means, and what this means
when we're talking about

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:52.670
all the different kinds of light
waves we have, and I've

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:56.930
shown a bunch here, is that if
we have the wavelength, we

00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:59.670
also know the frequency
of these wavelengths.

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:03.070
So, for example, radio waves,
which have very long

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:07.620
wavelengths have very
low frequencies.

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:12.620
Whereas where we go to waves
that have very short

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:16.630
wavelengths, such a x-rays or
cosmic rays, they, in turn,

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:19.660
have very high frequencies.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.210
So, it's important to get a
little bit of a sense of what

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.510
all these different kinds
of lights do.

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:27.610
You're absolutely not
responsible to memorize what

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:29.950
the wavelengths of the different
types of lights are,

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:32.870
but you do want to be
able to know the

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:34.260
general order of them.

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:37.700
So, if someone tells you they're
using UV light versus

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.770
x-ray light, you know that the
x-ray light is, in fact, at a

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:41.760
higher frequency.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.330
So that's the important
take-away

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:44.810
message from this slide.

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:47.150
If we think about these
different types of lights,

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:50.420
microwave light, if it's
absorbed by a molecule, is a

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.650
sufficient amount of frequency
and energy to get those

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:55.370
molecules to rotate.

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:57.200
That, of course, generates
heat, so that's how your

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.300
microwaves work.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:02.530
If we talk about infrared light,
which is at a higher

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:06.610
frequency here and a shorter
wavelength, infrared light

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:08.950
when it's absorbed by molecules
actually is enough

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:12.050
to cause molecules
now to vibrate.

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:15.570
If we move up to the more
high-frequency and divisible

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:19.350
light and all the way into UV
light, if you shine UV light

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:21.830
at certain molecules, it's going
to have enough energy to

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:25.430
actually pop those electrons
in that molecule up to a

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:28.210
higher energy level, which will
make more sense once we

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:31.790
talk about energy levels in
atoms, but that's what UV

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:32.910
light can do.

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:35.130
And actually, that's responsible
for fluorescence

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:37.850
and phosphorescence that
you see where typically

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:39.780
UV light comes in.

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.000
So, if you use a black lamp or
something and you excite

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.140
something up to a higher energy
level and then it

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:47.490
relaxes back down to its lower
energy state, it's going to

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:50.540
emit a new wavelength of light,
which is going to be

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:51.920
visible to you.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.610
X-rays are at even a higher
frequency, and those are

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:59.365
sufficient to actually be
absorbed by a molecule and pop

00:25:59.365 --> 00:26:01.450
an electron all the way
out of that molecule.

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:04.580
You can see how that would be
damaging to the integrity of

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:08.090
that molecule, that's why x-rays
are so damaging -- you

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:11.040
don't want to have electrons
disappearing for no good

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.140
reason from your molecules that
can cause the kind of

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:16.770
mutations we don't want to
be seeing in ourselves.

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:18.930
And then also as we go
higher, we have gamma

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:21.580
rays and cosmic rays.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:25.400
Within the visible range of what
we can see, you also want

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:29.200
to know this relative order
that's pretty easy -- most of

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.850
us have memorized that
in kindergarten, so

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:32.260
that should be fine.

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:36.140
Just remembering that violet is
the end that actually has

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:39.670
the shortest wavelength, which
means that it also has, of

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:42.100
course, the highest frequency.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.560
So, just an interesting fact
about this set of light, which

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.830
we're most familiar with, if we
think about our vision, it

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:51.330
turns out that our vision's
actually logarithmic and it's

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:54.150
centered around this
green frequency.

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:57.520
So, if instead of a red laser
pointer here, I had a green

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:00.370
one, you'd actually, to our
eyes, it would seem like the

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:04.110
green one was brighter, even if
the intensity was the same,

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:06.740
and that's just because our
eyes are centered and

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:11.710
logarithmic around this
green frequency set.

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:15.780
So, using the relationship
between frequency and

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.450
wavelength, we can actually
understand a lot about what's

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:20.330
going on, and pretty soon
we'll also draw the

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:22.830
relationship very soon to
energy, so it will be even

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:24.300
more informative then.

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.370
But I just want to point out one
of the many, many groups

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:31.850
at MIT that works with different
fluorescing types of

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:34.940
molecules, and this is Professor
Bawendi's laboratory

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.250
at MIT, and he works
with quantum dots.

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:42.950
And quantum dots are these just
very tiny, tiny crystals

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:44.780
of semiconductor material.

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:48.640
They're on the order of one to
ten nanometers, and these can

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.040
be shined on with UV light --
they have a lot of different

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.100
interesting properties, but one
I'll mention is that if

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:56.740
you excite them with UV light,
they will have some of the

00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:00.140
electrons move to a higher
energy state, and when they

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:04.300
drop back down, they actually
emit light with a wavelength

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:09.820
that corresponds with the size
of the actual quantum dot.

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:13.240
So, from what we know so far,
we should be able to look at

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.460
any of these quantum dots,
which are depicted as a

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:18.680
cartoon here, but here we have
an actual picture of the

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:24.390
quantum dots suspended in some
sort of solution and shone on

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:27.450
with UV light, and you can see
that you can achieve this

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:31.710
whole beautiful range of colors
just by modulating the

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:33.510
size of the different dots.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:36.660
And we should be able to know if
we're looking at a red dot

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:41.040
-- is a red dot, it's going to
have a longer wavelength, so

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.200
is this a higher or
lower frequency?

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.020
Yeah, and similarly, if someone
tells us that their

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:49.670
dot is blue-shifted, that should
automatically in our

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:52.980
heads tell us, oh it shifted
to a higher frequency.

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:55.740
And these dots are really
interesting in that you can,

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:58.450
I'm sure by looking at this
picture, already imagine just

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:01.330
a whole slew of different
biological or sensing

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:02.830
applications that you
could think of.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:04.800
For example, if you were trying
to study different

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.600
protein interactions, you could
think about labeling

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.930
them with different colored
dots, or there's also a bunch

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:12.240
of different fluorescent
techniques that you could

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:14.970
apply using these dots, or you
could think of in-vivo

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:18.080
sensing, how useful these could
be if you could think of

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:21.780
a way to get them into your body
without being too toxic,

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:22.420
for example.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:25.410
These are all things that the
Bawendi group is working on.

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:28.470
What they are real experts in is
synthesizing many different

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:31.100
kinds of these dots, and they
have a synthetic scheme that's

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.760
used by research groups
around the world.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:37.610
The Bawendi group also
collaborates with people, both

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:39.330
at different schools
and at MIT.

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:43.590
One example, on some of their
biochemistry applications is

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:47.640
with another Professor at MIT,
Alice Ting and her lab.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:51.640
So really what I want to point
out here is as we get more

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.890
into describing quantum
mechanics, these quantum dots

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:57.640
are one really good example
where a lot of the properties

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.460
of quantum mechanics
apply directly.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:02.780
So, if you're interested, I put
the Bawendi lab research

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:04.960
website onto your notes.

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:08.050
And also, Professor Bawendi
recently did an interview with

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:11.890
"The Tech." Did anyone see that
interview in the paper?

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:16.510
So, three or four -- a few of
you read the paper last week.

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:18.960
So, you can either pick up an
old issue or I put the link on

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:19.820
the website, too.

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:23.710
And that's not just about his
research, it's also about some

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:26.560
of his memories as a student
and advice to all of you.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.320
So, it's interesting to read and
get to know some of these

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:32.440
Professors at MIT a
little bit better.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.830
So, one property that was
important we talked about with

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:38.920
waves is the relationship
between frequency and

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:39.680
wavelength.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:42.540
Another very important property
of waves that's true

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.660
of all waves, is that you can
have superposition or

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:48.530
interference between
two waves.

00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:52.490
So, if we're looking at waves
and they're in-phase, and when

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:55.730
I talk about in-phase, what I
mean is that they're lined up,

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:58.560
so that the maxima are in the
same position and the minima

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.650
are in the same position, what
we can have a something called

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:03.840
constructive interference.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.310
And all we mean by constructive
interference is

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:09.040
that literally those two waves
add together, such as the

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:12.240
maxima are now twice as high,
and the minima are

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.560
now twice as low.

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:17.540
So, you can also imagine a
situation where instead of

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:21.910
being perfectly lined up, now we
have the minima being lined

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:23.470
up with the maxima here.

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:27.980
So, if we switch over to a
clicker question maybe on this

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:41.090
screen -- okay, can it be
done up there to switch?

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:44.430
So, we're still settling
in with the renovations

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:46.070
here in this room.

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:48.940
So, why don't you all go ahead
and tell me what happens if

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:56.060
you combine these two waves,
which are now out of phase?

00:31:56.060 --> 00:32:07.610
So, let's -- okay, so, why
don't you all think about

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:10.880
would happen -- we'll start
with the thought exercise.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.602
You can switch back to my
lecture notes then if this

00:32:12.602 --> 00:32:18.130
isn't going.

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:18.480
Alright.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.770
So, hopefully what everyone came
up with is the straight

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:23.300
line, is that what
you answered?

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:24.560
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:25.170
PROFESSOR: OK, very good.

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:28.510
And I didn't make you try
to draw the added, the

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:33.810
superimposed positive
construction in your notes,

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:35.120
but I think everyone can handle

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.470
drawing a straight line.

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:39.670
So, you can go ahead and draw
what happens when we have

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:42.270
destructive interference.

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:44.790
And destructive interference, of
course, is the extreme, but

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:47.370
you can picture also a case
where you have waves that are

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:50.010
not quite lined up, but they're
also not completely

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:50.930
out of phase.

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:53.260
So in that case, you're either
going to have the wave get a

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.360
little bigger, but not
twice as big or

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.700
a little bit smaller.

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.690
So, I think the easiest way to
think about interference is

00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:01.810
not actually with light, but
sometimes it's easiest to

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:04.180
think about with sound,
especially when you're dealing

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:07.350
with times where you have
destructive interference.

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:10.280
Has anyone here ever been in a
concert hall where they feel

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:13.620
like they're kind of in a dead
spot, or you don't quite hear

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:16.520
as well, and if you move down
just two seats all of a sudden

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.270
it's just blasting at you --
hopefully not in this room.

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:22.350
But have people experienced
that before?

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:24.830
Yeah, I definitely experienced
it, too.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:26.910
And really, all you're
experiencing there is

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:30.560
destructive interference
in a very bad way.

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.890
Halls, they try to design halls
such that that doesn't

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:38.050
happen, and I show an example of
a concert hall here -- this

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:41.430
is Symphony Hall in Boston,
and I can pretty much

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:43.470
guarantee you if you do go to
this Symphony Hall, you will

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:46.710
not experience a bad seat
or a dead seat.

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:50.720
This is described as actually
one of the top two or three

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.850
acoustic concert halls
in the whole world.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:57.450
So, it's very well designed such
that they've minimized

00:33:57.450 --> 00:34:01.230
any of these destructive
interference dead sounds.

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:03.500
So, it's nice, on a student
budget you can go and get the

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:05.710
worst seat in the house and you
can hear just as well as

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:08.780
they can hear up front, even
if you can't actually see

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.630
what's going on.

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:14.240
So, another example of
destructive interference is

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.240
just with the Bose headphones.

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.520
I've never actually tried these
on, but you see people

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:21.590
with them, and what happens here
is it's supposed to be

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:24.070
those noise cancellation
headphones.

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:26.680
All they do is they take in
the ambient noise that's

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.200
around it, and there's actually
battery in the

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.890
headphones, that then produces
waves that are going to

00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:34.150
destructively interfere with
that ambient noise.

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:37.700
And that's how it actually gets
to be so quiet when you

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:43.350
have on, supposedly, these quite
expensive headphones.

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:46.860
So, that's light as a wave, and
the reason -- well, that

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:49.820
was sound as a wave, but light
as a wave is the same idea.

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:53.650
And it was really established
by the early 1900s that, in

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:57.040
fact, light behaved as a wave.
And the reason that it was so

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.570
certain that light was a wave
was because we could observe

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:01.860
these things -- we could see,
for example, that light

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:04.630
defracted, and we could see that
light constructively or

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:08.880
destructively could interfere
with other light waves, and

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:12.300
this was all confirmed
and visualized.

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:17.080
But also, around the time that
Thomson was discovering the

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.710
electron, there were some other
observations that were

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:23.740
going on, and the most
disturbing to kind of the

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:26.500
understanding of the universe
was the fact that there were

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.590
some observations about light
that didn't make sense with

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:32.600
this idea that light
is a particle.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.720
And the photoelectric effect
is maybe the most clear

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.320
example of this.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:41.180
So, the photoelectric effect is
the effect that if you have

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:43.550
some metal, and you can pick
essentially any metal you

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:47.380
want, and you shine light of a
certain frequency onto that

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:52.110
metal, you can actually pop off
an electron, and you can

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:54.110
go ahead and measure what the
kinetic energy of that

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:57.110
electron that comes off is,
because we can measure the

00:35:57.110 --> 00:36:00.530
velocity and we know that
kinetic energy equals 1/2 m b

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:02.720
squared, and thanks to
Thomson we also know

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:05.150
the mass of an electron.

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:09.140
So, this is an interesting
observation, and in itself not

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:13.790
too disturbing, yet but the
important thing to point out

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:18.170
is that there's this threshold
frequency that is of the

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:20.360
metal, and each metal has a
different threshold frequency,

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.680
such as if you shine light on
the metal where the frequency

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:27.680
of the light is less than the
threshold frequency, nothing

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:31.900
will happen -- no electron will
pop off of that metal.

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.450
However, if you shine a light
with a frequency that's

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:37.470
greater than the threshold
frequency, you will be able to

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:39.320
pop off an electron.

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:42.080
So, people were making this
observation, but this wasn't

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:44.570
making any sense at all because
there was nothing in

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:46.890
classical physics that
described any sort of

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:51.510
relationship between the
frequency of light and the

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:55.310
energy, much less the energy of
an electron that would get

00:36:55.310 --> 00:37:01.030
popped off of a metal that would
basically come off only

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:03.820
when we're hitting this
threshold frequency.

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:07.050
So, what they could do was
actually graph what was

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:10.050
happening here, so we can also
graph what was happening, and

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:13.590
what they found was that if we
were at any point below the

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:16.460
threshold frequency and we were
counting the numbers of

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:20.000
electrons that were popping off
of our metal, we weren't

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.810
seeing anything at all.

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:25.650
But if you go up the threshold
frequency, suddenly you see

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:28.420
that there's some number of
electrons that comes off, and

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:31.110
amazingly, the number of
electrons actually had no

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:35.240
relationship at all to the
frequency of the light.

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:38.040
And this didn't make a lot of
sense to people at the time

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:42.710
because they thought that the
frequency should be related to

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:44.880
the number of electrons that
are coming off, because you

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:48.340
have more frequency coming in,
you'd expect more electrons

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:49.510
that are coming off
-- this wasn't

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:50.860
what people were seeing.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:53.270
So, what they decided to do
is just study absolutely

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:56.100
everything they could about the
photoelectric effect and

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.300
hope, at some point, someone
would piece something together

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.660
that could explain what's going
on or shed some light on

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:02.440
this effect.

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:04.620
So, one thing they did, because
it was so easy to

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:08.630
measure kinetic energy of
electrons, is plot the

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:11.600
frequency of the light against
the kinetic energy of the

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.860
electron that's coming
off here.

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:16.040
And in your notes and on these
slides here, just for your

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.090
reference, I'm just pointing
out what's going to be

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:19.930
predicted from classical
physics.

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:22.060
You're not responsible for
that and we won't really

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:24.290
discuss it, but it just gives
you the contrast of the

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:26.700
surprise that comes up when
people make these

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:27.840
observations.

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.800
And the first observation was
that the frequency of the

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:34.190
light had a linear relationship
to the kinetic

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:38.620
energy of the electrons
that are ejected here.

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:42.040
This made no sense at all to
people, and again they saw

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.620
this effect where if you were
below that threshold

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:48.900
frequency, you saw
nothing at all.

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:51.800
So, that was frequency
with kinetic energy.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:54.350
The next thing that they wanted
to look at was the

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:57.870
actual intensity of the light
and see what the relationship

00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:00.610
of intensity to kinetic
energy is.

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:03.640
So, what we would expect is that
there is a relationship

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:06.380
between intensity in kinetic
energy, because it was

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:08.790
understood that however intense
the light was, if you

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:10.810
had a more intense light,
it was a higher

00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:12.270
energy light beam.

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:14.940
So that should mean that the
energy that's transferred to

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:18.000
the electron should be greater,
but that's not what

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.830
you saw at all, and what you
saw is that if you kept the

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:25.390
frequency constant, there was
absolutely no change in the

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:28.490
kinetic energy of the electrons,
no matter how high

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:30.980
up you had the intensity
of the light go.

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:33.650
You could keep increasing the
intensity and nothing was

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:36.790
going to happen.

00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:40.040
So, we could also plot the
number of electrons that are

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:43.930
ejected as a relationship to the
intensity, so that was yet

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:46.330
another experiment
they could do.

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:48.790
And this is what they had
expected that there would be

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:53.380
no relationship, but instead
here they saw that there was a

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:56.820
linear relationship not to the
intensity and the kinetic

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.340
energy of the electrons, but
to the intensity and the

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:00.610
number of electrons.

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:03.920
So, none of these observations
made sense to any scientists

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:06.780
at the time, and really all of
these observations were made

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:10.040
and somewhat put aside for
several years before someone

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.970
that could kind of process
everything that was going on

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:17.620
at once came along, and that
person was Einstein,

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.930
conveniently enough -- if anyone
could put it together,

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:22.730
we would hope that he
could, and he did.

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:26.340
And what he did in a way that
made sense when all of us look

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:30.190
at it, is he plotted all of
these different metals on the

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:32.310
same graph and made
some observations.

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:35.760
So, for example, here we're
showing rubidium and potassium

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:40.190
and sodium plotted where we're
plotting the frequency --

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:43.920
that's the frequency of that
light that's coming into the

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:47.820
metal versus the kinetic energy
of the electron that's

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:50.980
ejected from the surface
of the metal.

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:53.980
And what he found here, which is
what you can see and we can

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:57.390
all see pretty clearly, is the
slope of all of these lines is

00:40:57.390 --> 00:41:01.040
the same regardless of what
the type of metal is.

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:05.270
So, he fit all these to the
equation of the line, and what

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:08.000
he noticed was the slope was
specifically this number,

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.530
6.626 times 10 to the negative
34, joules times seconds.

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:18.290
And he also found that the y
intercept for each one of

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:23.990
these metals was equal to
basically this number here,

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:31.820
which was the slope times the
minimum frequency required of

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:37.160
each specific metal, so that's
of the threshold frequency.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:40.960
And he actually knew that this
number had popped up before,

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:44.070
and a lot of you are familiar
with this number also, and

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:45.620
this is Planck's constant.

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:48.440
Planck had observed this number
as a fitting constant

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:51.060
years earlier when he looked at
some phenomena, and you can

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:53.810
read about in your book, such
as black body radiation.

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:57.680
And what he found was he needed
this constant to fit

00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.210
his data to what was observed.

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:02.700
And this is the same thing that
Einstein was observing,

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:07.170
that he needed this fitting
constant, that this constant

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:09.360
was just falling right out of,
for example, this slope and

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.110
also the y intercept.

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:15.720
So he decided to go ahead and
define exactly what it is,

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:19.760
this line, in terms of these new
constants, this constant

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:22.560
he's calling h, which is
Planck's constant.

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:25.650
So, on the y axis we have
kinetic energy, so we

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:27.460
can plug that in.

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:29.980
If we talk about what the x
axis is, that's just the

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:32.200
frequency of the light
that's coming in.

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:36.420
We know what m is,
m is equal to h.

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:41.900
And then we can plug in what b
is, the y intercept, because

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:45.140
that's just the negative
of h times

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.090
that threshold frequency.

00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:50.520
So we have this new equation
here when we're considering

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:53.250
this photoelectric effect,
which is that the kinetic

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:59.180
energy is equal to h nu minus
h nu threshold of the metal.

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:03.210
And what Einstein concluded
and observed is that well,

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:07.160
kinetic energy, of course,
that's an energy term, and h

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:10.170
times nu, well that has to be
energy also, because energy

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:13.280
has to be equal to energy --
there's no other way about it.

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:15.740
And this worked out with units
as well because we're talking

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.510
about joules for kinetic energy,
and when we're talking

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:20.880
about h times nu, we're talking
about joules times

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:23.490
second times inverse seconds.

00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:26.320
So, the very important
conclusion that Einstein made

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:32.000
here is that energy is equal to
h times nu, or that h times

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.280
nu is an actual energy term.

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:39.690
And this kind of went along
with two observations.

00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:41.940
The first is that energy
of a photon is

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:43.850
proportional to its frequency.

00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:47.300
So this was never recognized
before that if we know the

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:52.450
frequency of a photon or a wave
of light, we can know the

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:54.230
energy of that light.

00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:57.060
So, since we know that there's
relationship also between

00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:59.560
frequency and wavelength, we can
do the same thing -- if we

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:02.650
know the wavelength, we can know
the energy of the light.

00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:05.480
And I use the term photon here,
and that's because he

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:08.500
also concluded that light must
be made up of these energy

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:11.250
packets, and each packet has
that h, that Planck's

00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:15.210
constant's worth of energy in
it, so that's why you have to

00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:17.940
multiply Planck's constant
times the frequency.

00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:21.620
Any frequency can't have an
energy, you have to -- you

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:24.900
don't have a continuum of
frequencies that are of a

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:28.900
certain energy, it's actually
punctuated into these packets

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:30.430
that are called photons.

00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:33.330
And, as you know, Einstein made
many, many, many very

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:36.870
important contributions to
science and relativity, but he

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:41.660
called this his one single most
important contribution to

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:45.740
science, the relationship
between energy and frequency

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:48.660
and the idea of photons.

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:52.030
So this means we now have a new
way of thinking about the

00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:57.400
photoelectric effect, and that
is the idea that h times nu is

00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:59.130
actually an energy.

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:02.060
So, it's the energy of an
incident photon if we're

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:04.760
talking about nu where we're
talking about the energy of

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:08.890
the photon going in, so we can
abbreviate that as e sub i,

00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:11.050
energy of the incident photon.

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:16.170
We can talk about also h times
nu nought, which is that

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:17.840
threshold frequency.

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.380
So this is a term we're going
to see a lot, especially in

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:23.620
your problem sets, it's called
the work function, and the

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:27.410
work function is the same
thing as the threshold

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:29.320
frequency of a metal, except,
of course, that it's

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.280
multiplied by Planck's
constant.

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:34.910
So, it's the minimum energy that
a certain metal requires

00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:36.700
in order to pop a photon out of
it -- in order to eject an

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:38.100
electron from the surface
of that metal.

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:46.160
So this is our new kind of
schematic way that we can

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:50.240
think about looking at the
photoelectric effect, so if

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:53.580
this is the total amount of
energy that we put into the

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:57.430
system, where here we have the
energy of a free electron.

00:45:57.430 --> 00:46:01.660
We have this much energy going
in, the metal itself requires

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:04.540
this much energy, the
work function, in

00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:06.280
order to eject an electron.

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.720
So that much energy is
going to be used up

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:09.620
just ejecting it.

00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:12.840
And what we have left over is
this amount of energy here,

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.320
which is going to be
the kinetic energy

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:17.600
of the ejected electron.

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:20.650
So, therefore, we can rewrite
our equation in two ways.

00:46:20.650 --> 00:46:24.410
One is just talking about it in
terms only of energy where

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:27.580
our kinetic energy here is going
to be equal to the total

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:32.220
energy going in -- the energy
initial minus this energy of

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:34.210
the work function here.

00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:38.880
We can also talk about it in
terms of if we want to solve,

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.120
if we, for example, we want to
find out what that initial

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:44.370
energy was, we can just
rearrange our equation, or we

00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:48.110
can look at this here where the
initial energy is equal to

00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:50.800
kinetic energy plus
the work function.

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:54.640
So before we go we'll try to
see if we can do a clicker

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:58.610
question for you on this,
and we can, very good.

00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:01.610
So, everyone take those clickers
back out and tell me,

00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:03.770
if a beam of light with a
certain energy, and we're

00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:07.900
going to say four electron volts
strikes a gold surface,

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:11.015
and here we're saying that the
gold surface has a work

00:47:11.015 --> 00:47:15.990
function of 5.1 electron volts,
what is the maximum

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:31.490
kinetic energy of the electron
that is ejected?

00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:37.370
So why don't you go ahead and
take ten seconds on that.

00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:40.500
And if you don't know, that's
okay, just type in an answer

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:44.370
and give it your best shot.

00:47:44.370 --> 00:47:47.220
And let's see what we
come up with here.

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:47.600
Alright.

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:52.270
So, it looks like some of you
were tricked, but many of you

00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:55.060
were not, so no electrons
will be ejected.

00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:59.110
The reason for that is because
this is the minimum amount of

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:01.790
energy -- hold off a sec on
the packing up, so in case

00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:03.920
someone doesn't understand --
this is the minimum amount of

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:07.550
energy that's required from the
energy going in in order

00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:08.900
to eject an electron.

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:12.490
So if the incident energy is
less than the energy that's

00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:14.370
required, absolutely nothing
will happen.

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:15.870
That's the same thing we
were talking about

00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:17.260
with threshold frequency.

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:18.580
All right, now you
can pack up and

00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:20.430
we'll see you on Wednesday.
