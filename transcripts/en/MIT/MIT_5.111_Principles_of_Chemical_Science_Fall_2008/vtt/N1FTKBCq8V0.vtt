00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:23.020
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.120
So, let's get started.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.920
Why doesn't everyone take 10
more seconds to answer this

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:42.310
clicker question here.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.910
All right.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:43.570
So, good.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.620
It looks like just about
everyone is able to go from

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.000
the name of an orbital to
the state function.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.300
That's important.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.470
And we're actually going to get
a little bit deeper in our

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.660
clicker questions here, since
when you do your problem-set

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.530
it won't be quite this straight
forward that you'll

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.320
be answering this kind of
question, but actually you'll

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.120
be thinking about how many
different orbitals can have

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.700
certain state functions or
certain orbital names.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.660
So let's go to a second
clicker question

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.430
here and try one more.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.630
So why don't you tell me how
many possible orbitals you can

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.640
have in a single atom
that have the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.960
following two quantum numbers?

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.790
So let's say we have n equals
4, and n sub l equalling

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.300
negative 2.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.230
How many different orbitals can
you have that have those

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.760
two quantum numbers in them?

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.100
And this should look kind of
familiar to some of the

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.260
problems you may have seen on
the problem-set if you started

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.520
it this weekend.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.580
So this should be something you
can do pretty quickly, so

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:53.810
let's take 10 more
seconds on that.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.010
All right.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.970
OK, looks like we got the
majority, which is a good

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.980
start, but we having
discrepancy on

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.510
what people are thinking.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.060
So, let's go through this one.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.070
So, what we're saying is that
we have n equals to 4, and m

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.960
sub I being equal
to negative 2.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.000
If we have n equals 4, what
is the highest value of

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.780
l that we can have?

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.350
STUDENT: 3.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.620
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.260
We can have n 4, l 3, and then,
sure, we can have m sub

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.430
l equal negative 2 if l equals 3
What's the second value of l

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.260
that we can have?

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.670
2.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.140
OK.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.920
So we can have this
orbital here.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.930
What about l equals 1,
can we have this?

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:37.870
No, we can't.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.110
Because if l equals 1, we can
not have m sub l equal

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.160
negative 2, right, because the
magnetic quantum number only

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.010
goes from negative l
to positive l here.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.000
So that means it's not possible,
if we've made these

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.870
stipulations in the first
place, to have a case

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.450
where l equals 1.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.220
So this means we can only have
2 different values of l.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.270
We already know our
value of m.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.730
So now we're just counting up
our orbitals, an orbital is

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.650
completely described by
the 3 quantum numbers.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.670
So we end up having
2 orbitals here.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.410
All right, so hopefully if you
see any other combination of

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.340
quantum numbers, for example, if
it doesn't quickly come to

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.710
you how many orbitals you have,
you can actually try to

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.760
write out all the possible
orbitals and that should get

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.670
you started.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:29.130
All right.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.630
So today we're going to finish
up our discussion of the

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.120
hydrogen atom.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.450
We'd started on Monday talking
about radial probability

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.490
distributions for
the s orbitals.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.910
We'll finish that up, and then
we're going to move on to

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.650
talking about the p orbitals.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.610
We'll start with talking about
the shape, just like we did

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.440
with the s orbitals, and then
move on to those radial

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.600
probability distributions and
compare the radial probability

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.320
at different radius for p
orbital versus an s orbital.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.480
And once we do that, we're
actually going to move on to

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.660
multi-electron atoms.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.400
So, you might have noticed that
we will have spent about

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.750
6 and 1/2 lectures just getting
to the point where we

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.590
have only one electron, so we're
only up hydrogen so far.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.820
And you might have kind of
been projecting ahead and

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.830
thinking if we keep up at this
pace, pretty much we would

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.080
only get to carbon by the
end of the semester.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.600
So I will assure you that we
will not be spending 6

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.690
lectures per atom as we move
forward, and in fact, what

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.840
we're going to find is that by
taking all the principles

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.600
we've learned about the hydrogen
atom and applying

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.820
that to multi-electron atoms,
but making a few of changes

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.420
and making a few modifications
to take into the fact that

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.410
we're going to have
electron-electron repulsions

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.140
going on, we'll be able to think
about any multi-electron

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.280
atom using these same general
ideas, and the Schrodinger

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.910
equation ideas that we came up
with and have looked at for

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:53.440
the hydrogen atom.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.600
And this is really good news
because it's good to get

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.350
passed carbon.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.010
I'm an organic chemist, so I
love carbon, it's one of my

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.390
favorite atoms to talk about,
but it would be nice to get to

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.400
the point of bonding and even
reactions to talk about all

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.570
the exciting things we
can think about once

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:08.280
we're at that point.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.050
So, one we finish our discussion
of how we think

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.210
about multi-electron atoms, we
can go right on and start

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.780
talking about these
other things.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.400
All right.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.400
So, let's pick up where we left
off, first of all we're

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.470
still on the hydrogen
atom from Monday.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.260
And on Monday what we were
discussing was the solution to

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.880
the Schrodinger equation
for the wave function.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.930
And we also, when we solved or
we looked at the solution to

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.290
that Schrodinger equation,
what we saw was that we

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.270
actually needed three different
quantum numbers to

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.990
fully describe the wave function
of a hydrogen atom or

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.550
to fully describe an orbital.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.480
We didn't just need that n, not
just the principle quantum

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.460
number that we needed to discuss
the energy, but we

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.750
also need to talk about l and
m, as we did in our clicker

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.470
question up here.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.200
We also talked about well, what
is that when we say wave

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.040
function, what does that
actually mean?

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.070
And first we discussed the fact
that well, in terms of a

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.470
classical analogy, we don't
really have one for wave

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.880
function, we can't really think
of a way to picture wave

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.240
function thinking in classical
terms. But we do have an

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.610
interpretation for wave
function squared.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.280
And when we take the wave
function and square it, that's

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.940
going to be equal to the
probability density of finding

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.000
an electron at some point
in your atom.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And that's useful in terms of
seeing a general shape, but if

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.060
we're actually interested in
thinking about how far away

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.900
that electron is from the
nucleus, you can see that

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.480
instead of talking about
probability density, which is

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.590
the probability per volume,
instead it would be much more

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.400
useful to talk about something
called radial probability

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.460
distribution, or in other
words talking about the

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.030
probability of finding the
electron at some distance,

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.600
which we define as r, from the
nucleus in a spherical shell

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.670
that is just infinitesimally
small, infinitesimally thin at

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.760
distance or at a thickness that
we'll call a d r here.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.340
So, basically what we're saying
is if we take any shell

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.770
that's at some distance away
from the nucleus, we can think

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.920
about what the probability is of
finding an electron at that

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.270
radius, and that's the
definition we gave to the

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.290
radial probability
distribution.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:25.370
And we can look at the formula
that got us here.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.210
This is the radial probability
distribution formula for an s

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.150
orbital, which is, of course,
dealing with something that's

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.650
spherically symmetrical.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.975
It's somewhat different when
we're talking about the p or

00:07:35.975 --> 00:07:38.170
the d orbitals, and we won't
go into the equation there,

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.340
but this will give you an idea
of what we're really talking

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.070
about with this radial
probability distribution.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.970
So, what we can do to actually
get a probability instead of a

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.220
probability density that we're
talking about is to take the

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.520
wave function squared, which
we know is probability

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:57.380
density, and multiply it by the
volume of that very, very

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.840
thin spherical shell that
we're talking about at

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.050
distance r.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.480
So if we want to talk about the
volume of that, we just

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.850
talk about the surface area,
which is 4 pi r squared, and

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.540
we multiply that by
the thickness d r.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:14.020
So if we take this term, which
is a volume term, and multiply

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.310
it by probability over volume,
what we're going to end up

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:21.060
with is an actual probability
of finding our electron at

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.800
that distance, r, from
the nucleus.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.890
So, the example that we took
on Monday and that we ended

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:31.760
with when we ended class, was
looking at the 1 s orbital for

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.020
hydrogen atom, and what we could
do is we could graph the

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:39.170
radial probability as a function
of radius here.

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:42.890
And when we do that we can see
this curve, this probability

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.940
curve, where we have a maximum
probability of finding the

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.000
electron this far away
from the nucleus.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.120
And we call that most probable
radius r sub m p, or most

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.420
probable radius.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.920
And what is discussed is that
for a 1 s hydrogen atom, that

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.740
falls at an a nought distance
away from the nucleus.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.820
And remember, a nought, that's
just the Bohr radius, it's a

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.650
constant -- that's all we
need to worry about.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.300
We talked about the Bohr
model and how that

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.600
told us an exact distance.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.740
It was a classical model, right,
so we could say the

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.290
electron is exactly this far
away from the nucleus.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.380
We can not do that with quantum
mechanics, the more

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.590
true picture is the best we can
get to is talk about what

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:26.270
the probability is of
finding the electron

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:27.420
at any given nucleus.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.620
And the most probable one
here is that a nought.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.130
The other thing that we looked
at, which I want to stress

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:36.780
again and I'll stress it as
many times as I can fit it

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.960
into lecture, because this is
something that confuses

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.170
students when they're trying
to identify, for example,

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.910
different nodes or areas
of no probability.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:49.380
In an orbital is remember that
this area right here at r

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.710
equals zerio, that
is not a node.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.750
We will always have r equals
zero in these radial

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:57.950
probability distribution graphs,
and we can think about

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:58.570
why that is.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.730
At first it might be
counter-intuitive because we

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.850
know the probability density
at the nucleus is the

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.010
greatest. So the probability of
having an electron at the

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:09.490
nucleus in terms of probability
per volume is

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:10.820
very, very high.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.480
But remember that we need to
multiply it by the volume

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.350
here, the volume of some
sphere we've defined.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.220
And when we define that as
r being equal to zero,

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.560
essentially we're
multiplying the

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.700
probability density by zero.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:26.260
So that's why we have this zero
point here, and just to

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.270
point out again and again and
again, it's not a radial node,

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:32.280
it's just a point where we're
starting our graph, because

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.980
we're multiplying it
by r equals zero.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.740
So, we can look at other
radial probability

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.890
distributions of other
wave functions

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:42.750
that we talked about.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.820
We talked about the wave
function for a 2 s orbital,

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.470
and also for a 3 s orbital.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:55.270
So, let's go ahead and think
about drawing what that would

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:57.610
look like in terms of the
radial probability

00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:59.390
distribution.

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:03.650
So what we're graphing here is
the radius as a function of

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:05.940
radial probability.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:11.280
And for a 2 s orbital, you get
a graph that's going to look

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.090
something like this.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.200
So, again, we're starting
at zero.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.040
We have one node here, and we
can again define that most

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.160
probable radius.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.050
And it turns out that for a 2
s orbital, that's equal to 6

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:29.350
times a nought.

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.600
So when we think about what
it is that this radial

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.900
probability distribution is
telling us, it's telling us

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:39.400
that it is most likely that an
electron in a 2 s orbital of

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.960
hydrogen is six times further
away from the nucleus than it

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.710
is in a 1 s orbital.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:50.110
So another way to say that is,
in a sense, if we're thinking

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:52.620
about the excited state of a
hydrogen atom, the first

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:57.510
excited state, or the n equals
2 state, what we're saying is

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:01.430
that it's actually bigger than
the ground state, or the 1 s

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.350
state of a hydrogen atom.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.770
And when we say bigger,
remember this is not a

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.240
classical description
we're talking about.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.130
We are talking about
probability, but what we're

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:13.710
saying is that most probable
radius is further away from

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:16.280
the nucleus.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:20.020
So we can also look at this in
terms of the 3 s orbital.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:26.940
And in this case, we have
a graph that looks

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.060
something like this.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:32.010
So you can draw that
into your notes.

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:36.420
And again, we can define what
that most probable radius is,

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.910
that distance at which
we're most

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:40.840
likely to find an electron.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.280
And in the case of the 3 s
orbital, that's going to be

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.940
equal to 11 .

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:48.540
5 times a nought.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.800
So again, what we're saying here
is that it is most likely

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.580
in the 3 s orbital that we would
find the electron 11 and

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:59.330
1/2 times further away from the
nucleus than we would in a

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.110
around state hydrogen atom.

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:05.470
And I just want to point out
here in terms of things that

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:08.950
you're responsible for, you
should know that the most

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:11.530
probable radius for
a 1 s hydrogen

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:13.720
atom is equal a nought.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:18.040
And you should know that a 2 s
is larger than that, and a 3 s

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.200
is even larger, and of course,
hopefully as we go to 4 and 5,

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.380
you would be able to guess that
those are going to get

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:24.250
even larger.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.410
But you're not responsible
for knowing specifically

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:27.460
that it's 11 .

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.510
5 times greater.

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:33.270
You just need to know
the trend there.

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:36.990
Another thing to point out in
these two graphs is that we do

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.540
have nodes, and we figured out
last time, we calculated how

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.700
many nodes we should have
in a 2 s orbital.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.410
And in terms of radial nodes,
we expect to see one node.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:49.330
And how many nodes do you see in
the 3 s orbital? two, good.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:53.690
I'm glad to hear that no
one counted this r

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:54.930
equal zero as a node.

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:58.980
So we expect to see two nodes
right here in the 3 s orbital.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:02.250
And we can calculate that with
the formula that we used,

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:09.920
which was just n minus l minus
1 equals the number of nodes.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.100
Or we could just look at
the radial probability

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.910
distribution itself and see
how many nodes there are.

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:19.430
So if we're looking at these two
situations here and we're

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.560
actually thinking of them from
a more classical standpoint,

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.220
which is natural for us to do
because we live our lives in

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.740
the every day world, not
thinking about things on the

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.320
atomic size scale all the
time, most of us.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:35.070
So, for example, if we were to
look at this 3 s orbital here,

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:38.710
you might have the question of
how this can be, because we're

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:42.490
saying that, for example, we
have probability of having an

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.450
electron here, an electron
can also be way out

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:46.950
at this radius here.

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:49.260
But what we're saying is there's
a node here, so that

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.440
there's no probability of
finding an electron between

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.820
those two points.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.440
So you can think of it, if we
were to just think of it as a

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.230
straight line that we were going
across, essentially what

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:04.030
we're saying is that we're
getting from point a to point

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:07.260
c without ever getting
through point b.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.540
So, that can be a little bit
confusing for us to think

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.830
about, and when it's a very good
question you might, in

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:17.610
fact, say well, maybe there's
not zero probability here,

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:20.600
maybe it's just this teeny,
teeny, tiny number, and in

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.580
fact, sometimes an electron
can get through, it's just

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:27.020
very low probability so that's
why we never really see it.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.680
And in fact, that's
not the answer.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.670
The answer is, in fact, there
is zero, absolutely zero

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.880
probability of finding
a electron here.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:37.100
So basically we're saying yes,
we can go from point a to

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.990
point c without ever going
through point b.

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.180
That might seem confusing
if you're thinking about

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:45.430
particles, but remember we're
talking about the wave-like

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:47.000
nature of electrons.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.310
So, the quantum mechanical
interpretation is that we can,

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:55.820
in fact, have probability
density here and probability

00:15:55.820 --> 00:16:00.730
density there, without having
any probability of having the

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.700
electron in the space between.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.230
And you can think about that if
you think about a standing

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:08.080
wave, for example, where you
can have amplitude at many

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.370
different values of x, so an
amplitude at many different

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:14.000
distances, but you also
have areas where

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.680
there is a 0 amplitude.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.880
So, remember this makes sense
if you just think of it as a

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.490
wave and forget the particle
part of it for right now,

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:25.780
because that would be very
upsetting to think about and

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.760
that's not, in fact, what's
going on, we're talking about

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:28.940
quantum mechanics here.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:29.130
Yes.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:36.300
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.230
PROFESSOR: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:40.030
So it's n minus l minus 1.

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:46.000
So here we have 3 minus l equals
0, because it's an s

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:57.160
orbital, minus 1, so we have
two radial nodes here.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:57.560
OK.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:02.990
So let's actually go to a
clicker question now on radial

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:04.960
probability distributions.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.860
So I mentioned you should be
able to identify both how many

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:11.550
nodes you have and what a
graph might look like of

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.940
different radial probability
distributions.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:17.380
So here, what I'd like you to
do is identify the correct

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:21.100
radial probability distribution
plot for a 5 s

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.890
orbital, and also make sure that
it matches up with the

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:33.600
right number of radial nodes
that you would expect.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:33.860
All right.

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.820
Let's take 10 more seconds on
that, this should be a quick

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:47.680
identification for us to do.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.070
All right.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:51.910
So it looks like 82% got the
correct answer here.

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:55.790
So, you should know that there's
four radial nodes,

00:17:55.790 --> 00:18:00.430
right, we have 5 minus 1 minus
l -- is there a question?

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:03.360
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.420
PROFESSOR: It is very difficult
for me to draw

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:07.750
graphs on the computer.

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:09.340
That's a good point,
I'm sorry.

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:12.110
This was my best attempt at
hitting zero and not having

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:13.580
the graph go down there.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.940
I'm not the most gifted at
drawing on the computer.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:20.590
So yes, it should be zero
at zero, but I made

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:22.330
the line too thick.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:24.680
So, assuming -- if anyone got
it wrong because of that,

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.240
that's my apologies,
that's my fault.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.410
But you should see that there
are four radial nodes here

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:33.290
since we have a 5 s orbital.

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:38.160
And also that we know that the
zero does not count as a node,

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.170
if per se I actually had managed
to hit zero in drawing

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:46.030
that, so the correct answer
would be the bottom one there.

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:49.470
So, you should be able to
generally identify and draw

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:51.670
the general form of these
radial probability

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:52.730
distributions.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:56.010
Obviously we don't expect you
to know exactly what the

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:58.560
distances are, but you should
be able to compare them

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.010
relatively.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:00.350
Yes?

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:06.660
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:10.260
PROFESSOR: No, they actually
don't, and when you

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:10.940
graph it all out.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:12.220
You can see this if you
look at some examples

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:13.410
in your book, actually.

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:16.390
So this doesn't fall, for
example, at 6 a nought, but

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.010
that's a really good question.

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:21.480
And the trend always is that the
probability gets smaller

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:26.490
with each of the peaks as
you're drawing them.

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:26.760
All right.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.380
So we can switch back
to our notes.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:33.590
So we got our clicker
question set there.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.390
And so now we can move on to
thinking about p orbitals, we

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:38.380
now have two ways to talk
about p orbitals.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.520
We can talk about the wave
function squared, the

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.850
probability density, or we
can talk about the radial

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:46.990
probability distribution.

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:50.070
So when we talk about p
orbitals, it's similar to

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:53.720
talking about s orbitals, and
the difference lies, and now

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:57.470
we have a different value for
l, so l equals 1 for a p

00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:00.490
orbital, and we know if we have
l equal 1, we can have

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:05.240
three different total orbitals
that have sub-shell of l

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.650
equalling 1.

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:11.300
So we can have, if we have the
final quantum number m equal

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.710
plus 1 or minus 1, we're
dealing with a

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:16.420
p x or a p y orbital.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.650
Remember, we don't do a
one-to-one correlation,

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:22.930
because p x and p y are some
linear combination of the m

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.550
plus 1 and m minus 1 orbital.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:28.040
And if we talk about
m equals 0, we're

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.650
looking at the p z orbital.

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:36.810
And the significant difference
between s orbitals and p

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:40.190
orbitals that comes from the
fact that we do have angular

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:43.350
momentum here in these p
orbitals, is that p orbital

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:47.130
wave functions do, in fact, have
theta and phi dependence.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.320
So they do have an angular
dependence that

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.280
we're talking about.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.430
And what I'm showing here is not
on your notes, if you're

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:56.420
interested you can look
it up in your book.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.870
This is a table that's directly
from your book, and

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:01.580
what it's just showing is the
wave function for a bunch of

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:02.030
different orbitals.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:04.480
I mentioned last time
that there was this

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.840
list in your book.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:09.170
And what I want to point out
here is this angular

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:13.020
dependence for the p orbitals
for the l equals 1 orbital.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:17.880
So, first, if I point out when
l equals 0, when we have an s

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.410
orbital, what you see is that
angular part of the wave

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:23.600
function is equal
to a constant.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.250
So, remember we can break up the
total wave function into

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:30.470
the radial part and
the angular part.

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:31.860
When we look at this angular
part, we see that it's always

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.280
the square root of 1 over 4 pi,
it doesn't matter what the

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.550
angle is, it's not dependent
on the angle.

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:43.410
In contrast when we're looking
at a p orbital, so any time l

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:46.960
is equal to 1, and you look at
angular part of the wave

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.750
function here, what you see is
the wave function either

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:52.450
depends on theta or
is dependent on

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:54.370
both theta and phi.

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:57.210
So we do, in fact, have a
dependence on what the angle

00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:01.890
is of the electron as we define
it in the orbital.

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:06.480
So what this means is that
unlike s orbitals, p orbitals

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.690
are not spherically symmetrical
-- they don't have

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:13.770
the exact same shape at any
radius from the nucleus.

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:18.330
And these shapes of p orbitals
probably do look familiar to

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:20.680
you, most of you, I'm sure, have
seen some sort of picture

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.670
of p orbitals before.

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:25.270
So what I want to point out
about them is that they're

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:28.790
made up of two nodes, and what
you can see is that nodes are

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:30.650
shown in different colors
here and those

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:32.220
are different phases.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:35.750
Sometimes you see this written
when you see p orbitals, one

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:38.210
is written as plus, one
is written in minus.

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:40.430
That's not a positive and
negative charge, that's

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:43.760
actually a phase, and that
arises from the wave equation.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.190
Remember when we have waves
we can have positive or a

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.910
negative amplitude.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:50.690
When we talk about p orbitals
the phase of the orbital

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:54.170
becomes important once we talk
about bonding, which hopefully

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:55.920
you were happy to hear at
the beginning of class

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.200
we will get to soon.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.410
And it turns out that when you
constructively have two p

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:03.700
orbitals interfere, and when I
say constructively, I mean

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:06.140
they're both either positive or
they're both the negative

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.250
lobes, that's when
you got bonding.

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:12.170
Whereas if the phases where
mismatched, you

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:13.760
would not get bonding.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.380
So, that's going to be important
later when we get to

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.980
bonding, but just take note of
it now, we have two nodes,

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:24.490
each with a separate phase --
or we have two lobes, excuse

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:26.020
me, each with a separate
phase.

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.760
And when we look at this, it's
actually split by what's

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.980
called a nodal plane, which is
pointed out in light orange

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:34.910
here on this picture, but what
we just mean is that there is

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:37.970
this whole plane that separates
the two lobes where

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:41.250
there is absolutely no
electron density.

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.790
So, the wave function at all of
these points in this plane

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:45.980
is equal to zero, so therefore,
also the wave

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.930
function squared is going
to be equal to zero.

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:56.020
So, if we say that in this
entire plane we have zero

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:58.810
probability of finding a p
electron anywhere in the

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:02.420
plane, the plane goes directly
through the nucleus in every

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.660
case but a p orbital, so what we
can also say is that there

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:13.850
is zero probability of finding
a p electron at the nucleus.

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:17.320
So, again we can use these
probability density plots,

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:23.160
which are just a plot of psi
squared, where the density of

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.630
the dots is proportional to the
density, the probability

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.730
density, at that point.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:31.850
So what we can say is look at
each of these separately, so

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:36.430
if we start with looking at the
2 p z orbital, the highest

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:40.000
probability of finding an
electron in the 2 p z orbital,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.180
is going to be along
this z-axis.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.770
We can see that right here.

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:48.630
And in terms of thinking about
the phase of this p orbital,

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:50.520
the phase is going
to be positive

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.250
anywhere where z is positive.

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:55.780
So we would say we have a
positive phase here and a

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:57.140
negative phase there.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.200
Remember, that's going to become
important when we talk

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.030
about bonding, we don't
need to worry about it

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.280
too much right now.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:07.420
We can also think about where
the nodal plane is in this p z

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:11.060
orbital, so how would we define
the nodal plane here?

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:16.580
What would the nodal plane be?

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:18.950
So, it's the x-y plane, you can
see there's no electron

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:20.940
density anywhere there.

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.760
And similarly, actually, if
we're looking at our polar

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.540
coordinates here, what we see is
it's any place where theta

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:31.080
is equal to 0 is what's going
to put up on the x-y plane.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.900
So another way to define the
nodal plane is where theta is

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.820
equal to 90 degrees.

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:40.450
So let's look now at
the 2 p x orbital.

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:43.140
This is the probability density
map, so we're talking

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.680
about the square here.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:48.320
The highest probability now is
going to be along the x-axis,

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:52.060
so that means we're going to
have a positive wave function

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:54.420
every place where
x is positive.

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.290
What is the nodal plane
in this case?

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:57.990
Um-hmm.

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:02.030
So, it's going to be the y z
nodal plane, or in other

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:04.460
words, we can say it's
any place where phi

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.360
is equal to 90 degrees.

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:09.190
So you can see if you take phi,
and you move it over 90

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:11.580
degrees, we're right here
in the y z plane.

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.820
Anywhere where that's the case
we're going to have no

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:17.530
probability density of
finding an electron.

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:20.910
And finally, we can look at
the 2 p y, so the highest

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:23.590
probability is going to
be along the y-axis.

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:26.360
It's going to be positive in
terms of its wave function or

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.590
in terms of its phase anywhere
where y is positive.

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:33.520
And the nodal plane's going to
be in the x z plane, or again,

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:37.430
anywhere where phi is going to
be equal to 0, that takes us

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:41.440
to the x z plane.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.550
So, let me get a little bit more
specific about what we

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:47.590
mean by nodal plane and where
the idea of nodal plane comes

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:51.000
from, and nodal planes arise
from any place you have

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.830
angular nodes.

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:55.430
So we talked about radial nodes
when we're doing these

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:58.350
radial probability density
diagrams here.

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.930
You can also have angular notes,
and when we talk about

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:04.460
an anglar node, what we're
talking about is values of

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:07.570
theta or values of phi at which
the wave function, and

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:10.270
therefore, the wave function
squared, or the probability

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:13.400
density are going to
be equal to zero.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.570
So, you remember from last time
radial nodes are values

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:21.040
of r at which the wave function
and wave function

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.680
squared are zero, so the
difference is now we're just

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.910
talking about the angular part
of the wave function.

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:29.440
And, in fact, these are the only
two types of nodes that

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:32.600
we're going to be describing,
so we can actually calculate

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.490
both the total number of notes
and the number of each type of

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:39.170
node we should expect to see
in any type of orbital.

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:41.980
And our equation for total nodes
is just the principle

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:43.810
quantum number minus 1.

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:46.690
And when we talk about angular
nodes, the number of angular

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:50.820
nodes we have in an orbital
is going to be equal to l.

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:54.490
So that's why we saw, for
example, in the p orbitals we

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:57.470
had one angular node in each
p orbital, because l

00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:58.880
is equal to 1 there.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.650
And we talked about the equation
you can use for

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:07.520
radial nodes last time, and
that's just n minus 1 minus l.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.460
You can go ahead and use that
equation, or you could figure

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:12.690
it out every time, because if
you know the total number of

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:15.450
nodes, and you know the angular
node number, then you

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:17.160
know how many nodes you're
going to have left.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.710
So you don't really have
to memorize that.

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:22.760
So, let's go ahead and just
do a few of these.

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.990
They're pretty straight forward
to do and it gives us

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:27.430
an idea what kind of nodal
structure we can

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:28.990
expect it an orbital.

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:34.050
So for a 2 s orbital, how many
total nodes will we have?

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:38.700
Yup, I heard one, so 2 minus
1, one total node.

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.190
Angular nodes, we're not going
to have any of those, we'll

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:45.820
have zero, l equals 0, so we
have zero angular nodes.

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:51.240
And in terms of radial nodes, we
have 2 minus 1 minus 0, so

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:54.130
what we have is one
radial node.

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:56.720
So, what you find with the s
orbital, and this is general

00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:00.610
for all s orbitals is that all
of your nodes end up being

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:01.370
radial nodes.

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:02.990
That has to be the
case because l

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:06.490
equals 0 for s orbitals.

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:08.990
Let's look now at a p orbital,
so how many total

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:13.720
nodes do we have here?

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:18.630
Yup, so one total node, 2 minus
1 is 1, and that means

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:23.160
since l is equal to 1, we have
one angular nodes, and that

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:26.710
leaves us with how many
radial nodes?

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:28.620
Yup, zero radial nodes.

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:32.440
So, for a 2 p orbital, all the
nodes actually turn out to be

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:35.070
angular nodes.

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:37.900
So, let's have you try one more,
if we can switch over

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:41.270
and talk about a 3 d orbital.

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:44.000
So, I'm asking very specifically
about radial

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.090
nodes here, how many radial
nodes does a hydrogen atom 3 d

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:48.200
orbital have?

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:56.470
So, you can go ahead and take
10 seconds on that.

00:29:56.470 --> 00:30:09.530
All right.

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:12.550
So most of you got that, though
there is this little

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:16.090
sub-set we have thinking that we
have one, so let's actually

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:17.950
write this out here.

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:24.450
So if we have a 3 d orbital,
we're talking about n minus l

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:28.180
minus 1, what is n equal to?

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:30.180
What is l equal to?

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:33.560
OK. and 1 is equal to 1.

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:37.010
So, it turns out that we have
zero nodes that we're dealing

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:39.070
with when we're talking
about a 3 d orbital.

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:43.860
OK.

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:46.400
So we should be able to figure
this out for any orbital that

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:50.490
we're discussing, and when we
can figure out especially

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:53.580
radial nodes, we have a good
head start on going ahead and

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:57.070
thinking about drawing radial
probability distributions.

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:59.700
We did it for the s orbitals,
we can also do it for the p,

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:00.850
we can do it for the d.

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:03.200
All we have to figure out is how
many nodes we're dealing

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.170
with and then we can get
the general shape

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:07.170
of the graph here.

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:10.620
So, let's actually compare
the radial probability

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:13.910
distribution of p orbitals to
what we've already looked at,

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:16.580
which are s orbitals, and we'll
find that we can get

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:20.410
some information out of
comparing these graphs.

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:23.860
So if we draw the 2 p orbital,
what we just figured out was

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:25.870
there should be zero
radial nodes, so

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:27.950
that's what we see here.

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:30.200
The other thing that I want you
to notice, is if you look

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.010
at the most probable radius,
for the 2 s orbital it's

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:37.560
actually out further away from
the nucleus than it is for the

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.320
2 p orbital.

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:43.420
So what we can say here is that
the 2 p is less than or

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:46.930
smaller than the 2 s orbital.

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:49.590
So think about what that means,
we're, of course, not

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:51.580
talking about this in classical
terms, so what it

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:55.390
means if we have an electron in
the 2 p orbital, it's more

00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:58.190
likely, the probability is that
will be closer to the

00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:03.080
nucleus than it would be if it
were in the 2 s orbital.

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:06.720
We can also take a look the 3
s, which we have looked at

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.440
before, and we figured out
that that should have two

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.880
radial nodes.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:14.850
We can look at the 2 p, which
should have one radial node,

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:18.980
and we just figured it out for
the, excuse me, for the 3 p

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:22.840
has one radial node, and for the
3 d here, we should have

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.370
zero radial nodes, we just
calculated that.

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:28.570
So again, what we see is the
same pattern where the most

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:32.070
probable radius, if we talk
about it in terms of the d,

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:35.270
that's going to be smaller then
for the p, and the 3 p

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:38.330
most probable radius is going
to be closer to the nucleus

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:43.200
than it is for the 3 s most
probable radius that we're

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.160
looking at.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.960
So, there are 2 different things
that we can compare

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.950
when we're comparing graphs
of radial probability

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:54.660
distribution, and the first
thing we can do is think about

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:57.500
well, how does the radius
change, or the most probable

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.540
radius change when we're
increasing n, when we're

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:03.860
increasing the principle
quantum number here?

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:07.290
So, from going from the shell
of n equals 2, let's say, to

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:09.090
the shell of n equals 3.

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:13.500
And what we find is we're going
from about or exactly a

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:17.410
6 a nought here, to almost three
times that when we're

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:19.650
going from 2 s to 3 s.

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:22.940
So we say if n increases,
the orbital size is

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:23.990
also going to increase.

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:26.140
And when we talk about size,
I'm again just going to say

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:29.260
the stipulation that we're
talking about, probability --

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:32.420
we're not talking about an
absolute classical concept

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:36.210
here, but in general we're going
to picture it being much

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:40.920
further away from the nucleus
as we move up in terms of n.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:44.210
The other thing that we took
note as is what happens as l

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:47.890
increases, and specifically as
l increases for any given the

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:49.280
principle quantum number.

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:52.890
So if we're keeping n the same,
we look and what we saw

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:56.340
was that size actually decreases
as we increase the

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:58.610
value of l.

00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:02.230
So, I want to contrast that
with another concept that

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:06.330
seemed to be opposing ideas, and
that is thinking about not

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:10.000
how far away the most probable
radius is, but thinking about

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.546
how close an electron can get
to the nucleus if it's

00:34:13.546 --> 00:34:14.380
actually in that orbital.

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:18.370
And what we'll find is that we
actually see the opposite.

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:24.150
So if we compare l increasing
here, so a 3 s to a 3 p to a 3

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:28.550
d, what we find is that it's
only in the s orbital that we

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:31.920
have a significant probability
of actually getting very close

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:33.140
to the nucleus.

00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:37.130
So, if I kind of circle where
the probability gets somewhat

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:39.910
substantial here, you can see
we're much closer to the

00:34:39.910 --> 00:34:44.390
nucleus at the s orbital than we
are for the p, then when we

00:34:44.390 --> 00:34:46.350
are for the d.

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:51.150
So, the size still for an s
orbital is larger than for a d

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:54.330
orbital, but what we say is
that an s electron can

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:56.950
actually penetrate closer
to the nucleus.

00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:59.940
There's some probability that
it can get very, very close

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:01.850
the nucleus, and that
probability is actually

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:05.470
substantial.

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:11.140
A kind of consequence of this
is if we're thinking about a

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:13.880
multi-electron atom, which we'll
get to in a minute where

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:16.810
electrons can shield each other
from the pull of the

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:19.780
nucleus, we're going to say that
the electrons in the s

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:22.110
orbitals are actually
the least shielded.

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:24.520
And the reason that they're the
least sheilded is because

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:26.650
they can get closest to the
nucleus, so we can think of

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:29.430
them as not getting blocked by
a bunch of other electron,

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:31.010
because there's some probability
that they can

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:33.970
actually work their way all
the way in to the nucleus.

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:35.450
So, this is a concept
that's going to

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:36.990
become really important.

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:39.520
Soon when we're talking about
multi-electron atoms, and I

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.870
just want to introduce it
here, that it is sort of

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:45.090
opposing ideas that even though
the s is the biggest

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:47.440
and it's most likely that the
electron's going to be

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:50.280
furthest away from the nucleus,
that's also the

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:54.500
orbital in which the electron
can, in fact, penetrate

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.370
closest.

00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:56.690
All right.

00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:59.390
So I think we are, in fact,
ready to move on to

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:04.190
multi-electron atoms, and what
happens is when we solved the

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:07.550
relativistic version of the
Schrodinger equation and we're

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:10.790
discussing more than one
electron, we actually have a

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:13.880
fourth quantum number that falls
out and that we need to

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.000
deal with and this is
called the electron

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.530
spin quantum number.

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:20.330
And I promise, this is the last
quantum number that we'll

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:22.750
be introducing.

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:26.490
And this spin magnetic quantum
number we abbreviate as m sub

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:32.580
s, so that's to differentiate
from m sub l.

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:36.320
And when you solved the
relativistic form of the

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.730
Schrodinger equation, what you
end up with is that you can

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:41.580
have two possible values
for the magnetic

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:43.580
spin quantum number.

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:47.940
You can have it equal to plus
1/2, and that's what we call

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:51.730
spin up, or you can have it
equal to minus 1/2, which is

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:53.760
what we call spin down.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.970
So, there's two kind of cartoons
shown here that give

00:36:56.970 --> 00:36:59.420
you a little bit of an idea
of what this quantum

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:00.660
number tells us.

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:04.870
And this spin is an intrinsic
quality of the electron, it's

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:08.080
a property that is intrinsic in
all particles, just like we

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:10.970
would say mass is intrinsic
or charge is intrinsic.

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:13.750
Spin is also an intrinsic
property.

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:16.140
One way to think about it, if
we want to use a classical

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.610
analogy, which often helps to
give us an idea of what's

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:21.760
going on, is the spin of an
electron, we can picture it

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:24.010
rotating on its own axis.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:27.350
So that's kind of what's shown
in these pictures here.

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:29.350
So you can see, if it's spinning
on its own axis in

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:31.960
this direction we'd call it spin
up, where as this way it

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:34.010
would be what we
call spin down.

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:36.910
So, it turns out there's not
actually a good classical

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:40.140
analogy for spin, we can't
really think of it like that,

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:43.300
but if that helps give you an
idea of what's going on here

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.750
then it's valuable maybe to
consider it spinning on its

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:48.960
own axis, even though that's not
technically what's exactly

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:49.980
happening here.

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:52.570
But the reason that I like that
analogy is that it points

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:56.130
out a very important part of
spin, and that's the idea that

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:58.570
it's a description
of the electron.

00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:01.490
It is not dependent on
the actual orbital.

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:04.830
So we can completely describe
an orbital with just using

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:08.100
three quantum numbers, but we
have this fourth quantum

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.760
number that describes something
about the electron

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:13.840
that's required for now a
complete description of the

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:16.550
electron, and that's
the idea of spin.

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:19.490
So, we need to actually add on
this fourth quantum number,

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:25.000
and it's either going to be
plus 1/2 or negative 1/2.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.230
So, we can talk a little bit
actually, because it's an

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:30.650
interesting story about where
the idea of spin came from,

00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:33.590
and it was actually first
proposed by two very young

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:37.310
scientists at the time, George
Uhlenbeck shown here, and

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:40.370
Samuel Goudsmit who's here, and
they're with a friend, and

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:43.680
I can't remember who that is,
but he did not have anything

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.210
to do with discovering spin.

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:48.310
And what you can see in this
picture is that these are

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:50.060
actually, they're pretty young
guys in this picture.

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:51.910
I think this is taken about
two years after they

00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:53.930
discovered the fourth
quantum number.

00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:56.500
So hopefully, you can picture
yourself at this age in a

00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:00.010
similar situation with an
anonymous friend and think

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:02.780
this is something, kind of
observations maybe you can

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:04.820
make as well.

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:07.320
And what they were doing when
they discovered that there

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:10.100
must be this fourth quantum
number is they were looking at

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:14.730
the emission spectrum of sodium,
and, so specifically,

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:17.630
they were looking at the
frequencies, and if we think

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:20.600
about the frequencies of sodium,
it was already known

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.930
at this time that you could
calculate what those would be

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:25.110
based on the difference in the
energy levels -- this happened

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:27.060
in about 1925.

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:29.570
So they actually knew exactly
what they were expecting.

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:31.930
So, let's say they were
expecting to see one certain

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:36.150
frequency or one line in the
spectrum at this point here.

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:40.740
It turns out that what they
actually observed, so this is

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:44.830
the actual of what they saw,
is if they were expecting

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:47.890
their line at some given
frequency, which I'll show by

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:52.720
this dotted line here, what
they actually saw was two

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:56.570
lines, and one was just the
teeniest tiniest bit of a

00:39:56.570 --> 00:39:59.690
higher frequency than what was
expected, and one was just,

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:01.660
just below what they expected.

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:04.460
And if we're talking about
things in spectroscopy terms

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:08.840
here, this is what we
call a doublet.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.190
So it's centered at this
frequency that was expected,

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:14.350
but it's actually split into
two different frequencies.

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:16.930
And this was an amazing
observation that they made.

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:19.620
They were totally surprised
and excited, and they were

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:22.100
thinking how could this happen,
where did we got this

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:23.650
split doublet from.

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:26.600
And what they could come up
with, what they reasoned, is

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:29.130
that there must be some
intrinsic property within the

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:32.270
electron, because we know that
this describes the complete

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:37.780
energy of the orbital should
give us one single frequency.

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:40.810
And that the fact that it split
into two was telling

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:43.970
them that there must be some new
property to the electron,

00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:45.930
and what we call that
now is either being

00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:47.880
spin up or spin down.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:51.420
But at the time, they didn't
have a well-formed name for

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:54.210
it, they were just saying OK,
there's this fourth quantum

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:57.480
number, there's this intrinsic
property in the electron.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:59.910
So, where the story gets kind
of unfortunate, but also a

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:03.000
little bit more interesting is
the fact that well, they did

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.030
publish what they observed, and
they did write that up.

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:08.220
They put it in a pretty
low impact paper.

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:11.740
I think it was in French, so it
wasn't really hitting all

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:15.930
the scientific community of
the time in any major way.

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:19.310
And they didn't put their
explanation of what they

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:21.500
thought was going on,
it just sort of was

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:23.860
observing what they saw.

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:26.210
These were very young
scientists, of course, so what

00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:28.650
you would expect that they would
do, which makes sense,

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:30.850
is go to someone more
established in their field,

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:33.100
because they have the
completely radical

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:36.760
revolutionary idea, let's just
run it by someone before we go

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:39.540
ahead and publish this paper
that makes this huge statement

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:41.560
about this fourth
quantum number.

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.520
So the person they chose to talk
to, and I think it was

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:47.290
just Goudsmit that went to him
and discussed it is Wolfgang

00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:49.480
Pauli, which is shown here.

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:52.030
So how many before five
minutes ago had

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.840
heard the name Goudsmit?

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:55.620
All right, a couple.

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:56.850
OK, cool.

00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:59.580
How about Pauli, like the Pauli
exclusion principle?

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:00.750
Hmm, OK.

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:05.480
So, Pauli seems to be getting
a little bit of fame that

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.710
you'll see in a second here.

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:09.870
So, it turns out they go and
they discuss their idea with

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:14.580
Pauli, and what Pauli tells
them is that this idea is

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:17.120
ridiculous, that it's rubbish,
if they go ahead and try to

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:19.150
publish this their scientific
careers are ruined.

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:21.560
They can pretty much pack it
up and go home, because

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.710
everyone's going to think
they're ridiculous, no one

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:25.955
will believe what they say, and
it's a stupid idea anyway,

00:42:25.955 --> 00:42:28.960
is basically the gist of
this conversation.

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:34.050
And in chemistry, just like in
any discipline, you have all

00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:36.880
types of scientists, but also
all types of personalities,

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.850
and unfortunately Pauli had a
personality that was known

00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:42.280
for, first of all, being very
arrogant, but also the very

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:45.160
unfortunate trait of taking
other people's scientific

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.930
ideas as his own.

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:50.330
And as the story goes, as
Goudsmit was leaving and the

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:54.850
door with slamming, Wolfgang
Pauli was already writing down

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:58.590
this idea into a scientific
paper of the idea of a fourth

00:42:58.590 --> 00:42:59.840
quantum number.

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:03.150
And, in fact, he did make some
more strides, he was a

00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:06.440
brilliant thinker, maybe he put
it more articulately than

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:09.490
those two younger scientists
could have. But now, it has

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:11.660
come to light that they are the
ones that do get credit

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:14.860
for first really coming up
with this idea of a spin

00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:17.600
quantum number, and it's
interesting to think about how

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:21.120
the politics work in different
discoveries, as well as the

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:22.160
discoveries themselves.

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.550
You see that a lot with Nobel
prizes, there's usually a nice

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:27.680
little scandal, a nice little
interesting story behind who

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:33.070
else was responsible for the
Nobel Prize-worthy discovery.

00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:37.170
So, here, Pauli came out on top,
we say, and he's known

00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:40.770
for the Pauli exclusion
principle, which tells us that

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:43.810
no two electrons in the same
atom can have the same four

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:45.770
quantum numbers.

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:49.330
So let's just think exactly
what this means, and that

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:52.360
means that if we take away
function and we define it in

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:57.930
terms of n, l and m sub l, what
we're defining here is

00:43:57.930 --> 00:44:03.180
the complete description
of an orbital.

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:06.150
In contrast, if we're taking
the wave function and

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:12.580
describing it in terms of n, l,
m sub l, and now also, the

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:15.640
spin, what are we
describing here?

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:16.450
An electron.

00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:20.580
So now we have the complete
description of an electron

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:21.780
within an orbital.

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:26.160
So, that's an important
distinction to make -- what

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:28.930
three quantum numbers tell us,
versus what the fourth quantum

00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:32.390
number can fill in for us
in terms of information.

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:35.420
So what that means is that we're
limited in any atom to

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:38.860
having two electrons per
orbital, right, because for

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:42.380
any orbital we can either have
a spin up electron, a spin

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:44.670
down electron, or both.

00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:48.980
So, if we look at neon just as
an example, neon has ten

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:53.100
electron in it, and once we
look at all the orbitals

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:55.920
written out here, this is
probably a familiar thing for

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:59.310
you to look at, but it's
important to think about why,

00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:02.600
in fact, we don't just put all
ten electrons, why wouldn't

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.860
they just want to go in that
ground state, that lowest

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:05.940
state, right?

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:08.240
That should be the most stable,
the lowest energy

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:11.060
orbital for it to be in, and the
reason they can't do that

00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:13.470
is because of the Pauli
exclusion principle -- the

00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:17.410
idea that all of the electrons
have to have a different set

00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:20.850
of four quantum numbers, so only
two of them can have the

00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:24.140
same set of three quantum
numbers here, because for m

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:28.220
sub s, we're only left
with two options.

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:31.510
So let's try a clicker question
and thinking about

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:33.490
the Pauli exclusion principle.

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:36.760
It might look a little bit
similar to a question we just

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:41.300
saw, but hopefully you'll find
that it is, in fact, not the

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:45.490
same question.

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:47.650
So you can go ahead and take
10 seconds on that.

00:45:47.650 --> 00:46:02.170
OK, great.

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:07.080
So, most of you recognize that
there are four different

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:09.870
possibilities of there's four
different electrons that can

00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:11.590
have those two quantum
numbers.

00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:13.200
Actually the easiest
way is probably to

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:15.050
bring this down here.

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:17.740
And the next highest percentage
of you thought that

00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:19.220
we still only had two.

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:22.740
So, remember we solved this
problem earlier in the class,

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:24.560
but we were talking
about orbitals.

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:27.100
So there's two different
orbitals that can have these

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:30.190
three quantum numbers, but if
we're talking about electrons,

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:34.090
we can also talk about m sub s,
so if we have two orbitals,

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:36.740
how many electrons can
we have total?

00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:37.000
Yeah.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.400
So we have two orbitals, or four
electrons that can have

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:44.430
that set of quantum numbers.

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:46.670
So you'll notice in your
problem-set, sometimes you're

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:49.650
asked for a number of orbitals
with a set of quantum numbers,

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:52.400
sometimes you're asked for a
number of electrons for a set

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.110
of quantum numbers.

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:55.180
So make sure first that you read
the question carefully,

00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:59.830
and realize the difference
that is between the two.

00:46:59.830 --> 00:47:01.620
So, that's where we'll
end today.

00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:04.140
So on Friday, we'll start with
talking about the wave

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.860
functions for the multi-electron
atoms.
