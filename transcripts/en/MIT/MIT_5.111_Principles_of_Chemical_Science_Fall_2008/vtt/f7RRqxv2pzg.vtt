00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:22.690
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:28.800
As you're settling into your
seats, why don't we take 10

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:41.990
more seconds on the clicker
question here.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.390
All right, so this is a question
that you saw on your

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.680
problem-set, so this is how many
electrons would we expect

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.530
to see in a single atom
in the 2 p state.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.490
So, let's see what
you said here.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.210
Six.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.420
And the correct answer
is, in fact, six.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.790
And most of you got
that, about 75% of

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.000
you got that right.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.970
So, let's consider some people
got it wrong, however, and

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.250
let's see where that wrong
answer might have come from,

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.400
or actually, more importantly,
let's see how we can all get

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.570
to the correct answer.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.590
So if we say that we have a 2
p orbital here, that means

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.780
that we can have how many
different complete orbitals

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.160
have a 2 for an n, and a p
as its l value? three.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.600
So, we can have the 2 p x, 2
p y, and 2 p z orbitals.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.150
Each of these orbitals can have
two electrons in them, so

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.250
we get two electrons here,
here, and here.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.320
So, we end up with a total
of six electrons that are

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.670
possible that have that
2 p orbital value.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.910
So this is a question that,
hopefully, if we see another

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.870
one like this we'll get a 100%
on, because you've already

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.100
seen this in your problem-set as
much as you're going to see

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.780
it, and you're seen it in
class as much as you're

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.300
going to see it.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.050
So if you're still having
trouble with this, this is

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.690
something you want to bring
up in your recitation.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.250
And the idea behind this, of
course, is that we know that

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.320
every electron has to have its
own distinct set of four

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.530
quantum numbers.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.790
So that means that if we have
three orbitals, we can only

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.440
have six electrons in those
complete three orbitals.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.210
All right, so today we're
going to fully have our

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.760
discussion focused on
multi-electron atoms. We

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.880
started talking about these on
Wednesday, and what we're

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.130
going to start with is
considering specifically the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:36.540
wave functions for
multi-electron atoms. So, the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.040
wave functions for
multi-electron atoms. Then

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.830
we'll move on to talking about
the binding energies, and

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.590
we'll specifically talk about
how that differs from the

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.530
binding energies we saw of
hydrogen atoms. We talked

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.580
about that quite in depth, but
there are some differences now

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.440
that we have more than one
electron in the atom.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.770
Then something that you
probably have a lot of

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.010
experience with is talking about
electron configuration

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.260
and writing out the electron
configuration.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.890
But we'll go over that,
particularly some exceptions,

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.870
when we're filling in electron
configurations, and how we

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.310
would go about doing that for
positive ions, which follow a

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.170
little bit of a different
procedure.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.330
And if we have time today,
we'll start in on the

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.130
photo-electron spectroscopy,
if not, that's where we'll

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.390
start when we come back
on Wednesday.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.580
So, what we saw just on
Wednesday, in particular, but

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.335
also as we have been discussing
the Schrodinger

00:03:27.335 --> 00:03:30.310
equation for the hydrogen atom,
is that this equation

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.860
can be used to correctly predict
the atomic structure

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.150
of hydrogen, and also all of
the energy levels of the

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.770
different orbitals in hydrogen,
which matched up

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.080
with what we observed, for
example, when we looked at the

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.030
hydrogen atom emission
spectra.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.190
And what we can do is we can
also use the Schrodinger

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.900
equation to make these accurate
predictions for any

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.590
other atom that we want
to talk about in

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.450
the periodic table.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.610
The one problem that we run into
is as we go to more and

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.440
more atoms on the table, as
we add on electrons, the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.690
Schrodinger equation is going
to get more complicated.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.640
So here I've written for the
hydrogen atom that deceptively

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.850
simple form of the Schrodinger
equation, where we don't

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.260
actually write out the
Hamiltonian operator, but you

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.800
remember that's a series of
second derivatives, so we have

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.960
a differential equation that
were actually dealing with.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.920
If you think about what happens
when we go from

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.700
hydrogen to helium, now instead
of one electron, so

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.000
three position variables,
we have to describe two

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.800
electrons, so now we have six
position variables that we

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.810
need to plug into our
Schrodinger equation.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.000
So similarly, as we now move up
only one more atom in the

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.810
table, so to an atomic number of
three or lithium, now we're

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.500
going from six variables all
the way to nine variables.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.290
So you can see that we're
starting to have a very

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.330
complicated equation, and
it turns out that it's

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.800
mathematically impossible
to even solve the exact

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.050
Schrodinger equation
as we move up to

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.970
higher numbers of electrons.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.370
So, what we say here is we need
to take a step back here

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.000
and come up with an
approximation that's going to

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.050
allow us to think about using
the Schrodinger equation when

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.580
we're not just talking about
hydrogen or one electron, but

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.340
when we have these
multi-electron atoms.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.860
The most straightforward way to
do this is to make what's

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.390
called a one electron orbital
approximation, and when you do

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.610
you get out what are called
Hartree orbitals, and what

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.690
this means is that instead of
considering the wave function

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.880
as a function, for example, for
helium as six different

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.380
variables, what we do is we
break it up and treat each

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.670
electron has a separate wave
function and say that our

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.900
assumption is that the total
wave function is equal to the

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.630
product of the two individual
wave functions.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.520
So, for example, for helium, we
can break it up into wave

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.280
function for it the r, theta,
and phi value for electron

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.480
one, and multiply that by the
wave function for the r,

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.570
theta, and phi value for
electron number two.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.250
So essentially what we're
saying is we have a wave

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.770
function for electron one,
and a wave function

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.890
for electron two.

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.660
We know how to write that in
terms of the state numbers, so

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.610
it would be 1, 0, 0, because
we're talking

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.000
about the ground state.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.270
We're always talking about the
ground state unless we specify

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.680
that we're talking about
an excited state.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.720
And we have the spin quantum
number as plus 1/2 for

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.580
electron one, and minus 1/2
for the electron two.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.520
It's arbitrary which one I
assigned to which, but we know

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.770
that we have to have each of
those two magnetic spin

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:36.110
quantum numbers in order to have
the distinct four letter

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.700
description of an electron.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.770
We know that it's not enough
just to describe the orbital

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.530
by three quantum numbers, we
need that fourth number to

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.110
fully describe an electron.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.470
And when we describe this in
terms of talking about

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.540
chemistry terminology, we would
call the first one the 1

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.900
s, and 1 is in parentheses
because we're talking about

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.780
the first electron there, and
we would multiply it by the

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.800
wave function for the second
one, which is also 1 s, but

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.290
now we are talking about
that second electron.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.250
We can do the exact same thing
when we talk about lithium,

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.000
but now instead of breaking it
up into two wave functions,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.250
we're breaking it up into three
wave functions because

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.440
we have three electrons.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:15.730
So, the first again is
the 1 s 1 electron.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.050
We then have the 1 s 2 electron,
and what is our

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.830
third electron going to be?

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:22.190
Yeah.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.250
So it's going to be the
2 s 1 electron.

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.300
So we can do this essentially
for any atom we want, we just

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.490
have more and more wave
functions that we're breaking

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:35.940
it up to as we get to more
and more electrons.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.940
And we can also write this in an
even simpler form, which is

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.330
what's called electron
configuration, and this is

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.130
just a shorthand notation for
these electron wave functions.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.280
So, for example, again we see
hydrogen is 1 s 1, helium we

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.340
say is 1 s 2, or 1 s squared, so
instead of writing out the

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:57.300
1 s 1 and the 1 s 2, we just
combine it as 1 s squared,

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.020
lithium is 1 s 2, 2 s 1.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.590
So writing out electron
configurations I realize is

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:04.820
something that a lot of you had
experience with in high

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.570
school, you're probably --
many of you are very

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.860
comfortable doing it, especially
for the more

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.790
straightforward atoms. But
what's neat to kind of think

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:14.350
about is if you think about
what a question might have

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.640
been in high school, which is
please write the electron

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.050
configuration for lithium, now
we can also answer what sounds

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.530
like a much more impressive,
and a much more complicated

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.610
question, which would be write
the shorthand notation for the

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.220
one electron orbital
approximation to solve the

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.550
Schrodinger equation
for lithium.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:34.300
So essentially, that is
the exact same thing.

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.900
The electronic configuration,
all it is is the shorthand

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.260
notation for that one electron
approximation for the

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.980
Schrodinger equation
for lithium.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.090
So, if you're at hanging your
exam from high school on the

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:47.800
fridge and you want to make it
look more impressive, you

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.480
could just rewrite the
question as that, and

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.340
essentially you're answering
the same thing.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.460
But now, hopefully, we
understand where that comes

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.350
from, why it is that we use
the shorthand notation.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:59.040
So, let's write this one
electron orbital approximation

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.050
for berylium, that sounds like a
pretty complicated question,

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:05.620
but hopefully we know that it's
not at all, it's just 1 s

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.410
2, and then 2 s 2.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.760
And we can go on and
on down the table.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:15.040
So, for example, for boron, now
we're dealing with 1 s 2,

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.780
then 2 s 2, and now we have to
move into the p orbital so we

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:19.990
go to 2 p 1.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:23.380
So that's a little bit of an
introduction into electron

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.050
configuration.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.120
We'll get into some spots
where it gets a little

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.110
trickier, a little bit more
complicated later in class.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:33.000
But that's an idea of what it
actually means to talk about

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.320
electron configuration.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.690
So now that we can do this, we
can compare and think about,

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:41.770
we know how to consider wave
functions for individual

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:45.600
electrons in multi-electron
atoms using those Hartree

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.040
orbitals or the one electron
wave approximations.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.190
So let's compare what some
of the similarities and

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:53.910
differences are between hydrogen
atom orbitals, which

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.750
we spent a lot of time studying,
and now these one

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.040
electron orbital approximations
for these

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.600
multi-electron atoms.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.460
So, as an example, let's take
argon, I've written up the

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.480
electron configuration here,
and let's think about what

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.700
some of the similarities might
be between wave functions in

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.550
argon and wave functions
for hydrogen.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.430
So the first is that the
orbitals are similar in shape.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:19.910
So for example, if you know how
to draw an s orbital for a

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.400
hydrogen atom, then you already
know how to draw the

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:27.670
shape of an s orbital or
a p orbital for argon.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.090
Similarly, if we were to look
at the radial probability

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.130
distributions, what we would
find is that there's an

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.230
identical nodal structure.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:39.090
So, for example, if we look at
the 2 s orbital of argon, it's

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:41.870
going to have the same amount of
nodes and the same type of

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:45.310
nodes that the 2 s orbital
for hydrogen has.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:50.010
So how many nodes does the 2 s
orbital for hydrogen have?

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.280
It has one node, right, because
if we're talking about

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:56.840
nodes it's just n minus 1 is
total nodes, so you would just

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:03.450
say 2 minus 1 equals 1 node
for the 2 s orbital.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:07.710
And how many of those nodes
are angular nodes? zero.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:11.670
L equals 0, so we have zero
angular nodes, that means that

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.860
they're all radial nodes.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.590
So what we end up with is one
radial node for the 2 s

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.860
orbital of hydrogen, and we can
apply that for argon or

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:23.640
any other multi-electron atom
here, we also have one radial

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.390
node for the 2 s orbital
of argon.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.350
But there's also some
differences that we need to

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.460
keep in mind, and that will be
the focus of a lot of the

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.500
lecture today.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.820
One of the main difference is
is that when you're talking

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.700
about multi-electron orbitals,
they're actually smaller than

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.840
the corresponding orbital
for the hydrogen atom.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.730
We can think about why
that would be.

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:47.540
Let's consider again an s
orbital for argon, so let's

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.170
say we're looking at the
1 s orbital for argon.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:53.050
What is the pull from the
nucleus from argon

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:53.760
going to be equal to?

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.790
What is the charge
of the nucleus?

00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:01.280
Does anyone know, it's a quick
addition problem here.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.510
Yeah, so it's 18.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:06.960
So z equals 18, so the nucleus
is going to be pulling at the

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.970
electron with a Coulombic
attraction that has a charge

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:14.980
of plus 18, if we're talking
about the 1 s electron or the

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.810
1 s orbital in argon.

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.220
It turns out, and we're going to
get the idea of shielding,

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:22.320
so it's not going to actually
feel that full plus 18, but

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.450
it'll feel a whole lot more
than it will just feel in

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:26.560
terms of a hydrogen atom
where we only have a

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.120
nuclear charge of one.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.440
So because we're feeling a
stronger attractive force from

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.180
the nucleus, we're actually
pulling that electron in

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.530
closer, which means that the
probability squared of where

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.570
the electron is going to be is
actually a smaller radius.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:44.150
So when we talk about the size
of multi-electron orbitals,

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:46.140
they're actually going to be
smaller because they're being

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.340
pulled in closer to the nucleus
because of that

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.350
stronger attraction because of
the higher charge of the

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.380
nucleus in a multi-electron
atom compared

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.540
to a hydrogen atom.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.440
The other main difference that
we're really going to get to

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.830
today is that in multi-electron
atoms, orbital

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.290
energies depend not just on the
shell, which is what we

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:06.260
saw before, not just on the
value of n, but also on the

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.770
angular momentum
quantum number.

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:10.360
So they also depend on
the sub-shell or l.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.870
And we'll really get to see a
picture of that, and I'll be

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.170
repeating that again and again
today, because this is

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.870
something I really want everyone
to get firmly into

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:18.450
their heads.

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:21.570
So, let's now take a look
at the energies.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.870
We looked at the wave functions,
we know the other

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:25.760
part of solving the Schrodinger
equation is to

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.860
solve for the binding energy of
electrons to the nucleus,

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.360
so let's take a look at those.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.650
And there again is another
difference between

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:36.280
multi-electron atom and the
hydrogen atoms. So when we

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.160
talk about orbitals in
multi-electron atoms, they're

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.160
actually lower in
energy than the

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.120
corresponding h atom orbitals.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.930
And when we say lower in energy,
of course, what we

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.070
mean is more negative.

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:51.010
Right, because when we think
of an energy diagram, that

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:54.040
lowest spot there is going to
have the lowest value of the

00:13:54.040 --> 00:14:00.390
binding energy or the most
negative value of binding.

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:03.690
So, let's take a look here at
an example of an energy

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:06.930
diagram for the hydrogen atom,
and we can also look at a

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.930
energy diagram for a
multi-electron atom, and this

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:12.430
is just a generic one here, so
I haven't actually listed

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:15.460
energy numbers, but I want
you to see the trend.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.490
So for example, if you look at
the 1 s orbital here, you can

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:23.210
see that actually it is lower
in the case of the

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:26.480
multi-electron atom than it
is for the hydrogen atom.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.665
You see the same thing
regardless of which orbital

00:14:28.665 --> 00:14:30.090
you're looking at.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:33.090
For example, for the 2 s, again
what you see is that the

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:37.180
multi-electron atom, its 2 s
orbital is lower in energy

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.480
than it is for the hydrogen.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.720
The same thing we
see for the 2 p.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:45.890
Again the 2 p orbitals for the
multi-electron atom, lower in

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:48.300
energy than for the
hydrogen atom.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.940
But there's something you'll
note here also when I point

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.340
out the case of the 2 s versus
the 2 p, which is what I

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.920
mentioned that I would be saying
again and again, which

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.600
is when we look at the hydrogen
atom, the energy of

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.640
all of the n equals 2 orbitals
are exactly the same.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.460
That's what we call degenerate
orbitals,

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.070
they're the same energy.

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:09.910
But when we get to the
multi-electron atoms, we see

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:13.150
that actually the p orbitals are
higher in energy than the

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:14.450
s orbitals.

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:17.570
So we'll see specifically why it
is that the s orbitals are

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:18.490
lower in energy.

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:21.210
We'll get to discussing that,
but what I want to point out

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:24.320
here again is the fact that
instead of just being

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.030
dependent on n, the energy
level is dependent

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:29.780
on both n and l.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:34.400
And is no longer that sole
determining factor for energy,

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.080
energy also depends both
on n and on l.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.930
And we can look at precisely why
that is by looking at the

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:45.150
equations for the energy levels
for a hydrogen atom

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.030
versus the multi-electron
atom.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:50.320
So, for a hydrogen atom, and
actually for any one electron

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.070
atom at all, this is our energy
or our binding energy.

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:55.990
This is what came out of
solving the Schrodinger

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:59.260
equation, we've seen this
several times before that the

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:03.150
energy is equal to negative z
squared times the Rydberg

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:05.400
constant over n squared.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.500
Remember the z squared, that's
just the atomic number or the

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:13.050
charge on the nucleus, and we
can figure that out for any

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:14.740
one electron atom at all.

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.180
And an important thing to note
is in terms of what that

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.930
physically means, so physically
the binding energy

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:22.760
is just the negative of
the ionization energy.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.090
So if we can figure out the
binding energy, we can also

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:28.170
figure out how much energy we
have to put into our atom in

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:31.950
order to a eject or ionize
an electron.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:35.770
We can also look at the energy
equation now for a

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:37.820
multi-electron atom.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.800
And the big difference is
right here in this term.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.960
So instead of being equal to
negative z squared, now we're

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.650
equal to negative z effective
squared times r

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:49.970
h all over n squared.

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:53.230
So when we say z effective, what
we're talking about is

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:56.290
instead of z, the charge on
the nucleus, we're talking

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:58.980
about the effective charge
on a nucleus.

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:02.550
So for an example, even if a
nucleus has a charge of 7, but

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:05.850
the electron we're interested in
only feels the charge as if

00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:09.350
it were a 5, then what we
would say is that the z

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:12.260
effective for the nucleus
is 5 for that electron.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.790
And we'll talk about this
more, so if this is not

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:17.710
completely intuitive, we'll
see why in a second.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:20.590
So the main idea here is z
effective is not z, so don't

00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:23.590
try to plug one in for the
other, they're absolutely

00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:26.310
different quantities in any case
when we're not talking

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:29.200
about a 1 electron atom.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.190
And the point that I also want
to make is the way that they

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:36.400
differ, z effective actually
differs from the total charge

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.960
in the nucleus due to an
idea called shielding.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:43.455
So, shielding happens when you
have more than one electron in

00:17:43.455 --> 00:17:46.980
an atom, and the reason that
it's happening is because

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:50.120
you're actually canceling out
some of that positive charge

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.510
from the nucleus or that
attractive force with a

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:56.230
repulsive force between
two electrons.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:59.370
So if you have some charge in
the nucleus, but you also have

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:02.550
repulsion with another electron,
the net attractive

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:05.990
charge that a given electron
going to feel is actually less

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:08.120
than that total charge
in the nucleus.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.960
And shielding is a little bit of
a misnomer because it's not

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.930
actually that's the electron's
blocking the charge from

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:17.150
another electron, it's more like
you're canceling out a

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:20.530
positive attractive force with
a negative repulsive force.

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:23.520
But shielding is a good way to
think about it, and actually,

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.070
that's what we'll use in this
class to sort of visualize

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:29.400
what's happening when we have
many electrons in an atom and

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.470
they're shielding each other.

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:33.240
Shielding is the term that's
used, it brings up a certain

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.520
image in our mind, and even
though that's not precisely

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.630
what's going on, it's a very
good way to visualize what

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:39.880
we're trying to think
about here.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:43.250
So let's take two cases of
shielding if we're talking

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:47.300
about, for example, the helium,
a helium nucleus or a

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.270
helium atom.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:52.130
So what is the charge
on a helium nucleus?

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.850
What is z?

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:56.790
Yup, so it's plus 2.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:00.480
So the charge is actually just
equal to z, we can write plus

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.720
2, or you can write plus 2 e,
e just means the absolute

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.520
value of the charge
on an electron.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:09.020
When we plug it into equations
we just use the number, the e

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:11.140
is assumed there.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.940
So, let's think of what we
could have if we have two

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:17.160
electrons in a helium atom
that are shielded in two

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:17.960
extreme ways.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.510
So, in the first extreme way,
let's consider that our first

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:25.000
electron is at some distance
very far away from the

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.400
nucleus, we'll call this
electron one, and our second

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.570
electron is, in fact, much, much
closer to the nucleus,

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:34.250
and let's think of the idea of
shielding in more of the

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:37.780
classical sense where we're
actually blocking some of that

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.080
positive charge.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:42.090
So if we have total and complete
shielding where that

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:45.400
can actually negate a full
positive charge, because

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.980
remember our nucleus is plus
2, one of the electrons is

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.950
minus 1, so if it totally blocks
it, all we would have

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:54.590
left from the nucleus is an
effective charge of plus 1.

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:57.410
So in our first case, our first
extreme case, would be

00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:01.090
that the z effective that is
felt by electron number 1, is

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:04.100
going to be plus 1.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.730
So, what we can do is figure out
what we would expect the

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:09.330
binding energy of that electron
to be in the case of

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:10.960
this total shielding.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.440
And remember again, the binding
energy physically is

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.070
the negative of the ionization
energy, and that's actually

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:19.400
how you can experimentally
check to see if this is

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.790
actually correct.

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:23.290
And that's going to be equal
to negative z effective

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.890
squared times r h
over n squared.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.880
So, let's plug in these values
and see what we would expect

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.600
to see for the energy.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.890
So it would be negative 1
squared times r h all over 1

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:38.520
squared, since our z effective
we're saying is 1, and n is

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.440
also equal to 1, because we're
in the ground state here so

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:46.980
we're talking about
a 1 s orbital.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.370
So if we have a look at what
the answer would be, this

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:50.430
looks very familiar.

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:53.530
We would expect our binding
energy to be a negative 2 .

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:56.730
1 8 times 10 to the negative
18 joules.

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:59.410
This is actually what the
binding energy is for hydrogen

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:02.710
atom, and in fact, that makes
sense because in our extreme

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.920
case where we have total
shielding by the second

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.910
electron of the electron of
interest, it's essentially

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:11.610
seeing the same nuclear force
that an electron in a hydrogen

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:12.190
atom would see.

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:13.680
All right.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.080
Let's consider now the second
extreme case, or extreme case

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.870
b, for our helium atom.

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:22.080
Again we have the charge of
the nucleus on plus 2, but

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.340
let's say this time the electron
now is going to be

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:26.310
very, very close
to the nucleus.

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:29.390
And let's say our second
electron now is really far

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:32.640
away, such that it's actually
not going to shield any of the

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.490
nuclear charge at all from
that first electron.

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:39.640
So what we end up saying is that
the z effective or the

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.730
effective charge that that first
electron feels is now

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.920
going to be plus 2.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:49.240
Again, we can just plug this
into our equation, so if we

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.390
write in our numbers now saying
that z effective is

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:57.340
equal to 2, we find that we get
negative 2 squared r h,

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:00.520
all divided again by 1 squared
-- we're still talking about a

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.890
1 s orbital here.

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:06.870
And if we do that calculation,
what we find out is that the

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:10.840
binding energy, in this case
where we have no shielding, is

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.260
negative 8 .

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:17.410
7 2 times 10 to the negative
18 joules.

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:20.450
So, let's compare what we've
just seen as our two extremes.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:24.540
So in extreme case a, we saw
that z effective was 1.

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:26.910
This is what we call
total shielding.

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:29.380
The electron completely canceled
out it's equivalent

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:32.790
of charge from the nucleus, such
that we only saw in a z

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:33.900
effective of 1.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:38.240
In an extreme case b, we had
a z effective of 2, so

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:41.170
essentially what we had was
no shielding at all.

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:44.070
We said that that second
electron was so far out of the

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:46.310
picture, that it had absolutely
no affect on what

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:49.870
the charge was felt by
that first electron.

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:52.440
So, we can actually think about
now, we know the extreme

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.840
cases, but what is the reality,
and the reality is if

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.260
we think about the ionization
energy, and we measure it

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:00.480
experimentally, we find
that it's 3 .

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.980
9 4 times 10 to the negative
18 joules, and what you can

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:07.040
see is that falls right in the
middle between the two

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.960
ionization energies that
we would expect

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.460
for the extreme cases.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:13.730
And this is absolutely
confirming that what is

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:16.240
happening is what we would
expect to happen, because we

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.350
would expect the case of reality
is that, in fact, some

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:21.900
shielding is going on, but it's
not going to be total

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.340
shielding, but at the same time
it's not going to be no

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.290
shielding at all.

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:30.290
And if we experimentally know
what the ionization energy is,

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:33.460
we actually have a way to find
out what the z effective will

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:34.990
be equal to.

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:37.950
And we can use this equation
here, this is just the

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:40.630
equation for the ionization
energy, which is the same

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:44.060
thing as saying the negative of
the binding energy that's

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:48.490
equal to z effective squared
r h over n squared.

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:51.830
So, what we can do instead of
talking about the ionization

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:55.015
energy, because that's one of
our known quantities, is we

00:23:55.015 --> 00:23:58.810
can instead solve so that
we can find z effective.

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:03.680
So, if we just rearrange this
equation, what we find is that

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:10.060
z effective is equal to n
squared times the ionization

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:16.370
energy, all over the Rydberg
constant and the

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:17.320
square root of this.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:22.500
So the square root of n
squared r e over r h.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:27.710
So what's our value
for n here? one.

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.770
Yup, that's right.

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:35.410
And then what's our value
for ionization energy?

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:35.670
Yup.

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:37.590
So it's just that ionization
energy that we have

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:40.210
experimentally measured, 3 .

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:44.360
9 4 times 10 to the negative
18 joules.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:48.490
We put all of this over the
Rydberg constant, which is 2 .

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:53.390
1 8 times 10 to the negative
18 joules, and we want to

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:59.230
raise this all to the 1/2.

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:03.080
So what we end up seeing is that
the z effective is equal

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.280
to positive 1 .

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.430
3 4.

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:11.090
So, this is what we find the
actual z effective is for an

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:13.800
electron in the helium atom.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:17.490
Does this seem like a
reasonable number?

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:17.830
Yeah?

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:20.520
Who says yes, raise your hand
if this seems reasonable.

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.270
Does anyone think this
seems not reasonable?

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:23.650
OK.

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:26.170
How can we check, for example,
if it does or if it doesn't

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:27.040
seem reasonable.

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:29.590
Well, the reason, the way that
we can check it is just to see

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:32.090
if it's in between our
two extreme cases.

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:34.880
We know that it has to be more
than 1, because even if we had

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.870
total shielding, we would
at least feel is the

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:38.100
effective of 1.

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:41.490
We know that it has to be equal
to less than 2, because

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:45.070
even if we had absolutely no
shielding at all, the highest

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:47.560
z effective we could have is 2,
so it makes perfect sense

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.240
that we have a z effective that
falls somewhere in the

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.570
middle of those two.

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:55.220
So, let's look at another
example of thinking about

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.140
whether we get an answer
out that's reasonable.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:00.085
So we should be able to
calculate a z effective for

00:26:00.085 --> 00:26:02.490
any atom that we want to talk
about, as long as we know what

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:04.550
that ionization energy is.

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:06.980
And I'm not expecting you to
do that calculation here,

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.610
because it involves the
calculator, among maybe a

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:10.890
piece of paper as well.

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:13.660
But what you should be able to
do is take a look at a list of

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:17.460
answers for what we're saying
z effective might be, and

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.570
determining which ones are
possible versus which ones are

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:21.340
not possible.

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.700
So, why don't you take a look at
this and tell me which are

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:28.230
possible for a 2 s electron in
a lithium atom where z is

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:48.010
going to be equal to three?

00:26:48.010 --> 00:27:04.490
Let's do 10 more seconds
on that.

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:05.080
OK, great.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.860
So, the majority of
you got it right.

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.520
There are some people that are a
little bit confused still on

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.650
where this make sense, so, let's
just think about this a

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:12.700
little bit more.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:16.830
So now we're saying that z
is equal to 3, so if, for

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:20.080
example, we had total shielding
by the other two

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:23.970
electrons, if they totally
canceled out one unit of

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:27.050
positive charge each in the
nucleus, what we would end up

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:31.140
with is we started with 3 and
then we would subtract a

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.960
charge of 2, so we would end up
with a plus 1 z effective

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.570
from the nucleus.

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:39.920
So our minimum that we're
going to see is that the

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.505
smallest we can have for
a z effective is going

00:27:42.505 --> 00:27:43.630
to be equal to 1.

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:46.730
So any of the answers that
said a z effective of .

00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:47.680
3 9 or .

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.210
8 7 are possible, they actually
aren't possible

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:53.180
because even if we saw a total
shielding, the minimum z

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:54.880
effective we would see is 1.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.250
And then I think it looks like
most people understood that

00:27:58.250 --> 00:27:59.680
four was not a possibility.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.680
Of course, if we saw no
shielding at all what we would

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.020
end up with is a z
effective of 3.

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:07.460
So again, when we check these,
what we want to see is that

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:10.690
our z effective falls in between
the two extreme cases

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:13.120
that we could envision
for shielding.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.630
And again, just go back and look
at this and think about

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:17.650
this, this should make sense if
you kind of look at those

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:20.600
two extreme examples, so even
if it doesn't make entire

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.810
sense in the 10 seconds you
have to answer a clicker

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:25.640
question right now, make sure
this weekend you can go over

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:29.100
it and be able to predict if you
saw a list of answers or

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.990
if you calculate your own answer
on the p-set, whether

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:33.990
or not it's right or it's wrong,
you should be able to

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:37.550
qualitatively confirm whether
you have a reasonable or a not

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:42.100
reasonable answer after you
do the calculation part.

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:42.370
All right.

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:44.710
So now that we have a general
idea of what we're talking

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:47.820
about with shielding, we can
now go back and think about

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:50.500
why it is that the orbitals
are ordered in the

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:51.770
order that they are.

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:54.790
We know that the orbitals for
multi-electron atoms depend

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:56.970
both on n and on l.

00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:00.440
But we haven't yet addressed
why, for example, a 2 s

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:04.480
orbital is lower in energy than
the 2 p orbital, or why,

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:08.450
for example, a 3 s orbital is
lower in energy than a 3 p,

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:11.160
which in turn is lower
than a 3 d orbital.

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:15.082
So let's think about shielding
in trying to answer why, in

00:29:15.082 --> 00:29:20.500
fact, it's those s orbitals that
are the lowest in energy.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.860
And when we make these
comparisons, one thing I want

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:26.790
to point out is that we need to
keep the constant principle

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:29.260
quantum number constant, so
we're talking about a certain

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:31.910
state, so we could talk about
the n equals 2 state, or the n

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:33.410
equals 3 state.

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:36.240
And when we're talking about
orbitals in the same state,

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.800
what we find is that orbitals
that have lower values of l

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:42.720
can actually penetrate closer
to the nucleus.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.520
This is an idea we introduced
on Wednesday when we were

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.310
looking at the radial
probability distributions of p

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:51.550
orbitals versus s orbitals
versus d orbitals.

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:53.810
But now it's going to make more
sense because in that

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:57.290
case we were just talking about
single electron atoms,

00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:59.060
and now we're talking about
a case where we

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:00.890
actually can see shielding.

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:03.940
So what is actually going to
matter is how closely that

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:06.840
electron can penetrate to the
nucleus, and what I mean by

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:10.890
penetrate to the nucleus is is
there probability density a

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:13.730
decent amount that's very
close to the nucleus.

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:16.910
So, if we superimpose, for
example, the 2 s radial

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:20.870
probability distribution over
the 2 p, what we see is

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:23.290
there's this little bit of
probability density in the 2

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:27.370
s, but it is significant, and
that's closer to the nucleus

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:29.040
than it is for the 2 p.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:33.480
And remember, this is in
complete opposition to what we

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:37.010
call the size of the orbitals,
because we know that the 2 p

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:39.450
is actually a smaller orbital.

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:41.370
For example, when we're
talking about radial

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:44.930
probability distributions, the
most probable radius is closer

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:47.630
into the nucleus than it
is for the s orbital.

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:50.510
But what's important is not
where that most probable

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:52.810
radius is when we're talking
about the z effective it

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:55.770
feels, what's more important
is how close the electron

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:57.690
actually can get the nucleus.

00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:01.140
And for the s electron, since it
can get closer, what we're

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:04.520
going to see is that s electrons
are actually less

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.980
shielded than the corresponding
p electrons.

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:10.630
They're less shielded because
they're closer to the nucleus,

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:15.280
they feel a greater
z effective.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:18.420
We can see the same thing when
we compare p electrons to d

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:20.220
electrons, or p and
d orbitals.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:24.450
I've drawn the 3 p and the 3 d
orbital here, and again, what

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:27.260
you can see is that the p
electron are going to be able

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.770
to penetrate closer to the
nucleus because of the fact

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:33.810
that there's this bit of
probability density that's in

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:35.960
significantly closer to
the nucleus than it

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.810
is for the 3 d orbital.

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:42.470
And if we go ahead and
superimpose the 3 s on top of

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:46.060
the 3 p, you can see that the
3 s actually has some bit of

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:49.400
probability density that gets
even closer to the nucleus

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.010
than the 3 p did.

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:53.840
So that's where that trend comes
from where the s orbital

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:55.410
is lower than the d
orbital, which is

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:59.800
lower than the d orbital.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.130
So now that we have this idea
of shielding and we can talk

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:05.700
about the differences in
the radial probability

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:09.130
distributions, we can consider
more completely why, for

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:11.870
example, if we're talking about
lithium, we write the

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:16.950
electron configuration as 1 s 2,
2 s 1, and we don't instead

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:20.260
jump from the 1 s 2 all the
way to a p orbital.

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:23.420
So the most basic answer that
doesn't explain why is just to

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:26.340
say well, the s orbital is lower
in energy than the p

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:29.180
orbital, but we now have a more
complete answer, so we

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.850
can actually describe
why that is.

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:35.100
And what we're actually
talking about

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.020
again is the z effective.

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:41.210
So that z effective felt by the
2 p is going to be less

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:44.940
than the z effective
felt by the 2 s.

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:48.210
And another way to say this, I
think it's easiest to look at

00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:50.760
just the fact that there's some
probability density very

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:54.120
close the nucleus, but what we
can actually do is average the

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.930
z effective over this entire
radial probability

00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:00.020
distribution, and when we find
that, we find that it does

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:03.890
turn out that the average of the
z effective over the 2 p

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:07.590
is going to be less than
that of the 2 s.

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:10.590
So we know that we can relate
to z effective to the actual

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:14.510
energy level of each of those
orbitals, and we can do that

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:17.550
using this equation here where
it's negative z effective

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:19.280
squared r h over n squared,
we're going to see

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.720
that again and again.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:24.770
And it turns out that if we have
a, for example, for s, a

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:28.670
very large z effective or larger
z effective than for 2

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:32.880
p, and we plug in a large value
here in the numerator,

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.760
that means we're going
to end up with a very

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.530
large negative number.

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:39.370
So in other words a very low
energy is what we're going to

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:42.230
have when we talk about the
orbitals -- the energy of the

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:44.720
2 s orbital is going
to be less than the

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.920
energy of the 2 p orbital.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.460
Another way to say that it's
going to be less, so you don't

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.980
get confused with that the fact
this is in the numerator

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:54.900
here, there is that negative
sign so it's less energy but

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.540
it's a bigger negative
number that gives us

00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:01.630
that less energy there.

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:04.620
All right, so let's go back to
electrons configurations now

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:09.160
that we have an idea of why the
orbitals are listed in the

00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:12.730
energy that they are listed
under, why, for example, the 2

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:14.580
s is lower than the 2 p.

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:18.270
So now we can go back and think
about filling in these

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:20.890
electron configurations
for any atom.

00:34:20.890 --> 00:34:23.565
I think most and you are
familiar with the Aufbau or

00:34:23.565 --> 00:34:27.350
the building up principle, you
probably have seen it quite a

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:29.730
bit in high school, and this is
the idea that we're filling

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:33.440
up our energy states, again,
which depend on both n and l,

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:36.440
one electron at a time starting
with that lowest

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.890
energy and then working
our way up into

00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:41.750
higher and higher orbitals.

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:44.630
And when we follow the Aufbau
principle, we have to follow

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:45.560
two other rules.

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:48.220
One is the Pauli exclusion
principal, we discussed this

00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:49.390
on Wednesday.

00:34:49.390 --> 00:34:52.780
So this is just the idea that
the most electrons that you

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:54.520
can have in a single orbital
is two electrons.

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:58.670
That makes sense because we
know that every single

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:02.190
electron has to have its own
distinct set of four quantum

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:05.340
numbers, the only way that we
can do that is to have a

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:08.520
maximum of two spins in any
single orbital or two

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:10.750
electrons per orbital.

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:13.610
We also need to follow Hund's
rule, this is that a single

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:16.100
electron enters each
state before it

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:18.000
enters a second state.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.570
And by state we just mean
orbital, so if we're looking

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:24.370
at the p orbitals here, that
means that a single electron

00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:27.930
goes in x, and then it will go
in the z orbital before a

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:30.120
second one goes in
the x orbital.

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.910
This intuitively should make a
lot of sense, because we know

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:36.240
we're trying to minimize
electron repulsions to keep

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:39.520
things in as low an energy state
as possible, so it makes

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:43.240
sense that we would put one
electron in each orbital first

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:46.390
before we double up
in any orbital.

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:49.450
And the third fact that we need
to keep in mind is that

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:53.210
spins remain parallel prior to
adding a second electron in

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:54.780
any of the orbitals.

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:57.450
So by parallel we mean they're
either both spin up or they're

00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:00.080
both spin down -- remember
that's our spin quantum

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.020
number, that fourth
quantum number.

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:04.120
And the reason for this comes
out of solving the

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:06.610
relativistic version of the
Schrodinger equation, so

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:09.260
unfortunately it's not as
intuitive as knowing that we

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:12.630
want to fill separate before
we double up a degenerate

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:16.450
orbital, but you just need to
keep this in mind and you need

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:20.200
to just memorize the fact that
you need to be parallel before

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.280
you double up in the orbital.

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.510
So, we'll see how this
works in a second.

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:29.020
So let's do this considering,
for example, what it would

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.730
look like if we were to write
out the electron configuration

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:34.980
for oxygen where z is going
to be equal to 8.

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:37.510
So what we're doing is filling
in those eight electrons

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:40.760
following the Aufbau principle,
so our first

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:44.640
electron is going to go in the 1
s, and then we have no other

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.540
options for other orbitals that
are at that same energy,

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:50.690
so we put the second electron
in the 1 s as well.

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:54.050
Then we go up to the 2 s, and we
have two electrons that we

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:55.880
can fill in the 2 s.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:59.370
And now we get the p orbitals,
remember we want to fill up 1

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:02.740
orbital at a time before we
double up, so we'll put one in

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:08.000
the 2 p x, then one in the 2 p
z, and then one in the 2 p y.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.730
At this point, we have no other
choice but to double up

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:13.860
before going to the next energy
level, so we'll put a

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.650
second one in the 2 p x.

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:18.760
And I arbitrarily chose to put
it in the 2 p x, we also could

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:21.940
have put it in the 2 p y or the
2 p z, it doesn't matter

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:24.750
where you double up, they're
all the same energy.

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:27.940
So if we think about what we
would do to actually write out

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:30.900
this configuration, we just
write the energy levels that

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:34.940
we see here or the orbital
approximations.

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:38.630
So if we're talking about
oxygen, we would say that it's

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:45.240
1 s 2, then we have 2 s 2, and
then we have 2 p, and our

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:49.320
total number of electrons in
the p orbitals are four.

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.730
So it's OK to not specify.

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:54.690
I want to point out, whether
you're in the p x, the p y, or

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:58.550
the p z, unless a question
specifically asks you to

00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:02.310
specify the m sub l, which
occasionally will happen, but

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:04.570
if it doesn't happen you just
write it like this.

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:09.380
But if, in fact, you are asked
to specify the m sub l's, then

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:11.730
we would have to write it out
more completely, which would

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:19.950
be the 1 s 2, the 2 s 2, and
then we would say 2 p x 2, 2 p

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:22.660
z 1, and 2 p y 1.

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:29.380
So again, in general, just go
ahead and write it out like

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:32.720
this, but if we do ask you to
specify you should be able to

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.970
know that the p orbital
separates into these three --

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:42.250
the p sub-shell separates into
these three orbitals.

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:46.480
So let's do a clicker question
on assigning electron

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:49.700
configurations using the
Aufbau principle.

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:52.430
So why don't you go ahead and
identify the correct electron

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:55.570
configuration for carbon,
and I'll tell you that z

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:57.760
is equal to 6 here.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:01.230
And in terms of doing this for
your homework, I actually want

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:04.160
to mention that in the back page
of your notes I attached

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:06.530
a periodic table that does
not have electron

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:08.040
configurations on them.

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.570
It's better to practice doing
electron configurations when

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:13.140
you cannot actually see the
electron configurations.

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.490
And this is the same periodic
table that you're going to get

00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:17.650
in your exams, so it's good
to practice doing your

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:20.330
problem-sets with that periodic
table so you're not

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:22.860
relying on having the double
check right there of seeing

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.920
what the electron configuration
is.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:39.700
So, let's do 10 seconds
on this problem here.

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:40.370
OK, great.

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:43.370
So this might be our best
clicker question yet.

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:47.760
Most people were able to
identify the correct electron

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.000
configuration here.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.990
Some people, the next most
popular answer with 5%, which

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:56.790
is a nice low number, wanted to
put two in the 2 p x before

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:57.820
they moved on.

00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:01.200
Remember we have to put one in
each degenerate orbital before

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:04.490
we double up on any orbital, so
just keep that rule in mind

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:07.320
that we would fill one in each
p orbital before we a to the

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:07.820
second one.

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:10.950
But it looks like you guys are
all experts here on doing

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:12.820
these electron configurations.

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:15.990
So, let's move on to some more
complicated electron

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:17.290
configurations.

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:19.990
So, for example, we can move
to the next periods in the

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:21.190
periodic table.

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:24.140
When we talk about a period,
we're just talking about that

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:27.870
principle quantum number, so
period 2 means that we're

00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:31.420
talking about starting with
the 2 s orbitals, period 3

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:34.000
starts with, what we're
now filling into the

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.210
3 s orbitals here.

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:38.310
So if we're talking about the
third period, that starts with

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:41.080
sodium and it goes all
the way up to argon.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.550
So if we write the electron
configuration for sodium,

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:46.140
which you can try later --
hopefully you would all get it

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:49.250
correctly -- you see that this
is the electron configuration

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:54.060
here, 1 s 2, 2 s 2, 2 p 6, and
now we're going into that

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:57.750
third shell, 3 s 1.

00:40:57.750 --> 00:41:00.150
And I want to point out the
difference between core

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:02.440
electrons and valence
electrons here.

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:05.450
If we look at this
configuration, what we say is

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:09.080
all of the electrons in these
inner shells are what we call

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.750
core electrons.

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:14.020
The core electrons tend not to
be involved in much chemistry

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.980
in bonding or in reactions.

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:19.190
They're very deep and held very
tightly to the nucleus,

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:22.240
so we can often lump them
together, and instead of

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:25.110
writing them all out separately,
we can just write

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:28.440
the equivalent noble gas that
has that configuration.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.740
So, for example, for sodium, we
can instead write neon and

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:33.690
then 3 s 1.

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:36.980
So the 3 s 1, or any of the
other electrons that are in

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:39.890
the outer-most shell, those are
what we call our valence

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:43.300
electrons, and those are where
all the excitement happens.

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:45.220
That's what we see are
involved in bonding.

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:47.270
It makes sense, right, because
they're the furthest away from

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:50.520
the nucleus, they're the ones
that are most willing to be

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:54.160
involved in some chemistry or in
some bonding, or those are

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.500
the orbitals that are most
likely to accept an electron

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:59.130
from another atom,
for example.

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:01.660
So the valence electrons, those
are the exciting ones.

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:04.020
We want to make sure we
have a full picture of

00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:05.390
what's going on there.

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:08.830
So, no matter whether or not
you write out the full form

00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:11.630
here, or the noble gas
configuration where you write

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:14.950
ne first or whatever the
corresponding noble gas is to

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:17.660
the core electrons, we always
write out the valence

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:18.860
electrons here.

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:23.310
So for sodium, again, we can
write n e and then 3 s 1.

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:26.710
We can go all the way down,
magnesium, aluminum, all the

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:30.980
way to this noble gas, argon,
which would be n e and then 3

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:35.060
s 2, 3 p 6.

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:37.990
Now we can think about the
fourth period, and the fourth

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:41.130
period is where we start to run
into some exceptions, so

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:43.390
this is where things get a teeny
bit more complicated,

00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:46.010
but you just need to remember
the exceptions and then you

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:49.240
should be OK, no matter what
you're asked to write.

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:52.910
So for the fourth period, now
we're into the 4 s 1 for

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:54.070
potassium here.

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:58.370
And what we notice when we get
to the third element in and

00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:02.450
the fourth period is that we go
4 s 2 and then we're back

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:03.700
to the 3 d's.

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:07.160
So if you look at the energy
diagram, what we see is that

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:10.890
the 4 s orbitals are actually
just a teeny bit lower in

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:14.330
energy -- they're just ever so
slightly lower in energy than

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:15.830
the 3 d orbitals.

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:18.760
You can see that as you fill up
your periodic table, it's

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:19.800
very clear.

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:22.910
But also we'll tell you a
pneumonic device to keep that

00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:24.870
in mind, so you always remember
and get the orbital

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:26.100
energy straight.

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:28.960
But it just turns out that the
4 s is so low in energy that

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:32.060
it actually surpasses the 3 d,
because we know the 3 d is

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:35.200
going to be pretty high in terms
of the three shell, and

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:37.510
the 4 s is going to be the
lowest in terms of the 4

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:40.590
shell, and it turns out that
we need to fill up the 4 s

00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:42.780
before we fill in the 3 d.

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:46.690
And we can do that just going
along, 3 d 1, 2 3, and the

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:49.700
problem comes when we get to
chromium here, which is

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:53.030
instead of what we would expect,
we might expect to see

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:55.980
4 s 2, 3 d 4.

00:43:55.980 --> 00:44:01.750
What we see is that instead
it's 4 s 1, and 3 d 5.

00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:03.610
So this is the first exception
that you need

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:05.720
to the Aufbau principle.

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.670
The reason this an exception is
because it turns out that

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:11.680
half filled d orbitals
are more stable than

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:13.550
we could even predict.

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:16.250
You wouldn't be expected to be
able to guess that this would

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:19.810
happen, because using any kind
of simple theory, we would, in

00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:22.680
fact, predict that this would
not be the case, but what we

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:25.920
find experimentally is that it's
more stable to have half

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:32.170
filled d orbital than to have
a 4 s 2, and a 3 d 4.

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:34.250
So you're going to need to
remember, so this is an

00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:36.070
exception, you have
to memorize.

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:39.030
Another exception in the fourth
period is in copper

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:43.550
here, we see that again, we have
4 s 1 instead of 4 s 2.

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:49.340
This is 4 s 1, 3 d 10, we might
expect 4 s 2, 3 d 9, but

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:52.280
again, this exception comes
out of experimental

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:56.290
observation, which is the fact
that full d orbitals also are

00:44:56.290 --> 00:45:00.160
lower in energy then we could
theoretically predict using

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:01.830
simple calculations.

00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:04.930
So again, you need to memorize
these two exceptions, and the

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:09.180
exception in general is that
filled d 10, or half-filled d

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:13.690
5 orbitals are lower in energy
than would be expected, so we

00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:16.940
got this flip-flip where if we
can get to that half filled

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:20.280
orbital by only removing one s
electron, then we're going to

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:22.200
do it, and the same with
the filled d orbital.

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:27.280
And actually, when we get to
the fifth period of the

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:30.500
periodic table, that again takes
place, so when you get

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:34.250
to a half filled, or a filled
d orbital, again you want to

00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:36.920
do it, so those exceptions would
be with molybdenum and

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:40.220
silver would be the
corresponding elements in the

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:42.780
fifth period where you're going
to see the same case

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:46.310
here where it's lower in energy
to have the half filled

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:49.490
or the filled d orbitals.

00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:52.190
So here's the pneumonic I
mentioned for writing the

00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:54.450
electron configuration and
getting those orbital energies

00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:55.540
in the right order.

00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:58.540
All you do is just write out
all the orbitals, the 1 s,

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:02.120
then the 2 s 2 p 3, 3 s 3 p d,
just write them in a straight

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:05.760
line like this, and then if you
draw diagonals down them,

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.770
what you'll get is the
correct order in

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:09.770
terms of orbital energies.

00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:12.810
So if we go down the diagonal,
we start with 1 s, then we get

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:17.570
2 s, then 2 p and 3 s, then 3
p, and 4 s, and then that's

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:20.300
how we see here that 4 s is
actually lower in energy than

00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:23.920
3 d, then 4 p, 5 s and so on.

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:26.570
So if you want to on an exam,
you can just write this down

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:29.520
quickly at the beginning and
refer to it as you're filling

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.970
up your electron configurations,
but also if

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:34.550
you look at the periodic table
it's very clear as you try to

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:38.280
fill it up that way that the
same order comes out of that.

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:40.710
So, whichever works best for
you can do in terms of

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:44.300
figuring out electron
configurations.

00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:47.130
So the last thing I want to
mention today is how we can

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:50.030
think about electron
configurations for ions.

00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:52.170
It turns out that it's going to
be a little bit different

00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:54.150
when we're talking about
positive ions here.

00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:57.320
We need to change our
rules just slightly.

00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:01.210
So what we know is that these
3 d orbitals are higher in

00:47:01.210 --> 00:47:03.970
energy than 4 s orbitals, so
I've written the energy of the

00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:07.960
orbital here for potassium
and for calcium.

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:12.730
But what happens is that once a
d orbital is filled, I said

00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:15.480
the two are very close in
energy, and once a d orbital

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:18.620
is filled, it actually drops to
become lower in energy than

00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:20.170
the 4 s orbital.

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:24.360
So once we move past, we fill
the 4 s first, but once we

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.720
fill in the d orbital,
now that's going

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:28.440
to be lower in energy.

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:30.620
So that doesn't make a
difference for us when we're

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:34.650
talking about neutral atoms,
because we would fill up the 4

00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:37.860
s first, because that's lower
in energy until we fill it,

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:39.520
and then we just keep going
with the d orbitals.

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:42.740
So, for example, if we needed
to figure out the electron

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:46.810
configuration for titanium, it
would just be argon then 4 s

00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:52.280
2, and then we would
fill in the 3 d 2.

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:55.110
So, actually we don't have to
worry about this fact any time

00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:56.950
we're dealing with neutrals.

00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:59.820
The problem comes when instead
we're dealing with ions.

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:02.770
So what I want to point out is
what we said now is that the 3

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:05.240
d 2 is actually lower in energy,
so if we were to

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:08.770
rewrite this in terms of what
the actual energy order is, we

00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:11.940
should instead write
it 3 d 2, 4 s 2.

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:14.170
So you might ask in terms of
when you're writing electron

00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:16.400
configurations, which way
should you write it.

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.380
And we'll absolutely
accept both answers

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:19.580
for a neutral atom.

00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:20.480
They're both correct.

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:24.080
In one case you decided to order
in terms of energy and

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:27.080
in one case you decided
to order in terms of

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:28.280
how it fills up.

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:32.480
I don't care how you do it on
exams or on problem sets, but

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:36.680
you do need to be aware that the
3 d once filled is lower

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:40.580
in energy than the 4 s, and
the reason you need to be

00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:43.580
aware of that is if you're
asked for the electron

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:45.380
configuration now of
the titanium ion.

00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:48.380
So, let's say we're asked
for the plus two ion.

00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:51.680
So a plus two ion means that
we're removing two electrons

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:54.680
from the atom and the electrons
that we're going to

00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:57.680
remove are always going to be
the highest energy electrons.

00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:00.980
So it's good to write it like
this because this illustrates

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:04.880
the fact that in fact the 4 s
electrons are the ones that

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:06.080
are higher in energy.

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.380
So the correct answer for
titanium plus two is going to

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:13.280
be argon 3 d 2, whereas if we
did not rearrange our order

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:17.180
here we might have been tempted
to write as 4 s 2 so

00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:20.480
keep that in mind when you're
doing the positive ions of

00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.880
corresponding atoms. Alright,
so we'll pick up with

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.080
photoelectron spectroscopy
on Wednesday.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:26.230
Have a great weekend.
