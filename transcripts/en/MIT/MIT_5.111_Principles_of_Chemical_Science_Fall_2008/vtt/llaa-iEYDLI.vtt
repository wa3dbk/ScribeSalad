00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:23.575
PROFESSOR: -- that this is not
a quick clicker question, so

00:00:23.575 --> 00:00:26.090
you actually need to maybe write
something down to figure

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.740
out the answer.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.520
So if you haven't clicked in
yet, or if you want to change

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.050
your answer, keep in mind that
you might need to jot down,

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.420
for example, a Lewis structure
before you can answer this

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:59.900
question.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.480
-- and get in your final answer

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.030
to the clicker question.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.970
For those of you just walking
in now, you might not have a

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.770
chance to get all of the thought
process that you need

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.260
in on this clicker question,
because it is based on a Lewis

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.700
structure, so we will
go over it.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.880
But for those of you that have
been here for 30 seconds or

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.480
longer, see if you can get
the right answer in here.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.450
All right, so OK, it looks
like we have a very mixed

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.380
response in terms of
the answer to the

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.030
clicker question today.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.240
Raise your hand if you didn't
have time to figure out the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.360
Lewis structure.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.740
OK, so that accounts
for some of you.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.160
Let's go over the correct
answer this question.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.000
So, who got the right answer --

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.890
31% of us.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.810
This is not the kind of
percentages we're looking for,

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.260
so let's go over this.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.150
In class on Monday, we did go
over the geometries, and the

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.530
geometries themselves are very
straightforward, once you know

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.400
what the Lewis structure is, but
remember, you can't just

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.300
always look at a molecule
and automatically

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.060
know the Lewis structure.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.960
We actually need to think about
those valence electrons.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.500
So, here we're dealing with
selenium hydride, so s e h 2.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.020
I told you that there's 6
valence electrons in selenium,

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.310
so we have 6 there, plus 1
for each of the hydrogen.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.420
So what we should have is
8 valence electrons

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.980
in our Lewis structure.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.050
How many electrons do we need
to have full valence shells?

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.470
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.010
PROFESSOR: 12, that's right.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.120
We need 8 plus 4 is 12
for full shells.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:41.300
That means that we need 12
minus 8, or 4 bonding

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.870
electrons in our structure.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.990
So I tried to give you one that
you could draw pretty

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.170
quickly, it just has
hydrogens in It.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.550
So we have s e h 2.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.600
We can do our 4 bonding
electrons.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.660
How many valence electrons
do we have left?

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.500
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.220
PROFESSOR: 4, that's right.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.740
So, we need to fill our octet
for selenium, so 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.520
So, this is our Lewis structure
here, hopefully you

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.600
can see why it's not linear.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.570
If it were linear, which 32% of
you seem have thought, that

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.150
would have meant that our Lewis
structure had no lone

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.290
pairs in it, right, and
that's not the case.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.330
We have two lone pairs, so if
we thought about what the

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.040
bonds were everywhere,
it would be 109 .

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.540
5, but it's bent because we're
only looking at the bonds,

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.930
we're not counting the Lewis
structures in naming our

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.450
geometry, but they do
affect the angles.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.600
And it turns out that it's
actually less than 109 .

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.540
5, because those lone pairs
are pushing the bonds even

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.700
further away.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.590
So, does this make sense to
everyone if you think

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.450
about it this way?

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.310
Pretty much, okay.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.570
So, we'll try another clicker
question like this later.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.140
Some of these questions that
look very straightforward just

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.580
naming the geometry, you have
to remember to do the first

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.580
step before you jump in and
go ahead with a naming.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.770
So you'll got plenty of practice
with this on your

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.340
problem-set if you
haven't already.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.050
All right.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.030
So before we start in with
today's notes, I do want to

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.690
mention that this morning
the Nobel Prize in

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.420
chemistry was announced.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.200
This is an exciting week in
science in general because we

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.290
got to hear another
Nobel Prize every

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.300
morning pretty much.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.910
So, let's settle down for a
second and start listening.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:26.230
All right.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.400
So, today we're going to be
talking about molecular

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.775
orbital theory, but first I
wanted to just mention, in

00:04:31.775 --> 00:04:34.810
case some of you didn't hear
what the Nobel Prize was this

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.230
morning, and this was in
chemistry, it went to three

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.430
different chemists.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:47.600
Osamu Shimomura, who's a
Japanese chemist, and then

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.970
Martin Chalfi who's at Columbia,
and Robert Chen

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.880
who's at U. C. San Diego.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.670
The three of these chemists
split the Nobel Prize this

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.490
morning for their discovery
and/or their application of

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.840
using green fluorescent
protein, which

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.090
is also called GFP.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.970
How many of you have heard
of GFP before?

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:06.460
Oh, that's so great.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.070
OK.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.660
Many of you have heard of GFP.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.850
For some of you that haven't
I'll just say that it's a

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.130
protein, it's 238 amino acids,
which means that it's about

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.940
1,000, actually more than 1,000
atoms in size, and this

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.600
protein is fluorescent.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.960
The protein was first discovered
and first isolated

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.760
from this jellyfish here.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.890
This was done by Shimomura,
and he did this in

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.090
the 60's and 70's.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.340
He actually recognized and, of
course, many people recognized

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.080
that this jellyfish was
fluorescent, and he isolated

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.020
the actual protein, and
determined and proved that

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.620
this protein was sufficient to
cause this fluorescence.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.140
So, in terms of thinking about
applications of why it's so

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.360
exciting that you have this
fluorescent protein, other

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.670
than it's always really fun
to look at things that are

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.810
fluorescent, we can think about
in terms of biology why

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.080
it's so exciting, you can
actually tag this protein to

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.850
any other protein that you're
studying and now you have a

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.640
visual handle on what's
going on.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.340
So, for example, if you were
interested in some protein

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.150
involved in cancer, you
could tag it with GFP.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.240
You could watch where it
localizes in the cell, there

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.440
are fluorescent assays you could
use to determine what

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.400
other proteins it
interacts with.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.190
You could see, for example,
when it's expressed in a

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.880
cancer cell, and where
it's expressed.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.900
There are all sorts of things
you can do once you can

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.200
visualize something
with fluorescence.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.510
The reason it is so exciting
that it's a protein, and it's

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.060
a protein, this is the structure
here, it's a ribbon

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.650
structure so you can kind of see
what it looks like, it's

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.150
made up of all natural
amino acids.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.840
So this means we can code for
it in DNA, you don't have to

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.100
worry how am I going to
get into the cell.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.370
All you have to do is mutate
the DNA, which is very

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.760
straightforward to do in
molecular biology, and now you

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.070
can tag absolutely any protein
that you're interested in.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.150
So, as I said, this was first
discovered and isolated from

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.890
the jellyfish.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.750
This was done by Shimomura --
that was kind of the first

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.550
step in this process of having
it become such a useful tool.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.530
And then, many years later,
not until 1994 did Martin

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.810
Chalfi, at Columbia, show that
yes, I can, in fact, take the

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.260
DNA and put it into a different
organism, and he put

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.390
it into e coli, a bacteria.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.200
And what he could show was that
it could be expressed,

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.560
this is a picture from his 1994
science paper, in that e

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.160
coli, and it is going
to fluoresce green.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.510
Now, the first application
tends to not be quite as

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.060
exciting as, for example, all
the other organisms people

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.820
have put it in since then --
you can have flies, you see

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.830
transgenic mice that are glowing
green with this GFP.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.670
Of course, that's not the useful
application for it,

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.610
it's more of a proof of
principle, but it does show

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:42.240
you that you can put it in for
studies in any organisms.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.160
And the field was really
pushed forward by the

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.550
discoveries of Robert Chen at UC
San Diego, and what he did

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:53.370
was he actually figured out how
it was that this protein

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.030
fluoresced, what caused the
actual fluorescence.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:00.050
And once he did that, both he
and many other scientists,

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.250
could then, once they understood
what caused the

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.450
fluorescence, make little
changes to the actual protein,

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.300
and tune what the properties
of that

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.890
fluorescent protein were.

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:11.630
So now, for example, there are
a whole range, just a whole

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:14.050
rainbow of fluorescent proteins
that can be used.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:17.500
And I'm sure you can imagine
that if you want to label onw

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.250
protein green and one red and
one yellow, now you can start

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.630
looking at really complex
biological processes.

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.910
So, it's pretty rare that
chemistry makes

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:26.630
the every day news.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.470
So hopefully you'll all look
in the normal papers today,

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:31.550
not just the scientific
journals, and get to read

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:32.570
something about chemistry.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.430
It's always fun to see how its
described in The New York

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:37.540
Times or in The Boston Globe.

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.520
The other thing I wanted to
mention and I'm not sure if

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.020
the exhibit's still there.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.340
But there was an exhibit of
jellyfish, I know at least

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.760
until last year, at the Boston
Museum of Science, and all of

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.370
you guys can get
in there free.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.400
And it's neat to see the glowing
jellyfish and think

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.020
about the fluorescent protein
that's in them.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.610
So, I encourage you to do that
the next time you have some

00:08:55.610 --> 00:09:00.940
free time on your hands, maybe
at IAP or some time like that.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.680
All right, so let's move
into today's notes.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.480
Today we're talking about
molecular orbital theory.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.510
This is a shift, this is a new
topic that we're starting.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:13.990
So far we've exclusively been
using Lewis structures any

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:17.170
time we've tried to describe
bonding within molecules.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.880
Lewis structures are really
useful, we use them all the

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.080
time in chemistry.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.550
And they're useful because,
first of all, they're easy to

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:27.320
depict, they're easy to draw --
relatively easy once we get

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.550
all the rules down.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.730
And also they're accurate
over 90% of the time.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:34.570
But they're not accurate all the
time in predicting bonding

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:37.970
within molecules, and the reason
for this is because

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:39.710
Lewis structures are
not, in fact,

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.720
based on quantum mechanics.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.410
So, molecular orbital theory, on
the other hand, is based on

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:46.640
quantum mechanics.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.760
And specifically, MO theory
is the quantum mechanical

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.780
description of wave functions
within molecules.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.280
So, saying wave functions within
molecules might sound a

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.480
little confusing, but remember
we spent a lot of time talking

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.040
about wave functions within
atoms, and we know how to

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.320
describe that, we know that a
wave function just means an

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.000
atomic orbital.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.210
It's the same thing with
molecules -- a molecular wave

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.370
function just means a
molecular orbital.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.600
So, we'll start today talking
about the two kinds of

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.910
molecular orbitals, we can
talk about bonding or

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:17.580
anti-bonding orbitals.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.250
Then we're going to actually
use MO theory to describe

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.830
bonding within these molecules,
and we'll start

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.740
with homonuclear diatomic
molecules.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:30.070
Diatomic mean it's di atomic,
it's made up of two atoms, and

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:33.270
homonuclear means that those two
are the same atoms. Then

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:35.760
at the end, we'll look at an
example with a heteronuclear

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.330
diatomic molecules.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.480
So, again, the same thing, but
now two different atoms.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.560
So, I will point out, in terms
of MO theory, because it

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.330
rigorously does take into
account quantum mechanics, it

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.650
starts to become complicated
once we go

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:50.830
beyond diatomic molecules.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.930
So we're going to limit in our
discussion in 511-1 for

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.760
molecular orbital theory
to diatomic molecules.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.220
However, on Friday we will use a
different approach so we can

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.360
talk about bonding within atoms
that have more than two

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.920
atoms, molecules with
more than two atoms.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.300
All right, so one thing that I
first want to point out about

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.730
MO theory that is a big
difference from Lewis

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:15.350
structures, is that in MO theory
valence electrons are

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.710
de-localized over the
entire molecule.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:21.150
So, when we talked about Lewis
structures, we actually

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:24.330
assigned electrons to individual
atoms or to

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.670
individual bonds.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.280
Whereas in molecular orbital
theory, what I'm telling you

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.060
is instead we understand that
the electrons are spread all

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.780
over the molecule, they're not
just associated with a single

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.260
atom or a single bond.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.270
So specifically, what we do
associate them instead is

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:43.970
within molecular orbitals, and
what we say is that they can

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:45.770
be either in bonding or
anti-bonding orbitals.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:49.210
And again, I want to point out
that a molecular orbital, we

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.740
can also call that
a wave function,

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:51.920
they're the same thing.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.370
And these orbitals arise from
the combination of individual

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:55.910
atomic orbital.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:59.310
So, if we have two atomic
orbitals coming together from

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:02.230
two different atoms and they
combine, what we end up

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.060
forming is a molecular
orbital.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.460
The reason that we can talk
about this is remember that

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.490
we're talking about wave
functions, we're talking about

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:11.420
waves, so we can have
constructive interference in

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:16.300
which two different orbitals can
constructively interfere,

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.630
we can also have destructive
interference.

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.970
So, we'll start by taking
a look at constructive

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:24.030
interference, and another way to
explain this is just to say

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.540
again, molecular orbitals
are a linear

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.120
combination of atomic orbitals.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.970
So, let's start our discussion
of a bonding orbital.

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.730
Our simplest case that we can
look at would be if we had two

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:36.620
1 s orbitals coming together.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.160
So let's say, for example,
in a hydrogen atom.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.800
So in hydrogen atom a, I'll
depict that here where the

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.500
nucleus is this dot, and then
the circle is what I'm

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.070
depicting as the
wave function.

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:51.740
It makes sense to draw the wave
function as a circle,

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.440
because we do know
that 1 s orbitals

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.220
are spherically symmetric.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:58.180
So, we can say that a circle is
a good approximation for a

00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.810
1 s wave function.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:02.950
Similarly, with the second
hydrogen atom, we've got the

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:06.710
nucleus in the middle, and the 1
s b wave function around it.

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:08.490
So these are atomic orbitals.

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.040
What we're going to do in
forming a molecule is just

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:15.650
bring these two orbitals close
together such that now we have

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:18.920
their nucleus, the two nuclei,
at a distance apart that's

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.360
equal to the bond length.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.970
And what we end up forming is
a molecular orbital, because

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:27.610
as we bring these two atomic
orbitals close together, the

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:30.500
part between them, that wave
function, constructively

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.730
interferes such that in our
molecular orbital, we actually

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:39.440
have a lot of wave function
in between the two nuclei.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.200
So we can go ahead and name our
molecular orbital, just

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.270
like we know how to name
our atomic orbitals.

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.710
And I'm going to name
this sigma 1 s.

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.530
The 1 s just comes from the
fact that the molecular

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:53.920
orbital is a combination of
two 1 s atomic orbitals.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.450
And the sigma tells us something
about the symmetry

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:59.140
of this molecular orbital,
specifically that it's

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.770
cylindrically symmetric
about the bond axis.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:05.340
So that is the bond axis -- it's
just the axis between the

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.470
two nuclei.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.340
Sometimes it's also called
the internuclear axis.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.590
So any time you have two atoms
bonding, the bond axis is just

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:15.550
the axis that they're
bonding along.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.520
Another thing I want to point
out about every sigma orbital

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.925
that you see, and it will make
more sense when we contrast it

00:14:21.925 --> 00:14:23.050
with pi orbitals later.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:26.610
But in sigma orbitals, you have
no nodal planes along the

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:29.480
bond axis, so if we had a nodal
plane here, we'd see an

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.820
area where the wave function
was equal to zero.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:32.780
We don't see that.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.110
It will make more sense when we
can show you one where it

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:36.400
does have that area.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.210
But keep in mind sigma orbitals
have no nodal planes

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:41.440
along the bond axis.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.160
All right.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.250
So, let's look at this in
another way, sometimes it's

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.040
hard to picture these
waves combining.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.200
So let's think of them a little
bit more by graphing

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.210
the amplitude of the wave, and
seeing how we can have this

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:54.710
constructive interference.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:57.550
So again, if we think of a graph
of the wave function, we

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:01.180
had the wave function is at
its highest amplitude when

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.320
it's lined up with the nucleus,
and then as we got

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.300
further away from the nucleus,
the amplitude of the wave

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:11.700
function ends up tapering off
until -- it never hits zero

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.340
exactly, but it goes
down very low.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:18.030
So we can draw that for 1 s a,
we can also draw it for 1 s b,

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.250
and what I'm saying for the
molecular wave function is

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:22.820
that we have the interference
between the two, and we have a

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.870
constructive interference, so
we end up adding these two

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:27.940
wave functions together.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.280
So, we're talking about wave
functions and we know that

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:35.140
means orbitals, but this is --
probably the better way to

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:36.460
think about is the physical

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.820
interpretation of the wave function.

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.720
So what is the wave function
squared going to be equal to?

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.342
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:42.342 --> 00:15:46.260
PROFESSOR: Probability
density, yes.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.010
Probability density of finding
an electron within that

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:52.250
molecule in some given volume.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.630
So let's think about that
instead, let's think about

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:55.910
probability density.

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.770
So if we're talking about
probability density that's the

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:00.450
wave function squared.

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:03.290
But now we're talking not about
an atomic wave function,

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.500
we're talking about a molecular
wave function.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.650
So to talk about it's squared,
we're going to say it's sigma

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.580
1 s squared.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.890
Oh, and actually before you skip
your page in the notes, I

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:17.090
realized I should write out for
you what the addition is

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:18.190
to start with.

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:23.350
So, when we're combining two
waves, what we have is 1 s a

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:26.810
that we're adding together
with 1 s for

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:29.150
b, the second atom.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:32.450
And what we end up for
our molecular wave

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.740
function is sigma 1 s.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:38.020
So this is what we call
our molecular orbital.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.780
All right, so that will now
allow you to turn the page, I

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.880
think, and we can take a look
at the probability.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.500
So the probability again,
that's just the orbital

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.870
squared, the wave function
squared.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:54.680
So when we write that out, we
just write sigma 1 s squared,

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.350
or we can break it up into its
individual parts, there's no

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.080
reason we can't do
that as well.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:04.320
So just to say that it's 1 s
squared plus 1 s b, all of

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.030
that together squared.

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.910
So if we write out every term
individually, what we end up

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:12.940
with is essentially just the
probability density for the

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.740
first atom, then the probability
density for the

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:19.900
second atom, and then we have
this last term here, and this

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:23.090
is what ends up being the
interference term.

00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:25.990
So in this case where we're
adding it together, this is

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:27.970
going to be constructive
interference.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:31.250
So in this case the cross term
represents constructive

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:37.250
interference between the two
1 s atomic wave functions.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:38.580
And this again is what
we're going to

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.710
call a bonding orbital.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:44.550
So it can often make a lot more
sense if we think about

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:45.900
things in terms of energy.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.010
We've been discussing energy
diagrams a lot in this class,

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:51.300
it's a very good way to
visualize exactly

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.510
what's going on.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:55.090
So, let's think of the energy
of interaction when we're

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:58.800
comparing atomic orbitals to
molecular bonding orbitals.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.510
And what you find is when you
have a bonding orbital, the

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:05.480
energy decreases compared
to the atomic orbitals.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.890
So you can see here in this
slide we have the atomic

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:12.370
orbitals for the two hydrogen
atoms, each of them have one

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:16.730
electron in them, hydrogen has
one electron in a 1 s orbital.

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:18.650
So, if we look at the molecular
orbital, that's

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:22.050
actually going to be lower in
energy than either of the two

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:23.080
atomic orbitals.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.160
So it's going to be favorable
for the electrons instead to

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.690
go to that lower energy
state and be within

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:31.170
the molecular orbital.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:35.700
So, let's draw in our electrons
there, so we have

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:40.080
our two electrons now in
the molecular orbital.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.180
So any time that you're drawing
these molecular

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.070
orbital diagrams, you want to
keep in mind that the number

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:48.090
of electrons that you have in
atomic orbitals, you need to

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:49.620
add those together
and put that many

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.640
electrons into your molecule.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.890
Right, we had one from each
atom, so that means we need a

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:57.290
total of two in our
molecular orbital.

00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.740
And what you can see directly
from looking at this energy

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.780
level diagram, is that the
molecule that we have is now

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.650
more stable in the individual
atoms. That makes sense

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.710
because we're lower in energy,
the electrons are

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.810
now lower in energy.

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:13.450
So that's the idea of a bonding
molecular orbital.

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:16.100
Since we're talking about wave
functions, since we're talking

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.110
about the properties of waves,
we don't only have

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:21.780
constructive interference, we
can also imagine a case where

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:24.130
we would have destructive
interference.

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:27.090
Just like we see destructive
interference with water waves

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:29.410
or with light waves, we can
also see destructive

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:30.870
interference with orbitals.

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:33.420
So, let's think about what
that would look like.

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:37.640
So in this case we would have
1 s a and 1 s b, and instead

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:41.380
we would subtract one from the
other, and what we would see

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:44.850
is that instead of having
additional, more wave function

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.370
in the middle here, we've
actually cancelled out the

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:50.180
wave function and we
end up with a node.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:53.100
So we can also name this
orbital, and this orbital

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.320
we're going to call
sigma 1 s star.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:00.210
So if we name this orbital,
this is an anti-bonding

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:00.880
molecular orbital.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.160
So we had bonding and now
we're talking about

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.520
anti-bonding.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:08.360
When we talk about anti-bonding,
essentially

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:14.570
we're taking 1 s a and now we're
subtracting 1 s b, and

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:18.520
what we end up with again is
sigma 1 s, and the important

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.400
thing to remember is to
write this star here.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.110
So any time you see a
star that means an

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:27.700
anti-bonding orbital.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.600
Again we can look at this in
terms of thinking about a

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.510
picture this way, in terms of
drawing the wave function out

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:34.730
on an axis.

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:38.270
So we have 1 s a, and we're
drawing this as having a

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:41.300
positive amplitude, but since
we have destructive

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:45.030
interference we're going to
draw 1 s b as having the

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:47.580
opposite sign, so we
have a plus and a

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.380
minus in terms of signs.

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.780
So that should make it very easy
to picture that this is

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.440
being cancelled out
in the middle.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:57.600
If we overlay what the actual
molecular orbital is on top of

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.490
it, what you see is that in
the center you end up

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:03.650
cancelling out the wave
function entirely.

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:08.480
So this is the 1 s star, sigma 1
s star orbital, and what you

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:12.390
have in the center here is a
node, right in the center

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:15.060
between the two nuclei.

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:17.670
So again if we look at this
in terms of its physical

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:21.170
interpretation or probability
density, what we need to do is

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:22.960
square the wave function.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:27.970
So if we square sigma 1 s star,
we flip the amplitude so

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:31.280
it's all positive now, but again
we still have this node

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.400
right in the middle.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.680
So if we talk about the
probability density and we

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:38.630
write that in, it's going to be
sigma 1 s star squared, so

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:42.730
now we're talking about
1 s a minus 1 s b, all

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:44.670
of that being squared.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:47.480
And again, if we write out what
all the terms are, we

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:52.270
again have 1 s a squared plus
1 s b squared, but now what

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.510
we're doing is we're actually
subtracting the

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:56.200
interference term.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.110
So if we're subtracting the
interference term, what we

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:04.860
have here now is destructive
interference.

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.900
So let's think about the energy
of interaction here.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:11.020
When we were talking about
constructive interference, we

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:14.350
had more electron density
in between the 2 nuclei.

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:17.810
So that lowered the energy
of the molecular orbital.

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:20.360
So, bonding orbitals
are down here.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.910
But when we think about where
anti-bonding orbitals should

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:25.820
be, it should be higher
in energy.

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:29.070
It's increased compared to
the atomic orbitals.

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:33.240
So we would label our
anti-bonding orbital higher in

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:37.110
energy than our 1 s
atomic orbitals.

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:39.190
So, let's think a little bit
about what this means.

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:42.380
First of all, again to repeat,
any time we see the star,

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:46.240
sigma 1 s star, that's an
anti-bonding orbital.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.610
When we talk about that,
basically what we're saying,

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:51.440
and you can see that because of
that negative interference,

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:55.490
we actually have less electron
density between the nuclei

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:58.470
than we did when they were two
separate atoms. So you can see

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:01.670
that this is non-bonding,
this is even worse than

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:03.550
non-bonding, it's anti-bonding,
because we're

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:06.520
actually getting rid of electron
density between the

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.200
two nuclei.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.870
And we know that it's electron
density between the nuclei

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:13.290
that holds two atoms
together in a bond.

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:15.770
So what I want to point out is
that it creates an effect that

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:18.080
is exactly opposite of a bond.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.590
You might have thought before
we started talking about

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:23.370
molecular orbital theory that
non-bonding was the opposite

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:26.840
of bonding, it's not,
anti-bonding is the opposite

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:29.960
of bonding, and anti-bonding
is not non-bonding.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.680
We can see that if we just look
at this picture here.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.170
Here is bonding, and here
is non-bonding.

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:40.140
Anti-bonding is even higher in
energy than non-bonding.

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:43.260
And the other thing to point out
is that the energy that an

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:47.650
anti-bonding orbital is raised
by, is the same amount as a

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:49.640
bonding orbital is lowered by.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.990
So any time I draw these
molecular orbitals, I do my

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:55.460
best, and I'm not always
perfect, yet trying to make

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:59.110
this energy different exactly
the same for the anti-bonding

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:01.220
orbital being raised,
versus the bonding

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.560
orbital being lowered.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:07.730
So those should be raised and
lowered by the same energy.

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:09.995
So now let's take a look
at some of -- is there

00:24:09.995 --> 00:24:16.130
a question up there?

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:17.930
STUDENT: Why would two atoms
decide to [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:18.100
PROFESSOR: Well, they
don't want to.

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:19.860
It's a higher energy
situation.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.930
So we'll start to look at
molecules and we'll see if we

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:27.180
take two atoms and we fill in
our molecular orbital and it

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.750
turns out that they have more
anti-bonding orbitals than

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:33.610
bonding, that's -- a diatomic
molecule we'll never see.

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:37.060
So it helps us predict, will we
see this, for example, h 2,

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:40.830
which we're going to be about to
do, we'll see is stabilized

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.850
because it has more bonding
than anti-bonding.

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:44.730
So we'll predict, yes,
there's a bond here.

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:45.850
That's a really good question.

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:51.480
So, let's go ahead and do this
and take a look at some of the

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.640
actual atoms that we can
think about and think

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.280
about them in molecules.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.900
So our simplest case that we
started talking about was

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:00.190
molecular hydrogen.

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:03.230
I want to finish this discussion
by including the

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:05.880
anti-bonding orbital, and this
is a tip for you when you're

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:09.890
drawing your molecular orbital
diagrams, any time you draw a

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:12.080
bonding orbital, there is
also an anti-bonding

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.490
orbital that exists.

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:15.700
It might not have any electrons
in it, but it still

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:18.960
exists, so you need to draw
these into your molecular

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.020
orbital diagram.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.330
So I wanted to make sure you
have a complete set for

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:23.740
hydrogen in your notes.

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:24.940
So let's take a look at this.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:29.440
Hydrogen, we can first draw
in our atomic electrons.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.850
So there's one electron
in each hydrogen atom.

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:36.030
And then this means we'll have
a total of two electrons in

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:39.910
our hydrogen molecule, so we
can fill both of those into

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:43.260
the sigma 1 s orbital,
the bonding orbital.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:46.460
We don't have to put anything
into the anti-bonding orbital,

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:47.330
so that's great.

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:51.180
What we've seen is we have a net
lowering of energy of the

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:56.330
molecule versus the
individual atoms.

00:25:56.330 --> 00:26:00.090
So let's draw the electron
configuration of hydrogen, the

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:02.480
molecule, molecular hydrogen.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.200
What you saw, what we've done
a lot of is drawing the

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.520
electron configurations for
different atoms, we can do the

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.430
same thing for a molecule.

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:13.850
So, if we take h 2, and we
want to draw the electron

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:15.900
configuration, it's
very short.

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:20.500
All it is sigma 1 s, and then
we have two electrons in it,

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.890
so it's sigma 1 s squared.

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:25.990
So this is our electron
configuration.

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:27.620
Let's take a look at
another example.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:30.700
Let's draw the molecular
diagram for h e 2 now.

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:35.880
So again, we can fill in our
atomic orbitals here, there's

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.490
going to be two electrons in
each of our atomic orbitals.

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:42.240
So now let's go ahead and fill
in our molecular orbitals.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.950
We need to fill in a total
of four electrons.

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:49.280
So we have two electrons in
our bonding orbital, but

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:53.130
because we use the same rules to
fill up molecular orbitals

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:56.810
as we do atomic orbitals, so the
Pauli exclusion principle

00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:58.760
tells us we can't have more
than two electrons per

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.910
orbital, so we have
to go up to our

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:02.870
anti-bonding orbital here.

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:06.130
So this means that we have two
of the electrons are lowered

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:09.690
in energy, but two are
raised in energy.

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:12.470
So would this be a stabilized
molecule then?

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:14.520
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:15.320
PROFESSOR: No.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:18.050
So, compared to the atoms, it
should be somewhat the same

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:20.940
energy, we shouldn't get any
extra stabilization from

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:21.730
forming the molecule.

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:25.100
So lets go ahead and write
what the electron

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:31.680
configuration would
be of h e 2.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.660
And again, we're just filling in
the different orbitals, so

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:39.060
we have sigma 1 s, that's going
to be squared, and now

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:44.730
we have sigma 1 s
star squared.

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:48.440
So we can compare the two
electron configurations, and

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:52.220
we can actually think about --
what we figure out from them,

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:55.320
we see that two are lowered in
energy, two electrons are

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.930
raised in energy, so we have no
net gain or no net loss in

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:01.830
energy for h e 2.

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:04.810
And there's actually a way that
we can make predictions

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:07.630
here, and what I'll tell you
is molecular orbital theory

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:10.970
predicts that h e 2 does not
exist because it's not

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:14.830
stabilized in terms of
forming the molecule.

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:17.070
The way that we can figure this
out is using something

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:21.260
called bond order, and bond
order is equal to 1/2 times

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:23.990
the number of bonding electrons,
minus the number of

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:25.550
anti-bonding electrons.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:28.350
And the bond order you get out
will either be, for example,

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:31.165
zero, which would mean that you
have no bond, or you could

00:28:31.165 --> 00:28:33.330
have 1, a single bond, 1 .

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:37.490
5, a 1 and 1/2 bond, 2, a
double bond, and so on.

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:42.130
So let's figure out the bond
order for our two molecules

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:45.670
here that we figured out the
electron configuration for.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:47.220
So I guess we'll start
with helium 2.

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:53.900
So the bond order is going to
be equal to 1/2, and then it

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:56.400
will be 2 minus 2.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:00.250
So our bond order for h e 2
is going to be equal to 0.

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:04.330
So it has a 0 bond, there's
no bond in h e 2.

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:06.120
Let's look for hydrogen.

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:14.260
For hydrogen our bond order is
going to equal 1/2, 2 minus 0.

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:16.850
So we would predict
a bond order of 1.

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:19.590
What kind of a bond is
a bond order of 1?

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:23.780
Yeah, we'd expect to see a
single bond in hydrogen.

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:27.660
So what actually turns out the
reality is that h e 2 does

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:31.300
exist, but it exists as the
weakest chemical bond known,

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:35.370
and it wasn't, in fact, even
found to exist until 1993, so

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:39.000
I can assure you this is not a
bond that you see very often

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.210
in nature, and it is a
very, very weak bond.

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:45.320
It only has a dissociation
energy of 0 .

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.180
1 kilojoules per mole.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:50.210
So that should make sense,
because we saw no energy

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:53.780
difference between the actual
atoms and the molecules.

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:57.330
Molecular orbital theory, even
at this very basic level,

00:29:57.330 --> 00:30:00.340
allowed us to predict that no,
we're not going to see a true

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.220
bond here, a strong bond.

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:06.930
In contrast, the dissociation
energy of a bond for hydrogen,

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:10.710
and molecular hydrogen is
everywhere around us, we see

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:12.720
432 kilojoules per mole.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:16.880
All right, so we can now see a
little bit of what the power

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.180
of molecular orbital theory is
in predicting what kind of

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:23.110
bonds we're going to see in
molecules, or whether or not

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:25.610
we'll see this bonding
occur at all.

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:28.540
So let's look at another
example, let's take lithium 2

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:30.710
and see what we can
figure out here.

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:34.430
In lithium 2, we have two atoms
of lithium, each have

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:36.450
three electrons in them.

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:40.670
So now we have to include both
the 1 s orbitals and also the

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:42.250
2 s orbitals.

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:45.390
So any time in a molecular
orbital diagram you draw in

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:46.790
orbitals, you need to draw the

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:49.630
corresponding molecular orbitals.

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:54.450
So, this means we need to have
sigma 1 s, sigma 1 s star, and

00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:58.210
now sigma 2 s and
sigma 2 s star.

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:01.490
Something I'll also point out
as you see these dashed line

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:04.370
that tell you where the
individual molecular orbitals

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:08.050
are arising from, as you get
to higher and higher atomic

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:12.380
numbers of molecules that you're
making, it makes a lot

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:14.760
more sense to look at a diagram
when you draw these

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.460
dotted lines in, because
they can start to get

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:17.510
a little bit confusing.

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:20.010
So when you go ahead and draw
these on your problem-sets or

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:22.820
on your exams, it's a good idea
to put these dashed lines

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:25.670
in, both for you and for people
reading it to see

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:29.050
exactly where your molecular
orbitals are coming from.

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:32.390
So, this means we have a total
of six electrons that we need

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:34.550
to put into molecular
orbitals.

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:37.260
So again we just start filling
those up -- we have two in the

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:42.050
1 s, two in the sigma 1 s star,
and then we have two in

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:44.220
the sigma 2 s.

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.890
So we should be able to also
calculate the bond order, just

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:49.330
like we did for hydrogen
and helium.

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:52.120
First we can do that by
knowing the electron

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:56.070
configuration, we can write it
out just by going up the table

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:58.560
here, up the energy levels.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.270
And you can go ahead and tell
me what you think the bond

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:22.730
order is going to be
for this molecule.

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:22.920
All right.

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:36.460
Let's take 10 more
seconds on this.

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:37.960
OK, good, we're back on
track a little bit

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.170
with our clicker answers.

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:46.180
So it's selection three or
one is the bond order.

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:49.250
So let's switch back to our
class notes and look at what

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:49.900
this means.

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:54.010
So we know that it's 1, because
we have 1, 2, 3, 4

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:58.000
bonding, minus 2 anti-bonding,
and 1/2 of that is a bond

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:58.900
order of 1.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.800
We would predict to see a single
bond between lithium,

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:04.000
and it turns out that's
what we see.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.060
And so you have for a reference,
the dissociation

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:10.680
energy of lithium 2 is 105
kilojoules per mole.

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:14.040
So let's keep moving along the
periodic table and keep

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:16.440
applying our molecular
orbitals.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:22.100
For example now, with b e 2,
so beryllium 2 has four

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:24.840
electrons in terms
of each atom.

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:28.040
So you can start by filling
those in, and now we can fill

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.110
in our molecular orbitals
as well.

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:34.090
This means we need a total
of eight electrons in our

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:35.480
molecular orbitals.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:40.220
So we have two in 1 s, two in
the sigma 1 s star, two in the

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:44.460
sigma 2 s, and two in
the sigma 2 s star.

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:48.270
So let's go ahead and figure
out the bonding order for

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:57.030
beryllium here.

00:33:57.030 --> 00:34:00.720
So when we figure it out for
beryllium -- let's see if I

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:06.610
wrote in your notes what
the actual -- electron

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:08.830
configuration, OK that's already
in your notes for you.

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:12.450
So let's go right to the bond
order for beryllium.

00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:16.210
So for the bond order we want
to take 1/2 of the total

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:20.140
number of bonding electrons, so
that's going to be 4 minus

00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:24.660
anti-bonding is 4, so we end up
getting a bond order that's

00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:25.940
equal to 0.

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:28.530
So what I want to point out with
this case in beryllium is

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:31.450
that you don't have to use all
of the electrons to figure out

00:34:31.450 --> 00:34:35.320
the bond order, and in fact,
once you get to molecules that

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:39.240
are from atoms with atomic
numbers of 8 or 10, you're not

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:42.190
going to want to maybe
draw out the full

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:44.010
molecular orbital diagram.

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:46.600
So what I want to tell you is
we also always get the same

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.050
bond order if we instead
only deal

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:50.810
with the valence electrons.

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:53.620
So let's just prove that to
ourselves and figure out the

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:57.030
bond order just using
valence electrons.

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:59.940
So this would mean the bond
order is equal to 1/2, and in

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:02.370
terms of valence electrons,
how many bonding valence

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:02.990
electrons do we have?

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.440
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.690
PROFESSOR: All right, what
about anti-bonding?

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:07.840
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:08.270
PROFESSOR: Two.

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.630
OK, good.

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:11.780
So again, we're going to
see that we have a

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:13.820
bonding order of 0.

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:18.330
So we would not predict
to see a b e 2 bond.

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:23.150
So what we see is a bond order
of 0, and again, the bond is

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:24.180
very, very weak.

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:26.320
Essentially we're not going
to see this, it's 9

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.450
kilojoules per mole.

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:29.990
All right.

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:33.060
So, so far we've looked only
at molecules that involve

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:36.110
atoms that have only
s orbitals in them.

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:38.560
I'm sure you're thinking well,
what do we do in the case of p

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.900
orbitals, and, in fact, we
can do the same thing.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:43.480
Again, we're going to take the
linear combination of those p

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:47.700
atomic orbitals and make what
are called pi or some more

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:49.990
sigma molecular orbitals.

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:52.670
So let's look at the first case
where we have either the

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:57.200
2 p x or 2 p y type of orbitals
that we're combining.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.760
So they're the same shape,
this is the shape of the

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:03.090
orbital or the shape of the wave
function, and we can call

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:07.840
this either 2 p x a being
combined with 2 p x b, or we

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:11.085
could say since it's the same
shape, it's 2 p y a being

00:36:11.085 --> 00:36:13.780
combined with 2 p y b.

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.530
And in either case if we first
talk about constructive

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:19.310
interference, what again we're
going to see is that where

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:22.380
these two orbitals come
together, we're going to see

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:25.430
increased wave function in
that area, so we saw

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:27.530
constructive interference.

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:31.740
So again, we can name these
molecular orbitals and these

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:35.220
we're going to call -- also to
point out there is now a bond

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:38.650
axis along this nodal plane,
which is something we didn't

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:41.600
see before when we were
combining the s orbitals.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.670
So when we go ahead and name
these, we're going to call

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:45.260
these pi orbitals.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:49.520
We'll call it either pi 2 p x,
if we're combining the x

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:53.910
orbitals, or pi 2 p y.

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:57.280
The reason that I wanted to
point out this nodal plane

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:00.840
here is because this is why
it is called a pi orbital.

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:04.630
Pi orbitals are a molecular
orbital that have a nodal

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:07.220
plane through the bond axis.

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:10.750
Remember this is our bond axis
here, and you can see there is

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:13.640
this area where the wave
function is equal to zero all

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.190
along that plane, that's
a nodal plane.

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:18.290
So that's why these
are pi orbitals

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:20.420
instead of sigma orbitals.

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:23.410
So again, we can think about
the probability density in

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:25.480
terms of squaring the
wave function.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:28.410
So now what it is that we're
squaring is if we're talking

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:34.390
about x orbital, it's pi 2 p
x squared, and this is just

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:42.980
equal to the 2 p x a plus the 2
p x b all squared, or if we

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:48.360
write out all of the terms we
have 2 p x a squared plus 2 p

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:52.330
x b squared, and then this term
here, and again, this is

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:53.760
our interference term.

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:56.200
In this case is it constructive
or destructive

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:57.000
interference?

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:57.336
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:57.336 --> 00:37:59.410
PROFESSOR: Constructive
interference.

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:02.030
We're seeing that the wave
function's adding together and

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:06.680
giving us more wave function
in the center here.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:07.010
All right.

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:09.390
So we see constructive
interference, of course, we

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:12.060
can also see destructive
interference.

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:15.490
So I changed the colors here
to show that these are 2 p

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:19.150
orbitals with an opposite phase
or an opposite sign.

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:24.490
So what happens when we add a 2
p a and we subtract from it

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:29.970
a 2 p x b, or the same with a 2
p y a subtracting a 2 p y b,

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:33.290
is that we're actually going
to cancel out the wave

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:36.830
function in the center, so we
now have 2 nodal planes.

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:39.530
So again, this is an
anti-bonding orbital, and what

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:43.470
you see is that there is now
less electron density between

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:49.040
the two nuclei than there was
when you had non-bonding.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:53.320
So we're going to call this the
sigma 2 p x star, or if

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:58.400
we're talking about the 2 p y
orbitals we'll call this the

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:05.880
pi 2 p x star, and the
pi 2 p y star.

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:09.200
And the pi star orbitals result
from any time you have

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.600
destructive interference from
2 p orbitals that are either

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:16.370
the p x or the p y.

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:19.030
So now we can move on to an
example where we do, in fact,

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:23.790
have to use some p orbitals,
so this would be b 2.

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:26.990
How many electrons
are in boron?

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.590
Five.

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:29.590
I see some hands going up.

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:32.740
There's five electrons So what
you'll notice here is that I

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:35.240
only filled in 3 electrons.

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.140
What do these electrons
represent?

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:38.750
STUDENT: Valence.

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:39.740
PROFESSOR: Valence electrons.

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:41.910
OK, sometimes you're going to
be asked to draw a molecular

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:44.790
orbital diagram where you're
asked to include all

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:48.080
electrons, and sometimes it
will specifically say only

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.110
include valence electrons.

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:53.190
That happens because of space
issues that you were asked to

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:55.880
do that, because you can always
assume that all of the

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:59.050
core orbitals are already
going to be filled.

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:01.310
So, in this case, we're just
drawing the molecular orbital

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:03.940
diagram for the valence
electrons, so we

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:05.320
have three for each.

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:09.330
And what we see here is now when
we're combining the p, we

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:13.200
have our 2 p x and our 2 p y
orbitals that are lower in

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:16.900
energy, and then our pi
anti-bonding orbitals that are

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:18.580
higher in energy.

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:22.090
You might be asking where the 2
p z orbital is and we'll get

00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:24.410
to that soon once we need it.

00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:28.170
Let's just first fill in
this for the b 2 case.

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:32.360
So we can start at the bottom,
two electrons in sigma 2 s,

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:35.700
two electrons in
sigma 2 s star.

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:40.220
Now we need to jump up to using
these pi orbitals, and

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:43.910
what we're going to do is put
one electron into each of our

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:47.790
pi 2 p x and 2 p y orbitals.

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:50.690
So again you can see as we're
filling up our molecular

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:53.750
orbitals, we're using the exact
same principle we used

00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:55.110
to fill up atomic orbitals.

00:40:55.110 --> 00:41:00.530
So let's think about what
the valence electron

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:03.170
configuration is here.

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:07.980
So now we're looking
at the case of b 2.

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:11.500
And what we're looking at is a
valence electron molecular

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.640
orbital diagram, so let's
just draw the electron

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.880
configuration for the valence
orbitals, so that will be

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:25.940
sigma 2 s 2, sigma 2 s star 2,
and now we start in with our

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:34.350
pi 2 p x 1, and our
pi 2 p y 1.

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:36.440
So this is our valence electron

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:38.800
configuration for b 2.

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:41.250
All right.

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:48.670
So what would you expect the
bonding order for b 2 to be?

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:50.030
Shout it out if you know.

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:51.440
STUDENT: one.

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:55.220
PROFESSOR: And I didn't write up
there but it is one, and we

00:41:55.220 --> 00:42:00.200
can see that it's 1, because
it's 1/2 of 2, 4 minus 2, so

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:04.130
1/2 of 2, the bonding order is
going to be equal to one.

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:06.900
So let's move on to another
example, let's talk about

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:07.680
carbon here.

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:10.230
Again, we're just talking about
the valence electrons.

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:13.660
So carbon has four valence
electrons, so if we talk about

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:17.220
c 2, again we're going to start
filling in our molecular

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:21.100
orbitals, and now we're going
to have eight electrons to

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:22.400
fill into our molecular
orbitals.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:27.130
So, we'll put two in the sigma
2 s, two in the sigma 2 s

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:30.870
star, and now we're going to
fill one and one into each of

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:35.540
our pi 2 p x and 2 p y, but we
still have two electrons left,

00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:38.560
so what we're going to do is
double up in terms of our 2 p

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.120
x and our 2 p y.

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:43.640
So let's think about what this
valence electron configuration

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:48.230
is for c 2.

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:51.270
And again, I want you to have
practiced drawing these out in

00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:54.460
the form -- you always need to
start with the sigma and then

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:56.710
write the number
of the orbital.

00:42:56.710 --> 00:43:02.170
So, sigma 2 s has two electrons,
sigma 2 s star with

00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:06.560
two electrons, and now we have
sigma 2 p x -- how many

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:07.630
electrons here?

00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:09.760
STUDENT: Two.

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:10.560
PROFESSOR: Two.

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:15.710
And sigma 2 p y, two
electrons here.

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:20.960
Oh excuse me, pi 2 p y, thank
you -- pi 2 p x and pi 2 p y.

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.540
So let's talk about what
the bonding order is

00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:25.110
going to be for c 2.

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:30.640
So what's the bonding
order for c 2?

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:31.460
STUDENT: Two.

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:32.320
PROFESSOR: two?

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:40.880
OK, so we have 2, 4, 6 minus 2,
so we have 1/2 of 6 minus

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:45.390
2, so that's 1/2 half 4, so we
have a bonding order of two

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:46.870
for carbon 2.

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:50.330
So we would expect to see a
double bond for a c 2 where we

00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:54.680
would expect to see a -- double
bond for c 2 and a

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:58.060
single bond for b 2.

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:01.810
And that is, in fact, what we
can surmise if we look at the

00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:04.940
different dissociation energies
for the two bonds.

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:08.490
So for b 2, which is a single
bond, that's 289 kilojoules

00:44:08.490 --> 00:44:12.130
per mole to break it, and it
takes us more energy to break

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:14.690
this double bond for carbon,
which is 599

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:17.000
kilojoules per mole.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.080
So, in general what we see,
and this is always true if

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:22.420
we're comparing the same atom,
and in general, if we're

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:25.470
comparing different types of
molecules, but we know that a

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:27.950
single bond is always weaker
than a double bond, which is

00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:29.490
weaker than a triple bond.

00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:33.380
And obviously, no bond is the
weakest of all is not bonding.

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:34.470
All right.

00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:37.790
So let's look now at the case
where we do have 2 p z

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:39.570
orbitals that we're
talking about.

00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:41.850
So again, what we're talking
about is the linear

00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:45.710
combination of atomic 2 p
orbitals, and now we're

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:47.440
talking about 2 p z.

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:50.680
So if we have constructive
interference between the two,

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:54.610
what we're going to see is our
molecular orbital looks

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:56.570
something like this.

00:44:56.570 --> 00:44:59.790
Do you predict that this will
be a sigma or a pi orbital?

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:02.420
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:03.613
PROFESSOR: All right, I'm
hearing a little of both, but

00:45:03.613 --> 00:45:05.640
I'm very encouraged to
hear quite a few

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:07.310
people saying sigma.

00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:10.230
This is, in fact, a sigma
2 p z orbital is what

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:12.210
this orbital is called.

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:15.270
The reason that it's sigma is
if you look at the bonding

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:18.410
axis here, is that there
is no nodal plane

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:20.820
along the bonding axis.

00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:25.430
Also, it is cylindrically
symmetric around the bonding

00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:28.390
axis, so this is how we know
that it's a sigma orbital.

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:32.660
So some p orbitals form pi
molecular orbitals, and some

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:34.540
form sigma p orbitals.

00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:38.030
Specifically, it's always the
z that forms the sigma

00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:41.600
orbital, and the reason is at
least at a minimum for this

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:45.740
class we always define the
internuclear axis as the z

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:50.290
axis, so this is always the z
axis, so it's always going to

00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:53.440
be the 2 p z's that are coming
together head-on.

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:56.370
The reason that there is
increased electron density

00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:59.490
here is you can see that these
two orbitals come together and

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:02.450
constructively interfere.

00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:05.210
We can also talk about
anti-bonding orbitals where we

00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:07.190
have destructive interference.

00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:10.250
So instead, these would be
canceling out wave functions

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:13.820
between the two, so we would end
up with a nodal plane down

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:15.190
the center.

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:18.390
Would this be a sigma or a pi?

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:19.840
It's still sigma.

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:22.670
So even though we see a nodal
plane down the center, I just

00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:25.110
want to really point out that
it's only when we have a nodal

00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:27.940
plane in the internuclear or
the bond axis that we're

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:30.660
calling that a pi orbital.

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:32.360
So this is still a
sigma -- it's a

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:35.360
sigma 2 p z star orbital.

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:38.370
We have destructive
interference here.

00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:41.270
So now let's look at an example
where we talk about

00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:45.210
using these 2 p z orbitals,
so let's look at oxygen.

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:48.280
So the first thing I want to
point out is that the 2 p z,

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:53.400
the sigma 2 p z is even lower in
energy than the pi orbitals

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:57.340
here, and the anti-bonding sigma
orbital is going to be

00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:03.010
higher in energy than the pi 2
p orbitals that we have here.

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:05.690
So in oxygen again, this is
just showing the valence

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:09.570
electrons, so we end up having
six valence electrons from

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:11.070
each oxygen atom.

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:14.380
We can fill right up our table
just like we did before, but

00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:18.610
now we have included our
2 p z orbital here.

00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:23.080
So we have two electrons in
sigma 2 s, two in sigma 2 s

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:29.730
star, in sigma 2 p z we have two
-- those are filled first,

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:33.780
and now we're going to put
one into pi 2 p x, and

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:37.480
one into pi 2 p y.

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:41.860
So we can write out what the
electron configuration is

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:44.250
here, and I think that I have
already written that out for

00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:45.890
you in your notes.

00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:50.400
What is the bond order of o 2?

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:54.200
It's two.

00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:56.090
Oh excuse me, I didn't fill
in all of my electrons.

00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:57.140
All right.

00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:00.220
So we had a total
of 2, 4, 6, 8.

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:01.990
So we had a total of 12.

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:07.640
So we filled in four here --
we need to keep going.

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:10.630
All right, so I did this not at
all purposely, but this can

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:13.570
point out for you that you need
to make sure that the

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:17.480
number of electrons that you
have in your molecular orbital

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:19.840
does match up with the total
number that you have in your

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:21.170
atomic orbitals.

00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:24.160
So I did not do any counting up
here, you should make sure

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:25.910
you do counting, I apologize.

00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:29.850
So we need to fill all the
way up to the pi 2 p x,

00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:31.220
and the pi 2 p y.

00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:34.760
All right, so the bonding order,
you're correct, should

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:38.040
be 2, if we subtract the
number of bonding minus

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:42.380
anti-bonding electrons
and take that in 1/2.

00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:45.560
And what I want to point out
that we just figured out for

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:49.120
molecular orbital theory, is
that o 2 is a biradical,

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:51.180
because remember, the definition
of a radical is

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:53.550
when we have an unpaired
electron.

00:48:53.550 --> 00:48:57.680
You can see that we have two
unpaired electrons in this

00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:02.880
molecule here -- one in the pi
2 p x star, and one in the pi

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:05.020
2 p y star orbital.

00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:07.570
This was something we could
not predict using Lewis

00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:11.520
structures, but we can predict
using MO theory that we have a

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.190
radical species here.

00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:15.850
So that's a really important
type of an application that we

00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:18.440
can use MO theory for that we
weren't able to do with our

00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:20.340
Lewis structures.

00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:23.380
All right, I want to do one more
at homonuclear example

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:25.520
here, and this is n 2.

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:28.710
The first thing that I need to
point out is you can actually

00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:33.440
see an n 2 versus o 2 that we
flip-flopped the energy of the

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:36.590
sigma and the pi 2 p orbitals.

00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:39.610
So this is a glitch, just like
sometimes we had glitches in

00:49:39.610 --> 00:49:41.040
filling up our atomic
orbitals.

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:43.100
This is something that
you need to remember.

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:47.670
And what you need to remember is
if the z is equal to eight

00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:51.370
or greater, such as oxygen being
the cut-off point, this

00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:56.030
sigma 2 p orbital is actually
lower in energy than the pi 2

00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:57.650
p orbitals, the molecular
orbitals.

00:49:57.650 --> 00:50:01.660
But for anything 7 or
less, so what is the

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:03.220
atomic number for nitrogen?

00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:05.400
STUDENT: Five.

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.330
PROFESSOR: five -- there's five
valence electrons, but

00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:09.990
the atomic number is
actually seven.

00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:13.950
So z equals 7 -- this is the
cut-off where, in fact, the

00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:18.450
sigma orbital is going to be
higher in energy than the pi 2

00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:19.410
p orbitals.

00:50:19.410 --> 00:50:21.330
This is something that you
just need to remember.

00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:24.120
I wrote it down your notes, if
you can put a big star next to

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:25.890
it so you don't forget this.

00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:27.930
This is something you're going
to be responsible for in

00:50:27.930 --> 00:50:29.850
drawing out your molecular
orbitals.

00:50:29.850 --> 00:50:32.650
So let's fill it out in this
way, keeping in mind that

00:50:32.650 --> 00:50:36.630
we're going to fill out the
pi 2 p's before the sigma.

00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:42.410
So we have a total of 2, 4, 6,
8, 10 valence electrons, so

00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:44.590
I'll make sure I count to 10
as we fill up our molecular

00:50:44.590 --> 00:50:45.760
orbitals here.

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:48.050
We have two, then
we have four.

00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:51.710
Now we're going to start in
with that pi 2 p orbitals,

00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:55.960
which gives us 1 each, and then
two each in those, and

00:50:55.960 --> 00:51:00.490
then after that, we'll go up
to our sigma 2 p z orbital.

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:04.210
So this is going to be our
molecular orbital diagram.

00:51:04.210 --> 00:51:06.340
And again, I've written for you,
but you can figure out

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:08.320
what the electron configuration
is just by

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.940
writing up in this order here.

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:13.480
And what is the bond order
going to be n 2?

00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.280
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:16.190
PROFESSOR: It's going
to be three.

00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:18.850
So, you can go ahead and
calculate that, if you can't

00:51:18.850 --> 00:51:20.390
see that right away.

00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:22.370
So we'll end here, we'll
finish up with the

00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:25.230
heteronuclear example
on Friday.
