00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:25.530
PROFESSOR: All right, so we
started talking about

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.450
transition metals, and at the
end of last time we'd given an

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.010
introduction to all the sort of
nomenclature and things you

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.660
need to know, and we had just
gotten up to d orbitals, and

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.200
when you're talking about
transition metals you're

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.960
talking about d orbitals.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.060
So, we're going to start with a
little review of d orbitals,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.430
some of you have seen
this before, maybe

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.150
some of you have not.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.380
But here is what you're
going to need to

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.990
know about the d orbitals.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.450
You need to know the names of
all the d orbitals, you should

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.280
be able to draw the shapes of
the d orbitals, and so the bar

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.900
is not too high for this.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.660
You see the drawings that are
in your handouts, you should

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.540
be able to do about that
well, it doesn't

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.360
have to be super fancy.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.690
But you should be able to draw
their shapes, and you should

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.610
also be able to recognize which
d orbital it is -- if

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.450
you have a picture of different
d orbitals, you

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.890
should be able to name
that d orbital.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.790
So let's just review what the
d orbitals look like.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.210
And in this class, we're always
going to have the same

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.670
reference frame, so we're
always going to have the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.480
z-axis up and down, the y-axis
is horizontal, and the x-axis

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.260
is coming out of the board
and going into the board.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.820
So, we'll always use that
same description.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.260
It'll often be given, but if
it's not, you can assume

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.980
that's what we're
talking about.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.730
So, the first d orbital we'll
consider is d z squared.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.100
It has its maximum amplitude
along the z-axis, and it also

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.060
has a little donut
in the x y plane.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.680
So, d x squared minus y squared
has its maximum

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.370
amplitude along the x and the
y axis, so directly on-axis

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.870
for this particular d orbital.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.830
The next sets of d orbitals have
their maximum amplitudes

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.490
off-axis, so they don't
correspond directly to the

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.600
axes that I just mentioned,
they're, in

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.880
fact, 45 degrees off-axis.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:35.450
So we have the d y z shown here,
d x z shown here, so

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:43.680
maximum amplitude 45 degrees off
z and x axes, and then z

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:52.580
-- these pictures are a little
bit complicated to see -- d x

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.250
y, so it's 45 degrees off
of the x and the y.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.850
And so, here I tried to draw
them all in the same

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.300
orientation of axes, which is
a little bit difficult.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.450
So now let's look at them in
terms of where they're drawn

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.340
so you can kind of see them a
little bit better, and so why

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.520
don't you try to learn to
recognize all of these.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.600
So, what is this one called?
d z squared.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.420
What is this one, so its maximum
amplitude is along x

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.350
and y? d x squared
minus y squared.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.580
I think this picture might be
a little -- you might have

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.580
somewhat aversion later on, but
this is just good practice

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.330
for you in recognizing them.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.900
So here we have one 45 degrees
off-axis, which one is this?

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.560
Yup.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.750
And this one over here?

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:53.500
Yup.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.310
So, y z.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.320
And this last one here?

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.630
Yup, we have the x z,
so it's going up and

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.970
down for the for z-axis.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.410
So, a little more
practice now.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.330
To show what these look like
again, you want to think in

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.840
three dimensions, and on paper
and in most the time in

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.660
Powerpoint you're not in three
dimension, so here's a little

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.050
movie in three dimensions.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:25.830
Here you can really see that
donut, so this is d x squared

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.830
-- see the maximum amplitude
along z-axis here, and down

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.680
here, and the little donut
in the x y plane.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.960
So this one is d x squared
minus y squared.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.840
The maximum amplitudes are right
directly along axis, so

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.500
that allows you to distinguish
it from d x y.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.780
So when it's on-axis
here, it's the x

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.210
squared minus y squared.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:04.765
So moving along here, so this is
d x y, so you see that it's

00:05:04.765 --> 00:05:08.020
in that axis but it's not
directly on-axis -- the

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.750
maximum amplitude is 45 degrees
off, so the orbitals

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:19.860
are in between the axes there.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.250
Now we're looking at one that
has a z in it, and it looks

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.540
like it's x z, so that's where
our maximum amplitude is

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:41.150
between the x and the z-axes,
45 degrees off.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.580
And our last one, we
have y and z here.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:54.650
Again, 45 degrees off-axis
between the y-axis and z-axis.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.760
So, hopefully these little
movies will help cement in

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:05.060
your brain, what the shapes
of these d orbitals are.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.460
All right, so that's d orbitals,
and we're going to

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.810
be mentioning d orbitals in
every lecture in this, and you

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.460
have to be thinking about what
the shapes of the d orbitals

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.360
are to talk about today's
topic, which is

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:23.860
crystal field theory.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.465
So, there are two types of
theories that you may hear of

00:06:26.465 --> 00:06:29.490
and that your book mentions --
crystal field theory, and

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.390
ligand field theory, and like
most things that you learn

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.830
about in freshman chemistry, the
theories were developed to

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.340
explain experimental
information.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.800
So there are special properties
of coordination

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.690
complexes, so that's where you
have a transition metal in the

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.710
middle and you have ligands
all around it, so you have

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.890
these coordination complexes
and they have special

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:52.450
properties.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:56.120
And so people wanted to try to
rationalize these special

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.720
properties and they came up
with these two theories.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.920
So, the basic idea behind these
theories is that when

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.870
you place a metal ion with the
particular oxidation number in

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.890
the center of a coordination
sphere, and you have all these

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.520
ligands, these donor ligands,
all surrounding them, that the

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.380
energy of the d orbitals is
going to be altered by the

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.300
position of those ligands.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.150
So it's all about the d
orbitals, and the d orbitals

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:32.550
are going to experience some
influence from these ligands,

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:37.490
these donor ligands that are
surrounding the metal.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.950
So then, between these two
theories that are used to

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:44.670
explain how these d orbitals
are being affected.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:48.580
The crystal field theory is
based on an ionic description,

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.080
so it considers the ligands
as negative point charges.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:57.980
It's a very simplified model,
whereas as the ligand field

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:03.150
theory considers covalent, as
well as ionic aspects of

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:04.290
coordination.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:08.090
It's more powerful it's more
useful, but it's also a bit

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.780
more complex, and so we don't
cover it in this of course,

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.550
and if you go on and take the
first level of inorganic

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:18.510
chemistry, which is 503, then
you'll hear about this.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:20.570
But for this course, we're
just going to talk about

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.240
crystal field theory.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.580
Even though it's very much
of a simplified model, it

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.900
actually works very well.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.040
You can explain quite a few
properties of coordination

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:37.070
complexes just using this
simplified method.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:40.000
So, crystal field theory,
again, very simple.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.860
It's just considering the
ionic interactions, it

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:48.210
considers the ligands as
negative point charges.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:52.490
And so, the basic idea is that
ligands, as negative point

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.690
charges, are going to have
repulsive effects if they get

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.820
close to the d orbitals.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.500
So here is a drawing of a metal,
and so this is metal

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:07.880
abbreviated m, its oxidation
number is m plus here, and it

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.840
has ligands all around it.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.440
What is the geometry here?

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.550
It's octahedral geometry.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:20.390
And so we have ligands up and
down along z, ligands along y,

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:22.980
and a ligand going back
along x, and a ligand

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.280
coming out along x.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.120
And so here's another picture
of the same thing, the metal

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.580
is in the middle, and the
ligands -- in this case, you

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.810
have these ammonia ligands or
these little negative point

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:38.040
charges, which are all
along the axes.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:43.250
You have four along the
equatorial, and one up and one

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:47.960
down, so this is the octahedral
geometry.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.480
And so you can just think about
each of these ligands as

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.860
negative point charges.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.510
And so, if the negative point
charge is pointing right

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:58.170
toward a d orbital, that'll
be very repulsive.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.580
If it's not it's
less repulsive.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:04.570
That's the whole idea behind
this crystal field theory.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:09.170
So, here again, is just another
little picture, so you

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:11.550
can kind of get the idea that
we're going to be thinking

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.290
about the all the shapes of
the d orbitals, and we're

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:16.600
going to think about where
the ligands are.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.220
Today we're going to talk about
octahedral geometry, but

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.960
we're also going to go on and
talk about tetrahedral

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.240
geometry later.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.160
So here in octahedral geometry,
you can think about

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.090
the positions of all of these
negative point charges

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.810
surrounding your d orbitals.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:36.060
And when the d orbitals are
on axis, like the ligands,

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.650
there's going to be more
repulsion, so you can see here

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:40.740
that would be quite repulsive
-- you have a negative point

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.420
charge by that d orbital.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.340
When the d orbitals are off-axis
and the ligands are

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.190
on-axis, that's less
repulsive.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:51.570
And that's the basic idea.

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:55.110
So, let's look at each one of
these orbitals now in detail

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:58.960
and think about how a ligands
that's pointing directly

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:03.750
toward it is going
to be affected.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:08.780
So we have the ligands, l, as
these point charges directed

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:12.960
toward the d z squared, and
the d x squared minus y

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.580
squared orbitals, and these
would result in

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.140
quite a bit of repulsion.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:21.500
So if you had a ligand right up
here along z, and so that

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.610
would be a very close
interaction.

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:26.670
In this case, you're going to
have ligands along x and y,

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:31.110
again pointing directly toward
the orbitals, that would be

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.830
quite repulsive.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:37.530
And I'll just mention, we'll
come back to this later, that

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:42.220
one can think about the case
where you have the octahedral

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.490
geometry where the ligands are
in a definite position, and

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:49.550
you can also think about this
sort of hypothetical case

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.430
where you have a metal in the
middle and you have the

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.470
ligands, here are the little
ligands, and they're

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:58.950
everywhere, there's ligands
everywhere all around.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:03.210
And so, in this case where you
have ligands everywhere all

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:05.860
around your metal, then all your
d orbitals would have the

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.300
same energy, but if you take
the ligands and you isolate

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:13.280
them in particular positions,
then you can consider how the

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.400
different shapes of the d
orbitals will be affected.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.180
We'll come back to
that in a minute.

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.650
All right, so here we have a
case where our ligands are

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:27.250
on-axis, our orbitals on-axis,
this is a large repulsion.

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:31.930
So, I will tell you that d x
squared and d z squared and d

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:37.040
x squared minus y squared
orbitals are destabilized, and

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.160
they are destabilized
by the same amount.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:44.830
So there's repulsion now, and
so they're destabilized, and

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:47.750
they're destabilized by the
same amount of energy.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.830
So what's it called
when orbitals

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:53.720
are of the same energy?

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.570
Yup.

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:59.510
So, d z squared and d x squared
minus y squared are

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:02.640
degenerate.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:06.570
So, d z squared and d x squared
minus y squared

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:10.850
orbitals are destabilized more
than the other three orbitals,

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:15.400
and let's consider now
why that is true.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.790
So here are our other sets of
orbitals, and remember, here

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:22.720
the maximum amplitude of these
orbitals are 45 degrees

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.070
off-axis, whereas our ligands
are all on-axis.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:30.410
So, the ligand negative charges
are directed in

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:34.990
between these orbitals, not
directly toward them.

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:40.430
So that is stabilized compared
to this hypothetical case

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.620
where the ligands are
everywhere, so some of them

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:46.870
will be pointing toward them,
and also stabilized compared

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.300
to the other sets of orbitals
where the ligands are now

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:54.020
pointing directly at them.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.520
So these three sets of orbitals
are stabilized

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.430
relative to the d z squared and
the d x squared minus y

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:04.720
squared orbitals, and they're
stabilized by the same amount.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.450
So these three orbitals are also
degenerate with respect

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.910
to each other.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:19.200
So then to sort of summarize
this set of orbitals, we have

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:24.280
for d z squared and d x squared
minus y squared, we

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.270
have large repulsions by those
negative point charges,

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:30.290
they're pointing directly at the
orbitals, and so they're

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:35.710
destabilized, higher in energy
than the other -- the d x y, d

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:38.370
y z and d x z.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:46.180
For the d y z, d x z and d x y,
they're smaller repulsion,

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.310
because these orbitals are
off-axis, and so the negative

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.700
point charges aren't pointing
directly at them.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:56.580
So they're stabilized relative
to these guys up here.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:01.260
So that's the whole idea behind
an octahedral case of

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.720
crystal field theory.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.460
And we can look at this
just one other way, if

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.690
pictures help you.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:11.410
Here it's a little clearer
that those negative point

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:14.580
charges are pointing directly
toward the orbitals, here I

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.910
think you can see that the
negative point charges are not

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:21.630
directly pointing toward
any of the orbitals.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.610
So I'll show you a bunch of
different figures, this all

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:27.150
shows you the same thing, but
some might help you see this

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:30.380
relationship better.

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:34.910
OK, so now we're going to draw
some diagrams. I'm going to

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:37.750
start over here.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:46.890
So we're going to draw what's
called a crystal field

00:15:46.890 --> 00:16:00.630
splitting diagram, and this
is for an octahedral case.

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:03.380
And the diagrams are going to
look different depending on

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:07.760
what the geometry is.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:12.120
So when we draw this diagram,
energy is going up, and we're

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:19.770
going to start with our 5 d
orbitals, and so this is going

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:25.970
to be the average energy,
the average

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:32.500
energy of our d orbitals.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:41.100
And so, this is then with a
spherical crystal field.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.470
So that's where the ligands are

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:46.390
distributed around uniformly.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.540
So it's all spherical, they
aren't set up in the

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:53.250
octahedral case yet, our
octahedral diagram's going to

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:58.560
be over here, but this is the
case that this represents.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:03.120
If you have all your ligands
spherically distributed around

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.940
your metal, then the energy
of all the d orbitals are

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.970
identical, because every d
orbital has the same amount of

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:11.420
ligands, it's uniform,
it's symmetrical

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:12.790
all around the metal.

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:15.960
And I just want to tell you that
this is was very exciting

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.280
to me when I saw this.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.810
I've been teaching this class
for a while, and I never had a

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:24.170
real spherical crystal field
around my metal before.

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:28.360
And then I walked into Walgreens
one day, and I was

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:32.530
very excited to see that
Walgreens sold spherical

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:33.660
crystal fields.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.440
I mean you never know what
you're going to get.

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.590
I'm a big fan of Walgreens,
I've found a lot of good

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:41.840
stuff, toys for my dog,
etcetera, but

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:42.930
this was really amazing.

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:46.370
So I asked the cashier on the
way out whether they knew they

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:50.480
were selling spherical
crystal fields, and

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.110
they did not actually.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:56.600
So, you just never know what
you're going to get.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:01.690
OK, so in that case, where the
ligands are uniform all

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:07.220
around, the energy
is the same.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.670
But now, if we have an
octahedral crystal field over

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:23.720
here, so we have our octahedral
crystal field, then

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.090
we get some splitting.

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:30.600
So some of our orbitals are
going to be destabilized, and

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.890
they'll be higher
in energy here.

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:37.010
So we have the d x squared
minus y squared, and d z

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:40.540
squared over here are going
to be higher in energy.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:47.830
And we're going to have three
that lower in energy, so we'll

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:55.230
have our d x y, our d y z, and
our d x z over here, will be

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:58.390
lower in energy.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:05.050
This difference is called the
octahedral field splitting

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:09.180
energy, because it's the amount
of energy that the

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.750
octahedral field is split.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:20.170
So over here, we can put this
is for the octahedral case,

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:34.380
crystal field splitting
energy.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:38.420
And again, some of the orbitals
go up in energy, some

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:42.280
of the orbitals go down in
energy, and the overall energy

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.170
needs to be conserved.

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:55.930
So, if two orbitals go up in
energy, and three go down in

00:19:55.930 --> 00:20:01.660
energy, then to have everything
add up, you can say

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:06.640
that three go up in energy by
3/5, and two, these three

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.040
orbitals are going to
go down by 2/5.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:16.100
So overall, the energy of the
system is maintained.

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.460
OK, so that's a crystal field
splitting diagram for an

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:23.920
octahedral case, and now let's
look at some examples of this.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:29.450
So let's look at an example,
and we're going to have a

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:34.490
chromium system that has
three n h 3 ligands

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:38.090
and three b r ligands.

00:20:38.090 --> 00:21:34.520
Now, you tell me what the
d count of that is.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:52.410
Let's just take 10
more seconds.

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:55.440
They're not as high overall, but
still more people got the

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.740
right answer.

00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:00.530
So, let's take a look at this.

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:04.642
What's the oxidation
number of bromium?

00:22:04.642 --> 00:22:11.638
What is it?

00:22:11.638 --> 00:22:13.970
Bromium?

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:17.300
What's 1 b r minus?

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.850
What's its oxidation number.

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:21.260
Minus 1.

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.600
There are three of them.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.200
What about ammonia?

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:25.490
0.

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:27.980
So, 3 times 0.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:31.060
And the overall charge
of this is 0, so

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:32.470
there's nothing up there.

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:35.570
So what does that mean
about chromium?

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:38.070
Plus 3.

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:41.540
All right, so now we have to
figure out the d count.

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:47.940
So the d count is going to equal
the -- and the periodic

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.890
table, the group number, so if
you switch to my slides, we

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:52.170
can see what that is.

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:55.370
So what is that for chromium?

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:56.640
6.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:00.495
And then we have 6 minus 3,
because our oxidation number

00:23:00.495 --> 00:23:08.910
is 3, and so we have
a d 3 system.

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:10.490
So, did some of you get
this wrong because

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:13.690
you stopped too early?

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:18.120
Here, the answer, if you had 3,
you could have stopped with

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.760
oxidation number and still
gotten it correct.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:26.270
So that's a d 3 system.

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:29.960
So, we're going to worry about
three d electrons, and we're

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:35.450
going to put three d electrons
into our splitting diagram.

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:38.920
OK, so if you had a hypothetical
spherical crystal

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:43.170
field, you would have your one's
in here, but now let's

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:46.760
consider what happens in
the octahedral case.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.900
So we can come down here.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:53.520
Am I going to put my first
electron down here or up here?

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.320
Down.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.820
Oh, I just realized that I
didn't put two things on this

00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:01.390
diagram, so these are in your
notes, but these diagrams have

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:06.380
little abbreviations in them
for the orbital levels.

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:10.640
So we have an e g and t 2 g, and
that's an abbreviation for

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.810
the names of the ts of orbitals,
which you'll see

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:16.630
later is very convenient in
terms of writing things out.

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:18.660
All right, so we're going
to put them down here.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:22.240
Am I going to put two of them
together with the spins up in

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.710
the first orbital?

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:24.800
No.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.560
So you know that that is not
good, give you the same four

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.260
quantum numbers, you don't
want to do that.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.680
So, we can put them in.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:37.230
What about just putting in a
paired set over here yet?

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:37.950
No.

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:41.650
They have the same energies
here, so we're going to put

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:45.130
them in all singly, and
then we're done.

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:49.010
So we put three electrons
in these three orbitals.

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:54.290
Now we can introduce a couple
other terms, which is where I

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:58.560
realized I forgot to
put the labels on.

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:07.650
So, you'll often
be asked for --

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:12.150
OK, you'll often be asked for
something called the d n

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:21.670
electron configuration.

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:25.020
And so here you can use the
abbreviations for the

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:30.040
orbitals, so we point three
electrons in to the t 2 g

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.620
orbitals, so we can just
say that's t 2 g

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.450
raised to the three.

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:39.670
So that let's someone know that
you have three electron

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:44.360
in the set of orbitals that
are stabilized in an

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:48.580
octahedral crystal field.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:56.840
Then we can consider something
else that's called c f s e,

00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:03.120
and I think I should have --

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.340
OK, so I'll write that out.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:19.640
So, this is the crystal field
stabilization energy.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.870
So it's not the crystal field
splitting energy, it's the

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:26.870
stabilization energy, which
indicates how much those

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:30.360
electrons are stabilized by
being in an octahedral field,

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:35.490
rather than this hypothetical
spherical crystal field.

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:39.510
And so what we can do there is
you see that you have three

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:43.920
electrons in those lower sets
of orbitals, and those

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:48.680
orbitals are stabilized by 2/5
times the octahedral crystal

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.400
field splitting energy.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:58.030
And so that gives an answer of
minus 6/5 times the octahedral

00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:00.180
crystal field splitting
energy.

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:03.720
So that's how much those
electrons are stabilized.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:07.020
So they are lower in energy --
see, the average energy is

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:11.410
much, much higher in this
hypothetical case, but because

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:15.810
of having this octahedral
geometry, and there are only

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:19.990
three electrons to consider,
they all go into the

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:23.770
stabilized energy, and so
they're stabilized by minus

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:27.210
6/5 times whatever the
octahedral crystal field

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:34.210
splitting energy is for
this particular case.

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:40.570
So, now let's look at
another example.

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:45.410
So let's look at an example of
a coordination complex -- you

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:52.720
have manganese and you have
six water ligands and some

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.020
chlorides hanging around.

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:59.140
So why don't you tell me what
the oxidation number is for

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:27.890
this now -- not the d count,
but the oxidation number?

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:46.530
OK, so let's just take
10 more seconds.

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:50.000
OK, so let's just look at that
one for a minute, people did

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.510
very well on that.

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:57.460
So, what's the overall charge in
this coordination complex?

00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:03.570
So we can write this out here.

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:08.220
Our six ligands and we say that
here it's plus 3 overall,

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:11.580
because we have three chloride
ions hanging around with a

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:12.820
negative charge.

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:16.310
So this tells us that the
overall charge on the

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:19.360
coordination complex
had to be plus 3.

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:24.120
And this again is 0, so that
means that is plus 3.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.260
So, people did very
well on that.

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:31.440
All right, so then what
is the d count?

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.980
What is it?

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.160
4, right.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:41.550
So we have 7 minus 3 is 4,
so we have a d 4 system.

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:46.960
All right, so now, if you look
up there, we have to make a

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:50.440
decision about that fourth
electron. three electrons were

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.790
easy, four makes
it complicated.

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:55.220
Do we put the fourth one
down in the lower

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.360
set or do we go up?

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.130
So there are two possibilities
here.

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:03.490
So I have two diagrams
drawn over here.

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:07.580
And you might be in a case where
you have a small crystal

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:11.100
field splitting energy, or you
might be in a case where you

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:15.380
have a large crystal field
splitting energy.

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:17.690
And so, there are two
different ways the

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:21.430
electrons can go.

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:26.650
So over here where you have a
small crystal field splitting

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:31.040
energy, that's called
a weak field.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.420
And when you have a big
splitting energy, that's a

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:40.160
strong field.

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:44.760
So, with the weak field there's
not that much of an

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.240
energy difference
between them.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:51.100
And so, when you're putting in,
you do your first three

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.060
electrons, that's always
going to be the same.

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:58.495
But then the fourth electron, in
this case, if there's not a

00:30:58.495 --> 00:31:01.920
big difference in the energy, if
it's pretty small, if it's

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:05.690
a weak field, you can put that
fourth one up there.

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:10.200
Because it takes energy to pair
the electrons up, and so

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.060
you're asking the question, does
it take more energy to

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:16.160
pair them, or does it take
more energy to put one

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.420
in the upper set?

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:20.730
And for a weak field you say
that the crystal field

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:24.930
splitting energy is smaller than
the pairing energy or p

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:27.560
e, so p e is the
pairing energy.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:31.870
And so it takes more energy to
pair than it does to bump one

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:34.280
electron up to the
higher level.

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:38.840
So that's what a weak field
situation would look like.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:43.360
Now in a strong field situation,
boy, there's a big

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.500
splitting difference, a big
energy difference here.

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:52.870
So in this case, the crystal
field splitting is much larger

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:56.340
than p e, that pairing energy
for the electron.

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:59.010
So it's better to pair,
then to put one up.

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:03.510
I can't even reach those,
that's really far up.

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:07.035
So I'm not going to do
that, I'm just going

00:32:07.035 --> 00:32:07.890
to put them in here.

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:11.350
I'll put the first three in,
and then the fourth one is

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:13.480
going to go down where
I can reach it.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.960
I don't have the energy
to put it up there.

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:18.920
So that's a strong field.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:22.250
Weak field I can handle, strong
field I'm going to try

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:26.250
pair them all up.

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:31.740
So, now we can write the
different d n electron

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:34.790
configurations for these two.

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:45.410
So, in this case, if we
have our d n electron

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:55.400
configuration, so we
have three in the t

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.750
2 g, we have three.

00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:03.000
And in the e g set we have one,
so that is our electron

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.320
configuration for this
weak field case.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:09.680
And for the strong field case,
we didn't put any up in the e

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:15.710
g, so we just have t
2 g, four electrons

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:20.390
in that set of orbitals.

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:28.110
OK, so let's just put up what
we've done here, and introduce

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:32.920
another term, which are high
spin and low spin.

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.850
So we have these two cases
here, and again, we're

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:40.320
considering how big is this
octahedral crystal field

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:43.080
splitting energy compared
to a pairing energy.

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:46.330
The energy involved in pairing
electrons together.

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:49.970
In a weak field, the splitting
energy is small, so electrons

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:54.750
are placed singly with spins
parallel to the fullest extent

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:57.480
in all the sets of orbitals.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.850
In this other case with the
strong field, the pairing

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:04.900
energy is smaller than the
splitting energy -- strong

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.800
field you have a big
splitting energy.

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:11.680
And so, in that case, with the
splitting energy is large,

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.630
you're going to put all your
electrons in and pair them up

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:18.310
in t 2 g and don't put any
electrons in the e g sets of

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:22.880
orbitals until you completely
filled your t 2 g set.

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:27.210
So, the net result of this is
for a weak field, you have the

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:31.410
maximum number of unpaired
electrons, so see, you have a

00:34:31.410 --> 00:34:33.350
maximum number, you have
four electrons,

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:35.030
all four are unpaired.

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:38.030
So that's the maximum number
of unpaired electrons, and

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:40.680
this is referred to
as high spin.

00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.720
And in the other case, you have
the minimum number of

00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:47.340
unpaired electrons that you can
have, and so you have this

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:50.180
one set that's paired here,
so that would be

00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:54.710
considered a low spin case.

00:34:54.710 --> 00:35:01.060
We can also talk about the
stabilization energy of these

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:05.870
two cases, and so we have
the crystal field

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:08.110
stabilization energy.

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:11.650
So why don't you go ahead and
tell me for a weak field case,

00:35:11.650 --> 00:36:42.750
what is our stabilization
energy?

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:57.730
Let's just take 10
more seconds.

00:36:57.730 --> 00:36:59.760
OK, pretty good.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.960
So let's work this out.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:07.420
So, first we consider how many
electrons we have in the lower

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:09.910
set of orbitals, so
we have three.

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:14.530
Those three are stabilized
by 2/5.

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:22.060
And then we have one in the
upper set, so we have one at

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:25.020
3/5 times the octahedral
crystal

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.630
field splitting energy.

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:32.740
So this ends up with minus 3/5
times the octahedral crystal

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.900
field splitting energy.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:39.440
And notice why a is not correct
-- you don't have the

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.370
symbol for the octahedral
crystal

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:43.810
field splitting energy.

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:47.090
On a test, you need to make
sure that you remember to

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:52.380
write this term, so this was
a little test so that you

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:57.210
hopefully emphasize that you
want to have that there.

00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:59.330
All right, so that's
for this one.

00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:06.540
Let's look at the low spin case,
the strong field case,

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:11.040
and do our crystal field
splitting energy for that.

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:19.130
So in this case we're going to
have four electrons times

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:23.500
minus 2/5 times the octahedral
crystal field splitting

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:30.530
energy, so that's equal to minus
8/5 times the octahedral

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:35.060
crystal field splitting energy,
and some books will

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:41.590
also indicate, and they'll say
plus p e to indicate that

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:44.380
there's pairing energy that's
associated there.

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:49.570
So it's not quite as beneficial
as one might think.

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:55.130
You do have a lot of electrons
in these in lower energy

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:59.080
orbitals, but you did have to
pair some of them, so you had

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:01.160
one, and if two of them are
paired, you can see

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:02.920
sometimes 2 p e.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.480
So, some books will do that,
some books will not.

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:09.950
So I just wanted to mention
that both are OK.

00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:13.270
And whether you're asked to
write that or not, and the

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:16.220
question will say include the
pairing energy, so you know

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:19.830
whether you're supposed to do
that or not, that there is

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:22.820
that energy associated
with pairing in this

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:29.370
strong field case.

00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:33.610
OK, so let's look at another
example, and then you should

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:36.400
be all set to do these
problems for

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:41.020
an octahedral field.

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:44.650
So we'll take our
electrons down.

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:53.690
All right, so let's at a
case of cobalt plus 2.

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:59.200
So let's consider how many we're
going to put in, the

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.880
oxidation number is?

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:03.920
Plus 2.

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:07.990
And what is the d count then?

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:14.340
What group number?

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:20.650
9 minus 2 is 7, so we're
doing a d 7 system.

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:24.670
All right, so now for the weak
field case here, why don't you

00:40:24.670 --> 00:41:12.610
tell me what is the correct
electron distribution.

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:28.280
OK, let's just take
10 more seconds.

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:30.960
OK, very good.

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:35.530
This is the weak field case, so
in this case, we are going

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:40.240
to fill up singly all of the
orbitals, because the

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:43.080
splitting energy is less than
the pairing energy, so we're

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.870
going to put them to the fullest
extent possible before

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:47.120
we have to pair.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:55.000
So we have 7, so we're going to
do 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and now

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:55.800
we have to pair.

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:58.860
We have no -- we've used up
all our orbitals, so we're

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:03.090
going to start pairing down here
in the lower energy, so

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:06.620
that would be 6, 7.

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:10.090
So we had no choice, we had to
pair them, but because it was

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:12.940
a weak field, we filled
them all up singly

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:15.330
first before we paired.

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:18.370
So now let's consider what we're
going to do down here.

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:21.330
Now remember, this is a strong
field, so there's a big

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:26.350
splitting energy, so it takes
less energy to pair them than

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:29.060
to reach this higher level.

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.370
So first we put them
in the same way --

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:36.640
1, 2, 3, but now that we have
the 3 in, it's better to pair

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:38.280
than to bring them up here.

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:42.400
So we'll do 1, 2, 3, we'll
pair them all up.

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:46.290
Now it's all filled, we
have no other choice

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:50.330
but to go up here.

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:53.830
So, we have these very different
cases depending on

00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:55.250
the splitting energy.

00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:57.820
So what controls the
splitting energy?

00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:00.170
Well, what controls the
splitting energy is nature of

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:02.880
the ligands, so we're going to
be talking about that next

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:06.140
time, and you'll recognize for
certain kinds of ligands

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:08.770
you're going to have a strong
field, and other kinds you'll

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:10.070
have a weak field.

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:12.350
But right now we're not talking
about that, we're just

00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:15.220
showing those two
possibilities.

00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:18.765
So, for this system, is this
going to be a high spin or a

00:43:18.765 --> 00:43:21.180
low spin system?

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:24.870
So, this will be high spin,
because we have the maximum

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:27.570
amount of unpaired electrons.

00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:30.810
And over here we're going to
have a low spin system.

00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:34.210
We have the minimum
number possible of

00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:36.750
the unpaired electrons.

00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:42.790
All right, so let's finish this
up now, and do our d n

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:45.440
electron configurations
and our crystal

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.980
field splitting energies.

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:52.130
So, for this case, we're going
to have in our t 2

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:55.010
g system, how many?

00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:56.220
5.

00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:58.520
And in e g?

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:00.140
2.

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:05.680
And for our splitting energy,
we have 5 times minus 2/5

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:10.290
times the octahedral crystal
field splitting energy plus 2

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:16.030
times plus 3/5, and what does
that end up equaling?

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:20.810
Minus 4/5 times the
octahedral crystal

00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:22.320
field splitting energy.

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:26.760
And we could also optionally put
2 p e because we have two

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.230
sets paired.

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:31.360
All right, so let's look at
our strong field system.

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:35.050
How many do we have
in our e 2 g set?

00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:36.080
6.

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:39.180
What about e g?

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:40.360
1.

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:44.270
And for our splitting energy
then, we have 6 times minus

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:48.650
2/5 times the octahedral crystal
field splitting energy

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:55.900
plus 1 times 3/5, and what
is that going to equal?

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:57.890
Minus what?

00:44:57.890 --> 00:44:59.500
9/5.

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:05.740
And how many pairing energies?
three pairing energies, great.

00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:07.470
I think you have
that part down.

00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:09.630
Next time we get more
complicated, we're going to

00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:12.010
talk about types of ligands,
we're going to talk about

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:16.110
tetrahedral, we're going to talk
about square planar, and

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:20.300
that's, of course, after
the exam on Wednesday.

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:23.470
So, good luck, everyone, with
the exam on Wednesday.
