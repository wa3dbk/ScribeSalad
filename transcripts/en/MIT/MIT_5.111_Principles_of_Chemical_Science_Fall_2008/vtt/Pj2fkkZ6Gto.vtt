00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:21.930
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.070
As everyone finishes getting
settled in, why don't you take

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:34.710
10 more seconds on the clicker
question here, and let's see

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.370
how you did on that this, this
is very similar to the clicker

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.380
question that we
had on Friday.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.250
OK, so let's get started here.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.040
It looks like we are
doing a lot better.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.200
We now have 77% getting the
correct answer, we only had

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.560
about 30-something percent
on Friday for a

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.630
very similar question.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.740
So if you're not in this 77%,
let's quickly go over why, in

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.710
fact, this is the correct
answer, 0 .

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.390
9 times 10 to the negative
18 joules.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.150
So I'm using the same kind of
tricky language that we'd used

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.560
before, not to trick you, but so
that you're not tricked in

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.460
the future.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.590
So if we're talking about the
fourth excited state, and we

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.740
talk instead about principle
quantum numbers, what

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.340
principle quantum number
corresponds to the fourth

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.900
excited state of a
hydrogen atom.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.130
STUDENT: Five.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.920
PROFESSOR: Five.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.060
OK.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.290
So, hopefully that cleared up
for some of you why you got

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.740
the wrong answer.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.700
So we know that we're in the n
equals 5 state, so we can find

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.710
what the binding
energy is here.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.990
The ionization energy, of
course, is just the negative

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.460
of the binding energy.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.040
We know that binding energy is
always negative, we know that

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.450
ionization energy is
always positive.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.370
So hopefully, putting all those
things together, if you

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.750
looked at this question again
we'd get 100% on it, that our

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.390
only option here is 0 .

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.720
9, and that it's not the
negative, it's the positive

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.030
version, because we're talking
about how much energy we have

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.420
to put into the system in order
to eject an electron.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.900
All right.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.900
And today we're going to mostly
be talking about wave

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.170
functions of electrons, but
before we get to that, I

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.960
wanted to review one last
thing that's back on to

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.870
Friday's topic, which was
when we were solving the

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.900
Schrodinger equation, or in
fact, using the solution to

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.640
the Schrodinger equation for the
energy, the binding energy

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.000
between an electron
and a nucleus.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.950
And when we talked about that,
what we found was that we

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.360
could actually validate our
predicted binding energies by

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.140
looking at the emission spectra
of the hydrogen atom,

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.620
which is what we did as the
demo, or we could think about

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.610
the absorption spectra
as well.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.360
And what we predict as an energy
difference between two

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.450
levels, we know should
correspond to the energy of

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.510
light that's either emitted, if
we're giving off a photon,

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.440
or that's absorbed if we're
going to take on a photon and

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.040
jump from a lower to a
higher energy level.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.760
So we came up with two formulas,
which are similar to

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.700
the two that I'm showing here.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.940
The formula tells us the
frequency of the light that's

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.900
emitted or absorbed based on the
energy difference between

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.810
the two levels that we're
going between, that the

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.090
electron is transitioning
between.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.230
You'll notice that there's a
little bit of a difference in

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.840
these equations here from the
ones from the other day, which

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.550
is that you have this z squared
value in there.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.580
So these are both called Rydberg
formulas for figuring

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.330
out the frequency of light
emitted or absorbed, and

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.180
before we were looking at the
Rydberg formula specifically

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.740
for the hydrogen atom, and now
that we have this z squared

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.120
term in the formula here,
we're now talking about

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.350
absolutely any one
electron atom.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.010
And it should make sense where
we got this from, because we

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.380
know that the binding energy,
if we're talking about a

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:52.620
hydrogen atom, what is the
binding energy equal to?

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.750
Negative Rydberg over what?

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.040
Yes.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.890
So, it's negative Rydberg
constant over n squared.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.720
But if we're talking more
generally about any one

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.630
electron atom, now we have a
more general equation for the

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.300
binding energy, which has this z
squared term out in front of

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.680
it, right, so it's negative z
squared times the Rydberg

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.080
constant all over n squared.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.910
So, essentially when we're
talking about these equations

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.600
up here, all we're doing is
talking about the regular

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.580
Rydberg formulas, but instead we
could go back and re-derive

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.370
the equation for any one
electron atom, which would

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.190
just mean that we put that z
squared term in the front.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.110
So when you solve certain types
of problems, such as

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.580
problems later on in the second
half of your p-set, if

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.640
you need to talk about the
frequency of light emitted or

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.200
absorbed for a one electron
atom, such as lithium plus 2,

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.930
for example, then you would
need to plug in z, and

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.690
remember the z value for lithium
would just be 3.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.190
The z value for hydrogen, of
course, is 1, and that's why

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.680
this term falls out of that
equation when we're talking

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.670
specifically about the
hydrogen atom.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.160
So, just to finish our review
of what we talked about on

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.720
Friday, when we're thinking
about transitions between two

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.700
different states, and we're
talking about a situation

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.510
where the final state, the n
final, is greater than n

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.710
initial, in this case, are we
talking about absorption or

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.690
are we talking about emission?

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.200
Hearing a little bit
of a mix here.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.190
In fact, we're talking about
absorption when n final is

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.290
greater than n initial.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.870
We start at this lower energy
state and go up -- that means

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.870
we need to absorb a photon,
we have to take in energy.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.910
Specifically, we have to take in
this exact amount of energy

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.260
in order to bump the electron up
to the higher energy level.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.380
So that means that when instead
we start high and go

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.610
low, we're dealing with emission
where we have excess

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.570
energy that the electron's
giving off, and that energy is

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.050
going to be equal the energy of
the photon that is released

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.560
and, of course, through our
equations we know how to get

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.450
from energy to frequency or to
wavelength of the photon that

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.970
we're talking about.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:10.470
All right.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.040
So that's all I'm going to say
today in terms of solving the

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.250
energy part of the Schrodinger
equation, so what we're really

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.690
going to focus on is the other
part of the Schrodinger

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.220
equation today, which
is solving for psi.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.260
So we're going to for psi, and
before that, we're going to

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.800
figure out that instead of just
that one quantum number

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.920
n, we're going to have a few
other quantum numbers that

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.560
fall out of solving the
Schrodinger equation

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.150
for what psi is.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.480
We're also going to talk more
about what psi actually means.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.010
When we first introduced the
Schrodinger equation, what I

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.590
told you was think of psi as
being some representation of

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.030
what an electron is.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.170
We'll get more specific here,
more specific even than just

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.630
saying you can think of
it as an orbital.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.930
We'll really think about
what psi means.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.950
And in doing that, we'll also
talk about the shapes of h

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.590
atom wave functions,
specifically the shapes of

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.600
orbitals, and then something
called radial probability

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.060
distribution, which will make
sense when we get to it.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.670
But, as I said before that, we
have some more quantum numbers

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.360
to take care of, because it
turns out that when you solve

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.790
the Schrodinger equation for
psi, these other quantum

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:17.390
numbers have to be
the defined.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.190
When we talked about binding
energy, we just had one

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.840
quantum number that
came out of it.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.590
And that quantum number was
n, which was our principle

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:29.820
quantum number, and we know that
n could be equal to any

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:35.780
integer value, so, 1, 2, 3, all
the way up to infinity.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.830
And this quantization that comes
out of having n is what

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.230
gives us the quantization of
different energy levels.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.000
That's why we can't have a
continuum of energy, we

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.190
actually have those
quantized points.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:53.250
So, it turns out that n is not
the only quantum number needed

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.460
to describe a wave function,
however.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.490
There's two more that you
can see come out of it.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.780
And the first is l, and l is our
angular momentum quantum

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:06.660
number, and it's called that
because it actually dictates

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:10.460
the angular momentum that our
electron has in our atom.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.220
And when we talk about l it is
a quantum number, so because

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.900
it's a quantum number, we know
that it can only have discreet

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.320
values, it can't just be any
value we want, it's very

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.620
specific values.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.440
And unlike n, l can start all
the way down at 0, and it

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:29.400
increases by integer value,
so we go 1, 2, 3,

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.980
and all the way up.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.530
But also unlike n, l cannot have
just any value, we can't

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.420
go into infinity.

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.680
L is limited such that
the highest value of

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.870
l is n minus 1.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.260
We can't get any higher
than that.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.665
So, it would be a good question
to ask why are we

00:08:46.665 --> 00:08:49.010
limited -- clearly there's this
relationship between l

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.950
and n, and we can't get any
higher than n equals one.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.940
We can actually think about why
that is, and the reason is

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.400
because l is our angular
momentum.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.140
It describes the angular
momentum of the electron.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.580
So another way to think about
that is just the rotational

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.400
kinetic energy of
our electron.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.960
And we know that n describes the
total energy, that total

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.750
binding energy of the electron,
so the total energy

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.170
is going to be equal
to potential energy

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.820
plus kinetic energy.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.920
So if we say that l is just
talking about our kinetic

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.990
energy part, our rotational
kinetic energy, and we know

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.940
that electrons have potential
energy, then it makes sense

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.820
that l, in fact, can never
go higher than n.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.500
And, in fact, it can't even
reach n, because then we would

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.660
have no potential energy at all
in our electron, which is

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.130
not correct.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.860
So, that's the second
quantum number.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:44.950
And the third one is called
m, it's also m sub l.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:48.200
This is what we call the
magnetic quantum number, and

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.900
we won't deal with the fact of
its being the magnetic quantum

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.980
number here -- that kind of
tells us the shape of the

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.210
orbital or the way that the
electron will behave in a

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:02.360
magnetic field, but what's
more relevant to thinking

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.500
about the limits of this number
is that it's also the z

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.860
component of the angular
momentum.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:11.090
So since it's a component of
the angular momentum, that

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:14.330
means that it's never going to
be able to go higher than l

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.180
is, so it makes sense that, for
example, it could start at

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.530
0 and then go all
the way up to l.

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:23.330
But since it is a component it
can have a direction, too, so

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.280
can go up between negative
l and positive l.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.150
So the allowed values for m sub
l are going to be negative

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:35.640
l, all the way up to 0, and
then up to positive l.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:40.590
So, if we think of just an
example, we could say that 4 l

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:45.740
equals 2, what would be our
lowest value of m sub l?

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:46.310
Yup.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:49.870
So m sub l could equal
negative 2,

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:54.410
negative 1, 0, 1 or 2.

00:10:54.410 --> 00:11:00.310
So we could have five different
values of m sub l.

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:02.410
So, those are our three
quantum numbers.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:06.460
So if, in fact, we want to
describe a wave function, we

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:09.110
know that we need to describe
it in terms of all three

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:13.430
quantum numbers, and also as
a function of our three

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:18.660
positional factors, which are
r, the radius, plus the two

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.600
angles, theta and phi.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.040
So, we have now a complete
description of a wave function

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.500
that we can talk about.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.940
So, we can think about what is
it that we would call the

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.710
ground state wave function.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:32.120
We knew from Friday, when we
talked about energy, that

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.730
ground state was that n equals
1 value, that was the lowest

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:37.720
energy, that was the most
stable place for

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.020
the electron to be.

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:42.510
But now we need to talk
about l and m as well.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:45.450
So now when we talk about a
ground state in terms of wave

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:49.390
function, we need to talk about
the wave function of 1,

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:54.560
0, 0, and again, as a function
of r, theta and phi.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.960
So this is our complete
description of the ground

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.670
state wave function.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:04.270
So, a lot of you talked about
different types of orbitals in

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:08.050
high school, I'm sure, or in
previous courses, and it might

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.580
be less common that you actually
talked about a wave

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.720
function that was labeled
like this.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.480
We're used to labelling orbitals
as an s, or a p, or a

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.830
d, for example, but it turns
out that these correlate to

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:22.640
those letters that we're
more used to seeing.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:28.000
Does anyone know what the 1, 0,
0 orbital is also called?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:28.450
Yeah.

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.700
And specfically it's the
1 s, so not just the

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.320
s, but the 1 s orbital.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.770
So, using the terminology of
chemists, which is a good

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:38.670
thing to do, because in this
course we are all chemists, we

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:42.140
want to make sure that we're
not using just the physical

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.415
description of the numbers, but
that we can correlate it

00:12:44.415 --> 00:12:47.570
to what we understand as
orbitals, and instead of 1, 0,

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:49.840
0, we call this the
1 s orbital.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.280
The reason that we do this is
because this is another way to

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.870
completely describe it.

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:57.970
The n designates the shell, so
that's what this number is

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.070
here, we're in the
first shell.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:03.190
The l is what we call
the sub shell.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.300
And instead of having
a 0 there, what we

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.180
have here is an s.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:10.920
So, if we look at what the other
sub shells are called,

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.190
essentially we're
just converting

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:14.680
the number to a letter.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:19.300
L equals 0 is s, what
is l equals 1?

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.730
Um-hmm, it's the p.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:25.710
What about 2? d, and 3?

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:27.470
Yup, so 3 is f.

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:30.090
So these names, they don't
really make any sense if we're

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.990
looking at them why they're
called past s p and f, and it

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:36.110
turns out that it comes from
spectroscopy terms that are

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:39.420
pre-quantum mechanics where,
for example, this is called

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.540
the sharp line, I think the
principle, the diffuse, and

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:43.610
the fundamental.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:47.220
It doesn't even make sense
now, they're not used in

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.920
spectroscopy anymore, but this
is where the names originally

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.600
came from and they did stick.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.810
So, we being chemists, we'll
call that 1 s instead of 1, 0.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:00.200
In addition to having another
name to denote l, we also have

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:04.820
another name for the
m designation here.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:13.300
So, for example, when l is equal
to 0, we're going to

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.860
find that we have to call
-- we have to specify

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:22.780
what m is as well.

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:23.170
All right.

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:28.070
So, when we have, for example,
l equal to 1, what kind of

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.590
orbital is this?

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:31.250
The p orbital.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:34.380
And for example, we could
also in this case, have

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.270
m is equal to 0.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:40.700
If m is equal to 0, in this case
we would call it the p z

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:44.750
orbital, so we would have
the subscript z here.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:50.680
Similarly, if m is equal to
either plus 1 or minus 1, we

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:57.850
would in turn call it the p y
orbital, or the p x orbital.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:01.270
So you should know that any time
m is equal to zero when

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:04.180
we are talking about p orbitals,
that it's the p z.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.360
The p y and the p x are
actually a bit more

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:10.280
complicated, they're linear
combinations of the m plus 1,

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.340
and the m minus 1 orbital, where
1 is the positive linear

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.040
combination, and 1 is the
negative linear combination.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.540
You're not responsible for that,
you're not responsible

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.810
for correlating plus 1
to y, minus 1 to x.

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:24.950
Just know that you have plus or
minus 1, for our class, you

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:29.060
can call it either x or y,
either is fine, because it's a

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:33.520
little bit more complicated than
just the 1:1 translation

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:38.170
between, for example, m equals
0 and having a p z orbital.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:41.850
All right.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:44.560
So let's look at some of these
wave functions and make sure

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.120
that we know how to name all of
them in terms of orbitals

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.950
and not just in terms
of their numbers.

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:52.100
Once we can do that we can go on
and say okay, what actually

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.060
is a wave function, but first
we need to know how to

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.470
describe which ones were
talking about.

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:59.650
So we saw that our lowest,
our ground state wave

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:01.750
function is 1, 0, 0.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.750
We can call that psi 1,
0, 0 is how we write

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:07.420
it as a wave function.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.460
We said that's the
1 s orbital.

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:14.380
We also know how to figure out
the energy of this orbital,

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.560
and we know how to figure out
the energy using this formula

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:21.140
here, which was the binding
energy, which is negative r h,

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.390
and instead of n, we can plug
it in because n equals 1, so

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:28.730
over 1 squared, and the
actual energy is here.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:33.060
So, our next level up that we
can go is going to be the n

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:39.160
equals 2 energy level, but we
also have an l and an m value,

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.050
so our lowest l is going
to be a 0 there.

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:46.220
So we'll call that psi 2,
0, 0 wave function.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:50.070
What will we call that
in terms of orbitals?

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:52.690
Yup, so that's the
2 s orbital.

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:55.370
So something I actually wanted
to point out that I forgot to

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:58.850
here is you'll notice that
there's no subscript to the s.

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:02.120
We said we have a subscript to
the p, for example, that

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.150
describes what m is equal to.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:07.000
The reason that we have no
subscript to the s, is because

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.630
the only possibility for m when
you have an s orbital is

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:12.770
that m has to be equal to 0.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.280
So we just assume it, you don't
actually have to write

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.540
it because there is, in fact,
only one possibility.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.270
We can also figure out the
energy of this orbital here,

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:23.990
and the energy is equal to
the Rydberg constant.

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:25.750
The negative of the Rydberg
constant now

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:28.110
divided by 2 squared.

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:30.770
So we can go on and do this for
any orbital or any state

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:32.430
function that we
would like to.

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:36.400
So, for example, if we talk
about the 2, 1, 1 state label,

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.100
that's just psi 2, 1, 1.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.910
What, in this case, would
be our orbital?

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:44.660
2 p what?

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:49.750
OK, good, I heard mixed answers,
which is correct.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:53.390
So you can either write 2 p x
or 2 p y, whichever one you

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.430
want is fine.

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:58.270
And again, you'll notice that
our energy is absolutely the

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:01.870
same for an electron in
that 2 p x orbital

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:04.420
and in the 2 s orbital.

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.640
So that's true for a hydrogen
atom, it doesn't matter if

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.570
you're in a p or an s orbital,
their energies are the same.

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:13.970
Then we can also talk about the
2, 1, 0 state function,

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:15.880
which would be psi 2, 1, 0.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:16.670
What is this orbital?

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:18.810
Yup.

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:20.360
And there's only one correct
answer here,

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.590
which is to 2 p z.

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:26.700
Is the energy going to be the
same or different as up here?

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.150
It's going to be the
same energy.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:30.840
Again, the reason for that is
because the energy only

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.030
depends on the n value
here, it doesn't

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.850
depend on l or on m.

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:38.660
So finally, if we talk about our
last example of when n is

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:42.240
going to be equal 2, we can
have 2, 1 for l and

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.840
then minus 1 for m.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.570
We can re-write this as
psi 2 1 negative 1.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:50.570
And then our orbital is going
to be just the opposite of

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:52.370
whatever we said
it was up here.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:56.720
So if you said 2 p x the first
time, say 2 p y this time.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.240
And again, our energy is going
to be the same where we again

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.230
only depend on the n value.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:03.550
All right.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:06.230
So hopefully we're pretty
comfortable naming any type of

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:09.280
wave function using the
chemist terminology.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.920
Let's switch to a clicker
question and just confirm that

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.690
that is, in fact, true.

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:18.300
So what's the corresponding
orbital if we talk about this

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:27.530
state, 5, 1, 0?

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:42.180
And you can go ahead and give
10 seconds on that.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.340
OK.

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:45.980
All right, 77%.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:49.400
So, that's OK, you don't have to
memorize things as I speak,

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.310
you just need to go back and
look at this and make sure you

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:54.890
understand how to name it and
that you'll be able to, for

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:58.090
example, by next class, get
a similar clicker question

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:01.530
correct, and good job to the
77% that did get it.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.140
So I think we're safe
to move on here.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:07.290
And I just want to point out
that now we have these three

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:08.010
quantum numbers.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:09.940
The reason there are three
quantum numbers is we're

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:13.000
describing an orbital in three
dimensions, so it makes sense

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.360
that we would need to describe
in terms of three different

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.620
quantum numbers.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:20.760
And the complete description, as
I said, is from n l and m.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.060
And when you talk about n for an
orbital, it's talking about

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:27.150
the shell -- that shell is kind
of what you picture when

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:29.900
you think of a classical picture
of an atom where you

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.870
have 1 energy level, the next
one is further out, the next

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:34.780
one's further away.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.440
That's kind of your shell
that we're discussing.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:43.700
L is the sub shell here, and
then we have m, which is

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:47.420
finally the complete description
of the orbital.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:52.070
And what you can see is that for
any n that has an l equals

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:54.720
0, you can see here how there's
only one possibility

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.250
for and orbital description, and
that's why we don't need

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:01.910
to include the m when we're
talking about and s orbital.

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:04.350
The other thing that we know,
which is what we were just

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:06.870
discussing when we were going
through the table is how this

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:08.730
all relates to energy.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:11.720
And I want to really highlight
here we're talking about for a

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.280
hydrogen atom -- orbitals
with the same n value

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.980
have the same energy.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.510
Some of you might be saying in
your heads, wait a second, I

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:22.780
happen to know, I happen to
remember from high school,

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.960
that p orbitals have different
energies then,

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.620
for example, s orbitals.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.580
And that is not true for one
electron atoms. We're going to

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:34.175
get to more complicated atoms
eventually where we're going

00:21:34.175 --> 00:21:37.450
to have more than one electron
in it, but when we're talking

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:40.370
about a single electron atom,
we know that the binding

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:43.100
energy is equal to the negative
of the Rydberg

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:46.640
constant over n squared, so
it's only depends on n.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.260
So, for example, if we're
talking about the n equals 2

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:53.240
state, all of these four orbital
descriptions are going

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.690
to have the same energy.

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:57.560
And we can generalize to figure
out, based on any

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:01.710
principle quantum number n, how
many orbitals we have of

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:07.460
the same energy, and what we can
say is that for any shell

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.810
n, there are n squared
degenerate orbitals.

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:15.730
And the word degenerate simply
means same energy, so you have

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:18.620
n squared orbitals that are of
equal energy when they're

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.430
degenerate.

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:24.400
So, let's look at where this
comes from with an energy

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.090
level diagram here.

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:35.210
So what you can see is again,
we've got this ground state.

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:38.030
So if we go to the ground state,
what you see is we're

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:41.260
at that lowest energy level,
and we only have one

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.320
possibility for an orbital,
because when n equals 1,

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.690
that's all we can do.

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:49.950
So that's the 1 s orbital --
we have n squared or 1

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:51.760
degenerate orbitals.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:57.100
When we talk about the n equals
2 state, we now have 2

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:01.460
squared or 4 degenerate same
energy orbitals, and those are

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:03.900
the 2 s orbital.

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:08.590
And then we also have the l
being equal to 1 orbital, so

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:12.030
those are going to be the
2 p x, the 2 p z,

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:13.290
and the 2 p y orbital.

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:16.980
All four of these orbitals have
the same energy, they're

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.060
degenerate.

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:21.990
And as we go up the next energy
level, which is based

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:25.250
on n equals 3 principle quantum
number, well now we

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:29.045
have again the s, so we have the
3 s orbital, we're going

00:23:29.045 --> 00:23:34.350
to have three 3 p orbitals,
right, so we'll have 3 p x, 3

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:38.280
p z, and 3 p y, and now we're
actually also going to have

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:41.470
five different possible
l equals 2 orbitals.

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:44.970
Does anyone remember
the l equals 2?

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:46.110
Yes, everyone remembers.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:46.670
Good.

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:49.640
So we have five possible
d orbitals.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:55.540
We'll call these here the 3 d x
y, as the subscript, the 3 d

00:23:55.540 --> 00:24:03.430
y z, the 3 d z squared, the 3
d x z, and the 3 d x squared

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:05.740
minus y squared.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:10.360
So, what do you need
to know here?

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.350
What you need to know is
that when m equals

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:16.550
0, it's 3 d z squared.

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:17.540
That's it.

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:22.740
Again, these other p -- or the
d x y, d y z, those are going

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.340
to be those more complicated
linear combinations, you don't

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:26.840
need to worry about them.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.250
Eventually you will, at least,
need to know the labels and

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:30.630
know a little bit
more about them.

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:33.190
And in the second half of this
course, Professor Drennen's

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:36.320
going to talk to us about
transition metals in depth,

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.910
and that's when we'll really
delve into d orbitals.

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:41.360
For right now, you can kind of
put the d orbitals in the back

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:41.840
of your head.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.990
You need to know how to think
about them in the same way we

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:47.950
think about s and p orbitals,
but for example, you don't yet

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:51.520
need to know what all of the
names are except for this 3 d

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.340
z squared here.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:56.070
So we'll wait on that until
we start talking more

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:58.910
specifically about atoms where
the d orbital becomes very

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:00.890
significant.

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:03.660
So, what we can see is
this degeneracy.

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:07.130
So what we know now is we can
start thinking about the next

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:10.150
step because we can fully
describe the energy of

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:13.890
orbitals, and we can fully
describe a complete orbital in

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:16.270
terms of its three quantum
numbers, and its three

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:19.830
positional variables,
r, theta, and phi.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:23.050
So next we can think about okay,
what is actually a wave

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:25.990
function, and for example,
what might the shape of

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:29.130
different wave functions be.

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:31.370
So essentially, what we're
asking for here is the

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:34.876
physical interpretation of psi,
of the value of psi for

00:25:34.876 --> 00:25:36.210
an electron.

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:39.560
And it turns out that the answer
to can we have this

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.640
physical interpretation of
thinking about what psi means,

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.190
the answer is really
no, that we can't.

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:48.310
There's no classical way to
think about what a wave

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:49.460
function is.

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.580
There's no classical analogy
that explains oh, this is what

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:56.080
you can kind of picture when you
picture a wave function.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.960
And that's somewhat inconvenient
because we're

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.940
working with wave functions, but
it's a reality that comes

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:04.050
out of quantum mechanics often,
which is that we're

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:07.120
describing a world that is so
much different from the world

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.170
that we observe on a day-to-day
basis, that we're

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:10.450
not always going to
be able to make

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:12.240
those one-to-one analogies.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.670
But luckily we don't have to
worry about how we're going to

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:17.440
picture all this, now that I
said that, because even though

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.720
there's no physical
interpretation for what a wave

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.830
function is, there is a physical
interpretation for

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:25.620
what a wave function
squared means.

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:29.300
So when we talk about a wave
function squared, we're taking

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:32.140
the square of the wave function,
any one that we

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:36.810
specify between n, l and m, at
any position that we specify

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:38.920
based on r, theta, and phi.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:42.040
And if we go ahead and square
that, then what we get is a

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.710
probability density, and
specifically it's the

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:49.280
probability of finding an
electron in a certain small

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.300
defined volume away
from the nucleus.

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:54.680
So it's a probability density.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.260
The important point here is it's
not just a probability,

00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:59.530
it's a density, so we know
that it's a probability

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:01.690
divided by volume.

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:04.420
And the person we have to thank
for actually giving us

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:07.010
this more concrete way to
think about what a wave

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:10.570
function squared is
is Max Born here.

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:14.820
And actually after the
Schrodinger equation first was

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:18.150
put forth, people had a lot of
discussions about how is it

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:21.250
that we can actually interpret
what this wave function means,

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:24.260
and a lot of ideas were put
forth, and none of them worked

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.440
out to match up with
observations until Max Born

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.700
here came up with the idea that
we just square the wave

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.350
function, and that's the
probability density of finding

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:36.130
an electron in a certain
defined volume.

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:38.660
And it's very helpful because
it gives us a way

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:39.730
to think about it.

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:42.410
We can't actually go ahead and
derive this equation of the

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:45.655
wave function squared, because
no one ever derived it, it's

00:27:45.655 --> 00:27:47.960
just an interpretation, but it's
an interpretation that

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.120
works essentially perfectly.

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.380
Ever since this was first
proposed, there has never been

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:56.360
any observations that do not
coincide with the idea, that

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.680
did not match the fact that
the probability density is

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.480
equal to the wave function
squared.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:06.020
So, also about Max Born, just to
give you a little bit of a

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.910
trivial pursuit type knowledge,
he not only gave us

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:13.010
this relationship between wave
function squared, he also gave

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:15.420
us Olivia Newton-John.

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.950
This is her grandfather, I don't
know if you can see from

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:19.980
the eyes, I feel like there's
a little bit of

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.640
a resemblance there.

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:25.086
So, I don't know what she grew
up hearing about when she went

00:28:25.086 --> 00:28:27.210
to her grandparents' house, but
it might have been wave

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:29.080
function squared.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:33.290
So, a little tidbit of knowledge
for you that's

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:36.140
somewhat trivial.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:40.320
Then back to the non-trivial
knowledge that is not trivial

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.190
at all, in fact, is OK, how
do we think about this

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:45.140
probability density now
that we have a little

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.510
bit more of an idea.

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:50.120
We know that it's a density,
it's not an actual

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:50.860
probability.

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:53.850
So, one way we could look at
it is by looking at this

00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:58.610
density dot diagram, where the
density of the dots correlates

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:00.720
to the probability density.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:05.960
So, what you see is near the
nucleus, the density is the

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.200
strongest, the dots are
closest together.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:11.250
As you get far away from the
nucleus, the dots get farther

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:15.810
and farther apart, meaning the
probability density at those

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:19.490
volumes far away from the
nucleus is going to be quite

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:22.610
low, eventually going to almost
zero, although it turns

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:25.060
out that it never goes to
exactly zero, so if we're

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:28.640
talking about any orbital or
any atom, it never actually

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.770
ends, it never goes to zerio.

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:32.590
But it turns out the
probability is only

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:34.810
significant within
one angstrom.

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:37.470
So you can either say that
electrons are very, very tiny

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:40.070
or that they're never ending,
and both are pretty accurate

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:43.730
ways to think about
what an atom is.

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:47.360
So, that's probability density,
but in terms of

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.150
thinking about it in terms of
actual solutions to the wave

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:52.390
function, let's take a little
bit of a step back here.

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:55.870
I have yet to show you the
solution to a wave function

00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:58.680
for the hydrogen atom, so let
me do that here, and then

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.760
we'll build back up to
probability densities, and it

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.820
turns out that if we're
talking about any wave

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.500
function, we can actually
break it up into two

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:09.950
components, which are called the
radial wave function and

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:12.230
angular wave function.

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:15.040
So, essentially we're just
breaking it up into two parts

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:18.270
that can be separated, and the
part that is only dealing with

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:22.030
the radius, so it's only a
function of the radius of the

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:24.520
electron from the nucleus.

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:28.460
And we abbreviate that by
calling it r, which is

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:31.290
specified by two quantum
numbers, and an l as a

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:34.130
function of little r, radius.

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:37.330
And we have the angular wave
function, which is specified

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:41.010
by l and m, and it's a function
of the two angles

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:43.430
when we're describing the
position of the electron, so

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:45.780
theta and phi.

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:49.060
So, let's look at what this
actually is for what we're

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.840
showing here is the
1 s hydrogen atom.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.780
If you look in your book there's
a whole table of

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:56.330
different solutions to the
Schrodinger equation for

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:58.570
several different
wave functions.

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:00.700
So this is the 1 s, you can
look it up if you're

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:04.810
interested for the 2 s, or 3 s,
or 5 s, or whatever you're

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:05.040
curious about.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.150
But what I'm going to show you
here is the 1 s solution.

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:11.670
So you can see there's this
radial part here, and you have

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:14.370
the angular part, you can
combine the two parts to get

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:16.170
the total wave function.

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:20.470
And what you can see is we have
this new constant that we

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:22.000
haven't seen before.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.030
So what do you see in
there that is new?

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:26.220
Yeah.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:27.520
This a sub nought.

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.410
That's a new constant for
us in this course.

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:35.950
This is what's called the Bohr
radius, and we'll explain --

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:38.940
hopefully we'll get to it today
where this Bohr radius

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:41.930
name comes from, but for now
what you need to know is just

00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:44.630
that it's a constant, just treat
it like a constant, and

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:47.050
it turns out to be
equal to 52 .

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:51.620
9 pekameters or about
1/2 an angstrom.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:54.510
The more important thing that
I want you to notice when

00:31:54.510 --> 00:32:01.540
you're looking at this wave
equation for a 1 s h atom, is

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:04.570
the fact that if you look at the
angular component of the

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:08.160
wave function, you'll notice
that it's a constant.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:12.200
It doesn't depend on theta,
it doesn't depend on phi.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.120
No matter where you specify your
electron is in terms of

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:18.160
those two angles, it doesn't
matter the angular part of

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:21.090
your wave function is going
to be the same.

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:23.220
So, what does that
mean for us?

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:26.370
Well, essentially what that
tells is that these s orbitals

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:28.190
are spherically symmetrical.

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:30.050
That should make sense, right,
because they're only

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:31.190
dependent on r.

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:34.880
How far you are away from the
nucleus in terms of a radius,

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.910
they don't depend at all on
those two angles, they're

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:42.960
independent of theta and they're
independent of phi.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.820
So, what I'm showing in this
picture here is just an

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:48.280
electron cloud that
you can see.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:51.720
Think of it as a probability
density plot.

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:55.880
And what here is just a graph of
the 1 s wave function going

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:59.810
across some radius defined this
way, and you can see that

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:02.955
the probability -- well, this
is the wave function, so we

00:33:02.955 --> 00:33:05.820
would have to square it and
think about the probability.

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:11.480
So this squared at the origin
is going to be a very high

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:14.880
probability, and it decays off
as you get farther and farther

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:18.160
away from the nucleus or from
the center, and that's

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.370
independent of the angle.

00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:24.400
So, let's look at these
probability plots of different

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:34.660
s orbitals here, and up top
here, we have the probability

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:38.230
density plot and what you can
see is what I just said, a

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:40.060
very high probability density
in the nucleus,

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.670
decays as you go out.

00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:45.200
And what is plotted below is the
actual wave function, so

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.390
you can see it starts very high
and then the decays down.

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:51.750
More interesting is to look
at the 2 s wave function.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:54.620
So, if we look at the bottom
here and the actual plot of

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:57.980
the wave function, we see it
starts high, very positive,

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:01.380
and it goes down and it
eventually hits zero, and goes

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:04.480
through zero and then becomes
negative and then never quite

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.150
hits zero again, although
it approaches zero.

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:10.050
So, at this place where it hits
zero, that means that the

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:12.650
square of the wave function is
also going to be zero, right.

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:17.110
So we can see if we look at the
probability density plot,

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:20.100
we can see there's a place where
the probability density

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.880
of finding an electron anywhere
there is actually

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:25.370
going to be zero.

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:28.460
So we can think of a third case
where we have the 3 s

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:31.580
orbital, and in the 3 s orbital
we see something

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:35.040
similar, we start high, we go
through zero, where there will

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:38.040
now be zero probability density,
as we can see in the

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.250
in the density plot graph.

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:43.850
Then we go negative and we go
through zero again, which

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:47.170
correlates to the second area of
zero, that shows up also in

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:50.850
our probability density plot,
and then we're positive again

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:55.740
and approach zero as we
go to infinity for r.

00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:58.830
So, what this means is that
when we're looking at an

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:01.960
actual wave function, we're
treating it as a wave, right,

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:05.620
so waves can have both
magnitude, but they can also

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:08.380
have a direction,
so they can be

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.420
either positive or negative.

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:13.160
So, for example, if we were
looking at the actual wave

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:15.880
function, we would say that
these parts here have a

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.180
positive amplitude,
and in here we

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:20.040
have a negative amplitude.

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:23.460
And when we're looking at the
probability density graphs, it

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:26.650
doesn't make a difference, it's
okay, It has no meaning

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:29.800
for our actual plot there,
because we're squaring it, so

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.290
it doesn't matter whether it's
negative or positive, all that

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:34.040
matters is the magnitude.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.080
But when we're thinking about
actual wave behavior of

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:39.170
electrons, it's just important
to keep in the back of our

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:42.250
head that some areas have
positive amplitude and some

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:43.350
have negative.

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:46.210
So we'll talk about this more
we get into p orbitals and

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:48.090
bonding is where it's going
to become an issue.

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:50.990
So I just want to kind of
introduce that idea here.

00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:54.340
Because if we think about wave
behavior of electrons and

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:57.160
we're forming bonds, then what
we have to do is have

00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:00.620
constructive interference of 2
different electrons, right, to

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:04.380
form a bond, we want to and
together those probabilities.

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.110
So we want to have constructive
interference to

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:10.530
form a bond, whereas if we had
destructive interference, we

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:12.240
would not be forming a bond.

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.590
So that's where you have to
think about whether it's

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:15.580
positive or negative.

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:17.540
You don't have to think about
it right now, but you might

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:19.580
have heard in high school
talking about p orbitals, the

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:23.420
phase, sometimes you mark a p
orbital as being a plus sign

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:24.200
or negative sign.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:27.980
Did any of you do that in
high school at all?

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:28.950
A little bit, yeah.

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:31.900
So, that's having to do with
the actual wave function.

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.130
So, that'll become more relevant
later, bonding

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:36.840
actually, a couple lectures
down the road.

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.180
But I just want to introduce it
here while we do, in fact,

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:42.630
have the wave function
plots up here.

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:45.100
But a real key in looking at
these plots is where we, in

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:47.590
fact, did go through
zer and have this

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:49.520
zero probability density.

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:54.300
We call that a node, and a node,
more specifically, is

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:58.790
any value of either r, the
radius, or the two angles for

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:01.460
which the wave function, and
that also means the wave

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:04.370
function squared or the
probability density, is going

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:06.910
to be equal to zero.

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:10.310
So, we can see in our
1 s orbital, how

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:12.910
many nodes do we have?

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:13.970
There's no nodes, yeah.

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:16.500
It looks like we hit zero, but
we actually don't -- remember

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.720
that we never go all the way
to zero, so there's these

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.460
little points if we were to look
really carefully at an

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:25.080
accurate probability density
plot, it would never

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.540
actually hit zero.

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:29.780
And then, for example, how many
nodes do we have in the 3

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:31.810
s orbital? two.

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:32.890
That's correct.

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:35.740
So we have two nodes
in the 3 s orbital.

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:39.610
We can actually specify where
those nodes are, which is

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:40.760
written on your notes.

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:45.420
For the 2 s orbital, at 2 a
nought, so it's just 2 times

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:49.080
that constant a nought, which
is the Bohr radius.

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.040
And for the 3 s, we
have one at 1 .

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.560
9 a nought, and one at 7 .

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:55.340
1 a nought.

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:58.770
We can also specify what kind
of node we're talking about.

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:02.570
We'll introduce in the next
course angular nodes, but

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:05.460
today we're just going to be
talking about radial nodes,

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:09.820
and a radial node is a value
for r at which psi, and

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:12.420
therefore, also the probability
psi squared is

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:14.460
going to be equal to zero.

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:17.830
So, when we're talking about an
s orbital, since there is

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:20.890
no angular dependence, and it
only depends on r, every

00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:23.420
single one of our nodes is
actually going to specifically

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:26.180
be a radial node, right,
because these are, for

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:29.620
example, this 2 a nought is a
value of r, a value of the

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:33.610
radius, no matter which way you
go around at which there's

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:36.170
going to be a node at which
there is zero probability

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:40.030
density of finding an
electron there.

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:42.260
So, it's very easy to calculate,
however, the number

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:44.660
of radial nodes, and this works
not just for s orbitals,

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:47.680
but also for p orbitals, or d
orbitals, or whatever kind of

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:49.910
work of orbitals you
want to discuss.

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:52.940
And that's just to take the
principle quantum number and

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:57.800
subtract it by 1, and then also
subtract from that your l

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:58.700
quantum number.

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:03.030
So what you can do for a 1 s
is just take 1 minus 1 and

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:07.280
then l is equal to 0, so you
have zero radial nodes.

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.400
And that matches up
with what we saw.

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:14.370
If we try this for the 2 s,
we have 2 minus 1 minus 0.

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:17.420
So what we should expect to see
is one radial node, and

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:21.730
that is what we see here in the
probability density plot.

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:26.200
And then if we think about 3 s,
we want to start with 3, we

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:31.030
subtract 1, again l is equal to
0, so minus 0 and we have

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:34.120
two radial nodes.

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:36.220
So, this should be pretty
straight forward, let's see if

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:39.900
we can get close to a 100% on
this one, which is how many

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:49.440
radial nodes does a
4 p orbital have?

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.310
And let's give 10 seconds
on that, make

00:39:51.310 --> 00:40:04.710
you think fast here.

00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:08.910
OK, so most people were
correct, or well, the

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:11.630
majority, at least,
were correct.

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:15.450
And seeing that it's a 4 p has
two nodes -- let's just write

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:18.310
this out since not everyone
did get it correct.

00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:21.810
So, if we're talking about a 4 p
orbital, and our equation is

00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:28.030
n minus 1 minus l, the principle
quantum number is 4,

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:31.680
1 is 1 -- what is l
for a p orbital?

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.560
STUDENT: 1.

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:34.190
PROFESSOR: 1.

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:36.250
So, I tricked you a little, I
guess I didn't put an s up

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:37.910
there and that's what we had
been talking about, so that

00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:39.220
was probably the issue.

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:47.230
But what we find is that we
have two radial nodes.

00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:47.500
All right.

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:50.890
So we can switch back
to our notes here.

00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:54.800
So, doing those probability
density dot graphs, we can get

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.760
an idea of the shape of those
orbitals, we know that they're

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.640
spherically symmetrical.

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.140
We're not going to talk about p
orbitals today, we're going

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.970
to talk about p orbitals
exclusively on Friday, and as

00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:07.710
I said, d orbitals you'll get
to with Professor Drennen.

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:12.490
But we can also think when
we're talking about wave

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:15.570
function squared, what we're
really talking about is the

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:16.940
probability density, right, the

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:19.130
probability in some volume.

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:21.850
But there's also a way to get
rid of the volume part and

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:24.443
actually talk about the
probability of finding an

00:41:24.443 --> 00:41:30.710
electron at some certain area
within the atom, and this is

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:35.090
what we do using radial
probability

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:37.550
distribution graphs.

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:40.360
And what that is the probability
of finding an

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:43.880
electron in some shell where we
define the thickness as d

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:47.540
r, some distance, r,
from the nucleus.

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:49.510
So, think about what
we're saying here.

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:52.740
We're saying the probability of
finding an electron at some

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:56.390
distance from the nucleus in
some very thin shell that we

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:58.300
describe by d r.

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:00.700
So if you think of a shell, you
can actually just think of

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:02.870
an egg shell, that's probably
the easiest way to think of

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:05.460
it, where the yolk, if you
really maybe make it a lot

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.230
smaller might be the nucleus.

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:09.790
And let's also make our egg
perfectly symmetric and

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:11.200
perfectly round.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:14.910
But still, when we're talking
about the radial probability

00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:18.140
distribution, what we actually
want to think about is what's

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:22.150
the probability of finding the
electron in that shell?

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:24.690
Think of it as that
egg shell part.

00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:28.320
So, we can do that by using this
equation, which is for s

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.970
orbitals where the radial
probability distribution is

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:34.540
going to be equal to 4 pi
r squared times the wave

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:36.900
function squared, d r.

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:44.320
That should make sense to us,
because when we talk about a

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:52.260
wave function, we're talking
about a probability divided by

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:53.800
a volume, because we're
talking about

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.750
a probability density.

00:42:55.750 --> 00:43:00.240
So if we actually go ahead and
multiply it by the volume of

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:03.570
our shell, then we end up just
with probability, which is

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:06.520
kind of a nicer term to be
thinking about here.

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:09.070
So, of course, if we're talking
about a perfectly

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:12.600
spherical shell at some
distance, thickness, d r, we

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:16.430
talk about it as 4 pi r squared
d r, so we just

00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:20.780
multiply that by the probability
density.

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:25.740
We can graph out what this is
where we're graphing the

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:31.410
radial probability density as
a function of the radius.

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:35.620
And what you see is that at
zero, you start at zero.

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:39.790
And so, the radial probability
density at the nucleus is

00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:42.840
going to be zero, even though
we know the probability

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:46.390
density at the nucleus is very
high, that's actually where is

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:49.180
the highest. The reason in
our radial probability

00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:56.060
distributions we start -- the
reason, if you look at the

00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:58.880
zero point on the radius that
we start at zero is because

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:02.810
we're multiplying the
probability density by some

00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:05.560
volume, and when we're not
anywhere from the nucleus,

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:07.620
that volume is defined
as zero.

00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:09.450
So, it's a little bit artificial
that we're seeing

00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:11.020
that zero point there.

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:13.980
So, actually I want you to go
ahead in your notes and circle

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:17.820
that zero point and write "not
a node." This is not a node

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:19.660
because a node is where
we actually have

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:21.410
no probability density.

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:24.370
So this, where we start at zero
is not a node, is the

00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:27.060
first thing to point out.

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:30.370
And as we get further and
further from the radius, the

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:32.930
volume we're multiplying it by
actually gets bigger and

00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:35.480
bigger, because you can see how
the volume of that little

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:38.100
thin shell is going to get
larger and larger as you get

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:39.180
further away.

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:43.470
So there's some distance where
the probability of actually

00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:45.800
finding an electron there is
going to be your maximum

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:46.830
probability.

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:50.020
And that's what we label
as r sub m p, or your

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:52.970
most probable radius.

00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:55.900
This is the point at which your
probability is highest

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:57.470
for finding an electron.

00:44:57.470 --> 00:45:01.870
This is equal to a sub nought
for a hydrogen atom, and we

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:05.260
remember that that's just our
Bohr radius, which is 0 .

00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:11.450
5 2 9 angstroms. And basically,
what that means is

00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:15.390
you can actually find an
electron anywhere going away

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:18.090
from the nucleus, but you're
most likely to find that you

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:21.360
have the highest probability at
a distance of a sub nought,

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:23.970
or the Bohr radius.

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:25.920
So, I said I'd tell you a little
bit more about where

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:30.010
this Bohr radius came from, and
it came from a model of

00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:34.320
the atom that pre-dated quantum
mechanics, and Neils

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:38.230
Bohr is who came up with the
idea of the Bohr radius, and

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:41.870
here is hanging out with
Einstein, so he had some

00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:44.980
pretty good company
that he kept.

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:48.060
And what you need to remember
when we're thinking about this

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:51.450
model of the atom is that in
1911 it had already been

00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:53.880
discovered that we have an
electron, and we have a

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:56.750
nucleus, and there needs to be
some way that those two hang

00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:59.960
together, but it was not for
another 15 years that we

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:02.970
actually had the Schrodinger
equation that allowed us to

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:07.130
understand the interaction fully
between the electron and

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:07.630
the nucleus.

00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:10.900
So all that Bohr, for example,
had to go on at this point was

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:14.560
a more classical picture of the
atom, as you can see on

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:17.840
the left side of the screen
there, which is the idea that

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:20.680
the electrons actually somehow
just orbiting the nucleus.

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:23.440
And even though he could figure
out that this wasn't

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.840
possible, he still used this as
a starting point, and what

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:31.170
he did know was that these
energy levels that were within

00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:34.270
hydrogen atom were quantized.
and he knew this the same way

00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:37.230
that we saw it in the last
class, which is when we viewed

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:40.200
the difference spectra coming
out from the hydrogen, and we

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:43.130
also did it for neon, but we saw
in the hydrogen atom that

00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:46.130
it was very discreet energy
levels that we could observe.

00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:47.950
He knew the same thing
that had been

00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:49.440
observed by that point.

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:53.490
So, what he did was kind of
impose a quantum mechanical

00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:56.270
model, not a full one, just
the idea that those energy

00:46:56.270 --> 00:47:00.220
levels were quantized on to the
classical picture of an

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:02.890
atom that has a discreet
orbit.

00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:06.130
And what he came out with when
he did some calculations is

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:09.710
that there's the radius that he
could calculate was equal

00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:13.190
to this number a sub nought,
which is what we call the Bohr

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:17.550
radius, and it turns out that
the Bohr radius happens to be

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:21.220
the radius most probable
for a hydrogen atom.

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:23.850
And the reason we won't talk any
more about this Bohr model

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:26.120
is because, of course,
it's not correct.

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:28.580
So we're not going to spend
too much time on it here.

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:31.860
But we can see, for example, one
reason or one way in which

00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:33.010
is not correct.

00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:37.130
Because what it tells is that we
can figure out exactly what

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:41.110
the radius of an electron
and a nucleus are

00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:42.550
in a hydrogen atom.

00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:45.100
That's a deterministic way of
doing things, that's what you

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:46.890
get from classical mechanics.

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:49.840
But the reality that we know
from our quantum mechanical

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:53.050
model, is that we can't know
exactly what the radius is,

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:56.640
all we can say is what the
probability is of the radius

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.980
being at certain different
points. so, that's a more

00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:01.620
complete quantum mechanical
picture of

00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:03.360
what is going on here.

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:05.800
So if we superimpose our
radial probability

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:09.290
distribution onto the Bohr
radius, we see it's much more

00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:11.400
complicated than just having
a discreet radius.

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:14.760
We can actually have any radius,
but some radii just

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:17.710
have much, much smaller
probabilities of actually

00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:20.890
being significant or not.

00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:24.050
So, I think we're a little bit
out of time today, but we'll

00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:26.670
start next class with thinking
about drawing radial

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:28.840
probability distributions
of more than

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:31.270
just the 1 s orbital.
