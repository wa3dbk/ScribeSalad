00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:22.340
PROFESSOR: All right,
let's get started.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.880
Could everyone take
10 more seconds

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.360
on the clicker question.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:35.250
And as a reminder, hopefully I
don't need to remind any of

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.810
you, but exam 1 is on Wednesday,
so rather than our

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.210
clicker question being on
something from last class,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.120
which is exam 2 material, let's
just make sure everyone

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.250
remembers some small topic from
exam 1 material, which is

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.170
the idea of angular nodes.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.160
So I was hoping to see more like
99% on this, but you do

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.590
still have two more days
before the exam.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.410
Remember, we're talking about
angular nodes here, so you

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.800
need to read the question
carefully.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.380
For an angular node, we're just
talking about what the l

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.290
value is, so whatever l is
equal to is equal to the

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.410
number of angular
nodes you have.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.800
For an f orbital, what is the
quantum number l equal to?

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.340
Three.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.370
Good, so everyone that
recognized that probably got

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.880
the right answer of three
angular nodes here.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.370
So let's switch to
today's notes.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.580
Two more quick things about the
exam, the first is that

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.020
just remember on Wednesday,
don't come here, the exam is

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.980
not here, don't come here.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.580
It's in Walker, so make
sure you go to Walker.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.480
And also, keep in mind that
I have office hours

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.220
today from 3 to 5.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.460
All your TA's have either
already have their extra

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.090
office hours, or there are some
that will be going on

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.650
tonight or tomorrow, so keep
those in mind as your

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.250
finishing up your studying
for the exam.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.340
So, today we're moving on,
we're talking about Lewis

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.340
structures.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.550
This is a really good topic to
do the class before an exam

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.700
because it's a little bit
of a lighter topic.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.250
We remember that Lewis
structures are an idea that

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.190
are pre-quantum mechanics.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.130
So that means that we don't
have to worry about things

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.170
like wave functions when we're
talking about Lewis

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.980
structures, but because they're
so simple to use and

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.930
because they so often predict
the electron configuration of

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.100
molecules accurately, we end up
using them all the time in

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.610
chemistry, so it's very valuable
to know how to draw

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.830
them correctly and to know
how to work with them.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.760
So we'll talk specifically about
drawing Lewis structures

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.520
and then about formal charge
and resonance, which are

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.060
within Lewis structures.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.460
So remember, that when we talked
about Lewis structure,

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.640
the organizing principle behind
Lewis structures is the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.420
idea that within the molecule
the atoms are going to arrange

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.930
their valence electrons, such
that each atom within the

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.320
molecule has a complete octet
or full outer shell.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.780
So this is the idea of the octet
rule that Lewis came up

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.360
with way back in 1902.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.480
So, at the end of the class on
Friday, we saw that list of

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.650
eight steps that you always need
to go through when you

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.300
draw a Lewis structure.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.140
Once you're doing this on your
own, especially, for example,

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.010
on exam 2, which is a ways down
the road, you won't be

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.510
able to look at those steps, so
you need to make sure that

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.800
you can go through them without
looking at them, but

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.820
for now we can look at them as
we are actually learning how

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.050
to draw the Lewis structures,
and rather just go through

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.250
them step-by-step, it's
more interesting to

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.700
do it with an example.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.770
So let's hydrogen cyanide
as our first example.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.780
So we have h c n.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.360
So, in this example here, we
start with the first step --

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.310
the first step in any Lewis
structure is drawing the

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.940
skeletal structure.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.520
So, essentially drawing how the
atoms are arranged within

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.830
our molecule.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.860
And in this case we have three
choices here in terms of

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.730
what's going to be in the
middle, so we need to decide

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.040
that first.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.640
In terms of where different
atoms are in a molecule, if

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.270
you have a hydrogen atom or a
fluorine atom, you can pretty

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.120
much guarantee they're always
going to be terminal atoms.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.620
By terminal I mean they're
only bonded to one thing.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.080
So, for example, hydrogen or
fluorine they'll never be in

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.500
the middle, they'll always be
on the end of a molecule.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.750
So that takes care of the
hydrogen, what about between

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.250
the carbon and the nitrogen?

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.100
In terms of picking a Lewis
structure that's going to be

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.340
the lowest energy, what you
want to do is put the atom

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.730
with the lowest ionization
energy in the

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.300
center of your atom.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.840
This should make sense because
if something has a low

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.160
ionization energy, that means
it's not very electronegative,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.500
which means it's going to be a
lot happier giving up electron

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.020
density, which is essentially
what you're doing when you're

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.450
forming covalent bonds is you're
sharing some of your

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.740
electron density.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.000
So, we keep the atoms with the
lowest ionization energy in

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.890
the center.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.300
So, why don't you go ahead and
tell me, keeping that in mind,

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.910
which atom in terms of h c or
n would you expect to be in

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.550
the center of hydrogen
cyanide?

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.670
And I put a periodic table up
there, just the part you might

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.450
need to look at.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:05:07.950
So this should be fast, so
let's take 10 seconds.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.280
All right, good job everyone.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.190
So most of you saw that carbon
should be in the center.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.680
Carbon should be in the center
because it has the lowest

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.130
ionization energy.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.000
We know that ionization energy
is going to increase as we go

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.770
across the periodic table, so
that means carbon has a lower

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.810
ionization energy than
nitrogen, which is

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.170
right next to us.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.920
So as I just said, we want to
put that one in the middle.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.230
You got an extra hint here in
terms of the order, so even if

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.720
you had just forgotten what I
said, sometimes it's not a

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.970
terrible idea just to put it
in the order it's written,

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.240
that can give you a lot
of clues as well.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.820
So, either of those ways of
figuring this out is the first

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.490
guess of what goes in the middle
will work pretty well.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.570
So, let's go ahead and draw our
Lewis structure based on

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.800
the rest of the rules now
that we have a skeleton.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.210
So our skeleton tells us that
carbon is in the middle, so

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.310
we'll put the h on one
side, and the n on

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.650
the other side there.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.070
So, our second step, as we go
through our Lewis structure

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.420
rules, is to figure out how many
valence electrons we have

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.510
in our entire molecule.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.340
So if we talk about hydrogen,
how many valence electrons are

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.390
we talking about?

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:17.380
1.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.550
What about carbon?

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.760
I heard 4 and 6.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.770
And remember, we're only
talking about valence

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.360
electrons, so the outer-most
shells.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.360
So we're talking about four
valence electrons for carbon.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.010
And then for nitrogen?

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.260
Lots of options I have to
choose from from these

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.870
answers, but it's 5.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.000
So, if you can't immediately
know, and you don't all have

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.210
periodic tables in front of you,
so that's fine, but if

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.940
you have a periodic table in
front of you, you need to be

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.210
able to count valence electrons,
so work on that if

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.450
it doesn't come naturally
to you in terms of

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:52.300
figuring that out.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.250
So then in order to figure out
the complete number of valence

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.300
electrons in our molecule, we
just add 5 plus 4 plus 1.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.610
So we end up having 10
valence electrons.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:09.100
Step three in our Lewis
structure rules is to figure

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.560
out how many electronis we would
need in order for every

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.260
single atom in our molecule to
have a full valence shell.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.980
So, if we're talking about
hydrogen, that's our one

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.520
exception so far to
the octet rule.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.670
So we actually only need two
electrons to fill up the

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.110
valence shell of hydrogen,
remember that's because all we

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.640
need to fill up is the 1 s.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:34.090
However, for carbon and nitrogen
we need 8 each.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.050
So in terms of total numbers
that we would need to complete

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.510
our octets and fill our valence
shells, we would need

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:48.650
18 electrons.

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:48.980
All right.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.970
So let's bring down our
middle slide here.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.890
So we have 18 electrons, and the
next thing that we need to

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:57.780
figure out is how many bonding
electrons we have.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.500
So to figure out bonding
electrons, what we take is

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.220
that number 18, which is our
total number of electrons we

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.450
need to fill valence shells,
and we subtract it from our

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:11.110
number of valence electrons,
which is 10.

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:18.570
And what we find that we have
is 8 bonding electrons.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:23.810
And hopefully on your paper, you
can actually reach your h

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:24.750
c n skeleton --

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.940
I think I should probably
re-draw mine here.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.710
Because step five is that we
need to fill in our bonding

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.920
electrons, and we start
it with filling in two

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.850
electrons per bond.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:39.800
So I'm just going to re-draw
my skeleton.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:44.420
So, the first thing we do is
put two electrons between h

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.970
and c, and then two electrons
between c and n.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:50.210
Remember, every time we have two
electrons that are being

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:54.400
shared, that's a single bond.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.930
The next thing that we want to
do is figure out do we have

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:59.400
any bonding electrons left.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.090
So let's see, we started with
8 bonding electrons, and we

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:08.990
used up only 4, so the answer
is yes, we have 4 bonding

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:10.790
electrons left.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:13.350
So what we need to do is fill
in those extra bonding

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.810
electrons into our bonds.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.850
Should I put an extra
pair of electrons

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.890
here, does anyone think?

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:20.590
No.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:22.850
The reason is because we already
have a full valence

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:24.220
shell for our hydrogen,
it doesn't

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:25.590
want anymore electrons.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.600
What about between the
carbon and nitrogen?

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.080
Yes.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.840
Definitely, because both of
these are not anywhere near

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.670
filling up their octets yet.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:37.820
So we can put actually all 4
of our extra electrons in

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.780
between the carbon
and the nitrogen.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:44.960
Now we have 6 things around the
nitrogen, and we have 8

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.700
around the carbon.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.970
So, what we do as our seventh
step is then figure out if we

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:56.840
have any extra valence electrons
left at all.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:01.280
So we started with 10 valence
electrons, we used up 8 of

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.600
those electrons in terms
of making bonds.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.380
So it turns out that we have
2 valence electrons left.

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.920
So we need to add those 2
valence electrons left as lone

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.010
pair electrons in
our structure.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:17.070
So, which atom is in need of
those lone pair electrons?

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.290
The nitrogen.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.500
The reason being that's the only
one that didn't have a

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.930
full octet yet.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:26.940
So now we're done, actually
there is one more step, which

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.650
is to determine the
formal charge.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:32.760
This is a good way to actually
check if your Lewis structure

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.170
is correct or not.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.490
We haven't actually learned how
to calculate the formal

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.830
charge yet, we'll
learn it soon.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:42.650
So we won't do it for this
molecule, but we'll go back

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.730
and do it for some of our other
examples, and you can go

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:46.380
back and do it for this one.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.560
The other thing is that we
can re-write our h c

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.860
n in terms of bonds.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.970
So we know every time we have
two electrons, that's a bond.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:57.130
So we have h, then we can
draw our bond as a line.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:59.870
And then we have a triple bond
there because we have 3 pairs

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.750
of electrons.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:07.010
So it looks a lot less messy
if we just draw our Lewis

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:11.540
structure like this for h c n,
where we have h bonded to c

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:14.650
triple, bonded to n, and
then a lone pair on

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.020
the nitrogen there.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.220
All right, so this is the same
procedure that we're going to

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.940
go through, regardless of what
kind of Lewis structure we're

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:22.850
going to draw.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:25.810
What you'll actually find in
terms of asking your TAs about

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:28.590
the Lewis structure rules is
that sometimes they won't be

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:31.350
as good at them as you are, and
the reason is once you've

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.480
drawn enough of these
structures, you start to get a

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.280
lot of chemical intuition about
what's right or what's

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.090
not right -- it just looks wrong
to you if it's wrong.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.600
So your TA might take a minute,
so be patient with

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.510
them if they see your structure
and they say oh, no,

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:45.580
no, no, no that's wrong, that's
terrible, and they

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.860
don't immediately know why.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.840
They might need to go through
the rules with you, you might

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.540
need to remind them.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.130
Hopefully, they'll all
study them again, so

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.470
this will be an issue.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.920
But what really happens is as
you go on in chemistry, you

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.180
draw so many of these you can
just draw them without

00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.730
following the rules.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:01.920
Some of you might get almost to
that point, or you might be

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.010
at that point now, but I
recommend this for you and for

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:08.640
me and for the TAs, go through
the rules because there'll be

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.790
cases where it's a little bit
tricky and it's always much

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:15.310
faster to have gone through
step-by-step, than to try to

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:18.170
just kind of hit or miss figure
out what's going to be

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:19.680
right or wrong.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:24.480
So, let's try another example
here, and let's try a case now

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.260
where instead of dealing with a
neutral molecule we have an

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.700
ion, so we have c n minus.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.360
And what I'll mention to you
just in terms of the fact that

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.390
we're finally dealing with real
molecules, which is -- or

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.770
molecules that are made up of
more than one atom, which is

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:42.680
kind of exciting for me and
maybe for some other of you

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.390
that like to move into thinking
about what some of

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:49.760
the consequences of these
molecules reacting might be.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.750
A lot of the examples that we're
going to give you in

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.450
terms of trying out your Lewis
structures will be molecule

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.010
that are used in organic
synthesis, or maybe they're

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:00.360
molecules that react in
interesting ways with

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.630
biomolecules in your body or
proteins in your body.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:06.660
So, you already will have a head
start when you get on to

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.120
later classes, like organic
chemistry or if you're

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.480
thinking about biochemistry
where being able to draw the

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.490
Lewis structure allows you to
think about, eventually, the

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:18.290
reactivity of the molecule,
which becomes very interesting

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.760
in thinking about how you're
going to synthesize a more

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.790
complex molecule, or how that
molecule is going to interact

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.580
with an active site in a
protein in the body.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:30.300
So, for example, just talking
about hydrogen cyanide or the

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:34.750
cyanide anion, these are both
molecules which are used in

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.780
organic synthesis, so
particularly the cyanide,

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:41.320
anion and salts of the
cyanide anion.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:45.920
So either a potassium cyanide
or sodium cyanide, these are

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.980
used in synthesis in terms of
making carbon-carbon bonds.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.120
So if you're trying to make
a more complicated organic

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.160
molecule, carbon-carbon bonds
are one of the most difficult

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.880
things to make an organic
chemistry, and it turns out

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.900
that c n minus is a very
reactive molecule, so it's a

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.460
good way, even though we'll go
over some drawbacks in a

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:07.450
second, it is a good way to
make carbon-carbon bonds.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:08.550
It's very reactive.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:12.100
And because, of course, we have
this carbon here what you

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.580
end up doing is adding a carbon
to your molecule.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:19.460
So, when you think about
cyanide, you might not think

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.560
about organic reagents.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.370
Does anyone have something else
they think about when

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:24.230
they think about cyanide?

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:25.600
STUDENT: Death.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.370
PROFESSOR: Death -- that's
a good thought.

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:31.980
Yes, cyanide and death, very
closely related as well.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.490
Cyanide is incredibly toxic,
it's a poison.

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:37.280
That might be how you're more
familiar with cyanide.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.110
So if you're working with
cyanide in the lab as

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:43.320
potassium cyanide or sodium
cyanide, those are what are

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.660
called p h s's, or particularly
hazardous

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.100
substances -- it's a rating for

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.780
different kinds of chemicals.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.950
And what that means it's
there's all sorts of

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:55.930
precautions and procedures you
take that are special when you

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:56.980
deal with these.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.120
They're kept away from
other chemicals.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.880
You handle them very special
in terms of being extra

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:07.330
careful in a very high
ventilation area, in hoods is

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:08.490
how you handle them.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:13.050
So, yes, they're very poisonous,
and in fact, there

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:16.880
are areas where you find this
toxic compound, cyanide.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:22.330
Other than just in poisons and
in organic synthesis shells,

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.870
you might also find them in
some things we're more

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.360
familiar with, such
as almonds.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.260
I don't know how many know that
there are trace , trace

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.900
amounts, of cyanide
in almonds.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.530
I don't know if there any big
almond eaters out there.

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:37.070
You don't have to worry, we're
definitely talking about

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:38.160
trace, trace amounts.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.790
It's not going to hurt you.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.720
And actually, what we usually
eat are what are called sweet

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:47.090
almonds, and there aren't actual
cyanide in the sweet

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:49.350
almonds we eat, there's
precursors to cyanide, which

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:50.640
might not make you
more comfortable.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.840
But the fact is there are
trace, trace amounts.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.150
This is nothing that we need to
worry in our food supply.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:59.130
However, some people
aren't so lucky.

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:01.100
I don't know how many of you are
familiar with the Cassava

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:05.070
plant, which is a kind of woody
shrub that's first been

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:08.050
cultivated in South America,
but it's grown throughout

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:12.020
Africa, the Caribbean, South
America still, many places

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:15.450
around the world, and this
is a major source of

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:18.590
carbohydrates for much of the
world, because Cassava root is

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:21.140
very, very rich in
carbohydrates.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.940
It's not the best form of food
in that they're actually very

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.820
poor in protein, and
unfortunately very, very rich

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.180
in cyanide.

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.080
So, these roots can
be very dangerous.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:35.010
There's different types of the
root that you can get called

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.120
the bitter and the sweet.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.710
Hopefully you would all choose
the sweet if two are put in

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:40.580
front of you.

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.200
The bitter, of course,
are the ones that are

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.800
very high in cyanide.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.450
If you eat these raw, which they
do in many places around

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:49.740
the world, if you eat a bitter
one, you could, in fact, get

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:51.670
enough cyanide to kill you.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:54.390
And there are ways to prepare
these, so it's important --

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:57.560
this kind of thinking more along
the food science idea.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.930
There's a way to actually grind
down and prepare the

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:03.180
flower, so that you promote the
enzymes within the plant

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.950
to breakdown the cyanide
precursors.

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:08.080
And if you put this in the
well-ventilated area, if you

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:11.980
prepare this outside, the h
c n gas will actually be

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.270
released into the air,
so you're safe,

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:15.730
you can eat it later.

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:18.970
About 80% of the cyanide at that
point is gone, so it does

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.720
render the root much
more safe.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.540
But you do, in fact, have
to worry about long-term

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.950
exposure, cyanide poisoning in
terms of long-term effects in

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:29.070
certain populations that do
get the bulk of their

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.460
carbohydrates from this
root, from the root

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:33.080
of the Cassava plant.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.680
But in terms of us going to the
grocery store and thinking

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.010
about things, probably we're all
breathing sighs of relief.

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:40.470
I just told you almonds
are not a

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:42.280
problem, no worries there.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.830
We probably don't find any forms
of the Cassava plant

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.540
ever in the U.S. that are
going to have that high

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:52.630
cyanide content, so we should
all be relieved.

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:55.910
Unless, of course, you're a
smoker, or you're thinking of

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:58.670
becoming a smoker, and then
maybe you should worry,

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:01.850
because this is one of the
advertisements that was airing

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:04.260
in terms of anti-smoking
campaign.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.730
Hydrogen cyanide is found
in cigarettes.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.740
So, if you're looking for
another reason to quit, if

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.490
you're looking for a reason not
to start smoking, here's

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:15.330
another good one.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:18.970
As I said, it's a particularly
hazardous substance, this is

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:20.040
worked with in fume hoods.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.230
You don't want to inhale
it, it's definitely not

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:23.750
recommended.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:27.260
The way, in the simplest terms
that cyanide can kill you, is

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.110
it basically out-competes
your oxygen for the

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:31.500
heme in your blood.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.580
So instead of carrying oxygen to
your cells, you're carrying

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.700
cyanide to your cells.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.170
Obviously, the amounts that
are in cigarettes are not

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:41.210
enough that people are dropping
dead of cyanide

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:44.800
poisoning, but still it's not
a good idea if you can avoid

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.730
eating or inhaling cyanide
-- you definitely want to

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:49.610
minimize your exposure.

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:53.920
And in terms of thinking about
it for organic chemistry or if

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.880
you're interested in thinking
about the mechanism maybe by

00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:00.230
which it is toxic, a first
step would be to draw its

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:01.770
Lewis structure.

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:05.470
So, let's go ahead and make sure
we can draw that, if we

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:08.200
have interest either in the area
of organic chemistry or

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.670
biochemistry or biology here.

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:14.300
So in terms of the first step of
skeletal structure, this is

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.370
actually going to be easier
because we don't have a

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:23.440
central atom, we just have
carbon and nitrogen here.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.160
Our next step is thinking
about valence electrons.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:32.440
So we have 4 plus 5, but we're
actually not done yet, because

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.190
it's c n minus, so if we have
minus, we actually have an

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:38.780
extra electron in
our molecule.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.650
So we need to add 1 more.

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:45.660
If instead we had a positive
ion, a cation, what we would

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.890
have to do is subtract 1.

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:50.340
But here we're going to
add 1, so again, we

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:54.100
have 10 valence electrons.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:57.150
And if we go on to step three
where we figure out how many

00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:00.810
we would need for full octets,
it's just going to be 2 times

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:04.780
8, so we have 16.

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:09.710
And step four is going to have
us figure out how many bonding

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:16.230
electrons we have, so we have 16
minus 10, is going to be 6

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:21.150
bonding electrons.

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:29.210
So, step five tells us to add 2
electrons between each atom,

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:32.260
so we add two there.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:35.290
And step six asks us,
well, do we have any

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:36.630
bonding electrons left?

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:40.120
So how many bonding electrons
do we have left?

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.770
Yup, so we do, we have 4 left.

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:45.600
We started with 6,
we only used 2.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.330
This is very easy molecule
because we know exactly where

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.600
to put them without even having
to think, we only have

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:54.790
one option, and we'll make a
triple bond between the carbon

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.850
and the nitrogen.

00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:00.710
So, seven asks us if we have
any valence electrons left,

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:03.970
and how many valence electrons
do we have left?

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:06.070
Yeah, so also 4.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:09.540
We started with 10 valence
electrons, we used up 6 of

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:13.090
those as bonding electrons, so
we have 4 left, which will be

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:14.980
lone pair electrons.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:19.150
So, in order to fill our octet,
what we do is put two

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:23.900
on the nitrogen and
two on the carbon.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:27.030
So, in terms of finishing our
Lewis structure, we're

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:29.720
actually not done yet here,
even though we have full

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:33.610
octets, and we've used up all of
our valence electrons, and

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:36.400
the reason is because it's c n
minus, so we need to make sure

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.290
that that's reflected in our
Lewis structure, so let's put

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:43.600
it in brackets here,
and put a minus 1.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.920
And also I wanted to mention
in terms of checking your

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:49.230
Lewis structures, regardless of
what they are, you should

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:51.080
always go back and say
how many valence

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.370
electrons did I have --

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:57.290
I had 10, and then count 2, 4,
6, 8, 10, because you always

00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:59.770
need to make sure you have the
same number of valence

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:02.590
electrons that you calculated
in your actual structure.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:05.270
That'll catch a lot of just
silly mistakes for you if you

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:08.190
go back and see it and you
don't have all of that.

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.260
Let's re-draw this, so it looks
a little bit neater,

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:16.350
where we have a triple bond in
the middle instead, and again,

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:19.240
we need our negative
1 charge there.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:23.010
And our eigth step in the
process, again, is formal

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:32.880
charge, which we will talk
about very soon.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:33.200
All right.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.850
So let's try one more example
of drawing Lewis structures

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:38.100
before we talk about
formal charge.

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.800
And the last example that we're
going to talk about is

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:45.250
thionyl chloride, so
it's s o c l 2.

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:47.830
This is another good step
forward, because now we

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:51.890
actually have four different
atoms in our molecule.

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:55.220
I'll tell you a little about
thionyl chloride as well.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:58.100
This is another organic
chemistry reagent, it's also

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:01.460
used extensively in the
pharmaceutical industry.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:03.790
And what it's used is to convert
one type of group,

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:07.170
what's called a carboxylic acid
into another type of very

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:10.400
reactive intermediate, which
is called an acid chloride.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.590
So I show that here, so in
green, you have what's called

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:18.170
a carboxcylic acid group, a c o
o h, which gets converted by

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:23.280
s o c l 2 to a c double bond
o c l or an acid chloride.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.020
This is the very reactive
intermediate.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:27.250
You'll learn a lot more about
this if you take organic

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:30.470
chemistry, but, In fact, you
can then go on and make a

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:33.730
bunch of other different kinds
of very interesting molecules.

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:36.920
So, for example, this is the
synthesis of novacaine.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.020
This is what's used
in industry to

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.650
actually make novacaine.

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:41.430
Has anyone had a novacaine
procedure?

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:42.060
Yes.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:47.910
I've had it also many times,
you usually get

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:49.530
novacaine for cavities.

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:51.480
There's some alternatives that
are used now as well.

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:54.260
It's also used as a local
anesthetic for other types of

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:55.580
small procedures.

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:58.250
So, this is, in fact,
what's used to make

00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:59.780
novacaine in industry.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.540
You'll notice that a lot of
different kinds medications do

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.810
you have chlorine in them,
you'll see that c l group.

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:09.160
So, for example, you might be
familiar with Wellbutrin here,

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.170
this is a type of
anti-depressant that a lot of

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:14.070
people use right now that are
taking anti-depressants.

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:19.200
It's on the market, very popular
in terms of your

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.230
choices right now as an option
as an anti-depressant.

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:24.070
Also, Lunesta.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:27.390
This was very big in an ad
campaign at least last year,

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:30.010
I'm not sure if it still is,
with the little butterfly.

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:32.430
This is the structure of
Lunesta, and you see the c l

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:33.620
in it as well.

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.700
I just wanted to point out that
although you see these

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:41.100
chlorine atoms in these drugs,
what you almost never see is

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:44.310
an acid chloride -- in fact, I
don't think I've ever seen an

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:47.360
acid chloride in a final
pharmaceutical product or drug

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.650
that we take, and the reason is
because they're so reactive

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:53.340
that you wouldn't want to have
that in something you digest.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:56.420
So just keep in mind when you
do see the chlorine in these

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:58.550
drugs, it's very different
from the acid chloride.

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:02.290
So, for example, Wellbutrin,
it is very unlikely that it

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:06.140
would have thionyl chloride in
order to make it, and if

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.990
thionyl chloride was used at
some point in the synthesis,

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:11.150
it was not to put that chlorine
atom on, it was to

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:12.680
put something else on.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.190
But in terms of drugs that don't
look like maybe this

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:19.230
compound was used in the
synthesis, many of them might

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:23.170
have used thionyl chloride,
because it generates such a

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:25.560
nice reactive intermediate that
you can go on and make a

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.200
bunch of different compounds
from that intermediate.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:28.490
All right.

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:30.760
So let's think about how to draw
the Lewis structure for

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.620
thionyl chloride -- oh,
actually, let me let you tell

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.050
me how we should start
this Lewis structure.

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:39.890
So, which atom would you expect
to be in the center of

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:50.170
a Lewis structure for
thionyl chloride?

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:50.410
All right.

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:59.080
Let's take 10 seconds on that.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.780
Looks like we have some fast
thinking here, a lot of last

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.650
minute answers coming in.

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:04.880
OK.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:08.850
We have a split decision, so
-- you know what, actually,

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:10.510
let's think about this
for a second.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:14.940
So hopefully, it was a time
issue in terms of looking at

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:18.670
the periodic table, because
let's have you tell me what

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:22.480
are we looking for here?

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:22.770
Yeah.

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:22.980
OK.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:25.440
We're looking for the lowest
ionization energy.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.230
So, this one can be tricky
because oxygen looks like it's

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:30.540
in the middle because of the way
it's written, but we need

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:33.250
to start by looking at the
lowest ionization energy.

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:37.170
So, if we look on the periodic
table, comparing, for example,

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:41.720
s to o, if we have s it's
below o, what happens to

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.760
ionization energy as
we go down a table?

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.070
It decreases.

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:48.550
If you're still not completely
up on the periodic trends,

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:51.130
that is stuff that's going to be
on the first exam, so make

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:54.280
sure that you're able to do this
without taking too much

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.340
time to think about it.

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:58.420
We would expect the ionization
energy to decrease, that means

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.880
that sulfur has our lowest
ionization energy.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:01.480
All right.

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:05.950
So, let's go ahead and draw our
Lewis structure here with

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:08.390
sulfur in the middle.

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:13.030
So, we can put our sulfur in
the middle, and then it

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:16.120
doesn't really matter how we
draw the rest of it, where we

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.930
put our c l's versus where
we put our oxygens.

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:23.680
We'll just put them in some way
around our sulfur atom.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.050
So that's our step one.

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:28.600
For our step two,
what we need is

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.130
number of valence electrons.

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:33.600
So we have 2 for each
of the chlorine.

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.570
How many valence electrons
are in chlorine?

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:39.230
All right.

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:41.860
So it's 7 that are in chlorine,
it's the same as

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:45.500
fluorine or any of the
others in that row or

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.440
in that group rather.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:51.990
2 times 7, plus we have 6 in
the sulfur, and oxygen is

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:55.000
right above sulfur, so
that also has 6.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.240
So we end up having 26 valence
electrons that we're

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.220
dealing with here.

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:04.870
Our step three is to figure out
how many bonding electrons

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:08.070
that we need, or excuse me, how
many total electrons that

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:11.630
we need to fill up our octets,
so that's just going to be 4

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:15.730
times 8, which is 32.

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:20.810
And then we take 32 minus 26.

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:25.360
So what we end up with in terms
of our bonding electrons

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.540
is going to be 6 bonding
electrons.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:30.550
So we can go right ahead
and fill these in.

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:36.060
1 2, 3 4, 5 and 6.

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:37.910
And that was step five.

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:40.080
Step six is thinking about
do we have any

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.970
bonding electrons left?

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:44.240
Nope, we used them all up.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.920
So we don't need to put any
more bonds in there.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:52.280
And step seven is how many
electrons do we have left over

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.130
that are going to go
into lone pairs?

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:55.800
How many?

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.290
20.

00:28:56.290 --> 00:29:01.580
26 minus 6, so that tells us 20,
and these are all going to

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:02.770
be lone pairs.

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:04.780
Well, we're talking about a
pretty high number here, so to

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:08.330
make counting easier, we'll
just say 10 lone pairs,

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:10.480
because 20 lone pair electrons
is the same

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.130
thing as 10 lone pairs.

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:14.310
And all we need to do
is go over here now

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:16.270
and fill up our octets.

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:23.670
So oxygen gets 3 pairs, and each
chlorine gets 3 pairs, so

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:26.900
now we're up to 9 pairs.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:31.840
And what we have left here is
the sulfur, which will also

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.800
get a pair.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.320
So, if you look at all of these,
we have full octets for

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.100
all of them, and if we count
up all of the valence

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:44.520
electrons, it's going to be
equal to our number 26 here.

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:47.400
And the last thing we do for any
of our structures to check

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.080
them and figure out are these
valid or not valid, are these

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:54.380
good Lewis structures is to
check the formal charge.

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:56.520
So now that we have enough
practice drawing Lewis

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.450
structures, let's talk about
actually figuring out this

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:02.670
formal charge.

00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:05.500
So when we talk about formal
charge, basically formal

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:09.990
charge is the measure of the
extent to which an individual

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:12.060
atom within your molecule
has either

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.400
gained or lost an electron.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.880
So as we said when we first
introduced covalent bonds,

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.510
it's a sharing of electrons,
but it's not

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:22.120
always an equal sharing.

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.700
Sometimes we have a very
electronegative atom that's

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.330
going to take more of its equal

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:29.270
share of electron density.

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:31.500
So for example, that might
have a formal charge of

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:35.980
negative 1, because to some
extent it has gained that much

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.210
electron density that
it now has a formal

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:40.000
charge that's negative.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.450
So, when we think about any
type of formal charges, we

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:48.520
have to assign these based on a
formula here, which is very

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.260
easy to follow.

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:54.310
Formal charge equals v
minus l minus 1/2 s.

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:57.200
It's even easier to follow
if we know what all

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.820
of those stand for.

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:04.960
So, f c, I think you all
know is formal charge.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:10.940
Does anyone have
a guess for v?

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.530
Everyone has a guess, great.

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:14.930
Valence electrons.

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:17.610
What about l?

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:20.120
Lone pairs.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:23.530
So, lone pair electrons,
actually, not lone pairs

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:25.780
themselves.

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:28.440
And then s?

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:28.710
Good.

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:30.760
That's a tricky one,
shared electrons.

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:35.930
All right.

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:38.900
So this means we can actually
calculate this for any

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.680
molecule that we've drawn the
Lewis structure for, because

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.560
we actually do need to draw the
Lewis structure before we

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.290
know, for example, how many of
each of these we have, or at

00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:50.080
least go through the rules.

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:53.090
And what's important to keep in
mind about formal charge is

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:56.570
if we have a neutral atom,
such as we did in thionyl

00:31:56.570 --> 00:32:00.650
chloride here, the sum of the
individual formal charges on

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:04.840
individual atoms within the
molecule have to equal 0.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.620
So if we add them all up, there
should be no net charge

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:11.240
on the molecule, if the
molecule is neutral.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:15.460
So, if we think about the second
case here where we have

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:18.700
c n minus, now we're talking
about a molecule with a net

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.370
charge of negative 1.

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:23.350
So that means if we add up all
of the formal charges within

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:26.500
the molecule, what we would
expect to see is that they sum

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.940
up to give a net charge
of negative 1.

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:33.840
So we can do this for any final
charge we have, if we a

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:37.110
molecule that has a charge of
plus 2, then all of the formal

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:41.470
charges should add up
to plus 2 and so on.

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:44.470
So, let's just figure this out
for some of the examples we

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:45.820
did, so for the cyanide anion.

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:49.250
So, if we want to figure out
the formal charge on the

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:52.810
carbon, we need to take the
number of valence electrons,

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:54.110
so that's 4.

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:58.530
We need to subtract the lone
pair, what number is that?

00:32:58.530 --> 00:32:59.600
It's 2.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.140
And then 1/2 of the number
of shared electrons.

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:06.050
So, shared electrons are the
ones that are shared between

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:10.770
the carbon and the nitrogen, so
we have 6 shared electrons,

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:12.120
and we want to take
1/2 of that.

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.770
So we end up with a
formal charge on

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:16.370
carbon of negative 1.

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:18.330
We can do the same thing
for nitrogen.

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:21.410
So in terms of nitrogen that
starts off with a valence

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:25.630
number of 5, again we have 2
lone pair electrons in the

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:29.900
nitrogen, and again, we have 6
electrons that are shared.

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:31.750
So what we see is that
the formal charge on

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:34.000
the nitrogen is 0.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.270
Also, formal charges can be
checked, as I just said.

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:41.110
Negative 1 plus 0 should add up
to negative 1, if in fact,

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:43.270
we're correct for
the c n anion.

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:48.040
And it does, so we know that
we're probably on target in

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.990
terms of calculating
our formal charge.

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:53.440
So, let's think about our second
example -- actually our

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:55.290
third, but the second one we're
going to talk about in

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:58.490
terms of formal charge, which
is thionyl chloride.

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:01.220
So why don't you tell me what
the formal charge should be on

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.910
the sulfur atom of
thionyl chloride?

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:38.050
All right.

00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:53.610
Let's take 10 more seconds.

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:56.970
OK, so the majority got it.

00:34:56.970 --> 00:35:00.460
So hopefully next time we do a
formal charge question, we'll

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:01.740
get everyone back up to speed.

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:04.030
But we've just introduced it, so
let's go back to the class

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:06.890
notes and explain why this
is the correct answer.

00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:10.400
So if we look at sulfur, what
we need to do is take the

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.850
valence electrons in sulfur,
and there are 6.

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:16.190
By looking at the periodic table
it's right underneath

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:19.700
oxygen, so those both have
6 valence electrons.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:23.890
There are 2 lone pair electrons
on sulfur -- we only

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:29.140
have 2 lone pairs -- or 1 lone
pair, 2 lone pair electrons.

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:32.870
And then we end up having 6
shared electrons, 2 from each

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:35.710
of the bonds, so we end up
with a formal charge on

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:37.980
sulfur of plus 1.

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:42.040
If we go to the oxygen atom,
now we're talking about

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:45.810
starting with 6 in terms of
valence electrons again, but

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:50.040
instead of 2, you can see we
have 6 lone pair electrons

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:54.180
around the oxygen minus 1/2 of
2, so we have minus 1 is our

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.360
formal charge.

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:58.380
And if we talk about chlorine,
and both of the chlorines are

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:01.870
the same in this case, we start
with a valence number of

00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:06.140
7 for chlorine, and then we
subtract 6, because it had 6

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:09.340
lone pair electrons around each
of the chlorine atoms.

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:14.700
Then minus 1/2 of 2, because
we only have one bond or 2

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.460
electrons in a bond.

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:19.140
So again, we should be able
to check all of our formal

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:23.010
charges and make sure they add
up to 0, which they do, and

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:25.390
that makes sense, because we
have a neutral atom in terms

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:28.140
of thionyl chloride.

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.700
Another thing to mention in
terms of thinking about if you

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:34.090
have a good or a bad Lewis
structure, is that when you

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:37.550
figure out the formal charge on
each of the atoms, it's the

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:40.290
more electronegative atoms that
you would expect to have

00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:42.850
that negative charge, and that
should make sense to you

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:46.310
because electronegative atoms
want to have electron density,

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:49.350
they want to pull in electron
density to them, so it would

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:51.730
make sense that they have more
of it, which would give them a

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:53.630
negative charge.

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:58.030
So, if we compare the sulfur to
the oxygen, the oxygen it

00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:00.120
turns out is more
electronegative and that is

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:04.690
what holds the negative charge
in this molecule.

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:07.570
Another thing I want to point
out, and for some of you just

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:09.930
ignore what I'm saying, if
you haven't thought about

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:12.450
oxidation number, if you haven't
heard of that before,

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:14.230
don't worry we'll get to
it in the second half

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:15.440
with Professor Drennan.

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:17.520
But for those of you from high
school that have learned about

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:20.570
oxidation number and maybe are
starting to think about it

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:23.230
when you look at these
molecules, formal charge is --

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:25.890
it's not the same thing as
oxidation number, so separate

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:27.300
those two things in your head.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.760
We'll get to oxidation number
in the second half of this

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.690
course, but it's not
in any way the same

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:35.190
idea as formal charge.

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.450
All right.

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:38.000
So formal charge can actually
help us out when we're trying

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.200
to decide between several Lewis
structures that look

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.870
like they might be comparable in
terms of which might be the

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:46.170
lower energy or the more
stable structure.

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:48.540
The examples we've done so
far have been pretty

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:51.480
straightforward, so we haven't
needed to use formal charge to

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.120
make this kind of decision.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.620
But we could, for example, look
at a case where we have

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:59.620
several different structures
that look pretty good, and the

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:02.290
one we want to determine as
being the lowest energy

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:05.740
structure is the one in which
the absolute values of the

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:08.940
formal charges are going to be
lower, so essentially that

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:11.120
they have less charge
separation.

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:14.140
Those are going to be the more
stable or the lower energy

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:16.530
structures.

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:19.780
So, for example, let's look
at thiocyanate ion, we

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:22.380
have c s and n.

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:25.220
What we've learned so far is as
a first approximation, what

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:28.540
we want to do is put the atom
with the lowest ionization

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.270
energy in the middle here.

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:33.670
So let's compare those
ionization energies.

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:38.800
We have 10 90 for carbon, 1,000
for sulfur, and 1,400

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:39.950
for nitrogen.

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:42.650
So, thinking about ionization
energy, which atom would you

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:46.590
put in the middle here?

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:48.530
So, a lot of people
I hear are saying

00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:50.070
sulfur, and that's right.

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:52.530
So, in terms of ionization
energy, we would expect to see

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:53.450
sulfur in the middle.

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:56.780
So if we went through and drew
out our Lewis structure

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:59.690
following each of our steps,
what we would get is this as

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:02.230
our Lewis structure here, and we
could figure out all of the

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:03.380
formal charges.

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:05.830
But what I'm going to tell you
already is this is a case

00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:08.710
where, in fact, it's an
exception to the idea that the

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:11.600
lowest energy structure has the
lowest ionization energy

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.180
in the middle, and we can figure
this out when we look

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:15.380
at formal charge.

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:17.880
It's always a good first
approximation, because you

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.940
need to start somewhere in
terms of drawing Lewis

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:22.500
structures, but then if you go
and figure out the formal

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:25.750
charge and you just have lots
of charge separation or very

00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:29.360
high charges, like a plus 2 and
a minus 2 and a minus 1

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.850
all different places in the
atom, what it should tell you

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:33.690
is maybe there's a
better structure.

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:36.070
So, let's think of all of the
combinations that we could

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:38.120
have in terms of
this molecule.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.620
So in one case, we could
actually put carbon in the

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:43.270
middle, in one place, we could
put sulfur in the middle, and

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:44.960
in one case we could
put nitrogen.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.280
And then we can go ahead and
let's quickly write out what

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.720
the formal charges for
all of these will be.

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:53.410
So in our first structure, we
would find for the nitrogen we

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:56.980
have a formal charge 5 minus
4 minus 2, because we're

00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:00.840
starting with 5 valence
electrons, so that is a formal

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:03.940
charge of minus 1.

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:08.070
For the carbon, we start with 4
valence electrons, we have 0

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:12.370
lone pair electrons minus 4,
and we end up with a formal

00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:14.790
charge of 0.

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:18.220
For the sulfur, we start off
with 6 valence electrons,

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:22.730
minus 4 lone pair electrons,
minus 2, taking in account our

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:26.820
bonding electrons, so we end up
with a formal charge of 0.

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.080
All right, so this looks
pretty good.

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:30.180
We don't actually have much
charge separation

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:31.530
in this case here.

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:34.650
Let's take a look at the lowest
ionization energy in

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:35.950
the center case.

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:39.030
And what you find out if you do
these calculations, is that

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:42.980
you have a negative 1 for your
formal charge on nitrogen, you

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:47.210
have a negative 2 for your
formal charge on carbon, and

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:51.330
you have a positive 2 for your
formal charge on sulfur.

00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:53.940
If we look at our last structure
here where we have

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:56.230
nitrogen the middle, we can
also figure out all those

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:59.640
formal charges, and in this
case we have plus 1 on the

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:04.560
nitrogen, we have minus 2 on the
carbon, and then we end up

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:08.450
with a 0 on the sulfur there.

00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:10.460
So let's go to a clicker
question.

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:13.950
If we call this structure a,
b, and c -- you can look on

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:16.260
your notes, it also says
structure a, b, and c on your

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:17.480
notes, so you didn't
need to have just

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.250
memorized that slide.

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:23.080
But I want you to tell me in
terms of thinking about formal

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:25.420
charge, which Lewis structure
would you predict to be the

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:29.670
most stable?

00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:43.780
And this should be fast, so
let's take 10 seconds on this.

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:44.600
Okay, great.

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.050
So let's go back to
our notes here.

00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:48.920
And the reason that this
should be so fast is we

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.210
already did all the
calculations

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:51.650
for the formal charges.

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:54.740
So what we see is that structure
a is the most stable

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:57.510
because we have the least
separation of charge in the

00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:00.130
case of structure a.

00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:03.360
And you can do this any time if
you have Lewis structures

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:04.980
that you're choosing between.

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:08.750
You won't always draw out every
single possibility that

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:09.890
you have to start with.

00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:12.070
Often a good thing to start
with is to put the lowest

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:14.960
ionization energy atom in the
middle, and if you don't have

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:18.290
charge separation then go with
that structure, but if you do

00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:20.450
find you have a lot of
separation, such as the case

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:23.570
in negative 2, positive 2, and
minus 1, then you want to say

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:26.320
wait a second, this is really
bad in terms of formal charge,

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:30.880
let me go ahead and see what
other options I have here.

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:36.260
So, we can also get into a case
where we have similar

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:39.270
values in terms of absolute
values of formal charge

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:41.280
between two different molecules
we're deciding

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.320
between in their Lewis
structures.

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:45.580
And in this case, the
tie-breaker goes to the

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:48.660
molecule in which the negative
charge is on the most

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:51.030
electronegative atom.

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:53.440
So, let's look at an example
of this here.

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:56.740
So we could say, for example,
this molecule here, this --

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:59.130
now we're dealing with a lot
of different atoms in the

00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:01.340
molecule, much more complicated
than the initial

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:04.080
case of the cyanide ion
where we only had two.

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:06.660
So, how do we figure out first
how to draw the skeletal

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:09.270
structure of this
molecule here?

00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:13.360
And one thing I want to tell
you to start out with is

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:17.380
something about this
c h 3 group here.

00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:23.210
Any time you see a c h 3, this
means a methyl group.

00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:27.510
And if you draw out what a
methyl group is -- hopefully

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:35.880
you won't have to spell it --
then what you have is a carbon

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:40.910
in the middle with three
hydrogens around it, and then

00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:43.360
it can only be bonded
to one other thing.

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.990
So any time you see c h 3 here,
remember that that's

00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:49.410
methyl and that's going to
be a terminal group.

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:51.740
So, you already have a hint that
methyl groups are never

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:54.150
in the middle, they always have
to be on the outside.

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:57.190
So that's a good start for us
putting together a skeletal

00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:59.320
structure for this
compound here.

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.460
The other tip I'm going to give
you is any time you see a

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:05.080
chain molecule, by chain I just
mean many different atoms

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:06.480
written out in a row.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:10.440
A convention is that typically
you will put a terminal atom.

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.600
We know that h is always
terminal, it's always on the

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.720
end, never in the center.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:19.190
Right after the molecule
that it's attached to.

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:22.370
So, for instance, this would
suggest to us by the way it's

00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:25.810
written, that the hydrogen is
attached to the nitrogen and

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:27.440
not the oxygen.

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.390
So, if we use those two tips
to try to figure out a

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:33.300
structure, a skeletal structure,
we would get this

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:36.960
structure here if we write out
the full Lewis structure.

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:41.640
We could I think well, maybe
this isn't written out in

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:44.090
terms of that convention, which
sometimes it's not, so

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:46.790
let's also try writing it, such
that we have the hydrogen

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:48.600
and the oxygen atom there.

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:50.370
So that would give us
this structure here.

00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:53.532
So notice a difference in these
structures, is this has

00:44:53.532 --> 00:44:57.550
an n h bond whereas this
has an o h bond.

00:44:57.550 --> 00:45:01.120
And if we were to think about
which one of these is better,

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:03.750
it turns out that it's the
same in terms of formal

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:05.790
charges, so that doesn't
help us out.

00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:08.490
So we need to go to this
second case where we're

00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:11.650
instead going to think about
electronegativity, and we want

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:13.660
to think about which atom is
the most electronegative.

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:18.550
So, in this case, we see that
our formal charge is negative

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:22.200
on the nitrogen, in this case
it's negative on oxygen.

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:25.660
Which of those two is more
electronegative?

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:26.390
The oxygen.

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:28.700
So you should be able to look at
your periodic table and see

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:31.250
this, or also I've written
the trend here.

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:35.630
So that means that the more
stable molecule is going to be

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:38.210
this molecule here, which
actually puts the negative

00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:41.520
charge on be more
electronegative atom.

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:46.290
So this is our lower
energy structure.

00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:49.190
So, these are the different ways
that we can actually go

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:51.790
ahead and use formal charge when
we're choosing between

00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:53.650
different types of
Lewis structures.

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:56.520
So one last concept that I want
introduces is this idea

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.080
of resonance.

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:01.670
And resonance is the idea that
sometimes one single Lewis

00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:04.340
structure does not adequately
describe the electron

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:09.320
configuration around a given
molecule, so instead you need

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:12.320
to draw two different Lewis
structures to describe that

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:13.740
more appropriately.

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:17.810
So, let's quickly go through the
Lewis structure for ozone.

00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:20.280
I have the skeletal structure
written up there, I've written

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:22.140
it twice and you'll see
why in a minute.

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:23.910
It's easy to write the skeletal
structure, because

00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:26.030
it's all oxygen, we don't have
to worry about what's going to

00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:27.540
go in the middle.

00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:30.790
In this case, we're going to
have 3 times 6 for valence

00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:31.090
electrons --

00:46:31.090 --> 00:46:35.550
6 valence electrons for each
oxygen, so we have 18 total

00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:37.860
valence electrons.

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:41.740
So, in order to fill up our
shell, what we need is 3 times

00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:44.090
8 or 24 electrons.

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:48.820
This leaves us with
24 minus 18, or 6

00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:51.260
bonding electrons left.

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:53.960
So what we can do is
fill that in here.

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:59.360
Clearly, we put 2 for each bond,
and now we end up having

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.770
2 remaining bonding
electrons left.

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:04.100
So here is where our question
comes, because

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:04.960
where do we put it?

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:08.640
There's absolutely nothing that
tells us which atoms we

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:11.680
should put it between, because
they're both oxygen-oxygen.

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:15.320
So, let's just arbitrarily put
it between these two in this

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:18.880
case here, but actually there's
no reason we couldn't

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:21.730
also put it between oxygen b
and c, so I'm going to draw

00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:25.020
another structure where
we have it here.

00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:28.500
So in terms of remaining valence
electrons we have 12,

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:31.330
so we can finish off each of
our Lewis structures, so

00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:34.120
that's our first structure
there, and our second

00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:35.080
structure there.

00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:37.690
We could also figure out the
formal charges, and obviously

00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:40.820
the formal charges between these
two atoms, they're going

00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:42.500
to be identical, we're
only dealing with

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.810
oxygen atoms here.

00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:47.230
So, we need to think about what
this means -- which is

00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:50.060
the more stable structure,
because we have two different

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:50.710
structures here.

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:54.290
In this case we have a double
bond between a and b, and in

00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:56.870
this case we have it
between b and c.

00:47:56.870 --> 00:48:00.370
So, presumably, if we follow our
rules so far only one of

00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:02.420
these should be correct.

00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:05.620
And again, if we figure out the
formal charges, let's go

00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:10.230
through this quickly, we get
0 plus 1 and negative 1 for

00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:11.720
structure 1.

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:16.270
We get negative 1 plus 1
and 0 for structure 2.

00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:18.780
So as I said, they're going to
be identical in terms of

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:21.120
making the decision that way.

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:24.040
And what it turns out is
experimental evidence tells us

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:26.410
that these two structures
are equivalent.

00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:28.850
And by that what we mean is
that they're absolutely

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:31.980
identical, and it turns out that
this here is not a double

00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:34.730
bond, it's not a single bond
either, it's actually

00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:35.670
something in between.

00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:38.980
So if we look at its length,
it's actually shorter than a

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:41.190
single bond, but longer
than a double bond.

00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:44.170
Or if we look at how strong it
is, it's actually stronger

00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:47.010
than a single bond, but weaker
than a double bond.

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:50.420
And we find the same thing for
these two atoms here, it's not

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:54.490
actually a double bond, it's
somewhere between a single

00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:56.360
bond and a double bond.

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:59.620
So this is a case where we have
resonance structures, or

00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:01.820
we call this a resonance
hybrid.

00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:03.950
So the reality of the situation
is that it's a

00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:06.780
combination between these
2 structures.

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:08.800
And an important thing to
remember when we talk about

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:12.530
resonance hybrids is that the
structure it's not 1/2 the

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:15.910
time this structure, and 1/2
of the time this structure,

00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:19.390
it's actually some combination
or some average between the

00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:20.440
two structures.

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:22.970
But since in drawing Lewis
structures we don't have a way

00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:26.120
to represent that -- actually,
in some cases you do, you can

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:30.200
draw a dotted line that means a
1 and 1/2 bond, but most in

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:33.570
most cases, we just draw out
both resonance structures, and

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:35.730
the way that we say it's a
resonance structure is that we

00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:38.750
put it in the brackets and we
put an arrow between it.

00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:40.860
So, when you think about
resonance structures, some

00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:43.540
students tend to just get
confused and be picturing this

00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:45.470
flickering back and forth.

00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:49.270
A good example to keep in mind
is the idea of a mule.

00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:52.780
So most of you know, hopefully,
that a mule is a

00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:57.670
combination of a donkey
and a horse.

00:49:57.670 --> 00:50:00.590
A mule is not spending 1/2 of
its time as a donkey, and 1/2

00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:04.620
of its time as a horse, we don't
see it flickering back

00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:07.520
and forth between the two,
that's not what we see.

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:10.845
Instead what we see is it's an
average, it's part like a

00:50:10.845 --> 00:50:12.680
horse, it's part
like a donkey.

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:16.940
So if we want to put that in
chemical terms, we want to

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:19.580
make sure we put these in
brackets here, and remember,

00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:22.980
this is the resonance arrow,
it's not a reaction arrow,

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:25.140
it's a resonance arrow, so
make sure you mark it up

00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:27.080
correctly like that.

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:30.050
When we talk about resonance
structures, the key word is

00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:33.120
that the electrons
are de-localized.

00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:36.060
So they're not just between
two atoms here.

00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:38.380
Now, for example, in our
structure with ozone it's

00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:41.340
between all three atoms.

00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:44.240
And the final point I want to
make today, and this is very,

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:47.720
very important, so make sure
that you do understand this.

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:50.590
When we talk about resonance
structures, we're talking

00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:54.560
about cases that have the same
arrangement of atoms, the key

00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:57.365
is the atoms are the same, and
the thing that is different is

00:50:57.365 --> 00:51:00.080
the arrangement of
electrons here.
