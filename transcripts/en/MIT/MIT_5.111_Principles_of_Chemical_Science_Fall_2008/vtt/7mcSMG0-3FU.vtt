00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:23.370
PROFESSOR: OK, let's
get started.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.210
Why doesn't everyone go ahead
and take 10 more seconds on

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.130
this clicker question.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.310
It should look familiar.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.190
You were pretty split on this
question on Friday, so we're

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.630
hoping after learning a little
bit more about delta g of

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.520
formation, we have at
least one direction

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.560
that wins out here.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.450
OK, great.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.200
So now we're up to 85% of you,
and hopefully in just a minute

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.970
we'll be up to a 100%.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.920
But if delta g of formation here
is less than zero, that

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.000
means we're talking about a
spontaneous reaction when we

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.510
form the compound.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.770
So if it spontaneously forms the
compound, that must mean

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.060
that the compound is
going to be stable

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.390
relative to its elements.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.030
So that's kind of the last thing
we went over in terms of

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:14.820
topics on Friday, and we'll
pick up right there today.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.730
All right.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.750
Here we have our notes for
today, so reminder exam 2 is

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.340
on Wednesday --

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.200
I don't think I need to
remind anyone of that.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.930
But just please, don't come to
this room, make sure that you

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.120
go to Walker to take the exam.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.620
And also if you have any
questions or you feel like

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.010
there's anything you don't
understand, I have office

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.200
hours today from 2 to
4 in my office.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.320
Your TAs have also all moved
their office hours so they

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.940
fall before the exam.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.590
So make sure you get any of
your questions addressed

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.190
before you're trying to
sit there and figure

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.310
it out in exam time.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.260
All right, so today we're going
to pick up where we left

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.770
off on thermodynamics, so that
was talking about free energy

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.080
of formation.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.350
After that we're going to talk
a little bit more about the

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.810
effect of temperature
on spontaneity.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.990
We touched upon this on Friday,
but we're going to

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.810
formalize exactly in which cases
temperature can or can

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.260
not affect whether a reaction
is spontaneous or

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.810
non-spontaneous.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.010
Then we're going to look a
little bit into thermodynamics

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.800
and biological systems.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.920
Two examples that I wanted to
talk about were ATP coupled

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.980
reactions -- those are very
important in biology.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.430
And also, thinking about the
idea of hydrogen bonding,

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.090
we're going to combine our
thoughts on bond enthalpies,

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.570
and also our ideas of bonding
that we had from thinking

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.160
about covalent and
ionic bonds.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.040
All right, so let's finish
up first with

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.830
free energy of formation.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.670
So as 85% of you just told me,
when we have a case where

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.220
delta g of formation is less
than zero, what we're talking

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.100
about here is a compound that
is thermodynamically stable

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.470
relative to its elements.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.370
So that means we know the
inverse as well, which is when

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.920
we're talking about a case where
delta g is now greater

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.040
than zero, the compound is going
to be thermodynamically

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.840
unstable relative
to its elements.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.090
So any time you're looking at
delta g of formation, just

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.330
remember to think about this
is just the delta g of a

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.380
reaction where you're
forming a compound.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.710
So it should make sense that if
it's negative, it's going

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.950
to be spontaneous and you're
going to have a stable

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.970
compound here.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.050
So we could look at any number
of examples, really we could

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.290
pick any compound to look at,
but up on the screen here I'm

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.990
just putting the compound, the
formation of benzene, we've

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.710
looked at benzene a lot.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.500
So benzene has a delta
g of formation of 124

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.830
kilojoules per mole.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:39.900
Is benzene stable or unstable
compared to its elements?

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.000
I can't really tell the
difference between stable and

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.540
unstable when you say it,
so everyone start at

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.740
the same time, go.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.420
STUDENT: Unstable.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.780
PROFESSOR: OK, excellent.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.260
Benzene is unstable compared
to its elements.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.090
So that means the reverse
reaction here is going to be

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.320
stable -- or the reverse
reaction is going to be

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.460
spontaneous where we
actually have the

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.770
decomposition of benzene.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.450
So when we're seeing this, when
we're seeing that the

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.470
reverse reaction is spontaneous,
a question that

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.100
might immediately come to us is
well, why did we just spend

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.350
all the time talking about
benzene because clearly

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.040
benzene's just going to
break down, right.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.850
Why do we form benzene and not
have it immediately decompose

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:15.790
into its elements.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.160
Thermodynamically that is what
should happen and it is what

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.630
does happen, but the reality
is that this reaction, this

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.320
decomposition of benzene is
actually very, very slow.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.550
It's so slow that, you know we
use benzene all the time in

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.200
organic reactions, we don't see
it break down even when we

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.770
heat it up, is because
even though this is

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.630
thermodynamically a
non-spontaneous reaction to

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.040
form benzene, it's very slow for
the actual decomposition

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.960
of benzene to occur.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.730
So this is just another case,
and I'll keep saying this, and

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.360
when Professor Drennan starts
talking about kinetics, she'll

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.920
keep repeating this as well.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.820
What we want to keep in mind
is that delta g tells us

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.900
whether a reaction will happen
or whether it won't happen.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.710
It tells us absolutely nothing
about how long it takes for

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.790
that reaction to happen.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.100
It tells us nothing about the
rate of the reaction.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.370
We'll keep seeing examples of
this, so hopefully no one will

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.840
be confused by the time
we do get to kinetics.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.310
So if we're talking about
calculating delta g for any

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.690
reaction, now we actually have
several ways to do it.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.240
The first way is very analogous
to thinking about

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.910
delta h for the reaction.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.950
We can just look up a
table where we have

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.480
delta g as a formation.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.390
So we can take the sum of the
delta g of formation of the

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.880
products, and subtract from it
the delta g of formation of

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.220
the reactants.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.960
We also have another way if
maybe we don't have that

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.740
information available to us.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.220
We can also take a look at using
this reaction or this

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.490
equation right here, which is
telling us that delta g of a

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.110
reaction is equal to the
change in enthalpy

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.050
minus t delta s.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.050
So that tends to be very
helpful, especially when we

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.040
want to take into consideration
temperature.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.900
So let's take into consideration
temperature.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.880
We've done this a little bit so
far, but let's really take

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.260
a look at some reactions where
temperature's going to make a

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.250
big difference.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.290
So the reaction we're going
to look at here is the

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.660
decomposition of sodium
bicarbonate, or sodium bicarb

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.890
here, and it decomposes it into
sodium carbonate, plus c

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.820
o 2, carbon dioxide,
and water.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.500
So we can think about
calculating that delta g of

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.770
this reaction.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.280
I'll tell you that the change in
enthalpy, this is actually

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.730
an endothermic reaction.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:26.630
It requires heat.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.420
It's plus 135 .

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.110
6 kilojoules per mole.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.300
So let's go to a clicker
question and I want you to

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.010
pick out from several choices
which of the changes in

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:41.440
entropy seem reasonable
to you here.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.640
So what would you predict
the delta s for

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:51.250
this reaction to be?

00:06:51.250 --> 00:07:06.900
All right, let's do 10
more seconds on that.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.030
OK, so we've got the majority,
but not everyone.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.800
So let's take a look at why this
is the correct answer,

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.920
that it should be plus 0.334 .

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.710
If we're going from 2 moles of
solid, to 1 mole of solid,

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:25.020
plus 2 moles of gas, are
we increasing or

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.600
decreasing the disorder?

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.340
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.770
PROFESSOR: We're increasing
the disorder.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.400
If we're getting to a more
disordered state, then we're

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.500
going to have a positive
change in entropy.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.190
We're going to increase
the disorder.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.910
The only one with a positive
delta s is this choice here.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:45.365
So if we switch back to our
notes, we can see that, in

00:07:45.365 --> 00:07:54.060
fact, so what we see is that
it's 0.334 kilojoules per k

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:59.240
per mole is our delta s, so we
can go ahead and calculate our

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.860
delta g for the reaction,
so we're just plugging

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.520
in our delta h.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.620
So our delta h is 135 .

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.880
6.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.280
And we're talking about to start
with let's talk about

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.370
room temperature.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:18.050
So 298 k times 0.334 .

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:21.430
So what we end up having for the
delta g of our reaction is

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.860
that its 36 .

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.520
1 kilojoules per mole.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.740
So this is at room
temperature.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.030
So is our reaction spontaneous
or non-spontaneous at room

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:30.700
temperature?

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:31.970
STUDENT: Non-spontaneous.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:32.740
PROFESSOR: Non-spontaneous.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.800
All right, but let's take
a look at a different

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.230
temperature.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.560
For example, let's look
at baking temperature.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.700
So if we think about baking
cookies, we maybe bake them at

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.910
350 degrees fahrenheit, so that
would be 450 kelvin --

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:48.830
our ovens are usually set to
fahrenheit and not kelvin.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:50.700
So if we think about this
reaction that this

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.100
temperature, first of all let
me point out why we would be

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.860
talking about baking
cookies for this

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.990
particular reaction here.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:59.310
Does anyone know what another
name for sodium bicarb is?

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.840
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.410
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's
just baking soda.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.910
So this is the reaction that
causes your cookies or your

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.700
cakes to actually rise.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.010
So we're producing gas here, and
when we're producing that

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.850
gas when this sodium bicarb
decomposes, we're forming

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:15.750
these pockets of gas
in our baked goods.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.630
So if we bake our cookies at
room temperature, obviously,

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:24.020
they don't bake and they also
don't rise because the sodium

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.550
bicarb, clearly it was
non-spontaneous at room

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.850
temperature, this reaction
just doesn't happen.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.730
But if we take a look at baking
temperature now, we're

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:34.140
going to plug in this new
temperature, which is 450 k,

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:38.130
and plug this into our
delta g reaction.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.410
What we find is now our delta
g for the reaction

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:43.250
is negative 14 .

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.100
7 kilojoules per mole.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.550
So in this case, we are dealing
with a spontaneous

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:51.200
reaction, which is good, because
this means that when

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.480
we put our cookies in and we
turn it to 350 fahrenheit or

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.760
450 k, the baking soda will
decompose and we'll got our

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.520
cookies to rise a little bit.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.920
All right, so one thing that I
want you to notice when we

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.790
were talking about the case
with the decomposition of

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:10.660
sodium bicarb is that the delta
h for that reaction and

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.940
the delta s, they both
had the same sign.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.830
And something that you can keep
in mind in general is any

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:20.130
time that both delta h and delta
s have the same sign,

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:23.430
it's actually possible to switch
from spontaneous to

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:26.560
non-spontaneous or vice versa
just by changing the

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.330
temperature of the reaction.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.300
And we can think about
this graphically.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.370
If we assume that delta h and
delta s are independent of

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.300
temperature, which is a good
assumption to a first

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.810
approximation, in this case we
find that the delta g of the

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:43.650
reaction is the linear function
of the temperature.

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.430
So that means we can go ahead
and graph what we saw for the

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:49.090
case of baking soda.

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:51.520
So our first point here was
that we saw at room

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:55.380
temperature, about 298 k, the
delta g was positive, it was

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.190
36 kilojoules per mole.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.450
We also saw that once we
heated it up to baking

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:05.690
temperature, we actually had the
delta g now at negative 15

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.010
kilojoules per mole.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:10.650
So since this is linear, we can
actually draw a straight

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.950
line right through here, and
we can think about the fact

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:17.270
that we have this temperature
here where anything below this

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:20.260
temperature has a positive delta
g, and anything above

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.700
this temperature is going to
have a negative delta g.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.760
And let's actually think about
the fact that this is a line

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.610
and see what our slope and our
y-intercept is going to mean.

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:33.390
We can say that delta g is equal
to negative delta s t

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.290
plus delta h, if we want to put
it in the formation of the

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:37.810
equation for line.

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.290
So what this tells us is that
our slope is going to be

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:44.330
negative delta s here, and
if we think about our

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.880
y-intercept, that's going to be
the change in enthalpy for

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.190
the reaction.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:54.040
So again, what I want to point
out is that any time we're at

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.230
a temperature that's lower
than this change in

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:59.230
temperature here, we're going
to find that delta g is

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.700
greater than zero, and we're
going to be dealing with a

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.870
non-spontaneous reaction.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:08.220
However, if we move our
temperature up and up and up

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.750
so we go across the graph this
way, eventually we'll hit a

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.820
point where if we're above that
temperature, we'll find

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.670
that delta g is less than
zero, and now we have a

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:21.340
spontaneous reaction.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.280
So we can actually think about
what this temperature is.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.410
We can call this T star.

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.040
This is the temperature at which
our reaction switches,

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.620
whether it's spontaneous
or non-spontaneous.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.970
And if you're thinking about
trying to get a reaction to

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.380
go, it's very important to be
able to calculate what this

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.500
temperature is.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.320
A lot of times in organic
chemistry laboratories, they

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.100
need to heat up reactions --
part of why they do that is

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.590
kinetics, but the other part is
sometimes they need to make

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:48.380
a reaction go from being
non-spontaneous to

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:49.280
spontaneous.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.160
So let's think about how to
calculate T star or this

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.410
change in temperature.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:56.880
So we're talking about this
threshold temperature, so

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.210
we're talking about where delta
g is going to be equal

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:02.480
to zero, because if we set delta
g equal to zero, we know

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.650
that anything on one side of
that temperature is going to

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.910
be spontaneous, and the other
side is going to be

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:09.600
non-spontaneous.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.850
So if we do this, we can just
rewrite our reaction, delta g

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:17.270
equals delta h minus t delta s,
and let's plug in our zero

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:20.490
for delta g there, and now
rearrange our reaction so that

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:23.260
we're talking about this
threshold temperature.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.670
So that T star is just going to
be equal to the change in

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:29.940
enthalpy divided by the
change in entropy.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.640
So it's very easy for us to
calculate, so let's go ahead

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.950
and do this for the case
with baking soda.

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:39.340
And for baking soda what we saw
was that delta h was 136

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:43.890
kilojoules per mole, and the
change in entropy was 0.334

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:46.920
kilojoules per k mole.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.710
And that means if we do that
simple division, then what we

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:55.090
end up as our temperature
star is 406 kelvin.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:58.090
So basically, what this tells us
is if we tried to bake our

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:02.420
cookies below 406 kelvin they
would not rise, if we bake

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.800
them above 406 kelvin they
will rise because this

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.550
reaction is now spontaneous.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:12.290
All right, so this was a case
where we had seen that the

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:16.310
delta h and the delta s both
had a positive value.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:19.560
But let's take a look at what
happens when now delta h and

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.070
delta s are both negative.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.860
So we can think about this just
by plotting it on our

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.560
graph again -- we don't have
actual values, but we can

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.430
think about what the
sign should be.

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:33.170
So if we talk about our zero
point where temperature is

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:37.980
absolute zero, if we have a
positive, or excuse me, if we

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.870
have a negative delta h now
and we're at temperature

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:44.480
equals zero, what is delta
g going to be?

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.070
Negative or positive?

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:48.290
Yeah, it's going
to be negative.

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.690
So if we have negative delta h
and we're at temperature of

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.960
zero, our s term completely
falls out, so we're definitely

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.310
going to start with a
negative delta g.

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:00.480
As we increase the temperature
higher and higher, at some

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.050
point that delta s term is going
to become greater than

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:06.090
our delta h term, so at some
point we're going to flip to

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:09.730
where the reaction has now
a positive delta g.

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:12.510
So you can draw this into your
graphs in your notes where

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.240
we're going to start, in this
case if delta g is negative

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.270
where delta g starts negative,
and then when it hits that

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:20.180
threshold temperature,
anything above that

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.420
temperature is going
to be positive.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.970
So if we had actual numbers we
could plug those into our

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.290
graph, but we should be able to
understand what the general

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:30.120
trend is going to be even in a
hypothetical case where we're

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:37.100
just dealing with is it positive
or is it negative.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.420
So what we see is that below
this temperature, we have a

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.460
spontaneous reaction, and above
this temperature we have

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.330
a non-spontaneous reaction.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.460
That was flipped from the case
where we had delta h and delta

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.910
s both be positive.

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:54.190
All right, so let's actually
summarize what all of our four

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:57.860
different scenarios could be
if we're dealing with delta

00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:59.560
h's and delta s's.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.370
So to start with, why don't you
tell me what you think if

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:06.750
we have a reaction where we have
a negative delta h and we

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:10.510
have a positive delta s, do you
think that this will be a

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.360
reaction that's never
spontaneous, always

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.950
spontaneous, or will this be one
of these cases where the

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.090
spontaneity depends
on temperature?

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:40.430
All right, let's take 10
more seconds on this.

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:41.090
OK, great.

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:42.310
So most of you got it.

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:45.730
So let's go back to the slides
and think a little bit about

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:46.760
why this is.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.820
So, this case is always
spontaneous, because in this

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.450
case we have a negative delta
h, which contributes to a

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:58.550
negative delta g, and a positive
delta s, but since

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:02.910
the equation says minus t delta
s, that means a positive

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:04.850
delta s is also going
to contribute to a

00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:06.190
negative delta g.

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:08.320
So regardless of what the
temperature is, we're going to

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.360
have a spontaneous reaction.

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.600
So we say this is always
spontaneous -- delta g is less

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.580
than zero at all temperatures.

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:18.840
All right.

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:22.110
So let's look at the reverse
case here where delta h is now

00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:25.830
greater than zero, and delta
s is less than zero.

00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:29.120
Is this always, never, or
sometimes spontaneous?

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.470
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.230
PROFESSOR: Nope.

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:38.770
So, this is going to be never
spontaneous in this case.

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:41.840
So for the same reason, because
delta h is greater

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.270
than zero, that contributes to
a positive delta g, and delta

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.790
s being negative also
contributes to a

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:48.900
positive delta g.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:52.550
So we'll say again, that this
delta g is greater than zero

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:53.850
at all temperatures.

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:57.930
All right, so now we have a case
where delta h is greater

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:01.240
than zero and delta s is greater
than zero as well.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.770
Is this going to be always,
never, or sometimes

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:04.550
spontaneous?

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.360
STUDENT: Sometimes.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.170
PROFESSOR: Sometimes, good.

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.720
So, even before thinking, you
can just remember if the signs

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.420
are the same, we can
have a dependence

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.050
on temperature here.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.710
So what we find is that this
is sometimes spontaneous.

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:18.900
So we can think about
when this happens.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:22.810
Would it be when the actual
temperature is greater or less

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:24.560
than that threshold
temperature?

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.890
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:29.060
PROFESSOR: All right, so I
heard a lot of people say

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:29.710
greater than.

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:32.640
It's greater than, because when
it's greater than that

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.970
threshold temperature, that
means that the delta s term is

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:38.200
the one that's going to actually
sort of take over,

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.520
it's going to be at some point
greater than the delta h term.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.210
The delta h is going to be
making the delta g positive.

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:48.290
That means it would make it
non-spontaneous, but once

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:51.380
delta s gets large enough,
that's going to override, and

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.890
now we're going to have a
negative delta g only when the

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:57.010
temperature is above that
threshold temperature.

00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:01.000
So similarly, when we see that
delta h is negative and delta

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.570
s is negative, this is also
going to be sometimes

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:08.230
spontaneous, and specifically,
it will be spontaneous or

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:12.030
delta g will be less than 0 when
the temperature is less

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:13.580
than that threshold
temperature.

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:16.980
All right, so you should be able
to look at any situation

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.770
where you have or you figure
out or you calculate the

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.540
enthalpy and the enthropy change
in the reaction, and

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:26.055
you should right away, before
doing any calculations, be

00:19:26.055 --> 00:19:29.040
able to know is this always
spontaneous, is this never

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.530
spontaneous, or is this
something where I'm going to

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.680
need to really take
temperature into

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:34.710
consideration.

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:37.580
And if I do, you can actually
calculate what that

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.840
temperature is going to
be where you flip from

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.880
spontaneous to non-spontaneous
or vice versa.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:46.920
All right, so shifting gears a
little bit, let's take a look

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.580
at a few examples where it's
important to think about

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.050
thermodynamics and biological
systems.

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:55.020
So there's two things I
particularly want to focus on.

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:59.700
So the first is the idea of
ATP coupled reactions.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.950
So this is really important,
because when we're talking

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:05.040
about biological reactions, a
lot of the reactions that take

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.170
place in our body are actually
non-spontaneous, so

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:11.710
energetically we figure that the
delta g for this reaction

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.100
is actually positive.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.990
So I just show a schematic
biological reaction here where

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:20.020
we have some molecule that's
broken up into

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.030
two building blocks.

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:23.820
So let's say, for example,
this has a delta g that's

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:25.030
greater than zero.

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:27.580
We need to think about how it is
that our body can actually

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.740
make this reaction happen.

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.940
And the way that it does this
is that it takes the

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.910
hydrolysis of ATP, and the
hydrolysis of ATP is what's

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:40.740
called that it's coupled to this
non-spontaneous reaction.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.150
And when you have a spontaneous
reaction coupled

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:47.830
to a non-spontaneous reaction,
you can potentially drive the

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:49.860
reaction in the forward
direction.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:53.690
Remember the hydrolysis of ATP
is spontaneous, so what we're

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:57.100
doing in this case is we're
taking a spontaneous reaction

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.300
where we give off energy, and
we're coupling it to a

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.700
non-spontaneous reaction
that requires energy.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.820
So what we will hope is when
we add up the total energy

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.200
changes between these two
reactions, if the sum of those

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.550
two is a negative delta g total,
now we can have this

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:17.990
whole process move in the
forward direction.

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:21.140
So let's take a look at thinking
about what we can do

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.600
in terms of a coupled
reaction.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.870
The first thing we need to do if
we're thinking about using

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:29.060
the hydrolysis of ATP is
actually calculate what the

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:33.080
delta g for the reaction of
ATP hydrolysis is, and I

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.250
picked 310 kelvin because
that's the

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:36.830
temperature of our bodies.

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:41.220
So again, this reaction is
taking adenosine triphosphate

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:44.020
that has three phosphate groups
and hydrolyzing it, so

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:47.680
reacting it with water
to form ADP plus

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:51.810
phosphate plus acid here.

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:54.490
So I'll tell you that the delta
h of this reaction is

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:56.460
negative 24 kilojoules
per mole.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:59.770
This is what we actually
calculated in class on Friday.

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:05.370
And that the delta s is plus 22
joules per k, per mole, so

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:09.270
we can go ahead and calculate
what this delta g is here.

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:14.000
So the delta g of this overall
reaction is just going to be,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.260
of course, delta h minus t delta
s, and our delta h is

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:27.340
minus 24 kilojoules per mole,
and we'll subtract 310

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.590
kelvin times 0 .

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:38.720
022 kilojoules over k mole.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:43.020
So if we do this, what we end
up getting is a delta g of

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:47.280
negative 31 kilojoules
per mole of ATP.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:52.130
All right, so again, this is
good, we got a negative

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:53.890
number, that's what
we were expecting.

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:56.990
So that means that we will have
energy available to use

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:59.670
if we hydrolyize ATP
and couple it to

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.990
another reaction here.

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:04.450
So what we saw for our
delta g, negative 31

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:05.910
kilojoules per mole.

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:09.300
All right, so let's talk about
a reaction that is a ATP

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.400
coupled reaction, and there's
just tons of examples of this

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.060
in our body.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:16.100
One I picked because it has to
do with glucose, which we have

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:20.350
talked so much about, is the
conversion of glucose to

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:22.520
glucose 6 p.

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.950
So 6 p -- p just stands for a
phosphate group here, so what

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:29.190
we're doing is taking, if we
numbered the glucose carbons,

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:32.330
this would be carbon number
six, and we're putting a

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:34.910
phosphate group on carbon
number six.

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:38.430
So first of all, why would our
body need to do this reaction?

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:40.770
It turns out that glucose,
we know that we

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:42.220
use glucose for energy.

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:47.610
Glucose is somewhat apolar, so
it can actually move in and

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:49.890
out of our cells, because
our cell walls,

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:51.220
those are very greasy.

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:53.820
So what we're actually doing
here is we're putting a

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:56.490
charged molecule onto
the glucose.

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:59.280
There's two negative charges in
a phosphate group, this is

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.010
going to make sure that
our glucose is now

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:02.950
it's very polar molecule.

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:05.400
And now that we have a very
polar molecule, we're not

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.240
going to be able to have
the glucose move in

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.460
and out of the cell.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.610
So we keep it in our cell
by putting this

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:12.000
phosphate group on it.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.380
That's why we want to do this
reaction, but let's think

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:17.620
about the energy of
actually doing it.

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:21.510
And it turns out that this
requires energy.

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:25.630
The delta g for this reaction
is 17 kilojoules per mole.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:28.700
All right, so that could be a
problem if our body had not

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:32.180
come up with a way to solve it,
which it has, and what it

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.940
actually does is it couples this
reaction here with the

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.040
conversion of ATP into ADP.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.560
And we just calculated that that
has a delta g of negative

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.270
31 kilojoules per mole.

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:47.190
So this means we can think about
delta g total, and by

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:50.780
total we mean of this overall
process here.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:54.650
So that's just equal to 17,
and we're adding it to the

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:58.070
other delta g, which
is negative 31.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:01.550
So we get an overall delta g for
this process of negative

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:03.270
14 kilojoules per mole.

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:06.370
All right, so that's one really
simple example just to

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:09.850
illustrate to you how these ATP
coupled reactions work.

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:14.060
Some ATP coupled reactions
require one molar equivalent

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.200
of ATP, some require
a lot more.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.860
But essentially, the
idea is the same.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:21.170
We have this reaction that's
energetically unfavorable that

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:21.940
we couple with an

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:24.000
energetically favorable reaction.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.190
So, quite literally, this is
what we mean when we talk

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:29.840
about ATP as being the energy
currency for the cell.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.090
We spend some ATP in order to
get these non-spontaneous

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:34.210
reactions to go.

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:37.940
All right, so I also want to
talk to a little bit about

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:39.260
hydrogen bonding.

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:42.510
This also is a topic that deals
with the thermodynamics,

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:45.480
and it also is related to the
ideas that we talked about

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.980
before in terms of
thinking about

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:50.880
different types of bonds.

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.260
So if we talk about a hydrogen
bond, a hydrogen bond, first I

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:57.430
just want to be really clear,
is not a covalent bond.

00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:01.030
So this h x bond here is a
covalent bond, this is not a

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:02.100
hydrogen bond.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:05.290
But a hydrogen bond can form
when you have a partial

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:08.480
positive on a hydrogen, and
you have what's called a

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.010
hydrogen bond donor atom, which
has a partial negative

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:14.330
on it, and also has
a lone pair.

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:17.820
Typically this y atom will be
on a separate molecule.

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:21.450
And what happens is you have
that Coulombic attraction

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:24.150
between the partial positive
on the hydrogen and the

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:27.780
partial negative on this
hydrogen bond donor atom.

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.720
So what you form between them is
a hydrogen bond, and you'll

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.020
notice that I drew it
as a dashed line.

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:36.360
H bonds or hydrogen bonds are
drawn either as dashed lines

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.530
or as dotted lines, and
they're done so to

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:41.930
differentiate them from covalent
bonds, which we draw

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:44.530
with this straight line here.

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:48.100
So let's think about what
can form hydrogen bonds.

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:51.130
First of all, there's a
requirement for what this h x

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:52.510
bond can be.

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:56.060
It has to be a really
electronegative atom in this x

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.600
here, because we need to we
need to form that partial

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:01.950
positive on the hydrogen, which
means that the atom that

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:04.770
it's covalentally bonded to
needs to be pulling away some

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:07.290
of that electron density from
the hydrogen, such that we

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:10.470
have a delta positive
on a hydrogen atom.

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:14.260
Similarly, the same atoms are
what can be the y here, so it

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:17.420
can either be a nitrogen or
an oxygen or a fluorine.

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.320
So these are the only
hydrogen bond donors

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.420
that can form h bonds.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.190
And we can think about the
reason for this and the reason

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:27.250
is pretty straightforward.

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:30.320
We need to have a small atom,
but it also needs to be really

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.620
electronegative.

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.910
This should make sense because
we need to have this partial

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:37.190
negative charge here to have
that Coulomb attraction.

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:39.730
And the other requirement is
that we definitely need to

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:43.180
have that lone pair of electrons
so it can actually

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:47.990
interact in this hydrogen
bond here.

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:50.770
So let's take a look at an
example of a hydrogen bond,

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:52.850
and that's between two
water molecules.

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:56.220
So let's go ahead and re-draw
our water molecules -- they're

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.640
just kind of randomly
oriented there.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.440
But let's re-draw them as if
they were going to have a

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.090
hydrogen bond between them.

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:05.800
And one thing I want to point
out about hydrogen bonds is

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.230
that they're strongest when you
actually have all three

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:12.470
atoms in a straight line like
this, because it keeps the

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:15.270
dipoles the strongest, so the
partial positive here and the

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:17.050
partial negative here
can interact.

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:24.480
So let's re-draw our water
molecules like that.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.820
So we have our first water
molecule here, and let's say

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:30.060
we're going to be talking about
this hydrogen in terms

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:30.940
of hydrogen bonding.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.400
Obviously, we have four
hydrogens up there that can

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:37.555
take place or take part in h
bonding, but we're just going

00:28:37.555 --> 00:28:39.050
to focus on this one here.

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:41.570
So that means we want our
straight line to be something

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.370
like this to our
second oxygen.

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:48.540
So let's draw the hydrogens on
this water molecule as well.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:52.820
All right, so thinking about
what the Lewis structure of

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:55.295
water is, how many lone
pairs do we have

00:28:55.295 --> 00:28:56.850
on this oxygen here?

00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:57.820
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:58.680
PROFESSOR: Two lone
pairs, great.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:02.485
So let's draw those in,
and let's draw these

00:29:02.485 --> 00:29:04.020
lone pairs in as well.

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:07.250
All right, and we're going to
be talking about these two

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:10.540
atoms in terms of our hydrogen
bond, so does this have a

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:13.860
delta plus or a delta
negative on it?

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:14.570
Delta plus.

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:18.515
So this is a polar bond here,
this o h bond, so we have a

00:29:18.515 --> 00:29:23.280
delta plus on our hydrogen, and
we have a delta minus on

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.010
our oxygen.

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:26.410
So these also have delta
plusses, of course, and this

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:28.360
also has a delta minus.

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:31.070
So because these two can
interact and they're lined up

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:35.210
to do so, what we can do is we
can draw a hydrogen bond right

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:39.630
in between this hydrogen and
this oxygen atom here.

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:43.420
So again, I pointed out that,
in fact, hydrogen bonds are

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:46.300
not as strong as
covalent bonds.

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.210
Since they're not as strong, if
you remember thinking about

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:52.750
the relationship between bond
strength and bond length,

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:55.960
would you expect a hydrogen bond
to be longer or shorter

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.080
than a covalent bond?

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.560
STUDENT: Longer.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.410
PROFESSOR: Good, OK, it
should be longer here.

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:04.920
So this is our longer bond
because it's our weaker bond.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.150
They're not held together
as tightly.

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:12.080
All right, so this is an example
of an intermolecular

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:16.010
hydrogen bond, it's between
two different molecules.

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:18.650
Hopefully, you can also see that
if we're focusing on any

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:23.340
single one water molecule, we
could also form hydrogen bonds

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:26.160
between other water molecules
with either of these two

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:30.120
hydrogens as well, and also with
our other lone pair here.

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:33.230
So any water molecule can
actually form four different

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:34.300
hydrogen bonds.

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:38.460
All right, so let's talk a
little bit about these

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.730
hydrogen bonds in terms of their
bond enthalpies here.

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.200
I said that they were weaker
than covalent bonds, so let's

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.720
look at a few comparisons
here.

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:50.380
So we can look at an h o
hydrogen bond versus an h o

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.510
covalent bond.

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:55.170
And what we find is that the
bond enthalpies in kilojoules

00:30:55.170 --> 00:31:00.450
per mole, it's 20 kilojoules per
mole for a hydrogen bond

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:05.430
versus 463 kilojoules per mole
for a covalent bond.

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:07.730
So we're not talking about
just a little bit weaker,

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:09.620
we're talking about much,
much weaker for the

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.940
hydrogen bonds here.

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:15.120
Similarly, if we look at
nitrogen, for nitrogen

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:19.860
hydrogen bonds, if we have an
o h bound to a nitrogen,

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:22.390
that's 29 kilojoules per mole.

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:26.080
If it's an n h hydrogen bound
to a nitrogen, that's 14

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:29.670
kilojoules per mole, and if
we're talking about an h n

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:32.550
covalent bond, now we're
talking about 388

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:34.780
kilojoules per mole.

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:39.260
All right, so again what we see
in these cases is that the

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.960
hydrogen bonds are much,
much weaker.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:46.440
They tend to be as low as 5% of
what the covalent bond is,

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:49.620
so this is actually much weaker
than any kinds of bonds

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:53.460
we have within molecules, but
it's also the strongest type

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:55.070
of bond that we can
have between

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:56.420
two different molecules.

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:59.800
And one thing that you find as
in the case of water, is when

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.650
you have lots of hydrogen bonds
between molecules it

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:06.510
changes the property of, for
example, water here.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:08.940
It makes the boiling point much,
much higher than you

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:12.120
might expect if you looked at
the other properties, because

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:15.380
you have to actually break apart
all of these individual

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:17.510
hydrogen bonds, and even though
it's not that much

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:20.560
energy for one individual
hydrogen bond, once you get a

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:23.070
huge number of hydrogen bonds,
you're talking about huge

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:25.440
energies here.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.280
So let's look at some examples
of where we see hydrogen bonds

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.180
in biological processes.

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:33.060
First thinking about proteins,
they're absolutely hugely

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:34.730
important in proteins.

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:37.420
And in proteins, we're talking
about a molecule that's so

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:40.980
large that you don't just see
h bonds in between two

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:44.960
different molecules, what you
actually see is what's called

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.970
intramolecular hydrogen bonding,
so hydrogen bonding

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:50.190
within the protein
molecule itself.

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:52.875
And hydrogen bonding is
incredibly important, it, in

00:32:52.875 --> 00:32:56.670
fact, is the shape of a protein,
which I'm just

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:59.390
showing an example here, histone
deacetylase, and the

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:06.350
histone deacetylase molecule
actually has just countless

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:09.970
hydrogen bonds in here, and
the hydrogen bonds largely

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:11.930
govern the shape of
the molecule.

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:14.790
So, if you're thinking about any
protein that has a shape,

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:17.780
so for example, we see these
ribbon structures here,

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:21.080
they're called alpha helices,
you can see some arrows, which

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:24.150
are just like a sheet structure
or beta sheets, that

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:28.320
actual shape is stabilized and
formed in the first place by

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:32.000
just many, many hydrogen bonds
within the protein being in a

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.890
correct orientation that allows
for this particular

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:36.410
shape to be stabilized.

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:39.040
And we know that shape is so
important when we're talking

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:42.090
about proteins, and that's
because the actual shape of

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:44.610
the protein governs the
interaction with other

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:46.810
proteins or other
small molecules.

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:49.480
The shape of the protein is
very important in terms of

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:53.660
positioning the specific atoms
that are involved in the

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:57.150
chemistry that the enzyme
carries out being in the

00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:58.560
correct position.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.230
So hydrogen bonds are very

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:02.170
important in terms of proteins.

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:04.570
We can also think of them
in terms of sugars or

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:05.060
polysaccharides.

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:08.890
This is a nice dramatic example,
thinking about the

00:34:08.890 --> 00:34:11.740
structure of a protein is a
very microscopic way of

00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:13.180
thinking about hydrogen
bonding.

00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:16.130
If we want to take it to the
macroscopic level, we can talk

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:18.470
about h bonding in trees.

00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:21.710
So if we're talking about trees,
trees are made up -- a

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:27.060
major part of a tree is the
polysaccharide cellulose.

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:29.150
So that's shown right here.

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:31.230
Cellulose is a chain of glucose

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:33.050
molecules linked together.

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:36.180
It can be as many as 1,000 or
more glucose molecules linked

00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:37.730
together covalentally.

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:41.095
But what actually happens to
those individual chains is

00:34:41.095 --> 00:34:43.520
that if you look at this picture
here, all those dotted

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.710
lines are actually
hydrogen bonds.

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:49.450
So the individual molecules are
in a much larger chain of

00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:52.640
hydrogen bonded molecules and
they're incredibly rigid.

00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:55.060
You have so many hydrogen bonds
that now it takes a huge

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:56.910
amount of energy to break
all of these.

00:34:56.910 --> 00:34:59.010
So that accounts for
why wood is such

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:00.630
a hard, solid material.

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:03.870
And also, I mean for any plant,
and tree is the most

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:07.000
dramatic, the structure of
a tree, the macroscopic

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.150
structure, can be explained
by hydrogen bonding.

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:11.940
It's hydrogen bonds that keep
all of those molecules

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.870
together in the forest
and in trees.

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:15.190
All right.

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:18.220
So, that's proteins, that
thinking about sugars.

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:20.180
We can also talk about
the importance of

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:23.180
hydrogen bonding in DNA.

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.730
So if you think about the
characteristic DNA double

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:30.600
helix, hydrogen bonds, we have
in a double helix we have two

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:34.140
strands of DNA that you can
see are intertwined here.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:37.120
And those two strands are
actually held together by

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:38.860
hydrogen bonding.

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:41.420
So specifically, it's hydrogen
bonding between what are

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:44.530
called complimentary bases
within the DNA.

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:48.810
So, for example, if we look at
guanine and cytosine here, you

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:52.430
can see that there's several
places, when they're lined up

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:54.730
like this, where we can
have hydrogen bonds.

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:58.080
So in terms of thinking about
how these two molecules are

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.890
lined up, how many h bonds
would you expect

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:04.020
between these two bases?

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.810
Yeah, so it's lined up
that there are three

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:08.460
that can form here.

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:13.840
So we have an o h hydrogen bond,
an h n, and then an h o

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:16.260
hydrogen bond that can form.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:18.470
So the other side of
complimentary based pairs are

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:22.100
AT base pairs, and if you look
at the way these are lined up

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.610
here, how many hydrogen
bonds can form between

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:27.050
A and T base pairs?

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:29.620
Yup, so it it's two that
we can form here.

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:34.750
We have one between the h o, one
between the n h, and you

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:38.970
see that we've lost this
nitrogen, this n h group here,

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:41.410
and first of all this would be
too far apart anyway for

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:45.150
hydrogen bond, but we can't have
a hydrogen bond form when

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:46.920
we have a carbon h.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:50.955
Remember, it has to either be
a nitrogen or an oxygen or a

00:36:50.955 --> 00:36:53.870
fluorine because those are the
atoms that are going to pull

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:57.190
away enough electron density
from the hydrogen to give it a

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:59.430
partial positive charge
that it needs.

00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:02.810
So in terms of thinking about
DNA, this is a really neat

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:05.780
case to consider the actual
thermodynamics or the bond

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:09.150
enthalpies of the hydrogen
bonds, because, of course,

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:11.710
does not always stay in it's
double helix -- when we're

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:15.150
talking about transcription, we
actually need to unzip or

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:18.490
separate this helix into its
two strands, so each

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:20.720
individual strand
can be copied.

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:23.380
So it's really important that
hydrogen bonds are strong

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:26.750
enough to hold the DNA double
strand together, but that

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:29.860
they're not so strong that when
you actually pull the

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:33.200
hydrogen bonds apart to open up
the double strand, that you

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.500
actually, you don't want to
break all of a covalent bonds

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.460
in DNA as well.

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:40.740
All right, so that's all we're
going to say in terms of

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:43.390
thinking about thermodynamics
and biological systems.

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:45.690
Hold on a sec, we have
plenty of time left.

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:47.730
I want to go over a few
clicker questions.

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:50.430
I didn't want to give you too
long set of notes, because

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:52.490
we're switching over to
Professor Drennan's going to

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:55.340
start lecturing on Friday, so
I thought maybe I shouldn't

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:58.150
have to have her finish
up with my notes.

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:01.150
So, Professor Drennan will
continue talking about

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:04.260
thermodynamics and thinking
about equilibrium, and then

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:06.450
she'll transition that into
talking about kinetics.

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:09.410
So that's actually what's going
to start happening after

00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:11.610
the exam on Wednesday.

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:14.320
But let's take a look, since we
do you have a little bit of

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:18.460
time left, at a few clicker
questions just to make sure

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:21.450
everyone has caught what
we've gone over so far.

00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:25.210
And a few reviews for the exam,
and I will have this

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:29.480
clicker question or one of the
ones following, be a clicker

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.410
question quiz, so make sure you
are still answering these

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:34.620
questions here.

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:37.740
So the first one covers what we
went over today, so I want

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:40.230
you to tell me and try to not
look back in your notes for

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:44.710
this, for a reaction where you
have a positive enthalpy and a

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:48.720
negative entropy change, would
you expect this reaction to be

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:51.070
never, always, or sometimes
spontaneous?

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:53.780
So let's take 10 seconds
on that, that

00:38:53.780 --> 00:39:05.700
should be pretty fast.

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:06.650
OK, excellent.

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:08.220
90% is very good.

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:10.990
So this should never be
spontaneous, because we both

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:14.650
have the entropy and the
enthalpy term contributing to

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:16.010
a positive delta g.

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:19.710
All right, let's shift gears to
a couple of questions that

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:21.060
are review for the exam.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:23.110
So hopefully, these
will all be very

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:25.230
straightforward for you now.

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:28.460
So I want you to think about
bond lengths here, and tell me

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:32.760
which molecule contains the
shorter nitrogen oxygen bond.

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:38.120
So, we're comparing n o minus
1, and n o 2 minus 1.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.180
So if you wanted to get started
on this problem,

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:43.200
what's the first thing
you should do?

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.860
Yeah, draw some Lewis
structures.

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:47.850
So that might be a good
place to start in

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:56.110
thinking about this.

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:58.850
So I'll do that up here as well,
but don't look if you

00:39:58.850 --> 00:40:01.310
want to try it on your own.

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:04.130
Remember, the quiz points
come for answering, not

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:05.260
for getting it right.

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:26.590
So try doing it on
your own here.

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:34.340
All right, let's go ahead
and take 10 more

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:49.270
seconds on this one.

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.890
OK, hold on.

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:51.440
Don't show the correct answer.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.020
You know we're going to re-poll
and give you a little

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.320
bit more time to see if we
come to a consensus here.

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:58.270
So let's take another 30 seconds
or so on this while I

00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:32.430
finish drawing these up here.

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:33.060
OK, good.

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:38.410
So we've got 81% have it correct
that in the n o minus

00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:41.500
1 bond here, this is going
to be a double bond.

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:46.200
STUDENT: What if [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:47.090
PROFESSOR: No.

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:49.440
It would be a double
bond here.

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.880
So, if you follow just the Lewis
structure rules, and you

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:54.970
go ahead, you'll find that we
end up having four bonding

00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:56.770
electrons available.

00:41:56.770 --> 00:42:00.370
So you can just go ahead and
plug those in, and you end up

00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:01.820
with this many left.

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:08.120
If we had a triple bond, then
we would end up having more

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.590
bonding -- or we would end up
using more electrons than we

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:12.190
have available for
bonding here.

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:18.060
All right, so we have a double
bond in the case of n o.

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:22.180
What is this bond that
we have here?

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:24.170
Yup, so it's actually a 1 .

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:24.860
5 bond.

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:26.600
What is this bond that
we have here?

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:28.360
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:31.260
PROFESSOR: All right,
so we have two 1 .

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:33.780
5 bonds in this case, how
come these are 1.

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.630
5 and not, for example,
a double bond?

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:36.840
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:38.580
PROFESSOR: Great, so
that's the key.

00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:40.790
Even though we have double
bonds in each of these

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:44.350
structures, in this case here,
we have resonance, so it's

00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:46.460
turns out to be, in
fact, two 1 .

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:47.620
5 bonds.

00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:50.410
So since this is the double
bond, it's going to be the

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:51.500
stronger bond.

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.620
Since it's the stronger bond,
it's also going to be the

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:54.670
shorter bond.

00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:57.060
So make sure you can make those
relationships between

00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:01.160
bond strength and bond length
and thinking about if you have

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:02.940
resonance or you don't
have resonance in

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:04.260
a particular situation.

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:08.510
All right, let's try one more
clicker question here.

00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:10.950
We'll have this be the
last one for you.

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:13.140
So this is one that hopefully
you'll all get right, because

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:15.670
we've gone over this again and
again both in class and

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:16.670
recitation.

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:19.390
So let's talk about the
hybridization of the specific

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:23.230
carbon and oxygen atoms in ATP,
so I want you to go ahead

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:25.970
and tell me what these
hyrbridizations are

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:49.550
for these two atoms.

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:51.580
OK, let's take 10 more seconds
here, get those

00:43:51.580 --> 00:44:03.800
final answers in.

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:06.790
OK, good, so 83% of
you got this.

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:08.100
Let's take a look at why.

00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:13.250
So carbon a is bonded to three
things, but it is bonded to no

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:17.580
lone pairs, so we need to have
it be three hybrid orbitals,

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:19.440
so it's s p 2.

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:23.260
And oxygen is bonded to two
atoms plus two lone paris.

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:26.220
So we need four hybrid
orbitals or s p 3.

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:28.490
All right, so this was your quiz
question, so as long as

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:31.600
you answered it, you got your
quiz points for today.

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:35.780
And you can get going a little
bit early today and finish

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.850
studying for this exam.
