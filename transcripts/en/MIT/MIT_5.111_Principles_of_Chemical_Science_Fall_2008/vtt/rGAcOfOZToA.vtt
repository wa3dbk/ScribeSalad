00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:25.470
PROFESSOR: So, let's finish
up new material today, new

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.060
material Monday, and then
we're done with

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.040
the kinetics unit.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.710
So, we're going to talk about
temperature, collision theory,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.900
and activated complex
theory today.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.980
So on the first day, we talked
about kinetics, we talked

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.860
about factors affecting the
rates, and this was in your

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.740
handout on that first lecture,
but just to kind of review for

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.450
a minute what we have
talked about so far

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.690
and where we're going.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.930
So these are some of the things
we came up with are

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.710
factors affecting the
rates of reaction.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.360
People said mechanism affects
the rate of reaction, so we

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.140
talked about mechanism.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.190
Concentration of material,
nature of material -- that

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.330
pretty much fits in
in every lecture.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.145
We've been talking some about
that, say, if it's first order

00:01:11.145 --> 00:01:13.970
or second order, if you have a
concentration term in there,

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.690
or if you don't have a
concentration term.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.810
The nature of the material,
we're going to talk more about

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:18.730
that today.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.450
Temperature is going to be the
number one topic for today,

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.150
and on Monday the number one
topic is the use of catalysts

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.030
to speed up reactions.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.980
So, by Monday we'll be
done with this list.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.810
So, what about temperature.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.110
So temperature, when I said
what affects the rate of

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.690
reaction, temperature was one of
the things that you yelled

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.410
out at me, and that's very much
true, it has one of the

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.320
biggest effects on the
rate of reactions.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.300
So when we were talking about
the gas phase, there was an

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.090
observation made that the
reaction rates tend to

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.900
increase as the temperature
increases.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.530
And most of you can think about
this and are aware of

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.820
it, and today we're going
to talk more about the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.120
quantitative affect of this,
how much does the rate of a

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.400
reaction increase when the
temperature increases, how do

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.530
you know what equation
do you use.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.810
So, this idea has been
around for awhile.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.620
So in 1889, Arrhenius plotted
rate constants versus

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.780
temperature, and he found that
if he plotted the natural log

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.200
of those rate constants versus
inverse temperature, then he

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.320
would get a straight line.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.390
So let's look at the
plot that he had.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.570
So, he found that if he plotted
natural log of the

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.080
rate constants versus 1 over
temperature, so units or

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.440
kelvin to the minus 1, that
he got a straight line.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.070
Which means that the rate
constants are varying

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.610
exponentially with inverse
temperature.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.470
So you have to use a natural log
to get a straight line, if

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.080
you don't use natural log,
you wouldn't get a

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.220
straight line here.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.170
So, let's look at some of these
terms that we have here,

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.440
and here's our equation for the
straight line, the natural

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.830
log of k equals minus e a -- e
a is activation energy, which

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.410
we're going to talk a lot about
today -- over r t, r is

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.280
our friend the gas constant,
and t is temperature, plus

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.430
natural log of a.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.530
So what is a?

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.760
A is called factor a or
sometimes it's called

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.190
pre-exponential factor, and had
has the same units as k, k

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.320
being the rate constant.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.570
So, let's think about this
equation and this plot, and

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.070
about factor A and this other
term, activation energy.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.690
So, factor A and activation
energy depend on the reaction

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.620
being studied.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.380
So, it depends on the nature
of the materials involved.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.860
So I said we'd talk again about
nature of the material.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.970
So one kind of reaction's going
to have one activation

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.070
energy, another one will
have a different one.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.860
So, let's think about
this term, factor

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.880
A. What is it exactly?

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.080
Do you think it would be
temperature dependent?

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.490
What do you think?

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.190
How many people think
yes, it would

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.900
be temperature dependent?

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.310
How many people think no?

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.100
Some people are not
going to commit.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.800
The answer is no.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.370
So, let's think about
what factor A is.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.450
So, factor A is the rate
constant at some really,

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.830
really large temperature.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.960
So, if we look at this plot,
the natural log of k equals

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.330
the natural log of A, or
k equals A if you're

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.030
along this axis here.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.130
If you're along that axis
here, that's at zero, so

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.420
that's when 1 over temperature
equals zero, then the rate

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.610
constant equals factor A. What
would be true about the

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:08.390
temperature for 1 over
temperature to equal zero?

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.930
Very big.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.920
So, at the biggest, hugest
temperature you can imagine,

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.420
the rate constant's going to
equal A. And so, factor A

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.780
depends on the nature of the
material being studied and you

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.540
would have to determine
what that value is.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.370
But it's definitely not
temperature dependent.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.880
It's the value of the rate
constant at an enormous

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.480
temperature.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.060
So, what about activation
energy?

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.190
Do you think that's temperature
dependent?

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.490
Why don't you tell me
what you think.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:06:26.020
All right, let's take
10 more seconds.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.440
All right, so I'd like you
to discuss this amongst

00:06:28.440 --> 00:07:16.260
yourselves and see whether
you're happy with this answer.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:32.440
All right, go ahead
and vote again.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:39.170
All right, 10 more seconds.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.530
And the correct answer is?

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.110
So, I think most of you will
remember this answer.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.580
So the activation energy is
not temperature dependent.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.980
You can calculate what the
activation energy is by

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.430
plotting the rate constants
versus 1 over temperature, and

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.790
then you get it from the
slope of the line.

00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:00.170
So, activation energy depends on
the nature of the material,

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.320
but it isn't temperature
dependent.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.810
So, we're going to talk a lot
more about that today.

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.280
Before we leave this, I just
want to say one thing about a

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.480
clicker question.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:15.140
So, at the end of last time, we
had our first repeat winner

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.850
for a clicker competition.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:21.790
So, we thought that we might
have an opportunity for

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:26.950
recitations to see if they can
-- if some other recitation

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:28.410
can get a second win.

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:30.630
So on Monday we're going to
have our final clicker

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:35.490
competition, and if somebody
else does tie, one section,

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:40.370
that we'll have a final one-time
clicker question

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:41.700
that'll be a run-off.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.560
And whatever recitation wins, we
have special prizes for the

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.040
members of that recitation.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.870
So that's on Monday.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:54.450
So you may want to review
catalysis on Monday, if you

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:58.450
feel that you're in the running
for the grand champion

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:01.850
clicker recitation.

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:05.630
All right, so let's
go back to this.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:10.610
So we found out that no,
activation energy is not

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:14.500
temperature dependent.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:18.160
All right, so what are you going
to see on your equation

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.330
sheet on the final, you may
see a couple of different

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:25.210
forms that are all equivalent
to each other.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:28.210
So here is the plot of
a straight line.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:33.220
It will often be written with
just natural log of a and e a

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.280
over r t terms reversed.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.400
So that's as a straight line,
and this is often what you see

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.680
for the Araneus equation.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:45.080
You can also get rid of the
natural logs and have the term

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:49.620
here exponential, so you have
k equals factor A times e to

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.950
the minus, activation energy
divided by r t.

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:56.560
So, those are the equations,
they're all equivalent to each

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.550
other that you might see
on your equation sheet.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:05.950
So, it's also true that
non-gases can exhibit this

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:10.080
kind of behavior, and let me
just give you one example of a

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.340
non-gas that exhibits this kind
of behavior and you tell

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:19.440
me what this is.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.250
What is that?

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:22.660
Crickets.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.660
So crickets exhibit Arrhenius
behavior.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:31.070
They will chirp faster as the
temperature gets hotter.

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:34.290
So if you're out camping,
sometimes it can be in the

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.270
summer, it can be actually be
quite deafening, and you were

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:39.560
very happy to go back to the
city where you only have

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.210
ambulances and cars going, and
you don't have this incredible

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.050
racket at night.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:48.920
You can actually calculate what
the temperature is by

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:53.200
counting the number of chirps
of the crickets and using a

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.100
little equation.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:57.940
I think it's you count for 14
seconds and add 40 and that's

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.540
the temperature in fahrenheit
or something like that.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:06.920
So, not only gases do this
kind of behavior.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.360
All right, so activation energy,
we're going to be

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.470
talking a lot about
this today.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:14.630
So, what is it exactly.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:19.600
So let's think about two
molecules coming together.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.470
So when two molecules come
together, you have this

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:27.630
bimolecular process going on,
but every time two molecules

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.210
come together, they're
not going to go

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.650
on and form a product.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:36.970
You're only going to form a
product when those molecules

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:39.620
have a critical amount
of energy.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:44.440
When they have the energy which
allows them to react,

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.270
that activation energy.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:49.180
If they have enough energy when
they come together, they

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.960
will go on and form products.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.580
So, that's what activation
energy is, it's this critical

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:59.440
amount of energy that they need
to react with each other.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.120
All right, so let's just think
about what affects that

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.240
critical amount of energy, and
of course, temperature is

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.910
going to be involved.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:13.300
So let's think about that.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:23.220
So if we have fraction of
molecules on one side, and we

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:30.430
have kinetic energy down here,
let's think about how

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:32.130
temperature is involved
in this.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:38.040
So, at a low temperature, the
fraction of molecules that are

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:43.620
going to have enough energy to
react is going to be less.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:47.890
And let's think about at a
higher temperature, go like

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:54.510
this, so this is high
temperature, and we have low

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:56.510
temperature up here.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:01.210
And then over here we would have
our activation energy,

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:04.150
the energy needed
for a reaction.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.530
And you see, if you're at low
temperature, only a small

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:11.050
number of molecules are going
to have enough energy to

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:16.480
react, but if you're at higher
temperature, a large number of

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.900
molecules are going to have that
critical energy to react.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.060
So, at low temperature, not
many can react, at higher

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.250
temperature, many more will have
that energy -- will be

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:31.570
able to overcome that activation
energy, will have

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:34.320
it and they can react.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.510
So, temperature plays
a big role here.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:42.850
So we can use this idea of
activation energy to predict a

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:46.070
rate constant.

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:49.100
Let's look at an example.

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:56.000
So, often people have sucrose
in their diet, and the

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.370
hydrolysis of sucrose will form
glucose and fructose as

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.790
part of this digestive
process.

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:06.320
And we can think about the
rates at which that would

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.880
happen in the body.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.940
So normally, we're at 37
degrees, that's normal body

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:15.600
temperature, and we have the
observed rate constant for

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.540
that is 1 .

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:20.590
0 times 10 to the minus 3
per molar per second.

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:24.030
But what happens if your body
temperature is lowered, what

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:29.150
happens if it was at 35 degrees,
and to be able to

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:32.410
answer that question, you need
to know what the activation

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:35.830
energy is for this process,
and here it's 108

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:41.050
kilojoules per mole.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:44.180
So, we want to ask the question,
what is the new rate

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:47.060
constant at 35 degrees?

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:52.050
So, we can take our Arrhenius
equations, and we can put a 1

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:55.280
by the rate constant for
temperature 1, and a 2 for the

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.760
rate constant at
temperature 2.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:02.040
Now we can combine
these equations.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:05.860
Natural log of a cancels out,
it's not temperature dependent

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.700
so it doesn't stay in here.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.860
And so we can solve, we can
subtract these two, or that's

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:16.400
equivalent to dividing them,
and so natural log of rate

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.530
constant 2 over rate constant 1
equals minus the activation

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:25.460
energy over the gas constant
times this temperature term.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.330
Does this look at
all familiar?

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:28.890
Does this look like some
other equation you

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:31.740
saw once upon a time?

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:35.450
Do you remember what that
equation was called?

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:37.250
Van't Hoff equation, right.

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.970
And there we were
comparing what

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:41.930
instead of rate constants?

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:45.210
Equilibrium constants, and
instead of e a, what term did

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.140
we have here?

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.100
Delta h, right.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.430
And it's good you remember that
because we're going to

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.960
come back to that at the
end of today's class.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.890
So, we can use this equation
and plug in the values.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:01.230
We put in our activation energy,
and remember to pay

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:03.950
attention to units, because if
you're going to cancel your

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:06.740
joules with a gas constant, you
want to make sure you've

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:10.980
converted your kilojoules to
joules, and then we can plug

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:14.450
everything in and
solve for k 2.

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:16.360
So, here k 2 is 7 .

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.750
6 times 10 to the minus
4 per molar per

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.930
second, so it's slower.

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.710
And this is one reason why it's
really nice to have your

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:26.730
body temperature stay the
normal temperature.

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:30.830
If you get too cold, your body
processes, your enzymes are

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:33.100
not functioning, everything
is slowed down.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.270
And if you get too hot, that's
not good either.

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:38.670
So you really want to maintain
it, and so for some of you who

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:42.720
come to MIT from warmer
climates, let me introduce you

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:46.120
to the L.L. Bean catalog, they
sell coats, they sell boots,

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.220
and all sorts of things.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:52.000
So, this winter, when you come
back for IAP, or for the term,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.030
you're well-prepared, and you
don't have to prove that it's

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:58.370
not good if your body
temperature

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:03.400
goes below 37 degrees.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.300
All right, let's think about
what else this equation tells

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:10.910
us, and the other thing it tells
us is that if you have a

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:16.450
very large activation energy,
if this e a is a very, very

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:20.370
big number, that means that your
rate constants will be

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:22.490
very sensitive to temperature.

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:25.620
So if this is really, really
big, there's going to be a big

00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:28.790
change in your rate constants
as temperature changes.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.280
And keep that in mind,
we're going to come

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.120
back to that later.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:38.060
So, what do you think happens
to the rate of an enzymatic

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.780
reaction at liquid nitrogen
temperatures?

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:45.010
We looked at going from 37
degrees to 35, liquid nitrogen

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:47.530
is pretty cold.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:51.490
So, not a whole lot happens at
liquid nitrogen temperatures

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:56.100
as far as enzymes go, and I'll
just mention, so it slows way

00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:00.570
down, that this is a trick that
I use in my research.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:05.340
So we have crystals of enzymes,
and we can try to get

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:10.210
structures in particular states
by taking the crystals

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:13.470
that have enzyme in it, and
starting a reaction, and then

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:16.870
dunking the crystals in liquid
nitrogen to kind of stop it at

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:19.360
a particular stage, and then you
look at what the structure

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.190
looks like.

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:21.540
So that's one use.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.570
So, we're going to also take a
look at other reactions, we

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:27.620
don't have any enzymes here,
but some other things, and

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:32.630
look at what happens when we
get things to be very cold.

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:50.660
[EXPERIMENTING]

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:53.890
So, Dr. Taylor is pouring out
some liquid nitrogen.

00:18:53.890 --> 00:19:04.640
PROFESSOR: All right, so what
we're going to look at is a

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.620
reaction that we can see
pretty easily here.

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:11.140
Have any of you used glow sticks
before, maybe trick or

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.650
treating or some other point.

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:17.030
So basically, you may or may
not know how they work.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:19.540
There's two compartments in
glow sticks that have two

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.960
different chemicals in them, and
they're trade secrets so

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.530
we can't put them
on the board.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:26.250
But basically, what we have
here is a reaction.

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:29.160
A lot of reactions we know give
off heat, or they give

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.680
infrared light.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.690
Here we have a reaction
that gives off

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:35.180
energy as visible light.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.970
So would you call this an
endothermic or an exothermic

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:39.950
reaction here?

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:42.170
Yeah, so this is an exothermic
reaction.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:45.820
So just as Professor Drennan was
talking about with slowing

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.620
down enzymatic reactions we can
think about if we can slow

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.340
down this reaction.

00:19:50.340 --> 00:20:01.780
So, we're just going to put it
in the liquid nitrogen -- so,

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:04.840
keep an eye on this, we'll do
several controls of different

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:05.680
colors here.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:09.390
So, see if an orange glow
stick works the same.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:10.960
What we're looking to
see is if we can

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.690
slow down this reaction.

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:14.760
What would we see if we
slowed it down or even

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.290
if we stopped it?

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:19.370
Yeah, we're not going to
see anymore color.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.840
So are you starting to see
color loss in this first

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:28.380
reaction here?

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:39.820
So, we'll try green,
and yellow.

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.360
So, it looks like this first
one might have stopped

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.400
already, you see there's
no color anymore here.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.890
What would you expect if this
heated back up to room

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:49.990
temperature?

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:52.860
Yeah, so hopefully, if you just
keep your eye on this,

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.310
we'll continue on with the
lecturing, because I don't

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:57.810
know how long it will take for
it to warm back up the room

00:20:57.810 --> 00:20:58.900
temperature.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.360
But keep an eye and we'll see if
we get the temperature back

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.540
high enough to see
the glow again.

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.670
And since we do have a liquid
nitrogen here, it's too hard

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:10.580
to resist freezing a flower.

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:15.310
This has nothing to do with
kinetics -- we can't even try

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:17.170
that connection.

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:20.770
But we will be freeze
a flower.

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:28.320
OK, she will try making --
good catharsis pre-exam.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:36.700
PROFESSOR: So, has
anyone had liquid

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:41.410
nitrogen applied to them?

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:45.320
It's used in doctor's offices,
if you want a little something

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.350
removed perhaps, put a little
liquid nitrogen

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.640
on and burn it off.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.400
Good premed training for you.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.270
I think we're pretty
frozen here.

00:21:54.270 --> 00:22:04.600
So it looks the same, but
as you can see --

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.830
[INAUDIBLE] --

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:14.924
So I think that's all
we can do [LAUGHTER]

00:22:14.924 --> 00:22:25.710
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:30.086
PROFESSOR: So I actually heard
something interesting on NPR

00:22:30.086 --> 00:22:33.190
about liquid nitrogen removing
warts and things like that,

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:35.250
and they were talking about how
there was something that

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:36.700
was actually better than liquid

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.480
nitrogen for doing that.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.930
Did anyone hear the story about
what the thing was that

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:44.230
was better than liquid
nitrogen?

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:47.670
It was duct tape.

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.610
And so some scientists had
looked at what all the uses of

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:51.850
duct tape are.

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:54.390
And since most of you are
planning on being scientists

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:57.120
or engineers, duct tape will
probably be an important part

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.380
of your life in the future.

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:03.130
And so, duct tape worked better
than liquid nitrogen

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:04.520
for removing warts.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.180
And they found that duct
tape worked really well

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.380
for a lot of things.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.000
There was only one thing
they tried that it did

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.860
not work well for.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.630
Anyone want to guess
what that was?

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:19.020
Repairing ducts, yes.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.980
Not really good -- there were
many, many, many better ways

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:26.170
to repair ducts than with duct
tape, but I guess they decided

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:30.150
that calling it wart removal
tape was just not quite as

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:32.670
catchy as duct tape,
so it's still

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:38.330
referred to as duct tape.

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:44.970
OK, so when you lower the
temperature, things

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:46.240
tend to slow down.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:51.390
But if molecules are going to
react, they need to have

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:54.750
enough energy, they need to have
a high enough temperature

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:58.400
to overcome this activation
energy.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.200
So that critical amount.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.490
So again, when the molecules
come together, and let's just

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:08.720
look at these for a minute, when
they're coming together

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:12.810
to react, and if they're going
to react, there needs to be

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:15.130
some energy associated with
this, because you're probably

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:17.760
going to have to break a bond,
and that's going to take

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:21.190
something, and then you
may have to form a

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:22.980
new bond, for example.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:26.250
So there needs to be a critical
amount of energy, you

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:29.730
need to be able to overcome that
activation energy barrier

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:32.020
for the molecules to react.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:35.630
So it always takes some energy
for things to react and so you

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:37.500
need to have enough energy.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:42.080
And so, if those molecules have
that energy, they'll come

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.330
together, react, and you'll
form products.

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:46.580
If they don't have that energy,
they're just going to

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:52.060
go back to what they were,
unchanged reactants.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:56.040
So you need to have sufficient
energy to overcome that

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.060
activation energy barrier.

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:02.560
So, this is just a little movie
that shows two molecules

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:06.840
coming together, and if they
have enough energy to react,

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:11.940
you will see a spark, and then
the molecules will react.

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.350
So, here we go.

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:15.630
Molecule in red, in
green, they're

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:16.710
checking each other out.

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:19.560
Do they have enough -- they had
enough energy, and they

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:25.100
reacted, and went
on to product.

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:30.100
All right, so let's talk about
this activation energy barrier

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:38.410
and these activated complexes.

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:53.750
OK, so in this example, you have
n o 2 plus c o, and they

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:58.320
can come together and
form n o plus c o 2.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:02.590
And that's going to take some
amount of energy to react.

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:05.740
And so, I'm drawing something
that's called an activated

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:16.260
energy diagram, and we have
potential energy on one axis,

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:19.620
and on the other we have what's
called a reaction

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:28.560
coordinate.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.420
And so, the reactants are going
to have a certain amount

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:36.870
of energy, so our reactants are
going to have some amount

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:39.800
of energy, and our products
will have

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:45.880
some amount of energy.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:51.690
But even though in this case the
change, the products are

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:56.720
lower in energy, and you have
a delta e for the difference

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.620
between the reactants and the
products, they can't go

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.190
directly to products.

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:05.080
They have to overcome an
activation energy barrier.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.870
So they have to overcome
some kind of barrier

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:12.480
before they can react.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:16.510
So, only ones that can overcome
that barrier, that

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:20.400
have enough energy to overcome
this activation energy

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.920
barrier, so the activation
energy for the forward

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:27.440
reaction, only those will
be able to react.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:31.340
There's also an activation
energy barrier for the reverse

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:33.850
reaction on this side.

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:36.340
So, if you go from products
to reactants, you have to

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:40.020
overcome that activation
energy barrier.

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:47.780
And up here, this is called the
activated complex, so you

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:55.120
have some kind of activated
complex or transition state,

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:58.260
so the molecules will come
together, they'll form some

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.820
kind of transition state
up here, and then

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:04.660
go down into products.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:08.290
OK, so most of you are sort of
familiar with the concept, I

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:10.350
think, of this activation
energy, we've been talking

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:14.200
about it, but the idea of an
activation energy barrier, I

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.470
think is something that probably
all of you can

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:18.180
personally connect with.

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:23.270
So, for me, one of the things
that I find really hard to do

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:26.510
is get started writing
a long National

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:28.300
Institutes of Health grant.

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:33.710
They're about 25 pages long,
they're single spaced, font

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:37.870
11, and they have point 5
margins on every side of the

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:42.390
page, and it's really dense,
and it takes a long time to

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:43.990
sort of get going on that.

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:47.660
And so, there is deadlines, and
MIT is very particular,

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:50.830
you need to have it to the
Office of Sponsored Research

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:54.060
five full business days before
it's due at the National

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.680
Institutes of Health, and then
the Department needs

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:57.800
to sign off on it.

00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.830
And I'll be looking at my
calendar and I have those

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:03.160
dates marked, and checking how
many days I have left, and

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:06.290
eventually, just like getting
started, it's like oh, there's

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:09.400
so much to do, I have to read
the literature, the new stuff

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.160
that's come out on my topic.

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.460
And I have to think about what
projects I'm going to do in

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:16.080
the future, and I have to write
about the progress that

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:19.220
I've made so far, which is not
really what I want it to be.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:23.910
And so, I think a lot about how
-- it's just overwhelming.

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:25.940
But then eventually
something happens.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:29.490
Either it's tremendous fear that
there's so few days left

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:31.360
and you just have to do it.

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:34.300
Sometimes it's going and getting
an enormous cup of

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.750
coffee and sitting down.

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:38.520
You know, people have been
known to sort of chain

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.890
themselves to their desk, like
they're not going to get to

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:45.120
get up until they've written the
introduction to the grant.

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.330
So, a lot you can connect
with this.

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:51.030
That any new thing you start,
there's some barrier that you

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:53.360
have to overcome to get
started with it.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.332
And often once you're started
it's not that bad, and some of

00:29:56.332 --> 00:30:00.250
you may be thinking, exam 1 was
a long time ago, I recall

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:02.760
there was a lot of material
on exam 1.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.670
And it seems really scary.

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:07.760
But then the fact that I mention
the final exam over

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:11.710
and over in class is helping you
get that energy that you

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:15.790
need to overcome that activation
energy barrier and

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:18.017
start studying, because once you
start studying you go, Oh

00:30:18.017 --> 00:30:19.970
yeah, I remember this,
this wasn't so bad.

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:23.860
So you just need to get over
that activation energy barrier

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.060
and you're all set.

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:28.330
So, molecules have to do the
same thing, and the ones that

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:32.640
have higher temperature have
an easier time getting over

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.670
that barrier.

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:39.530
So, here we can talk about
this general process.

00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:42.470
We can look at the individual
numbers involved.

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:45.550
So in this particular case,
there's an activation energy

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:53.170
for the forward reaction of 132
kilojoules per mole, and

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:57.310
there is an activation energy
for the reverse reaction of

00:30:57.310 --> 00:31:01.770
358 kilojoules per mole.

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:05.640
And there's also a delta e for
the reaction, which is this

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.680
line, from reactions to
products, which in this case

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:13.410
is minus 226 kilojoules
per mole.

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:15.850
So do you think this reaction is
endothermic or exothermic?

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:23.170
What do you think, exothermic
or endothermic?

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:29.770
It's exothermic, and if you look
back in your notes, we

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:32.970
talked a little bit about the
relationship between delta h

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:33.920
and delta e.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:38.440
And they're actually
pretty similar.

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:45.070
A delta h usually equals delta
e plus a change in p v. So,

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:50.920
for gases it's about 1% or 2%
difference, and for solids,

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.840
there's really negligible
difference between

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.150
delta e and delta h.

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:58.570
So, they're pretty similar
types of values.

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:01.995
So, we can we can think about
what delta e really is, and so

00:32:01.995 --> 00:32:05.830
delta e in terms of activation
energy is going to be equal to

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:09.880
the activation energy for the
forward reaction minus the

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:13.220
activation energy for the
reverse reaction.

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:17.650
And in this particular case,
we have 226 kilojoules per

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:24.440
mole is our delta e, and for our
forward reaction, we have

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:33.060
132 kilojoules per mole, and for
the reverse reaction, the

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:38.700
activation energy for the
reverse reaction is 358

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:43.730
kilojoules per mole, and so
these should all equal up to

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:44.640
each other.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.010
And so, if you know two of
these values, you can

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:48.250
calculate the third.

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:50.270
And this is one of the equations
that you have to

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:53.760
memorize for the final, because
it has, its sort of a

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:56.540
conceptual thing that you need
to understand what this

00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:01.050
diagram says, that this plus
that is equal to that, that

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:02.940
these all add up
to each other.

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:05.950
And if you have a negative value
here, that means it's an

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:07.990
exothermic reaction.

00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:12.030
So, this delta e is a change
in internal energy of the

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:16.330
system, and you can determine
that value experimentally,

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:21.030
say, with a calorimetry
experiment.

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:27.800
OK, so let's keep this in mind
and go on and take a look at

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:31.060
how this connects back with some
other things that we have

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:34.020
already talked about
in this course.

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:37.730
So, for an elementary reaction,
and I think for all

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:40.060
of us, there's always
some activation

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.510
energy barrier to overcome.

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:46.090
There's always some positive
activation energy to overcome.

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:49.050
And because there's always
this activation energy to

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:52.680
overcome, increasing the
temperature is always going to

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:56.150
increase the rate of an
elementary reaction.

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:59.120
It's always going to make it
easier to get over that

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.930
activation energy barrier.

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:06.350
But for an overall reaction,
increasing the temperature may

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:09.140
not increase the rate
of the reaction.

00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:14.480
So let's consider why
that would be true.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:17.580
So, here is a reaction that
we've talked about before, we

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:20.950
talked about this proposed
mechanism where we have a fast

00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:26.530
reversible step and a
slow second step.

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:28.800
So we learned last time that
we can write the rate of

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:33.000
product formation from the
second step, there are two

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.340
molecules of n o 2 being formed,
so we have 2 times k

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:39.790
2, the concentration
of n 2 o 2, and the

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:43.310
concentration of o 2.

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:46.370
But this is an intermediate, so
we need to solve for that

00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:49.040
intermediate.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:54.530
So, in this case, we have a fast
reversible first reaction

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:56.730
and a slow second reaction.

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:59.860
So this intermediate is going to
build up, and it's going to

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:03.840
be more or less an equilibrium
with the reactants, because

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:07.180
this is very fast, and only a
little bit of this is siphoned

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:12.270
off to make product, and so this
creates an equilibrium

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:13.560
type situation.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:17.440
So why don't you solve this
intermediate for me, this is a

00:35:17.440 --> 00:36:13.090
review from the last class.

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:29.150
OK, let's just take
10 more seconds.

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:33.760
Very good.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:37.250
So, we can solve for this,
equilibrium constant for the

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:40.980
first step, products over
reactants, and then if you

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:43.770
solved for this, the
intermediate here, which is

00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:47.440
the product in the first step,
then it would be equal to k 1

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.150
times n o squared.

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:55.350
We can take that term and we can
we can plug it in, so over

00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:59.720
here, we can substitute it into
this equation, and so we

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:08.160
have 2 k 2, big K 1 times
n o squared times o 2.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.740
All right, so here
is our rate then.

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:13.810
And if you missed some of this,
this was in the notes

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:15.310
from before.

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:19.190
So now let's think about the
effect of temperature.

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:23.610
So, k 2 is an elementary rate
constant, and so its

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:26.230
temperature -- if you increase
the temperature,

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:29.640
its rate will increase.

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:34.980
So here again is our equation,
the activation energy is

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:37.260
always positive, there's always
positive, there's

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:39.500
always some barrier
to overcome.

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.850
So if you increase the
temperature, you're always

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:46.040
going to increase the
elementary rate.

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:49.200
Well, what about equilibrium
constant?

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:52.890
So we've talked about this back
in chemical equilibrium

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:56.330
that the effect of temperature
on the equilibrium constant

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:58.580
depends on whether the reaction
is endothermic or

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:01.030
exothermic.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:05.000
And you told me before, the
equation, and that's the Van't

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.970
Hoff equation shown here.

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:09.830
And so look how similar
those equations are.

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:13.480
So for an elementary rate
constant, we had e a, and for

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:18.090
equilibrium constant, we're
talking about delta h.

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:23.020
So, if you have, here the
reaction is exothermic, and if

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:26.640
you increase the temperature
of an exothermic reaction,

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:33.760
what happens to k?

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:36.750
It decreases.

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:40.490
So, again, it would shift,
then, to the endothermic

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:42.840
direction, decreasing k.

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.270
So let's look at this then.

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:47.760
So we have in this k obs term,
we have an elementary rate

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:51.330
constant and an equilibrium
constant, so if you if you

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:54.940
increase the temperature, the
rate constant increases, but

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:59.950
the equilibrium constant
is going to decrease.

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:03.550
So, the magnitude of the
increase or decrease depends

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:09.440
on the size of the activation
energy or the size of delta h.

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:12.780
So for this particular example,
there's no way that

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:14.860
you would know this so I'm
telling you, that the

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:17.620
activation energy is a small
number, or you might be able

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:21.090
to look it up in your book,
and delta h is a very big

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:24.030
number and it's negative, it's
an exothermic reaction.

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:27.940
So if you have a very small
number for e a, that means

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:30.300
that the rate constant will
increase only a little bit,

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:33.250
it's not that sensitive to a
change in temperature, because

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:35.280
e a's a very small number.

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:38.920
But if delta h is a big number,
then the equilibrium

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:41.940
constant would decrease a lot
with temperature because this

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:43.470
is a big number here.

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:46.410
So in this particular example,
increasing the temperature

00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:50.740
actually decreases the observed
rate, because delta h

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:53.690
is, in this particular example,
a much bigger thing.

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:56.470
So if you were given either
numbers or some information

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:59.350
like that, you should be able
to rationalize what might be

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:05.260
true about the rate of the
reaction. so, a large

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:08.560
activation energy means that
the rate constant is very

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:10.780
sensitive to changes
in temperature.

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:14.570
A large delta h means
equilibrium constant is very

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:18.620
sensitive to changes
in temperature.

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:22.450
And, as we've talked about, e
a is always positive, so the

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:26.320
elementary rates always increase
with temperature,

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:32.010
whereas delta h can be positive
or negative, so

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:36.410
equilibrium constants can
increase or decrease with

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:38.240
temperature.

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:42.460
And here, the magnitude of
delta h indicates the

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:45.280
magnitude of the change, how
much k will change, will it be

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:48.410
a big change or a small change,
whereas the sign of

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:55.480
delta h indicates the direction
of the change.

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.810
So, just want to review one
thing and then we'll

00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:00.140
stop for the day.

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:04.510
So when a stress is applied to
a system, an equilibrium, the

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:08.490
system tends to try to
minimize that stress.

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:12.130
So we're back to LeChatelier's
principle.

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:14.790
And so, just one more clicker
question and we'll

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:15.670
stop for the day.

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:21.130
So increasing the temperature
is going to do what again?

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:36.430
Again, thinking back
to LeChatelier.

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:51.500
And just 10 more seconds.

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:52.630
Very good.

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:56.750
So, we're going to finish up
these notes on Monday.

00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:59.840
We're going to think about
LeChatelier in a new way,

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.920
we're going to think about it in
terms of activation energy,

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:06.050
which is really fun, because we
tie back what we learned in

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:08.490
the middle of course to what
we're seeing now in the end of

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:09.250
the course.

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:11.600
All right, have a great
weekend, everybody.
