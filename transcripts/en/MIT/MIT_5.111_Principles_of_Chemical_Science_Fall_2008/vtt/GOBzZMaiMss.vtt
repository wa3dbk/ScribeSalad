00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:24.190
PROFESSOR: OK, so today we're
going to start talking about

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.720
acids and bases, and this is
acid-base equilibrium, so you

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.610
can't forget anything that
you've learned from the last

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.930
two lectures about
equilibrium.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.050
And then we're going to talk
about, after this, oxidation

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.490
reduction equilibrium, and
so there's a lot of

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.410
equilibrium going on.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.010
So today we're going to give
you some definitions.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.780
We're going to talk about
autoionization of water.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.190
We're going to talk about the
p h function, which most

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.460
people are familiar with.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.620
We may think about what the p
h's are of some commonly found

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.520
ingredients around campus.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.420
And talk about the strengths
of those acids and bases.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.740
And then if we have time, we'll
start thinking about how

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.090
to work a problem associated
with a weak acid.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.900
So actually, I guess, do we want
to do that other clicker

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.610
question, maybe, before
we get started?

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.090
At some point, we're going to
ask you a question about when

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.450
you want forums. So, I'm not
sure if we're going to have

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.460
that for you today or not, but
we need to -- we want to have

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.280
these pizza forums where you can
come, and the time isn't

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.490
always working, so we thought
we could use the clickers to

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.930
figure out what the best
time is for people.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.860
So we may have that
for you later.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.090
So this is the narrowest
definition of

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.150
an acid and a base.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.920
So the narrowest definition of
an acid and a base is that an

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.805
acid is a substance when you
dissolve it in water, it

00:01:55.805 --> 00:02:01.140
increases the concentration of
hydrogen ions, or h plus.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.260
Whereas a base is a substance
that when dissolved in water,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.030
increases the concentration of
hydroxide ions, or o h minus.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.530
So that's pretty narrow.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.210
We can be broader.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.060
We can talk about
Bronsted-Lowry, and here, an

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.420
acid is described as a substance
that can donate a

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.690
hydrogen ion.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.560
And a base is described as a
substance that can accept a

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.880
hydrogen ion.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:45.870
So let's look at some examples
using that definition.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:03:02.770
So let's look at an example, so
c h 3, c o o h plus water,

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:10.100
and I guess I should put that in
aqueous, going to hydronium

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:22.540
ion plus c h 3, c o
o minus aqueous.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.790
All right, so what
is going on here?

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.420
So if we look at the things on
one side of the equation and

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.270
the other, you can see that this
is an acid that has lost

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.090
its hydrogen ion, so the
hydrogen is gone, whereas the

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.140
water molecule has gained a
hydrogen ion, and so now it's

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.180
h 3 o plus.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:53.670
So we have an acid here, it's
acting as an acid, and acid

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.280
acts as a substance that gives
up a hydrogen ion, and the

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.030
water is acting as a base,
it's accepting

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.010
that hydrogen ion.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.680
And when it accepts the hydrogen
ion, it becomes an

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.870
acid in the reverse direction,
whereas when the acid gives

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.560
off the hydrogen ion,
it becomes a base

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.460
in the reverse direction.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.870
So in the reverse direction,
hydronium ions is giving off a

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:29.015
hydrogen ion to this base,
reforming the acid, and after

00:04:29.015 --> 00:04:32.850
a hydronium ion gives off
its hydrogen ion,

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.540
it forms water again.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.990
So that would be an example of
Bronsted-Lowry talking about

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.355
substances as acids and bases
whether they accept or donate

00:04:43.355 --> 00:04:44.790
a hydrogen ion.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.650
And this is the definition we're
going to be using mostly

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.330
throughout this unit.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:57.720
So, let's look at a little
movie of this going on.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.700
So, in this movie, we have our
water molecules with red and

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:08.890
the white dots here are their
hydrogen atoms, and now we're

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.180
going to come in and have an
acid come in, there's the

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.060
acid, it has the hydrogen
ion on it in white.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.120
It meets up with a water
molecule, and now you formed

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.740
hydronium ion.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.960
And that forms another water
molecule and it passes it

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.910
along, so there's a different
molecule of hydronium ion.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:35.230
So that's what's going on
in this definition.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.180
All right.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.000
So this brings us to another
term, which is conjugate acid

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.220
base pairs, so you can talk
about something being a

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:50.300
conjugate base of a particular
acid, and so a conjugate base

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.880
of an acid is a base that's
formed after the acid has

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.070
donated its hydrogen ion.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.950
A conjugate acid of a base is
the acids that its formed when

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.050
the base accepts the
hydrogen ion.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.350
So you can look at those
examples here.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.740
So we have a pair that we've
drawn here with this red line,

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.050
an acid base pair, and the other
pair is the water and

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.580
the hydronium ion.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.330
All right, let's look at a
couple more examples to get

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.610
the sense of this and
figure out what are

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:34.130
the acid base pairs.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:39.540
So, one more example.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:50.570
So now let's look at h c o 3
minus an aqueous solution and

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:58.690
water, going to, again,
hydronium ion, and c o 3 minus

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:06.930
2, also an aqueous solution.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:12.600
So, what is h c o 3 minus
acting as here?

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.990
As an acid.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.430
And so what does that
make water?

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.970
A base.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:26.700
And so the conjugate acid of
that base, again, is the

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.810
hydronium ion concentration.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:34.910
And the conjugate base
of the acid is c o 3

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.170
minus 2, over here.

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.210
And so in the reverse direction,
this base will be

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:46.020
accepting a hydrogen ion from
the acid, forming the

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.670
conjugates on the other side.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.530
OK, now you can do an example.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:56.830
Let's have a clicker question.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:41.790
So identify what the acid and
the base pairs are here.

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:57.270
All right, let's take
10 seconds.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.720
That's quite good actually.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.770
So, that's correct and you can
write it in your notes that

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:08.280
here we see that there's a
little bit of change, water's

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.740
doing something different.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.660
So instead of the conjugate of
water being the hydronium ion,

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.200
we see it's a hydroxide.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.980
So here, the water is acting
as an acid giving off a

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:25.040
hydrogen ion to this
h c o 3 minus.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.200
And so now we have a second
hydrogen ion over here, we

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:33.300
have the h 2 species, and that
the conjugate of water is o h.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.610
So this is acting as a base,
it's accepting a hydrogen ion,

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:39.850
this is donating it, it's an
acid, this is the conjugate

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:42.310
acid of that base, and
this is the conjugate

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:43.770
base of that acid.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.830
So in the reverse direction,
this is an acid giving off a

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:51.170
hydrogen ion to the hydroxide
forming water.

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.590
So one thing that you'll notice
about these examples

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:56.850
that we've written up is that
when you see water in the

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:59.250
equation, you don't really know
what it's going to be

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.270
doing until you actually look
at what the products are and

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:03.640
then you can figure it out.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.020
So water can act as either
an acid or a

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.290
base in these equations.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:16.280
And if we go to the lecture
notes, the term is amphoteric,

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.910
which is a molecule that can
act as either an acid or a

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.620
base, depending on the
reaction conditions.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.640
So depending on if it's mixed
with something that's a

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.730
stronger acid or a stronger
base than it is.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:34.400
And an example, one of the most
common examples is water.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.960
So now let's consider a broader
example of acids and

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.250
bases, and these are Lewis acids
and bases, and we're

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:46.150
going to actually come back to
this around Thanksgiving time

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:48.410
when we talk about transition
metals.

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.780
And so here it's really broad
-- we're not actually even

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:55.370
going to talk about a
hydrogen ion at all.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:59.790
So in this case, we're talking
about a Lewis base as a

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:04.550
species that donates lone pair
electrons, and a Lewis acid is

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:09.260
a species that accepts
such electrons.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.650
So here would be an example.

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:16.120
So we can think about forming a
complex, and which thing is

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:20.420
going to act as an
acid or a base.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:24.320
One will be donating its lone
pair electrons and the other

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.160
will be accepting.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.320
So this is a very broad, a much
broader definition, and

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.790
so when you talk about acid base
here, so always say as a

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:38.060
Lewis acid or Lewis base to make
it clear what's going on.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:41.380
So again we have our base
donating its lone pair

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.010
electrons and the
acid accepting.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:47.660
All right, so those are
our definitions

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:50.680
of acids and bases.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:56.060
So now let's come back to this
issue of water and how water

00:11:56.060 --> 00:12:00.050
can act as an acid or a base.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:03.760
So if it can act as an acid or
a base, it seems like it can

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:08.380
react with itself to do some
chemistry, and it can.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.700
So up here, you could have one
water molecule acting as an

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:15.310
acid, giving up its hydrogen ion
to another water acting as

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:18.460
a base, forming hydronium
ion and also

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.580
forming hydroxide ion.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:26.040
So then you can ask the
question, well, how much h 2 o

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.630
is in a typical glass
of water.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.810
How much, so you don't like
the idea that I'm drinking

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.150
hydroxide ions, how much
hydronium ion and how much

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:40.230
hydroxide ion are in this glass
of water, how much h 2 o

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:44.510
is in a glass of water?

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:47.400
So that's the question.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:52.440
So here's the equation again,
and we can think about how to

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.490
calculate it.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:58.330
What do we really want to
know in this question?

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.060
What are we really asking?

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:05.730
How much, at an equilibrium
situation, how much are

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:09.170
products and how much reactants
do you have?

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:12.530
What can you tell me about
ratios of products and

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:15.910
reactants at equilibrium?

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:20.030
K. And how are some ways
you can calculate k's?

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:29.690
Different terms, but, right,
it's what about -- what is k?

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:32.690
So we have the equilibrium
constant, and there a couple

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:35.330
different ways one might
calculate k -- you might be

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:40.850
given concentrations at
equilibrium, or you might be

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:45.030
given information
about delta g.

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:51.060
So you can calculate k's from
delta g nought, and this is an

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.690
equation that you'll use pretty
often -- delta g nought

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:57.320
equals minus r t natural
log of k.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.560
So if we want to know k, we
need to find out what

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.580
delta g nought is.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:06.530
What are ways to calculate
delta g?

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:12.010
So you've seen some of those
-- oh, you're probably

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:13.100
recognizing these already,

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.350
temperature and our gas constant.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:19.480
So we can solve for k
in terms of delta g.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.350
And how do we calculate
that delta g.

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:25.930
Well, there are a
couple of ways.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:32.990
So you can think about the delta
g's of formations, and

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:37.980
we can think about one of my
personal favorites, which is

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.770
relationship between delta
h and t delta s.

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:45.220
So you can think about your
enthalpies and your entropies

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.450
at a certain temperature, and
you can calculate delta g, and

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:50.920
from that you can get the
equilibrium constant.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:54.790
So this is just a little review
showing the relevance

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.775
of material you've learned
before to the material we're

00:14:57.775 --> 00:14:59.800
covering now.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:04.610
So we're going to pick one and
just calculate the delta g.

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:09.220
So we can look up these values
of formation for our products

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:13.510
and our reactants and plug them
in, and we get a value

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:16.890
for delta g nought
of plus 79 .

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:20.310
89 kilojoules per mole.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:23.830
So we have a positive
value here.

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:26.770
So without doing any more math,
which we'll do it a

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:32.530
minute, do you expect a large
or small value for k for the

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:36.630
equilibrium constant if delta
g nought is positive 79 .

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:37.580
89 kilojoules per mole.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.280
STUDENT: Small.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.130
PROFESSOR: We would expect
it to be small.

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:46.140
And you probably already knew
that that there's a lot of h 2

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.540
o in a glass of water.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.660
So again, from that perspective,
we'd also expect

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:51.970
it to be small.

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:56.190
So now we can plug those values
in, we calculated this

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:59.950
delta g, we know the gas
constant, we're at room

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:04.820
temperature, and so we get
a value of k as 1 .

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:11.610
0 times 10 to the minus 14 at
room temperature, and that's a

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:14.040
small number.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:19.030
So, the very small value
indicates that only a small

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:25.280
percentage all your h 2 0 has
ionized, and that mostly,

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:29.740
there's h 2 o in a glass of
water, not so many ions.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:33.100
Not many of the molecules have
ionized, because k is a small

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:37.010
number, not a lot of products
at this equilibrium.

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:41.700
So there's a lot of h 2
o in a glass of water.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:45.080
So, this particular k has
a special name, and

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.530
it's k w, w for water.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:52.780
And this term and this number,
if you haven't memorized it in

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.240
high school, you probably will
by the time you're done with

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.470
problem-sets.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.270
This is a very valuable number,
you'll be using it a

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:03.890
lot in calculating acid base
problems, and you will end up

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:08.820
memorizing it whether
you want to or not.

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:16.710
So, then k w equals your
hydronium ion concentration

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:21.070
times your hydroxide
ion concentration.

00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:25.210
Now for a minute, let's consider
why that's true.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:30.270
So our reaction, it's products
over reactants for an

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:33.540
equilibrium constant, but now,
all of a sudden, I don't have

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.140
my reactants going on in here.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:39.700
So the k w is expressed in terms
of the concentration a

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:43.020
hydronium ions times the
concentration of hydroxide,

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:46.140
and it doesn't have this water
term at the bottom.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:50.070
And that'll be true for
any problem in which

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.210
the water is a solvent.

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:56.510
And so, it's really not going
to be changing very much.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:18:00.100
A solvent is nearly pure, and
when you have in a nearly pure

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:04.830
solvent or solid, it's not
included in the equilibrium

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:05.780
expression.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:09.790
So we'll see other examples
of this as we go along.

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:13.420
So you always want to ask
yourself is this the solvent.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:19.000
If so, we're talking about very
dilute things going on in

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.140
solvent, the solvent
concentration isn't changing

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:26.170
very much, so it drops
out of our term.

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:30.070
So, because k w is an
equilibrium constant, the

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:33.690
products are always going to be
equal to the same thing at

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:35.060
the same temperature.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:39.780
So, at room temperature, or 298
kelvin, it's always going

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:40.970
to be equal to 1 .

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:43.650
0 times 10 to the minus 14,
and that's why it's such a

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:45.910
valuable number.

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:49.310
And when we're talking about
acid base problems, you're

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:53.310
almost always going to be at
room temperature, just to not

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:55.930
make life more complicated
for you.

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:59.040
So, you can pretty much assume,
it should be in big

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.200
bold letters if the temperature
is not room

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:06.810
temperature, so that you
can use these values.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:14.290
All right, so let's look at
the p h function now.

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:18.000
So what does p h equal?

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.200
So p h is equal to the minus the
log of the hydronium ion

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:30.550
concentration, and let's also
talk about p o h, and that's

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:39.190
equal to minus log of the
hydroxide ion concentration.

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:45.000
I just told you that k w is
equal to the concentration of

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.140
hydronium ions times
the concentration

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:51.160
of hydroxide ions.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.160
And now we can express
this in another very

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.800
useful way for you.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:02.280
If we take the log of all sides,
actually let's take the

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:13.260
minus log of everything, so
minus log of k w equals the

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:23.180
minus log of hydronium ion
concentration, minus the log

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:28.890
of hydroxide ion concentration,
and we end up

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:35.760
with terms of p k w being equal
to p h, because minus

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:40.710
log of the hydronium ion
concentration is p h, and

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:45.350
minus the log of the hydroxide
concentration is p o h.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.990
So plus p o h.

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:51.960
And we know that this term at
room temperature is 1 .

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:56.670
0 times 10 to the minus 14.

00:20:56.670 --> 00:21:00.730
So this term at room
temperature is 14 .

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:09.940
0 0, again at 25 degrees
c or 298 kelvin.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.920
So this is also a useful
expression.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:19.190
If you know the p h, you can
calculate the p o h if you're

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:24.080
at room temperature, remembering
this number of 14.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.440
So these are things that you
will be doing a lot in the

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.980
problems and you will start
remembering all of these

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.910
numbers really well.

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:36.040
So p h and p o h, what
does p h do for you?

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.850
Well, the p h tells you about
the strength of the acid.

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:48.060
So the p h of pure water should
be neutral, which is 7.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:51.420
And now, tell me what the
p h of an acid is and

00:21:51.420 --> 00:22:09.530
the p h of a base.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:11.910
Let's just do 10 seconds
on this, this is pretty

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:12.240
straightforward.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:28.140
So this tests previous knowledge
on this topic, and

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.250
it is very good.

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:34.390
People know about what
the p h's are.

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:36.550
So that's right.

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:40.810
So the p h of an acid solution
is less than 7, and the p h of

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:42.950
a base solution is
greater than 7.

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:48.170
And the EPA defines corrosive as
something where the p h is

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:52.150
lower than 3 or greater
than 12 .

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:54.440
5.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:23:01.340
So, if here is our scale of p
h, we're neutral at 7, we're

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:05.200
acidic below 7, and we're
corrosive below 3.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.870
We're basic above 7, and
corrosive above 12 .

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:09.200
5.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:14.280
So now what I want to do is ask
Dr. Taylor to come up and

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:18.320
we're going to measure some p
h's of things, so we're going

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:22.930
to be interested in knowing
how much danger you're in

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:24.140
around MIT.

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:35.390
So we're going to have
you measure them.

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:38.890
We have these little strips on
it, and so someone will come

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:42.280
around and help you read it, so
you can read off the strip

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:49.620
of what you have. Should
we start with water?

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:51.630
This is random MIT water.

00:23:51.630 --> 00:24:00.180
Let's start there.

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.690
So, just pick a volunteer.

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:22.190
PROFESSOR: OK, so what we're
going to do is have the TA's

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:25.420
go in and ask you to read off
of a p h strip, what the p h

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.550
of various things are, and
actually Marcus, if you could

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:30.920
write on the board
what these are.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.150
So we'll start with MIT water.

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:37.870
So, we know if it's 7 it's
neutral, if it's below 7 we're

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:40.750
talking about acidic, and
above that it's basic.

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:44.050
We actually, also for you to be
able to visualize as well,

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:47.550
what I did is I just boiled up
some cabbage last night and

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:49.530
brought in the extract
with me.

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:54.690
And cabbage actually has
anthocyanins in it, which is a

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:58.660
color indicator, and it changes
color based on whether

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.190
it's in an acidic or
a basic solution.

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:03.550
So we'll let you
see this here.

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:06.530
It looks like MIT water,
pretty safe to drink,

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:08.300
which is good news.

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:18.540
We can go ahead and -- so it
looks like if we add MIT water

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:21.530
to cabbage solution, what do you
think's going to happen --

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:24.630
this is neutral right now.

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:25.930
Hopefully not much.

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:29.540
We either have invalid
strips or we'll see

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.060
nothing happen here.

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:33.690
All right, so you can see we
still have the purple color

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:34.590
for MIT water.

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:38.270
Two confirmations that it's safe
to drink right out of the

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:39.910
tap when you get home.

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:43.210
So, the next thing is
vinegar did someone

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:44.500
take the, the strip?

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.500
STUDENT: We have
a 2 and a 1/2.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.840
PROFESSOR: OK, so are
we drinking vinegar?

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.670
STUDENT: No.

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:50.980
PROFESSOR: Probably
not straight.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:57.490
All right, so we've
got our cabbage

00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:59.820
extract here, it's purple.

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.950
Does anyone have a guess as to
what color it's going to turn

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:03.860
if we pour in vinegar,
very acidic.

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:07.890
All right, a couple guesses
I hear, blue and pink.

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:09.870
They're both good guesses
because different color

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:12.900
indicators turn different
colors.

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:21.220
But, all right, looks like a
dramatic difference here.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:24.030
What do we have next
out there?

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:29.780
Baking soda.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:31.700
Seven for the baking soda.

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:34.130
I'm going to guess we did not
pour in enough or it is not

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:35.550
dissolved here.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:38.140
All right, so let's do our
secondary test here and see

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:39.870
what happens with
the baking soda.

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:49.426
PROFESSOR: [UNINTELLIGIBLE] the
water we added it to was

00:26:49.426 --> 00:26:49.480
also not neutral.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.950
PROFESSOR: All right, so we're
actually pretty basic with the

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:51.640
baking soda.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.230
We won't give it a number
because it was just

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:54.140
dissolved in water.

00:26:54.140 --> 00:27:04.250
But we'll remember baking soda,
blue here is basic.

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:06.850
So the next thing we're going to
test is soda that you drink

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:07.520
all the time.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.590
I brought Sprite.

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:11.240
Coke probably would have
been a good pick as

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.370
well or Diet Coke.

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:15.780
So, we'll test what that is.

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:26.250
Hopefully it comes out
neutral, right?

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:28.050
So while we're waiting, we'll
start taking a little

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:30.900
bit of a look here.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:34.110
All right, we've got a 3.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:34.520
Soda, corrosive.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:41.290
It's not just the sugar that's
bad for your teeth.

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:46.270
Luckily we see here it is not
quite as bad as vinegar in

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:49.260
terms of how acidic it is, but
we definitely have a color

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:50.070
change here.

00:27:50.070 --> 00:28:00.228
PROFESSOR: Has anyone
used soda for

00:28:00.228 --> 00:28:01.780
something other than drinking?

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.332
What did you use it for?

00:28:03.332 --> 00:28:04.500
STUDENT: Cleaning pennies.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.950
PROFESSOR: Cleaning pennies,
what else?

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:12.185
STUDENT: When you have stuff all
over your car battery you

00:28:12.185 --> 00:28:13.430
can use Coke.

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:17.580
PROFESSOR: And some of those
other uses make sense.

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:17.720
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:17.960
What else?

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:18.150
STUDENT: Taking the
galvanization

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:18.210
off of a steel wire.

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:18.570
PROFESSOR: OK, so cleaning
steel wire.

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:19.080
How many of you still drink soda
knowing this information?

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:40.230
PROFESSOR: All right, so the
next thing we put out there

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:42.140
was aspirin dissolved in water,
and it's going to

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.950
depend what concentration we
did, but we put aspirin in

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:47.580
water and we got a 3 here.

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:53.560
So, aspirin sometimes gives
you an upset stomach, and

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:57.880
that's why Tylenol's an
improvement in some ways --

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.640
obviously, that has its
own drawbacks, too.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.340
But you can see what your
stomach on aspirin might be

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.190
feeling like here.

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:07.210
So if you're having an upset
stomach, something you might

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:12.880
do is take Tums or Mylanta or
some other kind of a -- yeah,

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:20.200
let's measure the p h here.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.380
So if you decide to take some
Milk of Magnesia after an

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:25.180
upset stomach, are you
hoping it will be

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.730
acidic or basic here?

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:28.290
STUDENT: Basic.

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:36.670
PROFESSOR: All right, let's
see what we get.

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:38.920
All right, so this is
kind of thicker.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:41.800
Let's see how this works.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:46.380
I think you can start to see
the green at the bottom.

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:50.500
So, it's white in here, so
this is not just color.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.880
So we'll let that
slowly mix in.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.200
What did we get for a p h, if
you can read it on there.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.160
This might be another no-go.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.920
STUDENT: It says 7, but--

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:00.200
PROFESSOR: It's probably
blue--

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:26.630
PROFESSOR: So, how many people
have had lunch yet today?

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.720
How many are going to
have lunch soon?

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.212
How many are reconsidering what
they're going to eat for

00:30:27.212 --> 00:30:27.300
lunch based on this demo?

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:34.410
PROFESSOR: Al right, we'll take
a look at one last thing

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:34.510
that you might be consuming.

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:37.990
Lemon juice, or actually this
is lime juice here.

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:39.820
All right, we're probably ending
with an easy one here.

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:43.690
What do you think, acidic or
basic for the lime juice.

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:47.760
So, really, the question is
probably just the shade that

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:50.310
we're going to get from going
from a purple here.

00:30:50.310 --> 00:31:05.130
All right, so what are we
reading for the lime juice?

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:24.850
A 2, OK.

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:28.980
PROFESSOR: OK, so that's the
end of our demo here,

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:33.420
providing you with some tips
about what is corrosive and

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:38.900
what is not corrosive
around MIT.

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:42.570
And I think the title of this
lecture on the syllabus is "is

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:48.340
it safe to drink the water at
MIT," and the answer is a lot

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:50.740
safer than drinking soda.

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:58.030
So let's talk about some acids
in water some more, and

00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:03.820
introduce something you'll use
a lot, which is an acid

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:08.750
ionization constant.

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:18.830
So let's look at an example
of an acid in water.

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:28.240
So say we have c h 3, c o o h
aqueous, so it's in water,

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.100
which is our solvent.

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:33.580
It's acting as an acid, so it's
giving off a hydrogen ion

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:41.160
to water forming hydronium
ion, and forming its

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:47.480
conjugate, which is missing
its hydrogen ion.

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:51.480
All right, so here we have an
equation, and now we're going

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.610
to introduce something which
is the acid ionization

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:59.475
constant, or k a, and you'll
be using k a a lot in this

00:32:59.475 --> 00:33:02.680
course, we're also going to
have some k b's for bases.

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:05.660
So the acid ionization
constant.

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.040
And it's an equilibrium
constant, so you all know how

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:11.290
to write equilibrium
constants.

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:14.960
So the equilibrium constant is
going to be products, which in

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:21.840
this case is hydronium ions
times the concentration of the

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:32.870
conjugate base of the acid
over the conjugate acid.

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:36.300
And there is no water in that
equation, because here the

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:39.390
water is pretty much pure.

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:42.210
It's the solvent so its
concentration is not going to

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:45.520
change very much, so
it is left off.

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:48.200
And I can tell you that
the ionization

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.140
constant here is 1 .

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:53.850
76 times 10 to the minus 5.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:55.653
Again, that's temperature
dependent, so

00:33:55.653 --> 00:33:57.700
that's at 25 degrees.

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:01.570
This is a small number, so that
tells us this is not a

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:04.290
very strong acid.

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:08.150
So it's not ionizing very
much in solution.

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:12.870
That is a definition of a weak
acid, something that doesn't

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:14.310
ionize very much.

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:17.800
The definition of a strong acid
is something that does

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.620
ionize quite a bit.

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:26.870
So here then, we can write
equations generically for

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:28.510
acids and bases.

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:31.890
You can write an equation
generically, h a being as your

00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:35.030
acid, plus water, goes to
hydronium ions, and your

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:39.530
conjugate of the acid,
which is a minus.

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:42.200
So this is an acid,
h a, in water.

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:47.780
We can also write it as h b plus
as an acid in water going

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:50.140
to hydronium ion concentrations
and the

00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:54.460
conjugate, which is base, it's
lost its hydrogen ion as well.

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:56.855
A strong acid is something
that has a k a

00:34:56.855 --> 00:34:58.010
greater than one.

00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:02.190
More products than reactant
at equilibrium.

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:05.850
So that means it ionizes almost
completely, so it goes

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:10.070
far toward products, ionizes
almost completely.

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:14.590
A weak acid is something with a
k a of less than one, which

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:17.960
means that when you put this
acid in water, it doesn't

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:23.480
ionize very much, when
you have equilibrium.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:27.760
So you can tell if something
is a strong acid or not by

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:32.410
looking at it's k a value, or
alternatively you can consider

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:34.430
something called p k a.

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:40.780
So the p k a is minus log of the
k a, and if you have a low

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:44.740
value of k a, you'll have a
higher p k a, and the higher

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:47.990
the p k a then, the
weaker the acid.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:52.350
So you can look it k a or you
can think about p k a in terms

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:55.660
of whether something is
a strong acid or not.

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:59.230
And so we'll just finish
up with this slide.

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:02.360
So, up here we have some
very strong acids.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:07.670
These k a's are much greater
than one, and you have

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:10.950
extremely low values
for p k a.

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:13.790
And if you keep going from
strong acids, again, a strong

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:17.220
acid has a k a greater than one,
so these are all strong.

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.930
And so, then weak acids
are less than one.

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:24.200
And so down here you'd have
small numbers for k a, and so

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:31.350
-- up here we have big k a's,
here we have smaller k a's,

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:34.950
and the corresponding p k a's
are going up, and if we keep

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:39.230
going, this table is very long,
we're going to get some

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:42.320
very high p k a values
when you have some

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.960
very, very small numbers.

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.180
OK, we'll stop there for
today and continue

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:49.050
acid base next time.
