00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:24.290
PROFESSOR: Today is our final
clicker competition.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.390
The first question is up.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.780
And I would just like to go over
the current standing for

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.710
the clicker competition as we're
getting started here.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.090
So, recitation 6 has two wins,
and there are other

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.380
recitations and have one win, so
recitation 2, 3, 5, 7, and

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.810
10 have one win.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.740
If any of those recitation wins
today, we're going to go

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.780
to a tie breaker to decide the
overall recitation champion.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.070
There are also recitations 1, 4,
9, and 11, who are looking

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.620
for their first win.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.480
This is their last
chance today.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.200
So, if they win today, they can
not be overall champions,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.770
but they will have snacks,
and they will assure that

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.590
recitations 2, 3, 5, 7, and
10 do not win the overall

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.470
competition.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.660
So, you have a chance to
foil those recitations.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.800
And if we need to go to a tie
breaker, it will not be from

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.710
current material, it's going
to be past material or past

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.940
things that were mentioned.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.580
So, just keep that in mind.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.560
All right, and for the overall
winner, I just would like to

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.220
show you what you will win, so
members of the recitation will

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:59.310
each get their own chemistry
t-shirt, and at some schools,

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.890
of course, you would look at
this and say oh, they're on

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.690
the varsity team, but at MIT,
it means that you are

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.470
associated with course 5.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.720
So, Department of Chemistry at
Massachusetts Institute of

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.020
Technology on the back, and we
have different colors and

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.670
different sizes.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.510
All right, so time to get
started with the clicker

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.480
competition.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:40.010
Go ahead and click in your
first responses.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:59.340
OK, let's just take
10 more seconds.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.990
All right.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.950
Big improvement from the first
time we asked this question

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.610
last class where it's about
33%, now we're up to 89.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.940
And no, it is not temperature
dependent.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.310
And we're going to be
talking more about

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.970
activation energy today.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.960
All right, so today we're going
to finish up kinetics,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.950
and we're going to start with
the material that we didn't

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.460
quite get to at the
end of last class.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.960
And I love this part, because
I love it when we can think

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.240
about what we learned before in
a slightly different way.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.240
So, when I first started
lecturing, I was talking about

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.040
LeChatelier principle and, of
course, encouraged students to

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.240
sort of -- you know it's not too
intuitive to MIT students,

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.890
but LeChatelier's principle says
that if you apply stress

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.580
to a system, it tends to respond
in such a way to

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.290
minimize that stress.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.890
So it's all about minimizing
stress, which is something

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.160
that's hard to kind to imagine
this time of year, a little

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.020
easier to imagine activation
energy barriers, a little hard

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.950
to imagine minimizing stress.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.790
But we're back to talking
about minimizing stress.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.700
And we talked about adding
reagents and removing

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.830
products, and we talked about
how reactions will shift to

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.620
respond to stresses.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.670
And one of the things we talked
about is rationalizing

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.330
the shift of reactions at
equilibrium when temperature

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.370
has changed.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.480
So, if you increase the
temperature of a particular

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.530
reaction, it tends to shift in
the endothermic direction to

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.030
remove that added heat
from the reaction.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.680
So, that's what we learned
before, but now we're going to

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.560
think about this in a slightly
different way.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.820
So we're going to think about
this in terms of these

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.990
reaction coordinate diagrams.
So, on one axis we have p e

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.840
plotted -- what does
that stand for?

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.850
Potential energy, right, so we
have potential energy going up

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.000
on both sides.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.990
And here we have a view of an
endothermic reaction, and over

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.240
here is an exothermic
reaction.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.500
So, let's just take
a look at this.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.270
For the endothermic reaction,
we have reactants and

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.140
products, we have a delta e
between those, and we have a

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.000
very large activation
energy barrier

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.860
for the forward direction.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.670
And, of course, for anything to
react, there always has to

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.450
be some barrier, you need some
amount of critical energy,

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.680
because as the molecules come
close to each other, and if

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.950
they're going to react and form
some kind of product, you

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.090
have to sort of distort bonds
and sort of rearrange things,

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.310
and that takes a certain
amount of energy.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.610
So if they come together and
they have that energy, they'll

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.360
react and go on to products,
if they don't they'll break

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.250
apart and go back and
be reactants.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.810
And how much temperature the
system has, is more likely

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.390
that they'll be able to react.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.480
So it's more likely, if there's
high temperature, they

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:06.110
could overcome this activation
energy barrier.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.760
All right, so in an endothermic
reaction, you have

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.160
a big one in the forward
direction, and a much smaller

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.140
activation energy in the
reverse direction.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.420
For exothermic reaction it's
the reverse -- there's a

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.450
smaller barrier for the forward
direction, and a much

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:24.240
larger barrier for the
reverse direction.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.670
So, we can think about
the sign of delta e.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.700
So delta e, this difference here
which is related to delta

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.910
h for liquids and solids, it's
pretty much the same for gases

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.100
is 1% or 2% different.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.440
So you have a positive value
here, and you can get a

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.370
positive delta e here if you
have a big number for the

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.260
forward activation energy
barrier minus a small number

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.780
for the reverse, so that's
going to give

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.550
you a positive number.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.230
For an exothermic reaction,
delta e's going to be

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.360
negative, and you get a negative
number if you take a

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.840
small number here for the
forward activation energy, and

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.080
subtract it from a larger number
here for the reverse

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.530
activation energy.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:09.040
And remember, this is one of the
equations that we're not

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.820
going to give you, you need to
have that memorized because

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.490
it's part of understanding
what's going on in these

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.160
diagrams.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.240
So now let's think about what
increasing the temperature is

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.530
going to do.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.860
So, it will help the molecules
if the is temperatures

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.490
increase, they'll have enough
energy to overcome barriers.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.850
Now if the barriers are pretty
small, then it's not very hard

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.430
for the molecules to get over
them, regardless of the

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:34.450
temperature.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:37.910
But when the barrier is big,
then temperature is going to

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.390
make a big difference.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.030
And you can sort of think about
this in your own life as

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:45.170
you have a small assignment to
do, you just jump in and do it

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.380
and get it done and it's fine.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.860
But if it's a very, very large
thing that you have to do, you

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.960
often need to procrastinate
longer before

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.190
you start doing it.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.840
So, a small barrier's not so
much of a problem, but if it's

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.020
a big barrier, you need to
increase that temperature to

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.800
help the molecules get over
the bigger barriers.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.450
So, let's think about what this
means in terms of the

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.040
direction that a reaction
might shift.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.870
So, if you increase a
temperature over here with an

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.410
endothermic reaction, it makes
it easier to overcome the

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:16.550
bigger barrier.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.550
The forward reaction barrier
is the bigger one, so

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:22.310
increasing the temperature will
help molecules get over

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:22.800
that barrier.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.470
They're already doing fine with
the reverse barrier, it's

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.740
the forward barrier that we're
having trouble with.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.330
So, if you increase the
temperature, that's going to

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.030
shift the equilibrium toward
products, or it will shift the

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.500
reaction in the endothermic
direction.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.900
That's what we had learned
before with LeChatelier's

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.650
principle, but now there's a new
way of thinking about why

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.190
that is true.

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:46.650
So, for an exothermic reaction,
if you increase the

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.800
temperature, that helps with
the bigger barrier.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.970
Again, here the bigger barrier
is for the reverse reaction.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.170
So, if you increase the
temperature of an exothermic

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:59.770
reaction, it's going to shift
it toward reactants.

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:03.710
More molecules can overcome that
reverse barrier, and so

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:08.260
you'll form more reactants,
it'll shift toward reactants

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
or it'll shift in the
endothermic direction.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.030
Again, these are the same things
that we already knew

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.560
from LeChatelier, but it's a
different way of thinking

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.960
about why those things
are true.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.650
So, a large activation energy
barrier means that rate

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:29.760
constants are very sensitive
to temperature.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.990
And so, if you have a big
activation energy barrier,

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.950
increasing the temperature makes
a big difference -- if

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.620
it's a big barrier, then there's
going to have a big

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.130
difference if you have
higher temperature.

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:45.330
If it's a small barrier, then
increasing the temperature

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.690
doesn't make much
of a difference.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.740
And so you can think about
that in terms of these

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.550
diagrams as well.

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:56.440
So, now we're done with
temperature and we're going to

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.530
talk about catalysis and
the use of catalysts.

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.060
And so, if you remember there
were factors affecting the

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:07.530
reaction, and we've talked about
everything on this list

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:08.890
except for catalysts.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:13.170
So today we're going to
talk about catalysts.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:17.010
So, a catalyst is a substance
that speeds up a reaction, but

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:20.600
it doesn't get consumed in the
reaction, it doesn't undergo

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.410
any permanent change itself.

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.540
It's just added to speed
up the reaction.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:31.820
So catalysts do not appear in
the overall balanced equation.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.200
So let's look at what a catalyst
is going to do, and

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.100
we're going to look at in
terms of these potential

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.270
energy diagrams as well.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.600
So here we here we have a
reaction, we're going from

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.990
reactants down here
to products.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:46.900
We have the delta e for the
reaction, we have a forward

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.910
activation energy barrier
and a reverse one.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:53.550
So, up here, at the top, that's
our barrier without a

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:56.410
catalyst. This is the transition
state or the

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:59.980
activated complex up here, so
you have to overcome the

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.930
barrier, you form some kind of
activated complex, which then,

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.940
if there's enough energy to
overcome that barrier, goes on

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.680
to products.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.430
So when you add a catalyst
what happens is

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.090
it lowers this barrier.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.750
So, in the blue line
here is the new

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.770
activation energy barrier.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.900
This is the barrier with a
catalyst, and so this would

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:27.380
then be the new transition
state with a catalyst.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.040
So when it lowers the barrier,
it's going to lower the

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.670
barrier for the forward
reaction, so we have a new

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:36.110
activation energy for the
forward reaction, and we're

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:38.320
going to have a new
activation energy

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.260
for the reverse direction.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.470
So catalysts work by reducing
both the forward and the

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:48.800
reverse activation
energy barrier.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.610
And another way that you can
say this is that they

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:54.070
stabilize the activated
complex or

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:55.490
the transition state.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:59.060
So here you have an activated
complex with a much higher

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:03.240
potential energy without the
catalysts, and by stabilizing,

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.670
you lower in energy that
transition state.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.040
So that's another way
of expressing

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.580
what a catalyst does.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:17.500
So, catalysts have no effect on
the thermodynamics of the

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.960
reaction, they affect the
kinetics of the reaction, but

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.210
they don't affect the

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.680
thermodynamics of the reaction.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.330
And so, of course, when you
think of thermodynamics, you

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.830
often think of delta g.

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:37.890
So, why don't you tell me what
you think, what would happen

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:40.610
about, so delta g is a state
function, it's independent of

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:44.080
path, and so therefore, what
can you tell me about the

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.020
equilibrium constant in the
presence of a catalyst?

00:12:48.020 --> 00:13:44.630
OK, let's just take
10 more seconds.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:49.560
Yup, very good.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.920
So, the equilibrium constant
is not changed.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.300
The thermodynamics, which
includes delta g and the

00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:01.390
equilibrium constant are not
affected, the rates of the

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:06.980
reaction are affected.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:10.590
All right, so opposite of a
catalyst is an inhabitor, and

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:14.410
we'll talk more about this at
the end of class, so it would

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:18.930
-- inhibitor is slow or
sometimes stop the rate of the

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:23.360
reaction, and one way that they
do this is by increasing

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:27.250
the activation energy.

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:30.820
So let's consider types
of catalysts now.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.260
You can have a homogeneous
catalyst, which is in the same

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.480
phase as the reaction that it's

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.710
catalyzing as the reactants.

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:44.310
An example of this is depletion
of the ozone layer

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.690
by chlorofluorocarbons.

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:51.860
And so, this was one of the big
environmental challenges

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:56.230
that the U.S. has faced, whether
it should ban these

00:14:56.230 --> 00:15:01.380
chlorofluorocarbons, and there
was a lot of debate on what

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:05.360
the data really was about what
how much they affected the

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.330
ozone layer.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.710
And I guess that debate is
somewhat still going on,

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:11.580
although I think most people now
recognize that this is a

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:15.640
serious problem and that
legislation is really needed

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:16.960
to help correct it.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.230
So that's an example.

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:21.780
In this case they're all gases,
so that's homogeneous

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:24.650
catalyst, not a happy one.

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:27.380
You could also have
heterogeneous catalysts, which

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.760
are a different phase.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.810
And here's another example
that has to do with the

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:31.790
environment.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:36.510
So a catalytic converter is an
example of a heterogeneous

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:40.500
catalyst. So here you have a
solid metal surface, you can

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.860
have palladium or platinum that
will catalyze reactions

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:48.650
with gases, and so they
catalyze oxidation of

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:52.800
hydrocarbons, carbon
monoxide, also

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.540
reduction of nitrogen oxide.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.880
So this is all to reduce
pollution.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.690
So that's an example of a
heterogeneous catalyst. And

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:05.450
let me just show you a little
movie of how that might work.

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:10.260
So in this movie, in grey here
we have a metal surface, and

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:14.510
this metal surface can break
the hydrogen bond of h 2.

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:17.570
And so here, it is already
broken, the h 2 bond, so

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:20.270
there's a little hydrogen there
and hydrogen there, and

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.630
so that activates the
hydrogen to react.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:28.130
And so, then we have ethene
molecule come in, and oh,

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:31.060
there goes the hydrogen, and oh,
there goes the hydrogen,

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.920
oh, there goes the other one
and you can form ethane.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.640
So it speeds up the reaction
by breaking the h 2 bond so

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.810
it's more ready to react.

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:46.970
That would be an example of a
heterogeneous catalyst there.

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:49.900
All right, and, of course, you
may all have guessed that my

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:53.240
favorite kind of catalysts
are enzymes.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.640
They are the catalyst of life.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:00.170
And so, enzymes are made up of
protein, or mostly protein

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:02.700
molecules -- you can have an
enzyme that's actually made of

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.010
RNA, but most are protein
molecules.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:10.550
And they're typically about
20,000 grams per mole or more,

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.120
and they're capable of carrying

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.590
out specific reactions.

00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:18.400
And so, they're made up of amino
acids, and just to take

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.090
a quick look at that, an amino
acid has an amino group and it

00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:24.750
has a carboxyl group, and it
has what's called an alpha

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:30.470
carbon that has a side chain on
it, which is abbreviated r,

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.570
and there are 20 different
types of r.

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:35.650
The simplest is just a hydrogen,
you could also have

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.420
a hydroxide, etc.

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.730
And so, this makes up the
alphabet of proteins, there

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:44.030
are 20 different ones of these
that get connected via a

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.490
peptide bond.

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:48.750
So at the end of this amino acid
you'd stick on the amino

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:52.580
group of another amino acid and
form this peptide bond.

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.860
And then you put together
hundreds and hundreds of these

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.850
to form an enzyme complex.

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:03.150
And so, the long chain of amino
acids folds up and forms

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:05.200
a compact structure.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.160
So, in this particular picture,
there are about 200

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:13.940
amino acids in each of these
colored units, so this is a

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:15.800
tetramer, so there are four
-- there's green,

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.030
red, yellow and blue.

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.920
And so, this is what's called
a ribbon diagram.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.540
So, these ribbons, this is an
alpha helix -- the beta

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.170
strands are long.

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:30.500
It traces out the position
of the alpha carbons.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:34.410
And overall, this structure is
about 90 angstroms by 70

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:38.280
angstroms by 50 angstroms. Of
course, 1 angstroms is 1 times

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.120
10 the minus 10 meters.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.420
So these are fairly small.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:46.370
These protein molecules are,
of course, in your body.

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:52.180
And this particular one is
an enzyme that makes an

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.900
antibiotic, and that antibiotic
is fosfomycin,

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:55.950
shown here.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:19:02.240
And so, fosfomycin is used
in antibiotic combination

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:07.020
therapies to treat staph
infections and other kinds of

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.830
very difficult infections
to treat.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:13.820
And so, I always talk about
the things that I'm most

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.790
concerned about.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:18.740
There are a lot of things that
are big threats that I don't

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.110
worry too much about.

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:22.070
Antibiotic resistance
is something I

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:23.650
actually worry a lot about.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:25.910
I guess I go to too many
meetings were they talk about

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:30.560
problems. But the rate at
which different kinds of

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:35.680
bacteria are becoming resistant
to antibiotics seems

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.990
to be increasing.

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:40.560
So it used to take a lot longer
before a resistance

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.660
would appear than it does now.

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:46.820
And there really haven't been,
I think since about 1980s or

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:48.730
so, really new antibiotics.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:53.560
So, we're still using the same
antibiotics that we have been,

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:57.980
which causes more things to
become immune or resistant to

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:01.370
those antibiotics, and I think
this is really dangerous.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:04.900
And there's not enough money in
it for the pharmaceutical

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.760
industry to really
go after this.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:10.430
And it's not just a problem
for biological warfare,

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:13.920
although that is a possibility,
but also in

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:18.200
hospitals, you go in for some
kind of surgery, you have to

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.300
worry about the fact that even
if the surgery goes great, you

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:24.000
might get an infection that
could really compromise your

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.760
health in the hospital.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.760
And so, whether you have a heart
problem, if you have

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:34.160
cancer, you become immune
compromised, there's a lot, a

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.560
lot of cases where people end
up not dying of cancer

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:43.390
directly, they end up dying of
the bacterial infection that

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:45.080
can't be treated.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.120
So this is really
a huge problem.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.620
So I always like to let you know
all the possible problems

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.050
that you can solve
in your future.

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:55.250
This is one that I think is
particularly important, and I

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:58.620
hope some of you will focus on
this, because we really need

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.790
different kinds of antibiotics,
or we need to

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:04.040
change the way we do medicine
in this country so that

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.020
resistance doesn't become
as much of a

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.670
problem as it has been.

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:13.430
All right, so that enzyme made
an antibiotic, so we like it,

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:16.670
and let's talk about
how that works.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:20.030
How that particular series of
amino acids folds up to do

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.820
that reaction.

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:24.610
So now we have some new
nomenclature, and sometimes

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:27.010
when people get into the
biochemistry world they get

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:28.920
scared because there are all
these words that they don't

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.700
know what they mean.

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.630
So most of them are not -- they
are things that you can

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.470
relate back to something
you already know.

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:38.930
So, we've been talking about
reactants, and when you have a

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:42.270
reactant with an enzyme, it's
usually called a substrate.

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:45.820
So this is just another name
for a reactant molecule.

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.440
And then substrates tend to
bind in what we call the

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.950
active site of the enzyme,
which is the part of the

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:52.990
enzyme that's going to
do the chemistry.

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:55.400
So those are two terms that
you'll hear about in

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.820
biochemistry.

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:01.210
All right, so we have an enzyme,
we'll call it e, it

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:04.660
binds a substrate, we'll call
that s, and then it forms an

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:08.380
enzyme substrate complex,
which we'll call an e s

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.800
complex, for enzyme substrate.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:14.940
And then that enzyme substrate
complex will go to enzyme and

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.960
product, which we'll call p.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.190
And if you look in the
state-of-the-art biochemistry

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:22.700
books, these are the
abbreviations you'll see in

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:23.910
there as well.

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:28.170
So, this pains me greatly to
show this cartoon, because I

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:30.700
spend my career determining
3-dimensional structures of

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:33.830
proteins, and so to describe
it as a little squiggly is

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:35.320
painful for me.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.830
But nonetheless, there you go.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:40.690
Also, the substrate is almost
about as big as the enzyme.

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:42.990
That is also usually not true.

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:45.280
But nonetheless, here's
a little cartoon.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.670
Here's our substrate binding to
our enzyme, it's forming an

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:50.320
e s complex.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.170
And then the enzyme is going
to move the ears of the

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:55.270
substrate around to
form product, and

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:58.490
now product is released.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:02.130
So, this is actually pretty
simple in terms

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:05.080
of writing a mechanism.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.060
And so, what we can do is write
a mechanism the way that

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.160
we have been writing
a mechanism

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.620
so far in this class.

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:14.090
And so we're going to go through
this, we're going to

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:17.960
derive expression mostly to show
you that all the things

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.350
you've been learning are related
to chemistry, they're

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:22.300
also related to biochemistry.

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.770
So, you already know a lot
of biochemistry from just

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:28.590
studying freshman chemistry
in 511-1.

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:31.460
All right, so we have 2 steps
in our mechanism.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.180
We have enzyme binding
substrate to form an

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:38.980
intermediate enzyme substrate
complex, which then goes on to

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:42.000
form enzyme plus product
in step 2.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.510
So the first step is reversible,
the second step is

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:47.070
not as drawn.

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:49.780
All right, so now we can come up
with the rates for each of

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:54.250
the individual steps in this
overall mechanism, and since

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:57.840
they are elementary reactions
or steps in an overall

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:01.180
mechanism, we can write the rate
laws directly from what

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:02.400
we observe.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.270
So for the forward direction,
we're going to

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:07.390
have what rate constant?

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:11.690
K 1 times the concentration
of what?

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:13.440
And?

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.450
Yeah.

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:15.120
So there we go.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.790
We have k 1 times the
concentration of e and the

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:19.240
concentration of s.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.620
See, you already knew how
to do biochemistry.

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:26.890
All right, so now at the rate of
the reverse direction is --

00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:29.060
what's our rate constant?

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:32.590
K minus 1 times e s.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:36.690
And then for step 2, we have
what rate constant?

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:41.680
K 2 times e s.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.080
All right, so now we can
talk about the rate

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.420
formation of product.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:50.950
And so you'll see this expressed
as d concentration

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:55.860
of p d t, so the change in
product that's being formed

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.650
and that's going to be equal
to the second step

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:01.420
here, k 2 times e s.

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:04.710
But, as has been the case
before, e s is an

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:09.010
intermediate, and we need to
solve our rate laws, our rate

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:11.280
expressions, in terms
of reactants or

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.460
products and rate constants.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:18.150
So we need to solve for
the intermediate.

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:21.600
All right, so let's think
about solving for the

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.680
intermediate.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:26:27.300
And why don't you tell
me how to do that.

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:42.490
OK, let's just take
10 more seconds.

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:43.110
Very good.

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:46.880
All right, so let's just
take a look at

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.940
why that is the case.

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:55.340
So, when we solve for this, it's
going to be equal to the

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:58.800
formation of the intermediate,
which happens in the first

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.885
step with this rate that you
told me, k 1 times the

00:27:01.885 --> 00:27:03.540
concentration of e s.

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.660
And then we have the
decomposition in the reverse

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:11.710
of step one, so that's
minus k minus 1 e s.

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:14.100
And then we also have the
consumption of the

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:18.120
intermediate, which is -- so we
have minus this step, which

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.340
is k 2 times e s.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:24.180
So again, formation minus
decomposition minus

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.000
consumption.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.030
And now, we can use the steady
state approximation.

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:32.630
So the steady state
approximation applies in

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:36.550
biochemistry just as well as
in all of your chemistry

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:39.160
problems that you've done
in this course.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:43.610
And so, the steady state
approximation allows us to set

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:46.250
that whole term equal to zero.

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:51.630
So it says that the net rate of
intermediate formation and

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:56.410
decomposition and consumption is
0, or you can express it as

00:27:56.410 --> 00:28:00.770
the rate of formation of the
intermediate equals the rates

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:03.940
of decomposition and consumption
-- those are

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:05.150
equivalent.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.960
So we can set all of
this equal to zero.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:13.110
So again, the same as what
we've done before.

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:15.520
All right, so now we're going
to have a slight change of

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.300
what we've done before, and
this has to do with the

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.570
practical consideration.

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:25.850
So you can solve for these
in terms of reactants and

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:30.130
products and rate constants,
but it's actually easier to

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:36.270
solve for e s in terms of your
total enzyme rather than your

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:37.380
free enzyme.

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.780
So what we've had before is our
free enzyme, but we often

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:43.880
don't know how much enzyme is
free, and by that we mean not

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.010
bound to the substrate.

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:49.570
And so, we know how much total
enzyme we put in, but we might

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:52.010
not know how much of
that is unbound.

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:55.900
So it's actually easier for the
experimentalist to solve

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.150
for things in terms
of total enzyme.

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:03.590
And so what we're going to do
then is we're going to replace

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:07.990
our free enzyme term with the
following, total enzyme minus

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:10.840
bound, and total enzyme
minus the bound

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.890
enzyme is the free enzyme.

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:16.660
So we're going to do this change
that makes it easier

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:19.750
for the experimentalist.

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:22.720
So here's the term we had
before, but now we want to

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:28.190
replace this term of e with
e to 0 minus e s.

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:31.140
So we're going to put that,
here's the term e up here, so

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:34.420
we're going to replace that
with e 0 minus e s.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:37.090
And then we're going to multiply
that out, so we get k

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:44.460
1, e 0, s minus k 1, e s, and
then the concentration of

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.940
substrate here, and the rest
of it is the same.

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:50.920
So we got rid of our term e.

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:55.140
So now we can solve for e s.

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:58.110
So this is what we just had,
and so we're going to

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:01.670
rearrange so the e s terms are
on one side, so we have an e s

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:03.200
term here, here, and here.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.810
So all that is going to be on
one side, and then this other

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:08.820
term will be on the other
side of the equation.

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:12.180
So now we have moved all the e
s terms over here, so we've

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:14.390
got rid of the negative numbers,
we've added them all

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:17.590
to the other side, and then on
this side we just have this k

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:19.280
1 term left.

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:23.030
Now we're going to pull
out the e s terms. So,

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:24.830
we'll solve for e s.

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:28.450
We'll pull that out, that leaves
us with k 1 times the

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:32.810
concentration of s, k minus
1, and then k 2.

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:36.650
And now we're going to take this
and divide by that term

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:41.630
in parentheses, and so now we've
solved for e s in terms

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:46.250
of total enzyme substrate
and our rate constants.

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:47.780
All right, now we're going
to do another thing

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.050
that's a bit different.

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:52.680
We're going to introduce a term
in biochemistry, which is

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:57.560
k m, also known as the
Michaelis-Menten constant, and

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:01.570
so k m is equal to the
rate constant for the

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:08.290
forward/reverse direction, k
minus 1 plus k 2 over k 1.

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:14.180
So we're going to now try to
use this in our expression.

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:19.820
So we're going to put this term
in there, and so to have

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:23.630
this term of k m in there,
we need to have this

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:25.500
divided by k 1.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.740
So we can do that, it's OK, as
long as we divide everything

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:32.160
by k 1, so we're going to divide
the top by k 1, and

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.090
this by k 1, and that by k 1.

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:41.070
So now, we divide all by k 1,
and so we have this top with k

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:44.370
1, this term with k 1, and
this with k 1, and

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:46.130
that's our k m value.

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:49.850
But now we can simplify this,
we've got a lot of k 1's here,

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:53.380
and so if we simplify this,
we can cross out

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:56.320
those k 1's over there.

00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:00.470
And we can also get rid of
these k 1's over here.

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:02.810
And that's going to leave
us with a much simpler

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:03.960
expression.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:07.450
So that's going to leave us with
the total enzyme times

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:11.770
substrate over substrate
plus k m.

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:14.430
And that looks a whole lot
better than that other term

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:21.550
that we had before.

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:25.780
OK, so we can now take this and
substitute it back into

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:29.480
the expression we had earlier.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:34.140
So here we had the rate of
product formation, k 2 times

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:38.160
this intermediate, we solved
for the intermediate using

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:41.580
total enzyme and using
this k m term.

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:45.280
And now we just put all
of this times k 2.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.630
And if you put all of that
times k 2, you have this

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:52.900
expression, which is the
Michaelis-Menten equation.

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:56.460
So the only difference of what
you did before was that you

00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:00.560
solved in terms of total enzyme,
and also, we have this

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:03.130
new k m term.

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:06.360
And so now we have an equation
that's used in a lot of

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:12.510
biochemistry research to think
about enzyme kinetics.

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:15.370
So let's think about enzyme
kinetics for a minute.

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:18.700
This is what a plot often looks
like -- we are looking

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.640
at the product formed by
an enzyme versus the

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.440
concentration of substrate.

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.800
And it often goes up.

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.210
It's pretty steep, and then
it starts to level off.

00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:31.530
So let's think about what's
happening here.

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:35.620
So if you have low substrate,
so that's way down here, not

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:39.800
much substrate is available,
adding more substrate will

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:42.090
increase this rate
significantly, you'll form a

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:45.690
lot more product, it increases
the rate of product formation.

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:47.950
Because a lot of the
enzyme is free and

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:49.610
can react with substrate.

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:53.360
So it goes up, but then the
rate starts to level off.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:58.230
So when you got to higher
substrate concentrations,

00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:02.562
adding more substrate does not
affect the rate much, the rate

00:34:02.562 --> 00:34:03.750
is leveling off.

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:06.480
And we say that the enzyme
is saturated.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:10.060
All the enzyme that you have in
there already has substrate

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:12.450
going on, it's already
doing the chemistry.

00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:15.800
So if you're throwing more at
it, the enzyme can't bind that

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:19.010
substrate, it's busy with a
different substrate molecule.

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:23.140
So all the active sites in the
enzyme are full, and so not

00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:24.220
much happens.

00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:28.320
So this kind of graph
is what you often

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:32.050
see in enzyme kinetics.

00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:34.130
Now let's think about
that in terms of our

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:34.410
Michaelis-Menten equation.

00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:40.050
So let's think about conditions
when there's a lot

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:44.990
of substrate, when substrate
is much greater than k m.

00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:48.370
So here we have substrate and
k m on the bottom of our

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:52.490
equation, and what's going to
happen if this term is much,

00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:56.230
much bigger than
this k m term?

00:34:56.230 --> 00:35:00.040
What happens to the k m term?

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.550
It goes away.

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:04.380
It's really small compared
to this, it's kind of

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:06.040
insignificant.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:10.800
So, if that happens, then you
can cancel substrate as well.

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.830
And so, that means that under
conditions where substrate is

00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:18.190
much greater than k m, the rate
is a much simpler term,

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:22.250
it's just equal to k 2 times
your total enzyme.

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:26.650
And so this has a name, this is
called Vmax or the maximum

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:29.130
velocity of the reaction.

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:32.030
So, under these conditions,
when the substrate is much

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:36.490
greater than that k m value,
this expression simplifies and

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:40.530
you get just k 2, your rate
constant, times your total

00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:43.490
enzyme, and that'll give
you the maximum

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:47.250
velocity of the reaction.

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:49.670
And so, that's just written
again here.

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:53.440
Vmax equals k 2 times total
enzyme, and that equation will

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.810
be given to you on an
equation sheet.

00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:56.750
So what's happening?

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:58.800
What's happening is that
you're up here.

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:02.460
So when substrate concentration
is much greater

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:06.190
than k m, then you're in these
conditions, and you're at some

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:07.390
maximum velocity.

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:10.550
So the velocity will only go,
the rate of the reaction will

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:14.510
only go so fast, it will
saturate, it'll level off up

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:16.910
here, and so you can calculate
that maximum

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:20.520
rate of that reaction.

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:24.110
Now let's consider what happens
when your substrate

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:27.800
concentration equals your k m.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:32.900
So down here, if k m is equal to
substrate, then we're going

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:36.540
to have two substrates
down here.

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:39.590
And so, we can write this, if
they're equal, we can write

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:44.390
this as substrate plus
substrate, and then we can do

00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:46.950
some canceling.

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:50.920
So this will be equal to 2
substrates and then we can

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:54.580
cancel that out, and so we get
the rate of product formation

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:59.270
under conditions where substrate
equals k m of 1/2 k

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:04.290
2 times the total enzyme
concentration.

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:07.760
And this is referred to
the half maximal rate.

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:13.320
Remember, the maximal rate was
k 2 times this e knot, and so

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:18.350
half of that is half the
maximal rate here.

00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:24.210
So, the definition of k m is the
concentration of substrate

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:28.120
for which the rate
is half maximal.

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:32.070
So if your rate is half of the
maximum rate, that substrate

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:36.470
concentration that gives you
half the maximum rate, is the

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:38.440
value for k m.

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:44.370
Substrate concentration equals
k m at the half maximal rate.

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:45.990
So let's just look at
what that meant.

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:52.780
So if this is Vmax up here, half
of Vmax is here, half of

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:58.030
that value, and the substrate
concentration at half Vmax is

00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:59.850
equal to k m.

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:03.400
So you can write those
in on your diagram.

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:07.610
Vmax is this velocity up here,
half of that, when you're at

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:12.120
half of the maximal rate,
k m equals the substrate

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:14.190
concentration.

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:17.180
And there will be problems that
you will work in your

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:22.070
book very shortly, and often,
the problems just have to do,

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:25.090
they'll give you the information
in words and the

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:27.870
calculations can often
be pretty simple.

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:31.780
Sometimes it'll say, figure
out what the k m for this

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:32.970
reaction is.

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:35.060
At this substrate concentration,
the rate is

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:35.960
half maximal.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:39.140
Well, at that substrate
concentration, that's the k m.

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:42.090
So, a lot of the problems are
sort of word problems, they

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:44.180
give you the information and
you need to know what the

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:46.390
definitions are.

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:48.280
But let's try an example.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:54.460
So here in this example, we've
talked about buffering in the

00:38:54.460 --> 00:39:00.360
blood, so the conversion of
your ingredients that make

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:04.820
your buffering agent in the
blood, that can be catalyzed

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:08.900
by an enzyme called
carbonicanhydrase, and the

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:13.380
following Michaelis-Menten
constants are known, a k m is

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:18.570
known, and a k 2 is known, and
if you're doing experiment and

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:22.740
you have a total concentration
of your enzyme of 5 times 10

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:26.970
to the minus 6 molar, then you
should be able to figure out

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:31.390
what the maximum rate of
the reaction would be.

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:33.120
So, why don't you go ahead
and tell me what the

00:39:33.120 --> 00:40:34.580
maximum rate would be.

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:49.520
OK, let's just take
10 more seconds.

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:49.950
Very good.

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:51.510
Everyone's doing very
good today.

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:57.030
All right, so all you have to
do, you have remember Vmax

00:40:57.030 --> 00:41:01.740
equals your total enzyme
concentration times your k 2.

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:05.440
And pretty much no one, hardly
anyone was fooled

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.500
by k m value there.

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:11.380
All right, very good.

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:16.840
So there are extra problems on
enzyme kinetics posted on the

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.890
extra problems posted
on the Web.

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:22.180
So there's a few there, so you
can see the type of problems,

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:24.580
again, they're like that,
they're pretty simple.

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:27.950
If you remember the definition
of k m, and you'll be given

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:31.990
the equation for Vmax, you
should be able to handle the

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:35.040
enzyme/kinetics problems
pretty well.

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:39.880
Often, also I'll ask questions
like explain why at high

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:44.220
substrate concentrations, the
rate does not increase very

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:48.770
much, or why the graph levels
off, or I might ask you to

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:52.290
draw the plot and tell me
about low substrate

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:55.280
concentrations, what's true
there, and high substrate

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.860
concentrations, what's true.

00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:58.870
So those are the types of
questions you're going to get

00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:03.230
on enzyme kinetics, they're
actually pretty simple.

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:05.990
All right, so let's just talk
briefly about enzyme

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:07.230
inhibition.

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:10.750
So the opposite of catalysis
-- instead of binding a

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:13.790
substrate, you'll bind
an inhibitor.

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:19.020
So often, these are actually
pretty simple.

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:22.410
An inhibitor sometimes will look
a lot like a substrate or

00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:26.180
like a transition complex, and
it'll blind to the enzyme.

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:29.050
And when you have that inhibitor
stuck in the active

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:33.310
site, substrate physically can't
bind, so it occupies the

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:36.600
place that substrate goes,
substrate will come in but it

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.030
can't bind anywhere.

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:42.210
So this is actually the
mechanism by which a number of

00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:44.780
pharmaceuticals work.

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:49.870
So, one thing that people who
were designing enzyme

00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:56.230
inhibitors think about is the
fact that enzymes do tend to

00:42:56.230 --> 00:43:00.420
stabilize a transition state
in the reaction.

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:05.790
So if you make an inhibitor that
resembles a transition

00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:10.400
state, it should bind to the
enzyme more tightly than

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:14.530
either the reactants, the
substrates, or the products.

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:17.560
So, a lot of the pharmaceutical
industry likes

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:20.900
to try to figure out what the
transition state might look

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:24.710
like, and then try to make a
molecule that looks like that

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:27.450
transition state that hopefully
will blind to the

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:31.710
enzyme active site and prevent
the enzyme from doing what

00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:35.030
it's supposed to do.

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:38.630
So, just to kind of look back
at this figure for a minute

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:41.720
that you had earlier in your
notes, so you have the

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:46.390
transition state is often
stabilized by a catalyst, and

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:50.650
so an enzyme will also stabilize
a transition state.

00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:53.870
So if you make your drug look
like a transition state, it

00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:56.560
will hopefully bind
very tightly.

00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:02.380
And so this is one of the sort
of principles that's behind a

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:06.490
lot of the pharmaceuticals that
have made to treat HIV

00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:07.330
infections.

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:11.320
So I mentioned last week we
had world AIDS day, that

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.550
understanding kinetics
was actually very

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:16.970
important in HIV research.

00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:19.730
And so, many of the
pharmaceuticals that are given

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:23.720
to HIV patients are what are
called protease inhibitors.

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:27.480
So they inhibit enzymes that are
called proteases, and if

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:30.120
you have ase at the end of the
name that means it's an

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:34.220
enzyme, and so protease means
that it's an enzyme that

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:35.720
cleaves proteins.

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.590
It's a protein ase.

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:40.450
And so, how do these
enzymes work.

00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:43.130
Well, they cleave other
proteins, they cleave peptide

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:46.040
bonds, and so you often have
some kind of either activated

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:51.650
water or other hydroxide
molecule that will attack here

00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:55.700
the carbonyl of a peptide
bond, and it forms a

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:59.180
tetrahedral intermediate, which
then collapses and it

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:00.350
cleaves that peptide bond.

00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:03.210
So the peptide bond is then
broken, so that's what a

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:06.800
protease does, and a
protease inhibitor

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.470
prevents that cleavage.

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:12.030
So often, protease inhibitors
look like tetrahedral

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:15.800
intermediates, and so they'll
bind to the protease active

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:18.920
site and prevent the chemistry
from occurring.

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.570
So if it's a tetrahedral
intermediate, what kind of

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:24.230
angles should some
pharmaceutical company be

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:26.650
looking for in its compounds?

00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:28.570
109 .

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:30.320
5, yes.

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:36.280
So, molecules with this stable
tetrahedral intermediate

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:41.030
somewhere on the molecule could
bind to the active site

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:43.110
and prevent a catalysis.

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:46.900
So, let me just show you one
example of an improved HIV

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:48.880
drug, and there it is.

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:54.470
This is the tetrahedral site
that binds at the active site

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:58.950
of that enzyme, and the enzyme
can't cleave this tetrahedral

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:02.280
intermediate, and so this just
binds, but the enzyme can't

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:06.980
work on it, so it just sits
there and prevents substrate

00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:08.080
from binding.

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:12.300
So that's how a lot of
these compounds work.

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:15.580
And so, this is just a little
picture of the enzyme active

00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:19.490
site and there's an inhibitor
bound to the enzyme active

00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:21.980
site, and so a number of
companies are working on

00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:24.920
trying to come up with better
and better inhibitors that

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:28.710
will sit in the HIV protease
active site.

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:33.410
So, knowledgeable of a reaction
mechanism can lead to

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:35.960
new therapeutic treatments.

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:39.760
So, one question with this, with
protease, there are a lot

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:43.320
of proteases, not just the ones
involved with HIV, and so

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:47.120
one real problem is specificity
and toxicity, so

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:50.850
you want to have a drug that
inhibits one enzyme and not

00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:53.100
all the enzymes in
that category.

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:56.910
So that's a big problem in the
pharmaceutical industry.

00:46:56.910 --> 00:47:02.540
So, apparently, clicker results,
we actually need to

00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:07.830
break a tie.

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:11.830
But we can't do it now.

00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:19.250
OK, so Justin's section, woah!

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:22.580
So, apparently we're having, we
have the questions ready,

00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:25.200
but apparently they're
not ready to be used

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.820
right at the moment.

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:32.630
So, we're going to use low tech
here and indicate the

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:36.030
results for today.

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:42.720
And then on Wednesday, last
day of class -- oh, my

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:46.400
goodness, so close.

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:57.960
Recitation 6, you were second.

00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:02.310
All right, so on Wednesday then,
we're going to have the

00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:06.180
tie breaker, and review
and evaluations.
