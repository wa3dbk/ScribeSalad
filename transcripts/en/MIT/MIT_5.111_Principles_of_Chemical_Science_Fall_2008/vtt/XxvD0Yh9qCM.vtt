00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:26.180
PROFESSOR: OK, so we're going
to leave off where we were

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.780
last time talking
about buffers.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.570
And I'm a big fan of buffers,
actually, and buffers are

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.890
extremely useful in my research
because they keep the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.910
p h of things constant.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.670
So if you're going to do any
kind of biology research or

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.510
biochemistry research, you need
to know about buffers.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.270
And as I'll mentioned later,
also your body needs to be

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.450
buffered appropriately, you
don't want a large changes in

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.880
p h in your body or things
won't function properly.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.580
So buffering is very
important.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.290
So let's go over buffers.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.160
So if we talk about an acid
buffer, that's something

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.460
that's buffering on the acidic
side of the p h range.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.070
And in that, you want to have
play on both sides.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.720
So if you have a strong acid, it
can be neutralized, the p h

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.370
stays the same.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.110
If you had a strong base, that
would be neutralized so the p

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.570
h stays the same.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.750
So what happens, you have to
have an acid and its conjugate

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.840
base in the mixture to
have a good buffer.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.260
So what the weak acid is going
to do is it will transfer

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.130
protons or hydrogen ions to
hydroxide ions that are

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.540
supplied by the strong base to
neutralize that strong base

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.740
that was added.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.450
So you need to have an acid in
there that's capable of giving

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.190
up a proton to neutralize the
hydroxide ion that was added.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.230
You also need to have
a conjugate base.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.600
The conjugate base is going to
accept protons if an acid is

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.050
added, thereby neutralizing the
effect of that added acid.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.260
So again, you need a weak acid
and its conjugate base, you

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.000
need both to have
a good buffer.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.750
So I've been talking about weak
acids and weak conjugate

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.740
bases, so why would a strong
acid and the salt of its

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.050
conjugate base not make
a good buffer?

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.330
What do strong acids do?

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.620
They dissociate almost
completely, and that's not

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.960
going to do you any good.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.490
You want to be able to shift
that equation both directions.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.600
So a strong acid goes to
completion is going to drive

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.700
it to the right, and for a good
buffer you want to be

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.380
able to switch things around
that if you add a strong acid,

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.630
then you neutralize that, you
add a strong base, you

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.720
neutralize it.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.620
So you need the conjugate to be
effective as a base, and a

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.960
strong acid has an ineffective
conjugate base.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.190
It's not good as a base at
all, so that won't work.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.770
So buffers are made up of weak
acids and their conjugate

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.210
bases, or weak bases and
their conjugate acids.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.380
They need to be in the
weak range or there's

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.800
no buffering capacity.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.420
So let's look at a base
buffer example.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.590
The only difference here is that
a basic buffer is going

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.340
to buffer on the basic
end of the p h range.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.970
So here's an equation.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.490
We have a base in water forming
a conjugate of that

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.150
weak base and hydroxide ions.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.150
So let's think about
what happens if a

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.150
strong acid is added.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.000
Well if a strong acid is added,
then this base, n h 3,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.080
can accept protons from the
incoming acid and make more n

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.390
h 4 plus, thereby removing the
strong acid from the solution

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.060
and neutralizing the p h.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.540
If on the other hand a strong
base is added, n h 4 plus or

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.960
ammonium ions can donate the
proton forming its conjugate

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.760
base in water, and again, the
p h remains about the same.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.590
So the base and its conjugate
acid can both react,

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.050
neutralizing the p h.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.160
So in the base buffer acid, a
weak base, b, will accept

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.480
protons supplied by the strong
acid, removing a strong acid

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.760
from the solution.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.650
The conjugate acid of that weak
base, which again, would

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.640
be a weak acid, can transfer
protons to the hydroxide ions

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.840
added by the strong
base, again,

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.380
neutralizing the effect there.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.630
So a buffer is a mixture of a
weak acid base conjugate pair

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.370
that will stabilize the p h
serving as a source or a sink

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.350
for the added protons.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.880
So that's how a buffer works.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.910
So, I mentioned buffering
is very important.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.410
It's very important
in your blood.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.510
Your blood is buffered in
the range of p h 7 .

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.080
35 to 7 .

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:22.710
45, and you have a buffering
pair and a conjugate acid base

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.820
pair that's in your blood
that does to work.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.020
So nature has its own buffering
system design to

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.220
keep the p h of your
blood constant.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.550
Well what happens if the p
h of your blood changes?

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.390
So let me just tell you about
one disease that can change

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.330
the p h of your blood.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.960
This is from a vitamin B12
dependent enzyme called

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:54.070
methylmalonic coa mutase, and
this enzyme is your friend.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.070
I think that most of you are
excited about the idea of

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.980
having all your fat go to
energy, so you should be all

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.790
fan of this enzyme.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:07.180
So it breaks down from fatty
acids -- you get methylmalonyl

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.270
coa, which is converted to
succinyl coa and goes into the

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.820
citric acid cycle.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.530
But if this step is blocked,
if there's some kind of

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.650
genetic disease associated with
that particular enzyme,

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.890
you get a condition called
methylmalonic aciduria.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.910
So this is excreted in the body,
it can't be converted to

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.260
the succinyl coa, so it has to
be excreted from the body, and

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.010
it has an acidic p h.

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.320
And so when it's excreted, it
will actually, there's a large

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.460
amount of it, and it can change
the p h of blood.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.080
So even though you have this
buffering system, it can

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.360
overwhelm the buffering system
and cause a change in the p h,

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.340
which can lead to neurological
disorders and sometimes death.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.880
So they can look for this in
newborns, they can do a test,

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.550
and I was -- one of the tests is
-- it's not in every state,

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.370
but it is in Massachusetts, so
my daughter, Samantha, had

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:08.940
this test. But they can simply
look at the urine of a newborn

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.290
and look at the p h
and whether any of

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.680
this is being excreted.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.390
And some infants that have this
condition can excrete

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.460
like a gram of this
acid a day.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.930
So it's really large quantities
of acid that are

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.280
excreted and it goes beyond
the buffering capacity.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.560
So, I'm going to tell you a
little story and it sort of

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.950
emphasizes some of the

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.830
importance of genetic research.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.850
So before the human genome
project, scientists were

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.500
trying to find the gene to
figure out what was wrong with

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.710
these patients that had
this condition.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:41.960
And here are all
the amino acids

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.670
translated from the gene.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:50.090
This is not a small protein,
that's a lot of amino acids.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.040
And they found that the problem
was right here, or one

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.230
of the main problems
is right here.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.250
There's a glycine residue, which
glycine is the smallest

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.450
amino acid and that had been
changed to something else and

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.240
that led to the disease.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.070
Now I want you to imagine if
you were parents of a small

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:10.080
child and you found out your
child had this condition and

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.600
then you had heard that there
were advances, they now know

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.920
what caused it, and so, they
went to the doctor and the

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:21.240
doctor said, yes, your child,
the DNA is wrong, and so let's

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:27.570
substitute a different amino
acid for glycine here.

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:29.040
OK.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.980
What does that do for you?

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.760
Like why is that a problem?

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.310
Well, they didn't know why it
was a problem, they just knew

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:38.930
that it had the wrong
amino acid in there.

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:43.340
And so, the next step was to
try to understand what was

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.210
actually going on.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:49.820
So what happened in this case
was that the vitamin B12

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.690
cofactor had changed its
conformation when it bound to

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:54.680
the protein.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.640
And instead of having this sort
of loop structure here,

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.400
it had more of a tail.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.350
So this base here had moved
down, and so there was a

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:10.520
different shape to the vitamin
than had been expected.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.270
So when the first structure
was solved of one of these

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:17.890
enzymes, it found that here's
kind of what the vitamin B12

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.460
looked like, it had this
extended region which no one

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:24.100
was expecting, and so that had
to fit into the protein.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.190
So this is the domain of the
protein that binds the

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:30.540
vitamin, and it had a large
hole, and you put these

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.970
together and that's
great, it fits and

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.710
you have happy enzyme.

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:40.780
Well, how do you create a hole
-- nature supposedly abhors a

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.110
vacuum, so how do you
have this hole?

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:47.250
Well, what nature did was it put
the smallest amino acids

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:51.350
there are, glycines, right along
here to make room for

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.360
this to fit together.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.470
So, what was happening in this
genetic case is that the

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:02.060
switch of a glycine to an
argenine did this to the hole.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:06.750
So, what people were trying to
do is treat these patients

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:10.570
with extra B12, you give them
injections of it, you have a

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:14.250
lot more B12, and you want to
the B12 to bind and get the

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.140
activity back going again.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:20.410
But really, no matter how much
vitamin B12 you added to it,

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.890
it wasn't really going to do
much good, it just wasn't

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.070
going to fit.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:27.410
So instead, there was a
suggestion that instead of

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:30.850
giving the whole vitamin,
perhaps you could just give a

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:32.920
truncated version of the
vitamin, which was

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:37.530
commercially available, and
that that might bind and

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:41.020
restore activity
of the protein.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:45.500
So this is what was suggested
once you knew what the problem

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.140
actually was.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:51.380
So this is just an example of
a genetic disease, and it's

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.770
not that common, but as I said,
it is tested for here in

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:55.900
Massachusetts.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:00.150
And how knowing something about
what the problem is can

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.610
lead to a potential solution.

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:05.920
But for most of you, your blood
is doing just fine, you

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.350
don't have a genetic condition
which is pumping too much acid

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:13.820
into your bloodstream, so that
nature's buffering capacity is

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:18.040
working quite well.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:23.530
So buffers are important.

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.980
It's great to have my
important statements

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.560
emphasized up there.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.570
We've been rehearsing at home.

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:33.220
OK.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:36.780
So let's do a sample
buffer problem.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.670
All right, suppose we have an
acid, 0.1 moles of an acid,

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:44.460
and 0.5 moles of its conjugate
base added in

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.090
the form of a salt.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:50.390
And so they're put into water
and diluted to 1.0 liter.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:54.480
And you're given information
about the k a of the acid, 1 .

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.380
77 times 10 to the minus
4, and you're asked to

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.840
calculate the p h.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.450
So what do you do?

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:05.060
All right, first, it's always
good to write the equation

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.380
that you're talking about.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:12.810
And so you have acid in water
forming hydronium ions and the

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.390
conjugate base.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:19.050
So here, the acid is giving up a
proton to the water, forming

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:24.480
h 3 o plus and it's
conjugate base.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.570
Now we want to think about what
happens at equilibrium.

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:31.020
So we know how many moles we
have and we know what the

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.300
total volume is.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.650
And in this table we should be
using molarity, but the math

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:40.910
here is pretty easy because we
have 1 mole and 1 liter or 1,

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:46.030
and 0.5 moles in 1 liter
or 0.5 for molarity.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:50.900
And now at equilibrium what's
going to happen, well, when

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.480
this equilibrates some of this
will go away and more of these

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.430
are going to be formed.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:01.520
So we have minus x over here,
plus x and plus x over there,

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:05.480
and we add it all together
you get 1 minus x plus x

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.290
and 0.5 plus x.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.710
So the important thing to
remember is in buffering

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:14.440
problems, you have the acid
and the conjugate.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.170
So we're used to seeing these
tables where we only have

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:21.130
something over here and it's
all zero on the other side.

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:24.390
But in a buffering problem, you
have things on both sides

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:25.710
from the very beginning.

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:28.320
And that's a really important
point, and that alone, if you

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.730
can remember that, will
get you a long way

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:31.510
through this unit.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:35.090
So you remember that in a buffer
you got to have both an

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:39.600
acid in its conjugate base or a
base in its conjugate acid.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.630
So here we're talking about an
acid in water, it's an acidic

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:46.800
buffer, and so we can use our
k a value -- we want to know

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.720
what the concentrations
are at equilibrium to

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.530
calculate our p h.

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:57.500
So we can use our k a and we can
set it up, so we have on

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:01.510
the top products over reactants,
and we we're not

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:04.360
including water in this
because it's dilute in

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.840
solution and so it's not
changing very much.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.710
And now we can plug in our
values, so we have 0.5 plus x,

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:15.780
x over 1 minus x.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.550
All right, now this is just
written again from the last

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:24.180
slide, we can try an
approximation, which is it

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:28.190
that x is small compared to
1 molar or 0.5 molar.

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:32.400
And so we can get rid of the
plus x and the minus x down

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:37.100
here and just have one x term,
which makes it simpler to

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.400
solve, but we'll have to
go back and check that

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.010
approximation in
a few minutes.

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:46.160
So making that approximation,
we can calculate x as 3 .

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:51.040
54 times 10 to the minus 4
molar, and now we need to

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.720
check that assumption.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.740
Well, you can probably guess
it's going to be OK, because

00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:00.740
something times 10 to the minus
4 compared to 0.5 and 1,

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.860
that's probably going to
be OK that it's small.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:08.060
But our assumption here is that
it needs to be less than

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.320
5%, and here it's 0.1%.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.930
So you could just take this
value of x, divide it by the

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:20.840
smaller of the two, 0.5 , times
100, and calculate the

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.500
percent ionization.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:26.310
If it's less than 5% you're OK,
if it's more you need to

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:30.740
use the quadratic equation
to solve the problem.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:35.410
So x here is our concentration
of hydronium ion, which is

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:39.720
great, because then we can
easily calculate the p h.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.920
So p h again is minus log
of the hydronium ion

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:47.230
concentration, and so
the p h here is 3 .

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:48.700
45.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.380
And again, significant figures,
we'll be talking

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.580
about this as we go through.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.830
The volume had two, it was 1 .

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:59.620
0 liters, and so we're going
to have two significant

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.760
figures after the decimal point,
because the volume was

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:08.110
limiting insignificant
figures.

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:14.250
All right, now let's consider
what happens if some strong

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:17.730
acid had been added
in the solution.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:20.520
So the volume is still going
to be 1 liter, because the

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:28.690
acid was added in before we went
up to the 1 liter mark.

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:32.810
So strong acids, they
go to completion.

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:37.150
So, if we added 0.1 moles of
that strong acid, it will

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:41.480
react with equal number of moles
of the conjugate base to

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.870
form the conjugate acid.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.070
So we can just do subtractions
here.

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:49.100
We don't have to worry about
setting up any kind of

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.920
equilibrium, we assume
it goes completely.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:58.420
So for the conjugate base we had
0.5 moles before, and it's

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:03.120
going to be reacting then with a
strong acid, so 0.1 of those

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:08.110
will react, leaving us with 0.4
moles of the conjugate,

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:10.710
and that's in 1 liter.

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:13.530
So now we have 0.4 molar.

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:17.550
For the acid, we had 1 mole to
begin with, but now we formed

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:22.010
more as they reaction
has taken place, and

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:24.130
so we have 0.1 more.

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:25.220
Now we have 1 .

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:29.270
1 moles again in 1 liter.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:33.190
So now we can do the
same thing again.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:36.390
So after this has happened,
after we have added the strong

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:40.920
acid, then a new equilibrium
is going to be reached.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:46.340
And so we can plug in
this table as well.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:47.970
So we have 1 .

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:55.250
1 now over here, and 0.4
on the other side.

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:59.880
As equilibrium is approached,
you lose some of the acid as

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.510
it reacts with water and ionizes
and you form more of

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:08.040
the h 3 o plus and more
of the conjugate.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.290
So we have 1 .

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:14.810
1 minus x, x, and 0.4 plus x.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:18.030
So again, the trick here is just
to remember that there is

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.810
a reaction with a strong acid
that has been added, and you

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:25.410
need to figure out the new
molarities, and then go back

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:33.720
to your equilibrium table with
those new molarities.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.790
So here we can set up with a
k a again, and do the same

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:42.030
problem that we did before.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:45.390
And so, we can make the
assumption again that x is

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:49.410
small, try it out and
see if it works.

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:52.060
X turns out to be 4 .

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:55.820
87 times 10 to the minus 4
molars -- so again, it's a

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.440
small number.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:03.300
And so, it turns out to be 1
. -- less than 1% of 0.4 .

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.840
If it's less than 5% of the
smaller number, you don't have

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:10.100
to worry about the bigger
number, and so your assumption

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.630
is OK, you don't need to use
the quadratic equation.

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:17.580
And so, then we can calculate
at the end that the

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.260
p h is now 3 .

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.260
31, again, two significant
figures after the decimal

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.300
place because of the volume.

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.990
So addition of 0.1 moles of
a strong acid changed

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:29.420
our p h from 3 .

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:32.200
45 to 3 .

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.290
31.

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:34.750
So we buffered pretty well.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:38.540
There was a change in p h, we
added acid and the p h did go

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:41.630
down, but not by an
enormous amount.

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:45.040
And so, that's because this
turned out to be a pretty

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.890
decent buffer here,
so we didn't have

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:54.740
a really huge effect.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:20:07.530
So, those are -- that's an
example of a buffer problem.

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:10.720
So, let's think for a minute
about designing a buffer.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:17.690
Suppose you wanted to create a
buffer at a particular p h,

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:19.680
what do you need
to think about?

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.870
Well, you need to think about
the ratio of your acid to the

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:26.570
conjugate, and you need to think
about the p k a of the

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:32.660
acid, and the p h
that's desired.

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:38.940
So here is a generic equation
for an acid in water, so we

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.060
have our acid, h a, in water
forming hydronium ions and our

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:44.340
conjugate base.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.300
And now we're going to do a
little derivation to come up

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.010
with an equation that would be
useful to you in thinking

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:53.420
about buffers and designing
buffers.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:57.910
So, we can write a generic
term for k a.

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:01.420
K a equals products over
reactants, and so we have our

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:05.220
hydronium ions are conjugate
base over our acid.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:09.400
And now we can take this
term and rearrange it.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.330
So we can pull a hydronium ion

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:14.380
concentration over to one side.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:18.860
And now we're going to take the
logs of both sides, so we

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:24.090
get the log of hydronium ion
concentration, the log of k a,

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:27.560
and the log of h a concentration
over a minus

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:31.680
concentration, and now we're
going to multiply everything

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:36.950
by negative sign, so we have
minus logs of things.

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:40.070
And I'm just going to move this
now up to the top of the

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:43.950
screen, and we have
this equation.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:49.160
So what is minus log of
hydronium ion concentration?

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:49.850
P h.

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:53.310
What's minus log of k a?

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.430
P k a.

00:21:55.430 --> 00:22:00.110
So, we have p h equals p
k a minus the log of a

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:03.970
concentration of your acid over
the concentration of your

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:05.120
conjugate base.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.030
And these are equilibrium
concentrations for that,

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:10.570
because remember, we derived
it from our equilibrium

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:13.230
expression for k a.

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:16.400
But a lot of times when you're
working buffer problems, you

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.710
know the concentrations that you
added of these things, not

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:23.780
necessarily the concentrations
of equilibrium.

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:27.550
And if we rewrite this
expression in terms of the

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:31.990
initial concentrations or
original or o concentrations,

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:36.550
then we have p h is
approximately equal to p k a

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:40.310
minus log of the initial
concentrations of your acid

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:41.810
over your conjugate base.

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:42.900
And this is known as a

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.140
Henderson Hasselbalch equation.

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:48.490
And people love the Henderson
Hasselbalch equation, and it

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:51.870
can be incredibly useful to you
in solving these problems.

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:55.090
But I'm going to emphasize when
it's OK to use it and

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:58.560
when it's not OK to use it,
because people try to apply it

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.300
to everything, and it's for
buffer problems, and people

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.340
apply it to all sorts of things
that are not buffer

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:07.160
problems. So I want to make sure
that it's clear when you

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:10.060
can use it and when
you can't use it.

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:14.110
And it's fine to use it and you
should use it when it's

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:17.150
acceptable, but not
at other times.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.800
It's one of the few equations
in acid base, so people get

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.400
very excited by it.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:26.680
All right, so remember that it's
really equal when they're

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.330
at equilibrium concentrations,
and this is just an

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:32.520
approximation that we're saying
that those are initial

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.180
concentrations.

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:39.080
So when is it OK to say well,
the equilibrium concentration

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:43.240
is more or less the same as
the initial concentration.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:47.400
And that's true when x, which is
in this particular example

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.500
your hydronium ion
concentration, is small

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:54.110
compared to your initial
concentration of the acid and

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:57.000
the conjugate base that you
added to the buffer.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.030
So, and when x is small, then
pretty much, the equilibrium

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:04.110
concentration equals the
initial concentration.

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:08.110
So there's not really very much
change if x is a really

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:10.050
small number.

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:13.510
So, a lot of the time
this is true.

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:15.740
Remember, we're making buffers
from weak acids and weak

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:19.120
conjugate bases, and the
definition of a weak acid is

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.390
that it only loses a tiny
fraction of its protons.

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:26.070
It only ionizes slightly
in water.

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:29.960
And a weak base typically only
accepts a fraction of the

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.740
protons it can accept.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:36.330
It's a weak base, so it's
not doing a whole lot

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:37.650
of chemistry there.

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:41.440
So this approximation is
good a lot of the time.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:44.590
So just you know when you can
and can not use it, we're

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:47.870
going to give a rule and say
it's the same rule as before.

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:52.040
When we say when x is small
or your hydronium ion

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:55.200
concentration is small compared
to the acid or the

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.360
conjugate base, when it's less
than 5%, that's what we're

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:02.380
going to call small, so
the same rule we've

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.800
been using all along.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.880
When x is small, this
approximation

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.170
works pretty well.

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:11.800
And you can plug in your
concentrations right there --

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.380
your initial concentrations
not your equilibrium

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:19.060
concentrations.

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:22.060
All right, so let's use
Henderson Hasselbalch and

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:26.490
design a buffer system if
we want a p h of 4 .

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:27.480
6.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:32.060
And a good rule to remember is
that a buffering solution is

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:36.420
most effective when it's
plus or minus 1 away

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.300
from the p k a.

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.540
So that's a good thing
too I keep in mind

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.050
for research as well.

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:46.490
If you're really far away from
the p k a, it's not going to

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:49.200
be a good buffering system,
and this is a mistake the

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.300
people make in the lab
sometimes, so you may run into

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.580
that in some of your
laboratory courses.

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:59.270
So we want a buffer
about p h 4 .

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:00.130
6.

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:03.870
So we can look at our ionization
constants of acid,

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:05.830
and of course, we're always
doing everything at room

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:09.840
temperature in this unit, and so
we can look at what p k a's

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:14.680
are of some weak acids, and
acetate, acetate is an easy

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:19.650
buffer to get your hands on,
acetate is quite available,

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:21.860
and it has a good p k a 4 .

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:22.980
75.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:27.340
So that's great, we can use that
in designing our buffer.

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:32.780
So, acetic acid has the right
p k a, and we're all set, we

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.490
can prepare a buffer.

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:38.010
But we'll need to add the acid
and the conjugate, and we need

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:42.890
to know how much acid and how
much of the conjugate to add.

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:46.410
So we can use Henderson
Hasselbalch equation for this.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:50.140
We're creating a buffer, and so
this is an equation we can

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:51.510
use for buffers.

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:55.840
We know what p h we want, we
know the p k a of the thing

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.730
we're going to use, and we want
to figure out how much of

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:01.700
the acid to use and how much
of the conjugate to use.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:05.660
We need to know the ratio of one
to the other to set up our

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.820
buffer ideally.

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:12.200
So we can plug our numbers
in and calculate that.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.660
So, we can rearrange this if you
want so that the unknown

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.560
is on one side and we have
to p k a and the p h

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:21.300
on the other side.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:26.560
And so, we have here our p k a
minus our p h and we get 0 .

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.710
15.

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:32.500
Now we need to inverse log and
come up with the ratio, and

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.640
the ratio that we want is 1 .

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.510
4.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:38.530
So we want to have a ratio
from our acid to the

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:40.260
conjugate of 1 .

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:40.910
4.

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:43.480
Well how much exactly are we
going to add them, we know the

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.460
ratio now, how much are
we going to add?

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:48.690
Well, you could use 1 .

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:53.130
4 molar and 1 molar, for
example, that would have the

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:54.860
correct ratio.

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:59.010
But how do you know if that's
going to be good?

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:02.310
Well, the ratio is more
important than the exact

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:07.150
amounts, however, the amounts
get to this issue of sort of

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:11.190
the capacity of the buffer --
how resistant it is to changes

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:12.170
in the p h.

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:15.440
So if you use too low
concentrations of both, it

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.490
won't be all that resistant.

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:21.490
So if you need to have a better
buffering capacity, the

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:24.880
higher concentrations
that you should use.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.630
And you can use Henderson
Hasselbalch then to calculate

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:31.350
what sort of the minimum amount
you use, the minimum

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:35.050
amount to have that
5% rule work.

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:39.520
So in the example I told you
about this condition, the

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:42.730
buffer in the blood was pretty
good, but the acid with so

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:46.120
much that it overwhelmed
buffering capacity.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.790
So if there had been larger
concentrations of the buffer,

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:52.760
that would have certainly
helped in that case.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:55.240
So the higher the concentrations
you use, the

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.760
more resistant to change.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:02.010
And that's the idea of
buffering capacity.

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:04.870
So, and if you use too low
concentrations, then your

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:08.770
Henderson Hasselbalch equation
won't even be valid.

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:11.520
So we can go back and calculate
what is sort of the

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:15.500
minimum concentrations we need
to use for Henderson

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.830
Hasselbalch to be valid
to meet that 5% rule.

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:20.630
So for a p h of 4 .

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:24.830
6, a hydronium ion concentration
is a 2 .

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:26.880
5 times 10 to the minus 5.

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:31.040
And so then if we work our
equation backwards, we want to

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:35.010
be less than 5%, so we have this
over the concentration of

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:39.310
either one of those times
100% gives you 5%.

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:42.890
So the concentrations need to be
greater than 5 times 10 to

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:46.690
the minus 4 moles or you won't
meet this 5% rule.

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:49.710
So at least to be greater than
that and they need to be in

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:50.880
the right ratio.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:55.210
Other than that you're somewhat
free to decide what

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:56.910
you're going to do with that,
and there may be other

00:29:56.910 --> 00:30:01.930
considerations involved if
you're working with a certain

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:04.930
concentration of protein, you
might not want your buffer

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:07.810
concentration to be too high,
it might start interfering

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:10.700
with enzyme assay,
for example.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:12.540
And often buffers are
somewhere around 100

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:15.440
millimolar, that's
a pretty common

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:19.170
concentration for buffers.

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:24.810
All right, so this slide we're
doing really well.

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:28.790
So we talked about weak acids in
water, weak bases in water,

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:31.410
and I'm trying to convince you
that these are the same as the

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:34.320
salt and water problems. So
we're going to talk much more

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.510
about salt and water
in a few minutes.

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:39.560
And I told you about buffers,
so we only have 2

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:40.950
more things to go.

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:43.890
We need to talk about strong
acids in water, and strong

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:47.340
bases in water, and then you'll
have all of the 5 types

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:50.900
of problems to do
the problem-set.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:55.690
And as I mentioned last time,
it looks deceivingly short,

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:58.840
the number of questions on
them, but the titration

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.700
problems are long.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:04.400
So don't leave those to the last
minute or there will not

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.860
be a whole lot of
sleep involved.

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:11.460
So just a word of warning from
the past. Everyone looks and

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.300
go, "Oh, this is an easy
problem-set, there aren't many

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:19.500
problems." So, titration
problems do

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:20.950
take a lot of time.

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:24.790
So let's talk about titration,
so that as soon as class is

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:27.650
over today, you can go work
on those questions on the

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:28.140
problem-set.

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:29.530
All right.

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:31.410
So acid base titrations.

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:37.300
How many of you in high school
titrated an acid with a base?

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:42.630
Large fraction of you, OK.

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:47.740
So usually what titration
problems are meant to do, that

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:52.810
you have something known about
an acid or a base, base say of

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:58.390
known concentration, and and
acid of unknown concentration

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:01.660
or maybe unknown molecular
weight, and you're titrating

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:04.790
them out, titrating them
together to find missing

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:06.030
information.

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:08.750
So you can determine
concentration, sometimes you

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:11.580
can determine a molecular
weight.

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.690
All right, so here's what a plot
looks like and some of

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:19.090
the key terms involved in
acid base titrations.

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:24.350
So you have a p h on one side,
and then volume of either base

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:26.690
or acid added on
the other side.

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:28.940
So p h versus a volume.

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:33.220
And the actual experiment here,
you have a base that

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:38.440
you're dripping, one drip at
a time supposedly into your

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.340
strong acid.

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:44.600
And then you're looking to
figure out when you're going

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.050
to reach the either equivalence
point or the end

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:50.620
point, these are basically the
same terms. It's also called

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:54.650
the stoichiometric point, and
often equivalence point is

00:32:54.650 --> 00:33:00.010
used as a more theoretical
amount of volume is added,

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:03.860
where as end point is the
experimentally measured.

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:06.500
So we're going to be talking a
lot about equivalence points,

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:09.110
because we have no lab
associated with this course,

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:12.360
so everything will be
theorectical in terms of

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:15.970
these, but they should
be the same.

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:19.190
So, many times you will measure
p h with the p h meter

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:21.400
-- this just shows
a p h meter.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:25.540
And for those of you who have
done these experiments, this

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:26.890
should look familiar.

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:30.090
And for those of you who
haven't, often what you're

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:32.330
doing when you're dripping
something in, you're waiting

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:35.970
for an indicator dye to change
color as an indication that

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:38.710
you have reached the end
point, and often you're

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:41.870
adding, and it's clear, clear,
clear for what seems to be

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:45.920
forever, and just as you get
incredibly impatient, you

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.960
start adding it faster and
you go all the way

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.250
to this dark color.

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:54.800
And what you want is this very,
very, very light changed

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.000
color that indicates
the end point.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.030
So you usually go too slow and
then go too fast and then have

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:03.950
to do the experiment
over again.

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:06.880
Those of you who know how to
calculate theoretical values

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.770
could sit down and do a
calculation first and then go

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:12.970
really fast right until you get
around this point and add

00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:16.500
it really slowly, and be
done with lab sooner.

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:20.110
So, we'll talk about how you
do the theoretical value,

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:23.810
which could save you a lot of
time if you ever run across

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:30.280
these labs in any
future class.

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:34.140
So, here are the two curves that
you would see for either

00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:36.920
a strong acid with a strong
base, or strong base with a

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.210
strong acid.

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:41.410
So if you're titrating a strong
acid with a strong

00:34:41.410 --> 00:34:44.630
base, you're going to start
down being very acidic,

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:47.450
because all you have is
your strong acid.

00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:51.640
And then as you add in base,
the p h will go up.

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:55.260
You'll reach this point -- s
is for the stoichiometric

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:58.060
point, we also call this, again,
the equivalence point,

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:01.840
and then it'll continue to go up
and then start to level off

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.880
a bit more up here.

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.960
If you're going the other
direction, you're starting

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:09.790
with strong base, your p h is
going to be high, and the p h

00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:12.120
will decrease as you
add the acid.

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.750
And then you get to the
stoichiometric or equivalence

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:20.090
point in the middle of
this curve here.

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:23.350
And then as you go down farther,
more acidic, it

00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:24.680
starts to level off.

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:29.880
So those are what the titration
curves look like.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.190
So let's do an example.

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:36.040
We're going to have a strong
base being titrated with a

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:42.095
strong acid first. And our
strong base is n a o h, and

00:35:42.095 --> 00:35:47.040
our strong acid is h c l.

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:56.560
So let's calculate the p h
at the equivalence point.

00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:00.730
Well, let's just calculate
the p h at 5 mils --

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:03.450
I don't know whether it's
equivalence point, actually.

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:08.200
5 mils of this have been added
to the amount of base.

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:12.920
So we have 25 mils of our strong
base at 0.15 molar

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:17.710
concentration, and we're adding
5 mils of our 0.34

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:21.520
molar acid.

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:24.580
So what we want to do is figure
out how many moles of

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:28.280
base we had to start with.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:33.050
So how many moles of o h minus
-- again, n a o h is a strong

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:37.300
base, so however much n a o h
you add, is the amount of o h

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:42.390
minus you get, and so we just
put in the number of liters

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:44.780
times the concentration
to get moles.

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:48.760
We don't need any equilibrium
table here.

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:52.290
So then we want to figure out
the amount of acid added when

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:55.660
you're adding 5 mils of it.

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:59.950
So again, h c l is a strong
acid, so the amount of h c l

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:05.040
added equals the amount of h 3 o
plus, that's formed, goes to

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:09.220
completion, and so we added 5
mils, the concentration was

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:12.480
0.34 molar, so we have 1 .

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:17.480
7 times 10 to the
minus 3 moles.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:21.100
So now, the strong acid is going
to react with the strong

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:24.850
base, and we want to figure out
how much of the base is

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:28.980
left, how much hydroxide ion is
left after it reacts with

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:31.210
the hydronium ions.

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:35.650
So it'll react 1:1,
so we had 6 .

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:41.900
25 times 10 to the minus 3
moles, and we added 1 .

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:45.260
7 times 10 to the minus 3 moles
of the acid, so we're

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:47.350
going to have 4 .

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:53.430
55 times 10 the minus
3 moles left.

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:59.270
And now we can calculate the
molarity here, so we have the

00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:03.900
number of moles and the new
volume, so we had 25 mils to

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:04.990
the base to begin with.

00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:08.600
We've added 5 mils to the acid,
so our new volume is 30,

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:12.980
and so we have our new
concentration.

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:15.280
And now we can calculate p h.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:20.380
First we'll calculate p o h, and
then use 14 minus to get

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:23.180
the new p h.

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:29.630
So if you were making your own
little titration curve, we

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:34.480
could have volume of acid on one
side and p h on the other

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:39.080
side, and you have
a point of 13 .

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:40.430
18.

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:49.360
That's how much we have after
you have 5 mils added.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.560
So we didn't, in this curve, we
have not measured the zero

00:38:52.560 --> 00:39:00.420
point, but we know what one
point after 5 mils of the acid

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:02.760
has been added.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:06.250
So now let's go right to the
equivalence point -- so the

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:08.180
way I draw it should indicate
that was not

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:09.510
an equivalence point.

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:12.850
So we want to figure out how
much we need to add of the

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:15.150
acid to reach the equivalence
point.

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:18.290
So the equivalence point or the
stoichiometric point means

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:22.900
that you add the same amount
of moles of your titrate as

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:26.740
you had, and so they're going
to be equal to each other.

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:30.250
So if you're adding acid to a
strong base, you've added

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:33.370
enough acid that you now have
equal number of moles to the

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:36.380
number of moles of base that
you had to begin with.

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:37.640
So we know we have 6 .

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:41.030
25 times 10 to the
minus 3 moles of

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:42.590
the base were present.

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:46.400
So at the equivalence point,
you need to have that exact

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.560
same number of moles of acid.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:53.700
So we know the concentration
of the acid we have and the

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:56.590
number of moles we need, and
so we can calculate the

00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:59.160
volume, which is 18 .

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:04.480
4 millimeters, or
0.0184 liters.

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:12.860
So what would the p h then be
of the equivalence point?

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:15.980
We're titrating a strong acid
with a strong base, what

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:19.830
should the p h be?

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:22.270
The p h should be 7.

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:27.120
So somewhere around here we're
going to be at 18, so you can

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:36.650
just try to draw a curve, and
here we have a p h of 7 when

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:39.770
we've gone to about 18 .

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:44.300
4 milliliters added.

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.620
So when you titrate a strong
acid with a strong base, you

00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:49.610
form a salt that's neutral.

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:52.320
Because the conjugates of a
strong acid and a strong base

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.380
are not basic or acidic.

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:56.740
They're ineffective as acids or
bases, so you're going to

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:58.640
get a neutral salt.

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:01.470
So if you're doing a problem
with a strong acid and strong

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:04.130
base, it's not a lot of
calculations that need to be

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:06.910
done at this point, you just
need to recognize that your

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:09.420
salt should be neutral.

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:12.920
So now, we can talk about what
happens if you add an extra

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:17.170
milliliter of your acid, after
you've reached that

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:19.820
equivalence point, which is
something that people probably

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:22.820
have done in doing these
titrations not meaning to,

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:27.550
gone well beyond the
equivalence point.

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:31.140
So first we can find out the
number of moles of the strong

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:36.250
acid that we've added extra,
so we added one mil of the

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:39.660
strong acid, and so again,
it goes to completion.

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:44.480
The concentration, the acid, is
0.34 molar times our 1 mil,

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:45.940
so we've added 3 .

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:52.100
4 times 10 to the minus 4 extra
moles of our acid, and

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:55.650
so let's calculate then what the
molarity is that we have

00:41:55.650 --> 00:42:03.660
added that was extra.

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:05.330
And even if you don't
have a calculator,

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:41.980
we've helped you out.

00:42:41.980 --> 00:43:05.530
Let's just take 10
more seconds.

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:10.650
I think this is a
first, isn't it?

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:12.300
Did I mention it's a
good idea to start

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:15.660
the problem-set early.

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:20.060
So the trick here was
about the volume.

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:25.960
So we had 25 mils to begin
with, then we added 18 .

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:30.110
4 to get to the equivalence
point, and then we're 1 mil

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:32.310
beyond the equivalence point.

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:35.360
And the tricks to these parts
of the problems are to

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:38.160
remember all the things
that have been added

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.630
to get to the volume.

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:43.150
So the problem itself is not
very tricky of having just an

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:47.640
acid in water, but the one trick
is in calculating the

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:50.530
molarity, remembering all of the
things that were added to

00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:52.490
get to this point.

00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:56.060
And so by the end of the
problem-set this should be

00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:59.230
pretty familiar to you, but it's
also something that you

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:02.670
want to make sure that you check
on an exam that you're

00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:06.530
not making any volume
mistakes.

00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:10.620
So again, here are the things
that you want to remember to

00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:13.640
add in in calculating this.

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:17.120
And then, if you calculate
the p h of that, you

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.620
get a p h of 2 .

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:24.450
1106, so that's down
somewhere in here.

00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:33.080
We've added 1 more mill, and
we're at a p h of 2 .

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:38.140
1106, and this can be
a check as well.

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:41.100
If you forgot to add some of
your volume, you might get a p

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:43.230
h that doesn't make
a lot of sense.

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:45.150
So that can be a double check.

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:49.290
Always ask yourself when you
have a strong base and you're

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:52.160
adding acid, before you've
added very much, your p h

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:53.830
should be basic.

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:56.800
At the equivalence point of
a strong acid, strong base

00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.710
titration, it'll be 7.

00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:01.660
And if you continue to add acid,
then you should have a

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:04.590
pretty low p h, you'll notice
the curve drops off pretty

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:07.580
fast. So it should be a dramatic
change in p h by

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:09.750
adding extra of your acid.

00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:11.680
So always check your work.

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:14.980
OK, so let's stop there, and
we're going to weak acid, weak

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:17.760
base titrations next time.
