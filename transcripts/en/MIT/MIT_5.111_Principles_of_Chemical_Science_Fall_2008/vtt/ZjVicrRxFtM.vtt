00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:23.690
PROFESSOR: So again, this
is one more question on

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.440
hybridization.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.850
This is the last question you'll
get on hybridization

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.630
before you see the exam.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.810
So now we're talking about
hybridization of two different

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.500
atoms in a molecule.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.940
So we're looking at
this carbon atom

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.710
here and this nitrogen.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.300
So using the rules that we've
learned in terms of doing this

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.400
quickly, let's see if you can
get these answers in quick.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.190
So let's go ahead and just take
10 more seconds on this

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.200
question here.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:01:01.530
Your parents are free to help
if they're here with you.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.100
OK.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.970
Excellent. excellent
job, 98% of you.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.860
You're a lot louder with the
parents here, so let's make

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.740
sure we're still listening.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.460
OK, so let's go over what we
just we just established here.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.310
Carbon a is going to be
s p 3 hybridized.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.930
What is the geometry, what's
the vsper geometry there?

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.830
Good, it's tetrahedral.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.900
And this nitrogen b here, that's
s p 3 hybrid as well.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.800
What's the geometry around
that nitrogen?

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.660
Trigonal pyramidal, right.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.960
We have to take into account
the fact that there's that

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.380
lone pair there.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.850
All right, so let's go ahead and
switch over to the lecture

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.260
notes and see what
we just did here.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.010
And essentially actually what
we just did was I had you

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.820
identify two of four components
that make up what's

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.790
called the morphine rule.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.980
And the morphine rule is a set
of structural elements that

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.950
are responsible for the
biological activity of

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.680
morphine and other morphine-like
drugs that have

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.690
a similar pharmacological
activity in terms of how

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:08.330
they're active.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.430
So specifically, the morphine
rule is a set of four

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.520
components, which start with the
phenyl ring here, so, an

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.830
aromatic ring.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.260
The second thing you identified,
which is an s p 3

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.130
hybrid carbon.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.540
And then following that we have
a c h 2 c h 2 group here.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.720
And the last part of the
rule is this s p

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.880
3 hybridized nitrogen.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.840
So, in terms of thinking about
what this means, I said this

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.810
is responsible for the

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.700
biological activity of morphine.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.970
If we take a look at the
morphine molecule here, what

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.670
you can see is that it's a
little bit more complicated

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.920
than this structure that
we see right here.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.790
But if I go ahead and highlight
the residues in

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.300
purple, you can see that it,
in fact, does follow the

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.490
morphine rule.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.780
And what this means is this
is what allows morphine to

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.310
actually bind into its receptor,
which is a pain

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.720
receptor and block the
feeling of pain.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.470
So that's a very important thing
in terms of thinking

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.510
about hybridization in geometry,
because we've

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.150
actually established a very
important structure and shape,

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.070
which is this morphine rule
here, that if it's found in a

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.130
molecule, as long as there
aren't other parts of the

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.850
molecule that are messing up
that interaction, we can

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.510
actually form a very
tight binder

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.310
into these pain receptors.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.910
So morphine, as you know, is
a very potent pain killer.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.470
But you also, I'm sure, know
that it's also very addictive,

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.850
so it's only used sparingly in
terms of treating pain in a

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.870
general sense, and it's always
used in very closely-monitored

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.590
situations in terms
of hospital care.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.250
But what's interesting to take
note of is that the bioaction

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.110
of morphine is very similar to
endorphins that we naturally

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.490
biosynthesize.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.350
Endorphins have a structure
that's very similar to this

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.080
structure up here -- endorphins
are small peptide

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.120
molecules that we biosynthesize
and have in very

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.110
low concentrations
in our brain.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.920
They bind to pain receptors and

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.600
block those pain receptors.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.510
So, when someone talks about an
endorphin high, which you

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.770
sometimes get -- one example
would be the runners' high, if

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.750
you run for a long way running
fast, eventually you'll hit

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.550
that runner's high where you get
this burst of endorphins.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.890
All of a sudden your feet don't
hurt, your shins don't

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.460
hurt, the pain goes
away and you got

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.830
this feeling of eurphoria.

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.470
It's the exact same interaction
and it's because

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.870
of that structure there.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.590
It's not exactly the morphine
rule in endorphins but it's

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.400
very similar.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.310
So, if we look at other
derivatives of morphine, such

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.480
as codeine and diacetylmorphine,
these also

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.840
you can see have this morphin
rule within them, this

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.630
structure that you've identified
using your vsper

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.360
rules and thinking about
hybridization.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.610
Codeine, as you may know, is
less of a potent pain killer

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.660
compared to morphine, but it's
also less addictive.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.470
So for that reason it's
prescribed with

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.530
slightly less oversight.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.620
So if you get your wisdom teeth
removed or something

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.640
like that, some of you might
have had taken codeine before,

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.570
and now you can think about by
looking at the structure, a

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.760
little bit more about how
that worked in terms of

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.460
blocking your pain.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.400
One that I just want to mention
because it's so

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.370
interesting is this derivative,
which is

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.480
diacetylmorphine.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.130
The only difference between
morphine and diacetylmorphine

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.330
is the changing of an alcohol
group, or two actually, two

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.210
acetyl groups here.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.410
This was synthesized by the
company Bayer, and you

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.100
probably know Bayer from
Bayer's aspirin.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.730
Bayer had a huge success with
aspirin where they took

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.280
salicylic acid and replaced an o
h group with an acetyl group

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.760
here, and made acetylsalicylic
acid.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.130
Does anyone know the common
name for that?

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.470
Yup.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.370
So that's aspirin, and we often

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.620
think of Bayer's aspirin.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.560
We associate it really
closely.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.010
They worked really hard in
marketing to make that really

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.630
close association and with
copywriting, so that when we

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.730
think about aspirin we
think about Bayers.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.160
Bayers also made this change
here, and they did find that

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.810
diacetylmorphine is much, much
more potent than morphine is.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.870
They could use just a tiny, tiny
amount of this compound

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.190
and get the same pain-killing
properties that

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.160
they saw with morphine.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.700
The problem is that this
masked some of the side

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.510
effects that they didn't realize
initially, which was

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.830
the extreme, extreme ability for
you to become addicted to

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.940
diacetylmorphine.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.800
And this was first thought of as
a hero drug because it was

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.090
such a strong pain killer,
and this was

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.070
called a Bayer's heroin.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.940
We don't usually associate the
name Bayers with heroin, like

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.090
we did with aspirin -- that's
because Bayers did not work so

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.420
hard to keep that association
there.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:42.070
But it's an interesting story
from the history of drugs.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.030
One more example I want to show
you is demerol, which is

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.880
used clinically quite often.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.430
Demerol, if we look at the
structure here, actually looks

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:50.960
nothing like morphine at all.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.690
So to an untrained eye,
you might not see the

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:54.650
relationship there.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.200
But because you all know some
of these basic principles of

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.390
chemistry, you should be able to
pick out that morphine rule

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.440
right in the middle
of demerol.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.170
And, in fact, demerol is
a pain killer, it's an

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.120
alternative to using morphine.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.990
Again, not quite as strong as
morphine in terms of pain

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.690
killing abilities, but also not
as addictive either, and

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.280
there are some other side
effects, such as nausea that

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.910
are limited with demerol
compared to morphine.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.510
Demerol has its own set of
problems, so it's not the

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.440
perfect solution to a different
alternative to

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.870
morphine, but you do see it
used in certain cases.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.540
All right, so that's thinking
about vsper theory, and that's

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.430
thinking about hybridization.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.840
We're now going to shift gears
to talking about some new

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.270
topics today.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.750
So, we ended in Wednesday's
lecture with giving that set

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.930
of rules to very quickly
determine hybridization.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.820
And then after we'd established
that, we moved on

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.830
to starting to talk about a
little bit of thermochemistry.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.180
Specifically what we were
talking about is the

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.120
enthalpies of chemical
reactions, so either the

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.440
amount of heat that's released,
or the amount of

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.740
heat that's required
in order to have a

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.940
chemical reaction go.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:05.250
And we'd established so far two
ways to think about how we

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.510
can measure what the overall
enthalpy of a reaction is.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:11.250
And I just wanted to introduced
one more technique

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:13.920
that we can use to do that.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.240
And this relies on the fact
that when we talk about

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.470
enthalpy or we talk about the
heat change of a reaction,

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.540
this is a state function, and
any time we're talking about

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.410
state function, it's independent
of path.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.850
So essentially, all that we're
worried about is the state

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:29.770
that we started in.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.790
So, for example, when we were
talking about the oxidation of

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:36.680
glucose, the state that we start
in are the reactants, so

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.650
it's glucose plus oxygen.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.540
And what we ended up with were
six moles each of carbon

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.320
dioxide and water.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.180
So, we don't care how we get
there in terms of making this

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.660
calculation, all we're
interested in is the

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.930
difference between those two
states, to think about the

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:55.660
overall change in enthalpy.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.200
So, for example, when we talked
about how we could

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.180
calculate this, one way that we
can do it, and we'll look

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.800
at these numbers even more
specifically in a second, is

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.630
thinking about instead of going
straight down here,

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.180
which we might not have the
numbers available to us to

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.030
calculate directly, we can think
about well, what happens

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:16.760
if instead we break apart this
glucose molecule and decompose

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.500
it into its elements, because
using tables in the back of

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.670
our book, for example, we can
figure out what the change in

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:26.070
enthalpy is of this
reaction here.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:28.470
That doesn't quite get us to
where we need to go though, so

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.920
then we can think about the
enthalpy of formation of six

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.180
carbon dioxide molecules.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.410
And then we can go one step
further and think about the

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.590
enthalpy of formation for
six water molecules.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:43.250
So this is just a round
about way of going

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:44.570
from here to here.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.680
Instead we went up and then
down and then down, but

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.130
because it's a state function,
we're absolutely

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:52.290
allowed to do this.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:54.680
And to formalize this, we can
talk about what's called

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.960
Hess's law.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:01.230
And Hess's law just tell us that
if we have two or three

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:04.560
or any number of chemical
reactions that we can add

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.330
together in order to get the
chemical equation that we're

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.950
actually interested in, we can
figure out the change in

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:14.230
enthalpy of that reaction that
we're interested in, just by

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:18.250
adding together all of the other
enthalpies of reaction

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.780
for every other reaction that
we had to add together in

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:21.730
order to get there.

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:26.460
So, let's take a look at what
we're talking about here.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.260
So when I just showed you that
example graphically, I'm just

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.470
writing it out more like an
equation here, because the

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.260
nice thing about Hess's law,
is it allows you to think

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.520
about chemical reactions kind
of as if they're algebraic

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.530
expressions.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:41.560
So we can just add all of these
different expressions

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.690
together, and if we're thinking
about algebra, we can

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:45.690
just think about crossing things
out that are in the

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.220
reactants versus in
the products.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.220
So if we do this, what we end
up getting is the reaction

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.560
that we're interested in, the
oxidation of glucose to form

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.940
carbon dioxide in water.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.930
So let's look pretty carefully
at exactly the fact that these

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.930
all cancel out to give us the
reaction I say we get.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.940
So, for example, we can think
about the oxygen molecules --

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:10.110
we can cancel out 6 here and 6
here, as long as we multiply

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.540
this whole reaction by 6.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:16.790
Again, we can get rid of those
last 3 oxygen molecules there.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:19.650
Similarly, we can cross out
our 6 hydrogens from the

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:23.590
products with 6 molecular
hydrogens from the reactants.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:27.860
And then the last thing we can
cancel out are our carbon

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.550
atoms -- we have 6 in the
products, and we have 6 in the

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.030
reactants here.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.570
So you'll see that the only
things that are not canceled

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.770
out is what's left in
our bottom reaction.

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:41.150
So we can go ahead and just add
up all of these different

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:42.710
reaction enthalpies.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.380
In the first case what we're
going to have is an enthalpy

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:47.240
of 1260, and that's in

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:53.390
kilojoules per mole of glucose.

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:56.290
And the reason that this is
positive is because it's

00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:01.560
essentially the reverse reaction
of the change in

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.730
enthalpy of formation.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:04.740
So it's going to be a positive
number there.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:08.470
We add to that the enthalpy for
this reaction here, which

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.110
is negative 393 .

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.500
5, but we need to remember to
multiply that by 6, because

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.460
we're actually adding
together six of

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.710
those individual reactions.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:21.060
And lastly, we also add together
six of this final

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.810
reaction here, which has
an enthalpy change of

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.620
negative 285 .

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:26.980
8.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.000
So if we go ahead and just add
up all of our individual

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.430
enthalpy changes, what we're
going to end up with for our

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:37.260
entire reaction here, is a
change in enthalpy of negative

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:41.290
2816, and that's kilojoules
per mole of glucose.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.090
Does anyone remember from
Wednesday's class, does this

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:45.640
match what we had seen
experimentally?

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.440
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.600
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so this is
the exact number that we

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.190
calculated when we used heats
of formation, and it's also

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:57.570
the exact number that's seen
in terms of experimental.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:57.980
All right.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:02.850
So there's actually three ways
we now have to calculate heats

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:06.850
of the change in enthalpy
of an overall reaction.

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:10.710
So, we have these in our notes
from last time and from

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:14.170
finishing the end of this unit
right now, but I'm just going

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.450
to summarize them for you on the
board, because there are a

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:19.450
couple things that can get
confusing that I want to make

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.620
sure no one is confusing,
particularly in

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:23.190
the upcoming exam.

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:25.990
So what was the first way that
we learned to think about

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.050
calculating enthalpies
of reaction?

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:30.120
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:30.390
PROFESSOR: Um-hmm.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:37.340
So, it's talking about
bond enthalpies.

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.000
And when we talk about bond
enthalpy, the symbol that we

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.310
see for a bond enthalpy
is usually delta h.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:45.190
And this is where all the
confusion starts, because

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:48.020
everything's delta h, it just
depends on the subscript here,

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.310
right, what kind of delta
h we're talking about.

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:52.680
In the case of bond enthalpy
often you'll see no

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.520
subscript at all.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.250
But sometimes you do see a
subscript, which would then

00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:01.050
just be delta h sub b here.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.940
So if we're trying to do this
calculation based on bond

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:09.700
enthalpies, for the delta h for
an overall reaction, what

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.770
we want to do is take the
sum of all of those bond

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:20.990
enthalpies of our bonds that are
broken, and what we want

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:26.050
to do is subtract from that
the sum of all our bond

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:29.870
enthalpies of our bonds
that are formed.

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:37.190
All right, so let's think a
little bit more about what

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:38.240
this means.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.050
So, if we're talking about bonds
broken, are we talking

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:42.510
about reactants or products?

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.190
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:44.370
PROFESSOR: .

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:44.620
Reactants.

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.560
So, essentially we're summing
up the bond enthalpy of

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.210
reactants and subtracting
it from the products.

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:54.620
All right, great.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.040
So that's our first
strategy there.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:01.450
The second strategy that we
learned is thinking about bond

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:06.400
enthalpies of reaction by using
the enthalpy change in

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.200
terms of the enthalpy
of formation.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.450
So this one is sometimes a
little bit more intuitive,

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.160
because we're talking about the
enthalpy change it takes

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.770
in order to form a
given molecule.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:20.250
So, if we're trying to do a
calculation using enthalpies

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:24.860
of formation, what we find is
that delta h of the reaction

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:30.750
is equal to the sum of the
delta h of formation of

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:31.640
products or reactants?

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.930
STUDENT: Products.

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:36.580
PROFESSOR: Products, good.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:42.440
Of products minus the delta h of
formation, and this is the

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.310
sum again of reactants.

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:51.900
All right, and our third
strategy is what we just

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:55.120
talked about, which is Hess's
law, and in fact, both one and

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:59.080
two are applications of Hess's
law -- specific applications,

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.830
but any application of Hess's
law you can use any way of

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.760
adding up different equations
to get the final enthalpy of

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.450
the reaction.

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:09.270
The reason I wanted to put these
two strategies, however,

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:11.880
on the board right next to each
other, is so we can just

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.310
confront a point of confusion
that happens a lot with

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:17.230
students, which is why in the
first case do we have

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:20.510
reactants minus product, and
in the second case we have

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.690
products minus reactants.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.190
So, you need to keep these two
straight when you're doing

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:28.490
your calculations in terms of
enthalpies, and the reason is

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.500
because the definition of a
bond enthalpy when we're

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:35.240
talking about bonds, is the
enthalpy that it takes in

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.230
order to break the bond, the
amount of heat that goes in to

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.560
breaking a bond.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.240
So it's typically a positive
number, because if you have a

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.500
stable bond you have to
put heat into it in

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:45.660
order to break it.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:48.920
So you end up having a positive
bond enthalpy here.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.390
In contrast, when we're talking
about enthalpies of

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:54.720
formation, now we're talking
about is the change of

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.360
enthalpy in order to
form a molecule.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.710
So, for example, if we have a
nice stable molecule with

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:04.240
strong bonds in it, what we're
going to find is that the

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.990
delta h of formation, would that
be positive or negative?

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:10.190
So it's negative.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:13.770
So you'd end up with a negative
delta h of formation.

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:16.410
So because you're talking about
a term that's negative

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.650
here where it would be positive
in the first case,

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:22.050
you end up flipping signs
to have it work out.

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:24.600
So, if this doesn't make sense
as I'm saying it right now,

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.650
just go back in your notes and
look through and make sure

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:29.570
that you aren't going to get
mixed up when you're using

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.510
bond enthalpies versus
enthalpies of formation here.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:36.750
All right, so that's pretty
much all we're

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:39.170
going to say on enthalpy.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.470
So I really just want to stress,
this is going to be

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:44.050
the end of exam 2 material
here, I said I'd be clear

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:45.550
about it in class today.

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:46.360
This is it.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.940
It's also written in
your notes when

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.140
you go ahead to study.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.560
So remember, in terms of exam 2,
which I'll remind you is on

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.640
Wednesday, it's going to be all
the way from the material

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.580
on lecture 10 up to
this point here.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.960
So only through enthalpy, and
it's also going to be on

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.070
problem-sets four and five,
and I'll mention that this

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:08.020
afternoon, as I said, I'll post
a bunch of extra practice

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:12.000
problems, which are more review
of these same concepts,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.430
so you can get even more
practice this weekend and

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:17.760
early next week to prepare.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.080
All right, so that's enthalpy,
that's the

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.390
end of exam 2 material.

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:25.680
But there's actually another
really important concept that

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.810
we need to talk about -- we
really don't want to stop with

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.450
enthalpy, luckily it's exam 2
and not the end of the class,

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:33.090
because a really important
concept to think about is

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:34.560
spontaneous change.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.560
So thinking about whether a
reaction is spontaneous or

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.680
non-spontaneous.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.180
And when we think about a
spontaneous reaction, I think

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.080
this is a term many of you are
familiar with, spontaneous

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.310
just means that the reactions
going to proceed in the

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:50.890
forward direction without any
kind of outside intervention.

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:53.960
So thinking of a spontaneous
process, can talk about a

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.970
chemical reaction, but you
could just picture, for

00:18:55.970 --> 00:19:00.320
example, putting a round rock
on the top of a hill -- it

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.200
will spontaneously just roll
right down that hill.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.940
So a spontaneous process also
has direction, right, because

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.910
the rock won't spontaneously
roll back up the hill without

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:10.070
putting in work.

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:12.920
So essentially we're talking
about a spontaneous process

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.130
when something's going to happen
without actually having

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:20.040
to do anything else to
force it to happen.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.180
So let's think about in terms
of chemistry what we're

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.840
talking about is a spontaneous
reaction -- that's the

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.900
specific type of spontaneous
process that

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.230
we're interested in.

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:32.260
So let's think about a few
different types of spontaneous

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:35.950
reactions, and see if we can
come up with some idea of

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:38.350
what's going to cause them
to be spontaneous.

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:42.010
So one spontaneous reaction is
written here, so this is just

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:46.130
the oxidation of iron, or the
formation of rust. This turns

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:49.950
out to also be an exothermic
reaction, it has a negative

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:55.020
delta h of 824 kilojoules
per mole.

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.670
Another spontaneous reaction
is written here, the

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.660
combination of an acid
and a base, which

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:00.950
neutralizes each other.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:05.540
So we have a hydronium ion and a
hydroxide ion interacting to

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:06.810
form water.

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:08.840
This is spontaneous, and
again, it's exothermic.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.520
So, its delta h is
negative 55 .

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.970
9 kilojoules per mole.

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:17.850
Let's think about some
really relevant

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:19.040
reactions in our bodies.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.800
So one incredibly important
reaction, of course, is ATP

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.350
hydrolysis where we have
adenosine here, a

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:29.550
triphosphate, so we have three
phosphate groups here.

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:30.470
That's called ATP.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:33.540
It has a total charge
of minus four.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.810
So if we hydrolize this, one
of the phosphate bonds here

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:39.460
and lose a phosphate, we end up
with adenosine diphosphate

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:42.870
or ADP and that has a charge
of minus three.

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:43.160
Yup?

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:50.010
STUDENT: On our notes, this
equation [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:50.520
PROFESSOR: Oh, no.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.120
OK, thank you.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.500
Which equation are
we talking about?

00:20:52.500 --> 00:21:03.670
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:05.730
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry, what
page are you on?

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:09.140
Page two.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:12.760
So the one with h 3 --

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.660
OK.

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:19.350
All right, let's go
back to that.

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:24.790
OK, so if you can fix this
reaction in your notes here.

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:26.990
I'll also fix it on the website,
so if you don't want

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:29.610
to fix it now I'll just
re-post the notes.

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:35.740
So it should be four irons plus
three oxygens is two f e

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.400
2 o 3 solid.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.360
Thanks for pointing that out.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.520
All right, does everyone
have that down?

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:46.680
I know you had to flip
a page there.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.230
All right, so I'll post
it in the notes if you

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:49.230
didn't get it there.

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:52.310
Let's go back to ATP
hydrolysis here.

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:58.050
So we're going from ATP to ADP,
and that is a spontaneous

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:02.560
process, and it's an exothermic
reaction as well.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.790
So we find that it's negative
24 kilojoules per mole in

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.700
terms of the change
in enthalpy there.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.610
All right, so at this point
I just showed you three

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:13.070
reactions where we have
something that's spontaneous

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:14.170
and it's also exothermic.

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:16.880
And I could show you a countless
number of other

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.750
reactions where it's
the same thing.

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:21.140
It's actually quite common
if you have an exothermic

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:23.800
reaction that it's also
spontaneous at room

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.770
temperature.

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.600
So we might start to draw the
conclusion that, in fact, it's

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.630
enthalpy that's responsible for
whether or not a reaction

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:33.090
is spontaneous or
non-spontaneous.

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:35.420
So it's very easy to get that
impression, but let me show

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.590
you a few more reactions
before we draw any

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:38.830
conclusions.

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:41.430
Let me show you some more
spontaneous reactions.

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:44.840
So, for example, the conversion
of solid h 2 o to

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.990
liquid h 2 o at room
temperature, I think we all

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:50.530
know this is spontaneous.

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:53.790
Ice melts at room temperature,
but it turns out that the

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:58.490
enthalpy change is positive,
it's 7 kilojoules per mole.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:01.410
Similarly, if we look at this
reaction here, which is

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:03.060
ammonium nitrate.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.800
This is a very commonly used
fertilizer, a very commonly

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.860
used nitrogen source
in agriculture.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:12.590
If we think about solvating this
and forming the two ions,

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:14.770
ammonium ion and nitrate ion.

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:17.770
Again, this is a spontaneous
reaction, but what we find

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:20.790
here is that delta h again
is positive, it's also

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:21.000
endothermic.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.180
So thinking about all of this,
would you say that enthalpy is

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:26.540
the key to spontaneity?

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:27.930
STUDENT: No.

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:30.180
PROFESSOR: No, it's definitely
not the key to spontaneity.

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:33.770
It tends to correlate in many
cases at room temperature, but

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:36.530
it is not the key
to spontaneity.

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:39.580
And the key to spontaneity is
instead something called Gibbs

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:43.760
free energy or delta g.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.720
And if we think about what delta
g is, we can relate it

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.980
to enthalpy, and this will sort
of show us why there's

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:52.220
often this correlation, because
delta g is equal delta

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:57.250
h minus this term here, which
is temperature, and that's

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:59.810
temperature times a
change in entropy.

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:03.920
And we'll talk very in-depth
in just a few minutes about

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.570
what entropy actually is, but
for now I just want you to

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:09.780
think about the fact that in
addition to thinking about

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.590
enthalpy there's this
other term here

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:13.090
that comes into play.

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:16.820
So when we're talking about what
the sign about delta g is

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:19.960
or free energy is, some of you
might already be familiar with

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.730
this, when we're talking about
a negative delta g, is this

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:27.570
spontaneous or non-spontaneous.

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:30.740
So, maybe not so familiar,
which is totally fine.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.570
So in terms of thinking about
a negative delta g, that's

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:35.840
going to be a spontaneous
process.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.940
Any time you see a negative free
energy, which just like

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:40.800
when we talk about entropy, it's
a similar idea, it means

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:44.730
that free energy is released
as the reaction progresses.

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:47.360
That's going to be a spontaneous
process.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.140
So that means that if delta g
is greater than zero, then

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:53.560
what we're going to see a
non-spontaneous process.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.900
And finally in the case where
delta g is equal to zero, at

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.050
this point we're at equilibrium,
which basically

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:01.870
means that there's no net change
in either the forward

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:05.500
or the reverse reaction in
terms of thinking about

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.300
whether something's
spontaneous or not

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.430
spontaneous, it's just
at equilibrium

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:11.470
we see no net change.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:14.020
And something I want to point
out is that this reaction is

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:16.290
valid only when where at
constant temperature and

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:20.020
pressure, which we will be
throughout the discussions in

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.650
this class in terms of
using this equation.

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:25.510
And also, it turns out that
when you do most chemical

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:28.940
equations, you are, in fact,
at a pretty constant

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.860
temperature, and a constant
pressure in terms of most

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:34.180
things are done in the open
atmosphere, so that's really

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.150
not going to change.

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:39.320
All right, so let's just talk
very briefly about why it is

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:42.480
that free energy is what
determines spontaneity, and

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.350
not this enthalpy here,
not what the

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:45.920
change in enthalpy is.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.600
And it really comes in terms
remembering it in terms of the

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.200
definition.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.310
When we think about delta g,
what that is is that it's

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:55.840
energy that's released or used
in the reaction, but if it is

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.430
released, that it can directly
be used to do work.

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:00.130
It's what we call free
energy -- it's

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:01.920
free to do other things.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:04.680
Whereas when we were talking
about enthalpy here, well,

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.300
this is the amount of heat
that's released when we break

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.390
and form the bonds
in the reaction.

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:12.840
But some of it actually gets
stuck in the molecules, and

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.240
this is just a way to think
about it, this term here is

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.580
one way we can think about it,
it's just some energy that's

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:18.660
getting stuck.

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:21.370
So, for example, molecules,
which we don't really go into

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:23.990
in this class, have vibrational
movements, they

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:26.740
have rotational movements,
there's energy associated with

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:30.600
that that can sort of get stuck,
as we could say, some

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.490
of the enthalpy that's released
in terms of forming

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:35.510
and breaking the bonds
in a reaction.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:38.170
So that's our case where we
could see that we have a

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:40.820
negative delta h, but we
still end up with a

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:42.350
positive delta g.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:45.150
And again, I haven't really gone
into what entropy is here

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:49.350
yet, and we will just
in a few minutes.

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:52.180
But first, I want to take a look
at one of the examples

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:55.050
that we talked about, which is
the conversion of ammonium

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:58.900
nitrate when its solvated,
breaking up into its ions.

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:02.410
So what I had told you is
that, in fact, this is a

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:06.340
positive delta h, but still
that the reaction is

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:07.080
spontaneous.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.610
So let's just do this
calculation and see if we can

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:13.410
confirm that in terms
of delta g.

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:16.660
So the reaction again that we're
going to use is delta g

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:19.980
equals delta h minus
t delta s.

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:25.570
So if we're talking about room
temperature here, so we're

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:29.970
going to say that delta g in
this case is going to be equal

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:37.230
to 28 kilojoules per mole,
minus -- we're at room

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:40.900
temperature or 298 kelvin -- in
this reaction, you always

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.940
put temperature into kelvin.

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:46.120
And then we need to multiply
it by the entropy, which is

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.760
109 joules per kelvin mole.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.040
I want to point out that entropy
tends to be a much

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:54.360
smaller value than enthalpy,
so it's reported in joules

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.100
instead of kilojoules.

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.220
When you solve these problems,
it's really important to

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:01.300
convert it into kilojoules so
that your units work out and

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.150
you don't get a completely
crazy answer.

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:06.080
So we want to convert
this to 0 .

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:12.860
109 kilojoules per
kelvin mole.

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:15.770
So we can just re-write this,
so we have 28 kilojoules per

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:19.850
mole, then this term
here will be 32 .

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:21.920
5 kilojoules per mole.

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:26.460
So what we end up with our delta
g for this reaction is

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:30.570
going to be negative 4
kilojoules per mole.

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:38.930
All right, so talking about this
as a negative delta g,

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:40.760
would you say this is
a spontaneous or

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:43.410
non-spontaneous reaction.

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:44.650
Yeah, it's spontaneous.

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:48.390
So what we're going to see is
delta g is negative 4, so this

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:50.720
reaction is spontaneous
even though our

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:54.320
enthalpy change was positive.

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.900
Let's take a look at one more
reaction since we spent so

00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:00.040
much time discussing the
oxidation of glucose.

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:03.050
So again, what we know about
this reaction, we've already

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:05.470
calculated the delta
h is negative 2816

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:07.660
kilojoules per mole.

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:09.820
And you could look up and
we'll figure out how to

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:13.650
calculate it soon, the change in
entropy, which is plus 233

00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:16.210
joules per k mole.

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:18.790
So before we actually do this
calculation, let's go to a

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:21.490
clicker question and I want
you to think about what's

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:23.800
happening here.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.040
So if you're thinking about the
oxidation of glucose and

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.890
what the sign is of the change
in enthalpy and the change in

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:32.700
entropy, which of these
statements is true.

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:35.660
Is it going to be spontaneous
at all temperatures,

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:38.390
non-spontaneous at all
temperatures, or will it

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:40.750
depend on the temperature
whether this reaction is

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:42.720
spontaneous or not
spontaneous?

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.590
So, remember this is our
relationship here.

00:29:45.590 --> 00:30:02.380
So let's go ahead and just take
10 seconds on this one.

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:06.220
OK, so we have a pretty
mixed response here.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.520
So this could have made or broke
the chances of your team

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.810
on the competition today, but
they'll be a few more left to

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:14.700
redeem yourselves if you
got it incorrect.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.490
So what we're going to find is
that it's spontaneous at all

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:20.440
temperatures, and we can
actually just look at this

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.560
equation here to figure
out why that is.

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.350
If our reaction is spontaneous,
that means that

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:28.500
delta g is negative.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:31.640
So in terms of delta h being
negative, well, that's going

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:34.010
to always contribute to delta
g being negative no matter

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:35.430
what the temperature is.

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:39.980
And if delta s is positive,
since it's minus t delta s,

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.840
and our temperature is always
positive because we're on the

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:46.900
kelvin scale, so it starts
at zero there, then this

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:49.930
component here is always going
to be negative as well.

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:52.780
So we're always going to have
two negative numbers so that

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:56.300
our combination, our delta g's
always going to be negative,

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:58.130
it's always going to
be spontaneous.

00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:01.200
All right, so let's make sure
that's what we do see when we

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:07.730
calculate this for the oxidation
of glucose here.

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:10.470
So if we do this and we plug
in our numbers, we see that

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:15.450
delta g is going to be equal
to negative 2816 times the

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:18.050
temperature, room temperature,
times again,

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:19.240
remember to put 0.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.080
233, because we need to
convert from joules to

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.720
kilojoules for our
entropy term.

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:28.310
So what we find out is that this
reaction has a delta g of

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:31.770
negative 2885 kilojoules
per mole.

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:33.700
This is a spontaneous
reaction.

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:37.860
All right, so let's get back
to that entropy term.

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:40.490
I introduced it without
explaining at all

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:41.960
what it really is.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.420
So let's take a few moments
and think about entropy.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:48.500
Entropy is actually a very easy
concept to think about,

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.180
it's a measure of disorder.

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.280
I think most of us have a very
good concept of how things

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:56.090
tend to go to disorder, so
it's something we can

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:59.320
conceptualize just in an
infinite number of ways.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.260
And entropy is simply
a measure of the

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.850
disorder of a system.

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:05.120
And when we're talking about
chemical reactions, what we're

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.620
talking about is a change
in entropy.

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:11.810
So whether, as a reaction goes
forward, are we becoming more

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:16.110
ordered or are we becoming
more disordered?

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:20.020
So just like we saw for
enthalpy, entropy also is a

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:23.270
state function, so it doesn't
matter in terms of path how we

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:25.260
got from point a to point b.

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:27.680
All we need to worry about is
the current state of our

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:31.000
system, what the current
entropy is and take the

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.350
difference.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:35.880
So, an example that I like to
use in terms of conceptually

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.940
thinking about what's going on
in terms of disorder, and

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:41.470
which is especially relevant
in New England is thinking

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:43.510
about stone wall.

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:46.880
So you can think about a stone
wall in terms of being very,

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:47.940
very ordered, right.

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:51.400
If you just built your stone
wall, every stone is in place,

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.530
it has a high degree of order.

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:56.710
So in other words, the
disorder is very low.

00:32:56.710 --> 00:33:01.140
So it has a low entropy, a
low level of disorder.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.950
But if we're looking at a New
England stone wall, which are

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:06.370
typically found if you're hiking
in the woods you see

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:10.100
ones that are just ancient and
are completely crumbling down,

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:12.620
you'll find that the stone wall
is no longer quite so

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.410
ordered as it was.

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:17.940
In fact, let's say there's a
few stones that have fallen

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:21.540
off, our disorder has increased,
so we end up

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:23.890
increasing the entropy.

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:26.365
And I do just want to point out
with this analogy that it

00:33:26.365 --> 00:33:27.690
is a state function.

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:31.300
So for thinking about the change
in entropy, which is

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:34.776
this distance right here, we
can either calculate it

00:33:34.776 --> 00:33:37.930
directly from here to here. but
it also doesn't matter,

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:40.420
let's say the wall crumbled down
completely and we ended

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:44.110
up having a very high degree of
disorder, if then someone

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:47.620
put most of the stones back in
place and we went back down to

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:50.290
this degree of disorder here,
it doesn't matter, it's a

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:54.020
state function, all we care
about is the actual difference

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:58.100
between our starting point
and our ending point.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.820
And I just can't resist putting
in a little quote,

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:03.845
"something there is that doesn't
love a wall." Does

00:34:03.845 --> 00:34:06.800
anybody know where this quote
is from -- very famous poem,

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:07.640
very famous poet.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:13.640
Good guesses, parents
can help with this.

00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.140
Yes, excellent.

00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:18.340
I've never heard the correct
answer this question before.

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:18.930
Excellent.

00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:21.520
So this is Robert Frost
in The Mending Wall.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:25.950
He talks about, it sounds like
a lot of you did know this,

00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:29.880
this makes me full of joy.
"Something there is that

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:33.050
doesn't love a wall," there's
many interpretations for this

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:35.050
poem, but maybe it's
about entropy.

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:38.980
Entropy doesn't love a wall,
we're going from order to

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:41.290
disorder, that wall wants
to come down.

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:44.520
All right.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:47.240
So let's formalize these
thoughts on entropy and in

00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:49.460
terms of what we're
talking about.

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:53.170
Again, what I said on that's
chart there is as we increase

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:55.770
entropy, we're increasing
disorder.

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:58.810
So if you saw a positive
change in entropy in a

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:02.590
reaction, would you think about
that as being more or

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:03.530
less ordered?

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:06.660
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:08.190
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so it's
actually going to be less

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:10.800
ordered, and, in fact, I should
stop saying order, I

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.310
should be just saying disorder
because disorder's actually

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:15.930
what we're measuring, and
there's an increase in

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:19.840
disorder here when we have a
positive change in enthalpy.

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:22.010
So if we have a negative change
in enthalpy, we're

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:26.980
going to see a decrease
in disorder.

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:30.620
So in terms of considering
different types of states that

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:33.780
we can be in, whether we're in
a gas state or a liquid state

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:37.020
or a solid state for any given
molecule or any given

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:41.070
compound, we can think about
how much order or disorder

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:44.710
these states have. So which of
these three states would you

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:46.540
call the most disordered?

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:48.060
STUDENT: Gas.

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:48.910
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's
the gas state.

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:51.940
So it turns out that the
disorder gas is greater than

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:54.240
liquid., which is greater
than solid.

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.960
This makes sense and the gas
molecules are free to bounce

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.610
around, go wherever they want.

00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:01.010
Once you're in a liquid, they
have a little bit more

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:02.990
limitation, they can't
go anywhere.

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:05.060
But the molecules can still
slide all around

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:06.210
and pass each other.

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:09.190
Once you're in a solid state,
this molecule is not going to

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:12.380
flip places with the other
molecules there.

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:16.660
It's going to be kind of stuck
in its place within the solid.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:20.770
So, just understanding this
explanation of entropy that

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:24.180
we're going to have an increase
in entropy if we have

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:27.370
an increase in disorder, allows
us to make predictions

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:30.690
about reactions even without
doing any calculations, and we

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:33.180
always like when that happens,
because then once we do

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:35.710
calculations, we can check our
calculations and make sure

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:38.440
they make sense with what
we would be predicting.

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.270
So before we talk about how to
actually do a calculation,

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:44.550
let's go to a clicker question
here and make sure everyone is

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:48.110
on the same page in terms of
thinking about changes in

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:52.060
entropy or changes or delta
s for the reaction.

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:56.190
So let's say we're talking about
the decomposition of

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:59.500
hydrogen peroxide into
water and oxygen.

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.600
I want you to tell me if you
think it's going to have a

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:06.470
positive delta s, a negative,
or zero, or maybe this will

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:08.120
change with temperature
as well.

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:12.660
All right, so let's go
ahead and take 10

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:25.580
seconds on this one.

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:26.640
OK, excellent.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.740
Great job with the
questions today.

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:33.090
So we are actually going to see
a positive delta s. this

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:36.230
should be very clear because
we're going from two moles of

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:40.726
liquid, to now having two moles
of liquid, plus a mole

00:37:40.726 --> 00:37:43.600
of gas, so we're going to be
increasing the disorder of our

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.480
system here.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:50.580
All right, so let's think about
how we actually can

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:51.960
calculate, though, delta s.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.420
So far I've just been giving
you the delta s's for the

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:57.270
reactions, but, as I'm sure you
can guess, you won't be

00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:59.540
given that information, for
example, on upcoming

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:02.650
problem-sets, you'll actually
need to calculate the entropy.

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:06.230
So what we can do is we can
actually calculate the entropy

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:10.930
of a reaction from absolute
entropies of individual

00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:13.530
molecules that we're
discussing.

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:17.060
So this is very similar to how
we calculated the enthalpy of

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:20.420
a reaction by taking the
change of enthalpy of

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:22.650
formation, except we don't even
have to worry about a

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:26.710
change in entropy because we can
talk about entropy as an

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:27.950
absolute value.

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:31.860
There's an absolute zero in
terms of entropy where there

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.490
is no disorder at all.

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:38.220
And this is described for any
molecule as being its perfect

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:41.170
crystal at absolute zero.

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:43.720
So this is what we're going to
say there's absolute complete

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:46.690
order, there's no disorder
at all in this system.

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:49.220
So what we can take to calculate
the entropy in a

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:52.800
reaction, is just to take the
sum of the entropy of all the

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.970
products, and subtract from that
the entropy from all of

00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:59.000
the reactants.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.110
So let's try this for the
example that you just did on

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:05.000
the clicker question, and make
sure that our calculation

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.720
matches up with our
prediction here.

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:11.600
So again, we're just going to
take the sum of the entropy of

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:15.100
the products minus out
of the reactants.

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:17.340
So if we talk about this,
we're starting with our

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:20.710
product, so our first
product is water.

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:22.830
And what I want to point out is
you need to make sure you

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:26.120
multiply this by 2, because, in
fact, we have two moles of

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.550
water that are formed here.

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:31.980
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:33.580
PROFESSOR: OK, I'm so sorry.

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:37.230
Yeah, so yikes, this
should be water.

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:43.630
You know what, let's just
write this on the board.

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:49.270
So we're going to talk about
delta s of the reaction.

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:53.630
So that's to be sum of the
entropy of the products.

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:57.500
So we're going to be talking
about 2 times entropy of

00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:07.190
water, and we'll add to that
our other product, which is

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:12.180
molecular oxygen here, and we
don't need to put a number out

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:14.480
here because it's
just one mole.

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:19.190
So that's of o 2, and we'll
subtract from that, the

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:24.790
entropy of hydrogen
peroxide here.

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:27.010
And do we need to put anything
out here for this?

00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:28.260
STUDENT: 2.

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:30.590
PROFESSOR: So, yeah, because
there's two moles there.

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:35.610
So water plus oxygen minus
hydrogen peroxide.

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:46.170
Let's hope I at least got
the values right.

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:48.300
Yeah, and actually I think this
is right, I believe this

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:49.460
is the entropy of water.

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:52.920
So OK, so the actual numbers
are right here for what is

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:56.700
written on the board and
hopefully in your notes.

00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:00.610
So what we find out is that the
entropy of this reaction

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:04.090
here, the change in entropy, the
delta s, is 125 joules per

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:05.450
k per mole.

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:11.340
All right, so we can also --
well, first, we already

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:13.870
thought about why delta
s is positive.

00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:17.390
Delta s is positive because
we're going from a liquid to a

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:20.270
liquid and a gas -- we're
increasing our disorder.

00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:24.590
So let's think about whether
this reaction is spontaneous

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:27.280
or not, and to do that, we
actually need to go ahead and

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.720
completely calculate delta g.

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:33.900
So to do this, we can take our
values here, and delta g is

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:37.980
equal to delta h minus
t delta s.

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:42.190
So if we plug all of this in,
we have our delta h is

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:46.250
negative 196 kilojoules per
mole, minus our temperature,

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:48.430
and I wanted you to write this
again, because I want to make

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:51.350
sure you get in the habit of
converting our joules to

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:51.570
kilojoules.

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:52.930
It's 0 .

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:57.120
125 kilojoules per
kelvin mole.

00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:00.570
So we end up with a delta
g of negative 233

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:02.440
kilojoules per mole.

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:03.640
Is that spontaneous or
non-spontaneous?

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.980
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:06.860
PROFESSOR: Great.

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:09.240
So the reaction here
is spontaneous.

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:11.200
So actually, this is probably
a reaction that you're

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:14.280
familiar with because a lot of
us do have hydrogen peroxide

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:16.000
just in our medicine cabinet.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.960
And if you go and look at the
expiration date on your

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.870
hydrogen peroxide, you
will see that it

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:22.710
does, in fact, expire.

00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:25.900
And you might think oh no, what
happens when it expires,

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:27.030
when it goes bad?

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:30.560
All that's happening is it's
turning into water.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.700
So I wouldn't drink it after
its expiration date, but

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:35.550
probably there's more
water than hydrogen

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:37.450
peroxide at that point.

00:42:37.450 --> 00:42:40.030
But it also actually brings out
a really important point

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:41.740
about thermodynamics, which is
that thermodynamics, in fact,

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:46.480
tells us if a reaction happening
in the forward

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.250
direction is spontaneous
or non-spontaneous.

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:51.530
So, for example, we see
that yes, it is

00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:53.320
a spontaneous reaction.

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:55.350
But you'll note that
thermodynamics tells us

00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:58.820
absolutely nothing about the
timeframe of that reaction.

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:02.160
So some reactions that are
spontaneous take place in a

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.870
matter of seconds or
microseconds or less.

00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:08.110
Other reactions, such as this,
to have an appreciable amount

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:11.220
of that reaction go forward,
it actually takes years.

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:13.590
You'll notice that it's not
just one day before that

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:15.480
hydrogen peroxide expires.

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:18.290
It's takes a really long time to
get a significant amount of

00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:19.850
this reaction to go.

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:23.250
So just make sure, we will get
to talking about kinetics,

00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:24.510
which does tell us about the

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:26.680
timeframe of chemical reactions.

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.810
But don't confuse
thermochemistry or

00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:30.770
thermodynamics with kinetics.

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:34.370
It doesn't matter how huge our
delta g is in terms of being

00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:37.280
if it's negative two or if it's
negative two million,

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.070
that still doesn't tell
us how fast the

00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:40.210
reaction's going to go.

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:42.520
All right.

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:45.690
So let's think about one more
example here in terms of

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:47.110
thinking about entropy.

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:50.050
So another example we talked
about was the melting of ice

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:51.440
at room temperature.

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:55.330
I think all of us agree that
this is spontaneous, but that

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:58.490
the enthalpy change
is positive, it's

00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:01.670
an endothermic reaction.

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:07.350
So we can think about
calculating the entropy here,

00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:11.080
and I'm happy to see that I did,
in fact, put the products

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:15.780
h 2 o here as a liquid,
subtracting the reactant,

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:19.010
which is h 2 o as a solid.

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:22.480
If we go ahead and plug in those
values here, what we end

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:26.530
up with is a delta s of
this reaction of 28 .

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:28.120
59 joules.

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:31.020
This makes sense because we're
increasing the disorder of the

00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:37.110
system, we're seeing a positive
delta s here.

00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:38.880
And I just answered that
question for you.

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:42.010
We're going why is
delta s positive?

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:43.820
We're going from a
solid to liquid,

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:46.570
we're increasing disorder.

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:50.250
So, we can calculate delta g as
well, and if we do this we

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:51.810
plug in these numbers here.

00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:55.260
What we end up with is that
delta g equals negative 1 .

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.710
57 kilojoules per mole.

00:44:57.710 --> 00:45:01.150
So it is spontaneous, delta
g is just barely negative.

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:04.330
And what actually is the case,
which we'll talk about more on

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:07.040
Monday and thinking more and
more about how temperature

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.570
actually affects these
reactions, but what we know

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:12.270
about melting of ice is that
it is, in fact, temperature

00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:13.160
dependent, right.

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:16.000
Ice doesn't melt at just
any old temperature.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.820
So that's where temperature
actually comes into play here.

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:21.350
All right.

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:24.020
So we have a case --
spontaneous, even though delta

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:24.990
h is positive.

00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:27.920
All right, so let's think also
about how we can go about

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:30.560
calculating the free energy
of formation.

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:34.170
So we know that we can use the
equation that we saw in terms

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:36.760
of the free energy the reaction,
but what if we're

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:39.510
actually thinking about the free
energy of the formation

00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:41.210
of a particular molecule?

00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:43.830
So that's actually completely
analogous to thinking about

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:47.860
the enthalpy of formation, or
it's basically the standard

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:49.370
Gibbs free energy
of formation.

00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:52.780
So this is talking about forming
a mole of a compound

00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:55.500
from its most stable elements,
from its elements in their

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:59.140
most stable states at pressure
of one bar and at room

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:01.400
temperature.

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.930
So we know that we can tabulate
it must like we

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:07.790
tabulated delta h formation,
but we can also tabulate it

00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:10.690
from this reaction here, which
it looks like I already told

00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:13.420
you this reaction, which I did
but I told you a more general

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:16.850
form, which was for the free
energy of a reaction.

00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:19.180
This is the free energy of
a reaction, which is the

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:22.350
formation of a certain compound,
and this is the free

00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:25.790
energy of formation equals
the enthalpy of formation

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:29.040
minus t delta s.

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:33.620
So let's think about why it is
important to be thinking about

00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:37.240
these changes of free energy
in terms of forming a

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:40.580
molecule, and it's important
because the delta g

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:43.680
information is actually a
measure of how stable or

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:48.120
unstable a molecule is relative
to its element.

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:51.670
So, for example, if something
is really stable relative to

00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:55.025
its elements, we can think
about whether delta g of

00:46:55.025 --> 00:46:56.770
formation should be negative
or positive.

00:46:56.770 --> 00:46:59.820
So let's have you do one last
clicker question here, and

00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:03.470
tell me what do you think, if
delta g of formation, of

00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:06.990
actually forming a molecule is
going to be negative, would

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:11.330
you say that the compound is
going to be stable or unstable

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:14.150
relative to the elements that
that compound is made up of?

00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:37.830
All right, let's take
10 seconds on this.

00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:38.990
OK, interesting.

00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:40.850
So this is going to be another
tie breaker for us.

00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:46.040
So let's go back to the notes
and think about this.

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:50.100
So it turns out that it's going
to be stable, relative

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:54.440
to its -- the compound
is stable

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:55.810
relative to its elements.

00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:58.960
And the reason for this is if
you think of the reaction of

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:03.440
the elements forming the
compound, if the delta g of

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:06.030
that reaction is negative,
that means it's going to

00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:08.440
spontaneously form
the compound.

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:11.730
It's going to go -- release
energy when it actually forms

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:12.930
that compound.

00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:15.340
So that's another way of telling
us that the compound

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:17.990
is more stable than
its elements.

00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:22.270
So conversely, if we have delta
g of formation being

00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:25.560
greater than zero, so delta g
of formation is just delta g

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:29.170
of the reaction where the
compound is formed, then what

00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:31.770
we find is that it's
thermodynamically unstable

00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:34.680
relative to its elements,
because instead of releasing

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.110
energy in that reaction, you
actually have to put energy

00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:40.200
into that reaction in order
to make it happen.

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:43.180
So, delta g of formation can
give us an indication of

00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:46.680
whether we have a stable or
an unstable compound.
