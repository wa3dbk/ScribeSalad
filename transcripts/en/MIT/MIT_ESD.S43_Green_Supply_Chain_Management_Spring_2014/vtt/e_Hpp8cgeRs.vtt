00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.450
PROFESSOR: OK, great.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.890
So I think it's about
time to get started.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.940
So good afternoon.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.103
So let me see.

00:00:35.103 --> 00:00:37.477
So what do you think about
[? Genco? ?] [? Or Genco, ?] I

00:00:37.477 --> 00:00:37.977
guess.

00:00:37.977 --> 00:00:40.490
[? Genco ?] [? Genco? ?]
You never know.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.360
It was a good talk.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.354
I enjoyed it.

00:00:42.354 --> 00:00:43.940
Did you enjoy it?

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.300
Yeah, it was interesting.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.130
So let's talk about the-- just
to kind of refresh your memory.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.590
And then we move
into the two more

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.840
things I want to cover today.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.660
We want to cover the
willful case study-- kind of

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.310
to close this notion
of reverse logistics

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.600
and closed-loop supply
chains a little bit.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.580
But before we start, we read
quickly a study of ReCellular

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.720
that was really try to connect
with some of the things that we

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.730
heard from [? Genco-- ?]
[? Genco? ?] Genco.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.960
And I wanted to know-- I read
the responses, the homework,

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.460
and you were split.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.410
So some of you did think
that ReCellular had a future,

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.060
and others thought that
they were beginning

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.800
to disappear as a company.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.170
So who wants to be the
voice of ReCellular-- well,

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.980
before we start, well, since
this is your first time I see

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.230
you here-- you were traveling.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.310
So do you remember what
is the basic business

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.390
model of ReCellular?

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.990
AUDIENCE:Yeah, I do. [INAUDIBLE]
I was one of the guys for it,

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.820
actually.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.153
PROFESSOR: Well, it's all great.

00:01:50.153 --> 00:01:53.500
So why don't you give us a quick
recap of what ReCellular does?

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.995
Just in 10 minutes or less.

00:01:54.995 --> 00:01:55.913
AUDIENCE: They are-- [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:55.913 --> 00:01:56.620
PROFESSOR: A couple minutes, OK?

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.911
AUDIENCE: --cellphones and
repurposing them and selling

00:01:58.911 --> 00:02:00.960
them to other markets--
markets that, you know,

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.600
may think those cell--
give us certain value

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.090
for those secondhand cellphones.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.910
And they get them
from various sources,

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.260
including the donation bin
type sources as well as

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.052
some higher quality sources.

00:02:17.052 --> 00:02:17.760
PROFESSOR: Great.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.450
So who else was in favor, or
thought that the ReCellular

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.000
model had some future?

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.150
Four?

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.656
So who wants to--
[? Marianna? ?]

00:02:28.656 --> 00:02:29.890
Do you want to try to do it?

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:30.515
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:02:30.515 --> 00:02:32.601
PROFESSOR: Give your pitch.

00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:34.733
AUDIENCE: Well, my
[INAUDIBLE] I think

00:02:34.733 --> 00:02:37.460
they have a future
because people

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.042
who always consume cellphones.

00:02:39.042 --> 00:02:40.625
They might evolve
into something else,

00:02:40.625 --> 00:02:44.270
like we have seen it [INAUDIBLE]
composites or something.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.689
But that same instrument
to talk and surf the web,

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:49.730
and what we're doing now
with phones will evolve,

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.709
and they can tap
into that industry.

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.000
It might not be cellphones,
but it will something else.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.525
And they can tap into
that and reach-- as long

00:02:56.525 --> 00:02:57.865
as they keep up with it.

00:02:57.865 --> 00:03:00.550
Which I think by them
going to the e-commerce

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.326
gives them a good
sign that management

00:03:02.326 --> 00:03:04.512
is doing a good job of
keeping up with technology

00:03:04.512 --> 00:03:06.370
and making it,
keeping it global.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.659
So I think that's why
I see a good future.

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.450
PROFESSOR: What do you
think is the biggest

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.461
bottleneck of ReCellular?

00:03:13.461 --> 00:03:15.960
AUDIENCE: The fast evolution
of equipment, of the technology

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.100
is a thing.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.836
The other one is as they
say the standards are not

00:03:19.836 --> 00:03:21.440
the same in all countries.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.880
However, the fact that
they have different markets

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.796
in each country also
works in their advantage.

00:03:25.796 --> 00:03:28.380
For example, in
Latin America, you

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.142
get equipment that
is refurbished,

00:03:30.142 --> 00:03:32.026
and it, you don't, doesn't care.

00:03:32.026 --> 00:03:33.439
You have the technology in hand.

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:36.265
And I'm sure it's the same
in developing countries.

00:03:36.265 --> 00:03:39.106
And I see that as working
to their advantage,

00:03:39.106 --> 00:03:39.930
as well, for that.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:40.805
PROFESSOR: OK, great.

00:03:40.805 --> 00:03:44.845
So someone that doesn't think
ReCellular has a chance?

00:03:44.845 --> 00:03:47.220
AUDIENCE:I guess they've got
their current business model

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.197
getting donated cellphones
just wasn't viable because, you

00:03:50.197 --> 00:03:51.780
know, there was a
time when, you know,

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.770
people usually got their
cellphone for free.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.355
And then after two years ago,
they got another one for free,

00:03:56.355 --> 00:03:56.830
and they said, OK.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:57.770
I don't need this anymore.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:58.930
And they throw it
in the donation bin.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.190
But now people pay lot of
money for their cellphone.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.096
And they want some
of that value back,

00:04:03.096 --> 00:04:04.720
or they still see
the value at the end,

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.610
so they have to shift their
model where maybe they're

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.550
actually paying you
at this kind of rate

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:09.840
for someone's old cellphone.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.832
Which you see now,
like [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:11.832 --> 00:04:13.188
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:04:13.188 --> 00:04:17.390
We cannot hear anything
at all from here.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.910
You can hear me,
but nobody else.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.550
So Michael can you
help us with the mics?

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.884
I'll try to repeat in a sec,
but keep going then please.

00:04:29.884 --> 00:04:31.425
AUDIENCE: At
[? least ?] I think they

00:04:31.425 --> 00:04:33.526
have to shift towards
basically purchasing

00:04:33.526 --> 00:04:35.400
these phones from people,
not relying so much

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.050
off of third-party collectors
if they want remain viable.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.800
PROFESSOR: So your main concern
is that the shifting business

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.785
model of cellphones
or electronics

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:47.757
is you're paying for
them, that you don't

00:04:47.757 --> 00:04:48.840
want to donate it anymore.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.756
And that's kind of the
main way how ReCellular

00:04:50.756 --> 00:04:53.740
is trying to make money
is by getting them donated

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.010
and trying to make money
out of that donation.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.830
So basically you're
arguing that there may not

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.847
be enough residual
value to buy a phone,

00:05:02.847 --> 00:05:04.930
because they could pay a
little bit for it, right?

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:05.790
And then they will--

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:06.480
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.230
AUDIENCE: Can't rely
so much as getting it

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:09.900
to the third-party collectors.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.320
PROFESSOR: But you
think they pay for it ,

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.670
will that make them viable?

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:15.410
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.993
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:05:15.993 --> 00:05:18.446
Somebody that's doesn't agree.

00:05:18.446 --> 00:05:21.770
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]
the point of-- I don't think

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.057
it'll, it'll--

00:05:23.057 --> 00:05:25.140
PROFESSOR: I'm checking
to see if they could hear.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.040
AUDIENCE: Can they?

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.456
PROFESSOR: Can you
hear right now,

00:05:27.456 --> 00:05:31.628
or the same as [? before? ?]
Can you hear better?

00:05:31.628 --> 00:05:33.044
AUDIENCE: Yes,
[? it is better. ?]

00:05:33.044 --> 00:05:33.627
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:05:33.627 --> 00:05:39.650
AUDIENCE: OK, so I think the
business model was more viable

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.000
the beginning where the
cellular industry was starting,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.570
and part of lifetime like
was [? say ?] much longer.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.730
But now you have new
models coming all the time,

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.200
and that significantly
decreases the price they

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.930
you can get for a
secondhand phone.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.156
So for example, previously
maybe you had, I don't know,

00:06:01.156 --> 00:06:03.510
50 models of cellphones
come out in a year,

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.710
and now you might have 200.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:05.300
I don't know.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.600
I'm making the numbers up, but
you do have much more offers

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.580
right now.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.880
So the price you can get is
pretty, I think it'll decline.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.590
And as a result, you'll
have less revenue,

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.793
so I don't think
that it's so viable.

00:06:22.793 --> 00:06:24.525
PROFESSOR: OK

00:06:24.525 --> 00:06:28.430
AUDIENCE: I think to add onto
the point, right now, I mean,

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.215
we're talking about
enough, almost like one

00:06:31.215 --> 00:06:34.020
to one ratio of cellphones
and people on Earth.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.190
So we're talking about
large manufacturing volumes,

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.800
which means that the cost,
the price has also decreased.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.020
So that would decrease
the attractiveness

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.390
of secondhand phones.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.944
And also, I mean,
that differential

00:06:44.944 --> 00:06:47.110
that ReCellular is trying
to play on-- how much they

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.901
buy the phones as
compared to how much they

00:06:48.901 --> 00:06:50.009
can sell the phones.

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:51.550
PROFESSOR: So it is
shrinking margins

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.150
that you think are
going to be a problem.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.320
So you want to go back and
say why ReCellular can still

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.820
make money.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.161
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:06:57.161 --> 00:07:00.023
And I mean like a good
point that was raised,

00:07:00.023 --> 00:07:02.910
I think one first
thing about prices--

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.385
I don't think that
the price going down

00:07:05.385 --> 00:07:07.860
is bad from the
customer's perspective.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.890
And what I used is
technology lifecycle model.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.942
So there is a lot of innovation.

00:07:13.942 --> 00:07:16.170
And there are early adopters
in the early majority,

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:18.215
but there are also
laggards and people

00:07:18.215 --> 00:07:21.050
who are not adopting
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.350
and who are just really happy
to have really low-priced phone

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.920
because they value
more the price rather

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.240
than the technology.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.090
And so there's at least one
third or more of the market

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:34.910
that is actually asking
for the secondary phones

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.180
because they don't value
as much the technology.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.135
And they have just more
choice because a lot

00:07:40.135 --> 00:07:41.920
of different phones
actually that

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.620
are being put on the market.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.800
[INAUDIBLE] so those people
have actually larger choice

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.902
for like a lower price.

00:07:50.902 --> 00:07:54.070
And from a customer perspective
and from a demand standpoint,

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.010
I think this is a good thing.

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.345
And so the business
model might have

00:07:59.345 --> 00:08:02.100
to change a little bit because
they will have more margins

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.620
or so, but they have demand.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.400
So they do the right
adjustments [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.730
and they have
quality [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:14.650
that quality of phone offered.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.800
I think that is really
a way to make their way

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.930
through the secondary market.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.440
PROFESSOR: So the
argument here is

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.610
that even though the margin
could shrink over time,

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:24.910
there's always an adoption
of any technology.

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.547
There's always laggards.

00:08:26.547 --> 00:08:28.130
So there's always a
market, basically.

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:28.630
Yeah?

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.670
The question is,
well, you probably

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:34.520
have to be more efficient
or-- so part of the argument

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.115
is they are the first.

00:08:36.115 --> 00:08:38.490
If you are among the first,
you could probably get scale,

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:39.823
and you can be more competitive.

00:08:39.823 --> 00:08:40.672
I don't know.

00:08:40.672 --> 00:08:42.350
AUDIENCE: Part of my
reason for thinking

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:43.980
they're not going
to last is that they

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.370
do one and only one thing.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.460
And we find all the time that
companies who do one thing

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.140
don't survive when
the next disruptive

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.384
technology comes along.

00:08:52.384 --> 00:08:53.800
I guess what I'm
saying I disagree

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.091
with the fundamental assumption
that people will always

00:08:56.091 --> 00:08:57.030
have cellphones.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.690
That's what we
said about horses.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:00.330
That's what we said
about newspapers.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.214
Things go away

00:09:02.214 --> 00:09:03.880
AUDIENCE: I said that
they would evolve.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.546
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:09:04.546 --> 00:09:06.710
So maybe There is
the electronics

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:09.350
so they need to add
something else, yeah?

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:14.652
AUDIENCE: And also [INAUDIBLE]
emerging countries.

00:09:14.652 --> 00:09:19.480
The cellphones [INAUDIBLE]
large market to penetrate.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.260
And we can see that
with mobile payment.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.670
People are just buying
phones when there's really

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:27.468
accessing ways to pay for
those phones because it's also

00:09:27.468 --> 00:09:28.836
[INAUDIBLE].

00:09:28.836 --> 00:09:32.827
So even if we at some
point in the future

00:09:32.827 --> 00:09:38.040
don't have phones anymore,
they can still in the meantime

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.175
sell to other people.

00:09:39.175 --> 00:09:42.000
And what I think is
that they can adapt.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.497
And if they, if we don't
have phones at some point,

00:09:44.497 --> 00:09:45.955
and we have something
else, then we

00:09:45.955 --> 00:09:50.155
can sell [INAUDIBLE] something
else to people afterwards.

00:09:50.155 --> 00:09:51.967
So this [? big timeline ?]
still goes on.

00:09:51.967 --> 00:09:52.550
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:56.200
So let's say I just check with
our friends from Zaragoza.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.225
Do you hear any of
that discussion?

00:09:59.225 --> 00:09:59.850
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:03.097
We heard part of it, so--

00:10:03.097 --> 00:10:03.680
PROFESSOR: OK?

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.390
AUDIENCE: It's OK.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:04.870
PROFESSOR: OK, good.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:05.953
Just want to double check.

00:10:05.953 --> 00:10:08.400
All right so here's
the challenge, right?

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:13.850
So we, I am hopeful that
ReCellular can survive,

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.240
or one way or the other.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.680
But the question is what
happens when ReCellular does not

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.320
survive?

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.090
There's not a
business to be made.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.540
So, what will happen
with those phones?

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.040
AUDIENCE:
[? Genco will ?] get them.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:27.720
PROFESSOR:
[? Genco will ?] get them.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.940
Yeah.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.610
So the we heard
that the difference

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:35.360
is ReCellular is a specialized,
very niche, reverse logistics

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.610
provider.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:39.160
Genco is completely diversified.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.820
So they take anything
that their are

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.760
customers want-- in this case,
the customers is the retailers.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.190
The customers is the
[? rest. ?] So I think that is,

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:50.300
what many of you pointed out,
one of the big differences is

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.550
Genco's with its [? moral ?] is
more towards partnership with

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.820
the retailers.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.070
Really, that's their customer.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.540
ReCellular, on the
other hand, wants

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:02.550
to go to the end customer.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.800
They want to get us more
engaged one way or the other.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.400
Of course, most of their
purchases come from dealers.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.370
So they have another option.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:13.330
And they try to go to
end consumers to try

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:14.660
to penetrate the market more.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:18.320
But it's a challenging
environment.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.670
Which gets us to Whirlpool.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:23.100
Whirlpool, Whirlpool, Whirlpool.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.470
So what do we do with Whirlpool?

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.160
So the way I would like to
start-- any other comments?

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.420
I cannot, not sure if they're
going to survive or not.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:32.110
But--

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:35.064
AUDIENCE: Every time a fly to
Brazil, I can pay for my ticket

00:11:35.064 --> 00:11:37.022
by reselling the cellphone
that's in my pocket.

00:11:37.022 --> 00:11:38.955
There's definitely a
future for ReCellular.

00:11:38.955 --> 00:11:42.010
PROFESSOR: There's-- hopefully
there's enough market.

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:45.446
And I believe there's enough,
but there's lots of pressures.

00:11:45.446 --> 00:11:46.820
To be honest, I
[? see ?] becomes

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.431
the margins lower and lower.

00:11:48.431 --> 00:11:49.236
Who knows.

00:11:49.236 --> 00:11:50.235
AUDIENCE: I was curious.

00:11:50.235 --> 00:11:52.740
I didn't see exactly
when that was published.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:53.630
Oh.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.605
This case was five
years ago, or so?

00:11:56.605 --> 00:11:57.730
So it's a little bit older.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:59.660
So ReCellular is still around.

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:04.080
I don't know how good are they
right now-- thriving or not.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:04.660
OK, good.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.990
So let's go to Whirlpool.

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.570
Unless there's any other
closing comments or questions

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.940
about ReCellular or Genco?

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.880
Zaragoza, any
comments or questions?

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:15.700
Final thoughts?

00:12:18.809 --> 00:12:19.308
No?

00:12:19.308 --> 00:12:19.760
AUDIENCE: No.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:20.240
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:20.765
Remember wave--

00:12:20.765 --> 00:12:21.473
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:12:21.473 --> 00:12:22.520
PROFESSOR: --the hands.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.110
Otherwise, I cannot see you.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:25.060
All right.

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.210
So let's go to Whirlpool.

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:29.060
And to do Whirlpool,
we're going to spend

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.020
a little bit more time on it.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:36.550
And what we will start with
is who wants to tell me

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:40.140
what should Whirlpool do?

00:12:42.547 --> 00:12:44.380
So what, which are the
choices of Whirlpool?

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:45.255
Let's start with you.

00:12:45.255 --> 00:12:48.620
AUDIENCE: So the choices are
to go with the IFO model--

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.297
PROFESSOR: Can you
explain what IFO is?

00:12:50.297 --> 00:12:50.797
Quickly?

00:12:50.797 --> 00:12:54.773
AUDIENCE: So the IFO is an
industry-funded organization

00:12:54.773 --> 00:12:58.220
in which-- it's from
what I understand,

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.905
it's kind of like a third
party that kind of collects--

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:03.030
you know, it's owned by
all these industry players,

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:06.064
and they collect the
appliances, and then [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:06.064 --> 00:13:07.350
with the public.

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.520
PROFESSOR: So if we're
pulling at words-- Genco,

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.790
but funded by a bunch of
[? same ?] the suplex.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:14.930
And they all pay Genco,
and Genco does it.

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:15.860
Pretty much.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.720
AUDIENCE: Another
way, a second method

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.872
is for Whirlpool to
be an IFO on it's own,

00:13:21.872 --> 00:13:24.324
or to run a closed-loop system.

00:13:24.324 --> 00:13:27.270
And collect their own
appliances at the end of life.

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:33.340
PROFESSOR: Closed-loop
system-- so in this context,

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.050
we probably have not defined
closed-loop properly.

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:39.490
It's just the same company
that sells a product,

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:40.720
wants to get it back.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.790
And try to keep it within
your own system, as opposed

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:48.320
to getting somebody else to deal
with it and take care of it.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.224
And you want to somehow extract
value out of the process

00:13:51.224 --> 00:13:53.390
and bring those materials
back into your same supply

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.224
chain as best as possible.

00:13:55.224 --> 00:13:57.140
And that's why the option
and this closed-loop

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.984
is closed loop-- doing it alone.

00:14:00.984 --> 00:14:03.150
[? A little bit ?] alone,
at least it cannot, right?

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:06.190
Do it by why will they even--

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:07.670
AUDIENCE: There's
a third option--

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.880
PROFESSOR: Which is?

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.200
AUDIENCE: -which
is to do nothing.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:09.640
PROFESSOR: Ah.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.020
Third option.

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:10.520
Of course.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.454
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:14:12.454 --> 00:14:13.870
PROFESSOR: More
than do nothing Do

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:15.500
nothing is no longer an option.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.327
Do nothing was an option
maybe in 2005 for these guys.

00:14:18.327 --> 00:14:19.160
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:19.960
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I know.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:20.740
I know what you meant.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:21.320
Yeah.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:27.890
So third option is to
oppose the regulation.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:37.580
Oppose the regulation.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.037
So let me start doing with
a little show of hands.

00:14:40.037 --> 00:14:41.620
How many people think
that they should

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:45.800
go with the
industry-funded option?

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:50.446
Zaragoza one, two,
any one there?

00:14:50.446 --> 00:14:51.220
That's two people.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:51.950
AUDIENCE: Two and a half.

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:53.100
PROFESSOR: Two and a half?

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:53.969
No halves here.

00:14:53.969 --> 00:14:56.260
AUDIENCE: I'm doing, I'm
going with three and then one.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:56.843
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:14:56.843 --> 00:14:58.000
OK.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.620
So if it doesn't work?

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:00.120
OK.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.687
Two.

00:15:02.687 --> 00:15:04.395
How many would like
to oppose regulation?

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:10.140
One, two, three?

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.480
Look like there's three.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:19.430
So I take the rest of you would
like to do it on your own,

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:20.210
right?

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:22.625
So let's start with
the-- so you already

00:15:22.625 --> 00:15:25.360
spoke-- who else wants
to oppose regulation?

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.880
Why would you oppose regulation?

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.610
AUDIENCE: Well,
can I also qualify

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:33.074
to say if I had to be one
or two, I would pick two.

00:15:33.074 --> 00:15:33.740
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:37.350
AUDIENCE: But the idea
was that it's not really

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:39.490
be helpful because a
lot of this process

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:41.050
is self-sufficient
to begin with.

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:45.160
I think they said like 95%
of all of these products

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.956
go to the recycling process
and hardly any of it

00:15:48.956 --> 00:15:53.480
go to the landfill just because
there's a lot of commodities

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.530
that are in these
products like aluminum,

00:15:56.530 --> 00:16:00.420
or aluminium-- whatever--
copper, stuff like that.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:01.950
So all this stuff
gets reclaimed.

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:05.020
So you don't need to
do something that's

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.900
going to add a lot of overhead
to people's businesses

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.500
to have them do something that's
pretty much already happening

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:11.232
on its own.

00:16:11.232 --> 00:16:12.240
PROFESSOR: So it
happens on its own.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.120
What are the rates?

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.530
Someone remembers of recycling?

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:17.240
AUDIENCE: It's like 95% to 99%.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.820
That's pretty good, right?

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.700
AUDIENCE: Those were
Whirlpool's numbers.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.412
PROFESSOR: They're pretty
good, pretty consistent.

00:16:25.412 --> 00:16:26.120
Let's trust them.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:26.828
Let's trust them.

00:16:26.828 --> 00:16:28.050
These are factual numbers.

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:34.327
So 95% of it is kind of being
naturally repurposed, recycled

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:36.410
in some way or another
through our normal network.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:38.250
We're going back
to, we're discussing

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:42.030
all the different products--
cars and t-shirts.

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:43.230
Cars have a lot of value.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:44.720
Appliances have a lot of value.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.830
They're designed for a
very, very long time.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:48.930
So someone wants to
kind of move that chain

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:52.520
of how much value having the
latest model of refrigerator

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.290
or not.

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:55.900
And eventually when it goes
to the bottom of that chain,

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.440
that person also wants
to maybe make the effort

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.850
to try to get some value.

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:03.620
And a dealer gets it and
scraps it and divides it

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.994
into all the metals and
eventually gets done.

00:17:05.994 --> 00:17:08.410
AUDIENCE: I would argue it's
more of an effort for someone

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.542
not to recycle their
old washing machine,

00:17:10.542 --> 00:17:12.500
to like pick it up and
take it to the landfill.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.440
It's not like you're
throwing away batteries.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.504
I mean, most people
get rid of their stuff

00:17:16.504 --> 00:17:18.420
by putting it outside
in front of their house,

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:19.671
and then someone picks it up.

00:17:19.671 --> 00:17:21.579
So if the process already works?

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:24.640
Like those 5% who aren't
recycling it, or whatever,

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.140
they're probably not going to
just because Whirlpool came up

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:28.223
with a closed-loop system.

00:17:28.223 --> 00:17:29.820
So it's really not
going to add any--

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.819
PROFESSOR: So those 5%
have their own landfills.

00:17:31.819 --> 00:17:33.120
They will still trash it, yeah?

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:33.995
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:33.995 --> 00:17:36.000
PROFESSOR: OK. they'll
leave it there hanging.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.208
Those are the ones that are
not accounted for, right?

00:17:38.208 --> 00:17:40.709
Those are the ones that
are still your houses,

00:17:40.709 --> 00:17:41.500
landfill somewhere.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.000
OK, good.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.031
So what is-- yeah?

00:17:43.031 --> 00:17:44.655
You want to add
something else on the--

00:17:44.655 --> 00:17:44.800
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.960
I just want to
[? comment made ?] I think that

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.566
the problem with that even
though it seems to be working,

00:17:48.566 --> 00:17:51.744
[? it's like ?] perpetuates a
mentality that I can just put

00:17:51.744 --> 00:17:54.923
something out on my,
you know, on my driveway

00:17:54.923 --> 00:17:57.368
or on the sidewalk and someone
else will take care of it.

00:17:57.368 --> 00:18:02.280
And I think that's a big issue
in the US at least [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.625
PROFESSOR: So this
is the working part

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:06.120
is that it naturally
the market is.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:11.140
But there's something about the
overall social norms changes

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.404
that you would like to maybe to?

00:18:13.404 --> 00:18:14.820
So this is part
of a trend, right?

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:15.750
So this is Canada, right?

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.310
We're not talking
about the US here.

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:19.494
It's Canada so people
are very conscious.

00:18:19.494 --> 00:18:21.160
They're already doing
lots of recycling.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.191
There's lots of other
programs going on.

00:18:23.191 --> 00:18:23.690
Eh?

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:26.820
So this is natural progression.

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:30.830
But a couple of
people that maybe--

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:36.140
who thought that the one
regulation is still not enough.

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.330
So one reason is social.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:39.609
Which is the other reason?

00:18:39.609 --> 00:18:43.553
AUDIENCE: Well, I [INAUDIBLE]
prices of all the cohesion

00:18:43.553 --> 00:18:46.018
are pretty high, but what
happens if at some point

00:18:46.018 --> 00:18:49.469
the prices are not high enough
to give incentive to recycle?

00:18:49.469 --> 00:18:50.455
There's a second point.

00:18:50.455 --> 00:18:59.575
And also [INAUDIBLE] new
regulations [INAUDIBLE] There's

00:18:59.575 --> 00:19:00.810
an example about mercury.

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:02.740
They may need to
regulate mercury,

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:06.377
how we get that mercury.

00:19:06.377 --> 00:19:09.263
How will we show that all
the scavengers that deal

00:19:09.263 --> 00:19:12.870
with maybe some of the
material correctly so

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:14.520
the person [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.020
AUDIENCE: Refridgerant,
for example.

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:16.978
PROFESSOR: Refrigerant.

00:19:16.978 --> 00:19:19.030
So there's a couple
of things that we

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:21.660
know that they are recycled.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:26.110
We know that those materials
are being somehow repurposed--

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.980
a big chunk of them.

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:31.760
So the problem is that if
the prices change, boom.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.720
This market will collapse.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.361
Maybe there's
innovation in materials.

00:19:35.361 --> 00:19:36.860
And they come up
with a new material

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:38.600
that is an alloy-- plastic.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.550
Who knows-- that is
still as good performing

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:43.010
as the need for the
structure of the refrigerator

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:44.990
that is not as recyclable
or is very expensive.

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:46.780
And then you have
much [? our ?] waste.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:48.910
So there's a little bit
of an uncertainty factor.

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:52.060
Then clearly what
they're trying to get out

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.230
of it what is the
most value and what

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:55.410
they know how to deal with.

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:58.310
And mercury and refrigerants
are a little more tricky.

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:08.620
And it's unclear to know if
if they're doing properly.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.200
So there's a little bit
of a tricky part there.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.604
But there may be other
options of regulation

00:20:14.604 --> 00:20:15.520
instead of these ones.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.830
So this is the regulation
that what they are opposing

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:22.220
is the extended producers'
responsibility, the EPR

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:24.127
responsibility.

00:20:24.127 --> 00:20:25.710
That is Whirlpool
is to be responsible

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:26.870
over the whole thing.

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:28.940
But there are other
things that could do.

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:32.140
Adjust to tackle mercury and
refrigerant, for example.

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:35.869
What could they do if they
only want to fix that problem?

00:20:35.869 --> 00:20:38.160
Why would the government,
what could the government do?

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.880
Without doing this whole,
very complicated process?

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.905
AUDIENCE: It's what
they're doing to laptops.

00:20:42.905 --> 00:20:46.180
They just ban the product, or
ban the hazardous material.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.320
PROFESSOR: So some
pieces you can

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.621
ask manufacturers to phase
this out of their products

00:20:50.621 --> 00:20:51.370
altogether, right?

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:52.828
So you work with
the manufacturers,

00:20:52.828 --> 00:20:55.830
and you so some sort of
agreement, technology path.

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:58.090
And then eventually you
can get rid of that.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:59.130
That's one option.

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:01.760
Any other options?

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.970
Zaragoza, any other options?

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:11.240
They're silent today.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.760
AUDIENCE: We have
the mic off just

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.990
to make sure we don't have echo.

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:18.380
PROFESSOR: So any other options?

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:20.820
AUDIENCE: Guys?

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.895
PROFESSOR: No options.

00:21:22.895 --> 00:21:24.770
The other one is to try
these dealers, maybe,

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:26.936
right-- these current
recyclers and train them to do

00:21:26.936 --> 00:21:28.060
better mercury management?

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.060
You can do a whole program,
right, where you can

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.550
just instead of
involving everyone

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:34.610
you just go to the market
directly and do it.

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:37.770
Those are a few things you
could do instead of regulation.

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:40.940
But let's move to the
other two options.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:46.490
IFO versus closed loop--
who chose the IFO more?

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:52.780
So, well, no one in Zaragoza,
so maybe I'll give you a chance.

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:56.100
So why will the IFO model be
a good chance for Whirlpool?

00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:00.110
AUDIENCE: Well, I voted
for that because that

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:04.947
leaves time and flexibility
for the regulation to change.

00:22:04.947 --> 00:22:07.941
I said if you go with an
IFO, gives you more time

00:22:07.941 --> 00:22:11.933
to see how things
[? structure ?] really works,

00:22:11.933 --> 00:22:17.172
how they can look internally
to see how the closed loop can

00:22:17.172 --> 00:22:18.420
be designed [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:26.150
I thought more as a
temporary solution,

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:30.437
and then because it's way
more expensive, right?

00:22:30.437 --> 00:22:32.475
It would take three,
four times according

00:22:32.475 --> 00:22:35.300
to my garbage to go through.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:37.770
So I said do it for
a period of time,

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:40.110
and then once you
change the closed group,

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:43.452
you can pay back an actually
meet how the regulation would

00:22:43.452 --> 00:22:44.905
go [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:44.905 --> 00:22:46.780
PROFESSOR: So this is
like a good, safe place

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:47.840
to start the process.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:48.631
AUDIENCE: To start.

00:22:48.631 --> 00:22:51.110
And then move ahead
either regulation change

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:52.750
or the closed loop.

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:55.558
Turns out to be more
effective than expected.

00:22:55.558 --> 00:22:56.870
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:58.854
So what do you say about that?

00:22:58.854 --> 00:23:01.270
AUDIENCE: I haven't been because
I'm still not on Stellar.

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:02.660
PROFESSOR: Oh, you're
still not on Stellar.

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:03.680
AUDIENCE: My first class.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.060
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:04.360
OK.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:04.860
All right.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.530
So they--

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:09.020
AUDIENCE: I said that you
should go with a closed loop

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.985
because, I think,
assuming that you're

00:23:10.985 --> 00:23:13.100
going to have to
get there eventually

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.724
even though it's
more start-up costs.

00:23:15.724 --> 00:23:17.640
Putting the time in and
getting the jump on it

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:20.936
could make them
a leader in this.

00:23:20.936 --> 00:23:22.560
If they know they're
going to go there,

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.400
and they already have started
to make their machines more

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.868
[? grave, ?] then they
can stand to benefit

00:23:27.868 --> 00:23:32.688
from optimizing their processes
and manufacturing their system

00:23:32.688 --> 00:23:35.339
vice continuing
to pay for people

00:23:35.339 --> 00:23:42.592
who aren't as advanced as
they are with their recycling

00:23:42.592 --> 00:23:43.092
technology.

00:23:46.571 --> 00:23:51.560
AUDIENCE: Adding to that, you
also address customer loyalty.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:59.064
Not only are you there when
they start using [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:59.064 --> 00:24:03.510
actually have a lot of
impact in a future sense.

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:09.438
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] common
culture is very in-house

00:24:09.438 --> 00:24:13.884
[INAUDIBLE] doing their own
thing so I [? thought ?]

00:24:13.884 --> 00:24:21.294
the closed loop, maybe
like [INAUDIBLE] [? as ?]

00:24:21.294 --> 00:24:24.258
the industry will grow they
will say to the customer how

00:24:24.258 --> 00:24:26.234
important it is to
have [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:33.087 --> 00:24:33.670
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:36.270
Do you want to defend
your IFO choice?

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:41.210
So basically why I
chose IFO was as to me

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:44.667
so I worked under the assumption
that legislation would pass

00:24:44.667 --> 00:24:45.500
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.400
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.710
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]
the legislation passed soon,

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:53.600
and that there are
fines for not complying,

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:58.140
you going to closed loop you
have to develop a logistics

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:02.368
system that's really, that
gets to every part of Canada,

00:25:02.368 --> 00:25:03.344
basically.

00:25:03.344 --> 00:25:06.760
Which is a huge country.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:11.170
And you need to make investments
in, for example, vehicles

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:16.070
to pick up the
refrigerators and the ovens,

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:19.020
the washing machines,
and all this.

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:23.780
So I believe that this
was too much of a cost

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:29.392
to effectively reach all of
the customers that it has.

00:25:29.392 --> 00:25:34.172
And that under the IFO model
since there was something

00:25:34.172 --> 00:25:36.424
consolidated, you
were taking advantage

00:25:36.424 --> 00:25:39.322
of the economies of
scale of, well, you

00:25:39.322 --> 00:25:41.520
would reach all the
customers in all of Canada,

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.280
but for not just
30% of the market,

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.654
but for the entire
100% of the market.

00:25:47.654 --> 00:25:50.070
And you get the economies
of scale of that.

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:52.380
PROFESSOR: So if I make
[INAUDIBLE] this argument is,

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:56.020
well, I can make investment
money many, many places, right?

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:58.700
I could invest in
better products.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:00.280
I could invest maybe
in other places.

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:05.760
So why should I put my money
in developing this new network

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.880
if I could just pull my
resources with others.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:13.230
And then try to make,
pay potentially less.

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:15.450
We'll talk about the
cost later, yeah?

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:16.640
And decide what happens.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.250
Do you want to add
something to the argument?

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:21.440
AUDIENCE: Speaking of
the economies of scale,

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:25.780
95% to around 95%
of the machines

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:28.740
are currently not making
their way to the landfill.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.615
I'm not sure that there's
an economy of scale

00:26:30.615 --> 00:26:34.100
to justify the up-front costs
for a closed-loop system.

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:37.580
PROFESSOR: So, yeah, so there's
not even enough volume even,

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:38.080
right?

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.869
Because people are
naturally recycling.

00:26:40.869 --> 00:26:49.495
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] about
these costs and [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:49.495 --> 00:26:51.620
PROFESSOR: So here you
have, you control the costs.

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:05.200
Here you may get scale.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:05.820
Maybe.

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:06.580
Maybe, right?

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:08.150
The scale is much
more certain here.

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:09.450
Here you control the cost more.

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:10.160
OK, great.

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.530
So those are the options.

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:14.350
And it's hard to make a call
here without some number.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:19.580
So who is brave enough to walk
us through their calculations

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:22.490
on how much this thing
cost for Whirlpool?

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:24.777
Let's try to make a
few estimates to see

00:27:24.777 --> 00:27:27.110
and try to make a decision
is this really more expensive

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.810
or not.

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:35.300
From an industry IFO
versus the closed loop.

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:39.840
So what I'll do is maybe someone
is willing to risk and tell me

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:46.124
how much is the cost per
ton of doing an IFO model.

00:27:46.124 --> 00:27:47.600
Do you remember?

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.260
I have your [? papers ?] here
so [? someone ?] I can open it,

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:52.770
or your document, I can
be happy to open it.

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:55.974
So we see how do you
get to that number.

00:27:55.974 --> 00:27:57.390
Because those are
numbers you have

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:00.750
to do eventually if you
want to analyze the systems.

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:05.800
So what is the cost per ton
more or less, or per pound?

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.990
I'm sure all of you computed
to get these numbers.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:09.560
Let me get mine here.

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:13.075
See more or less what they were.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.750
Someone remembers?

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:19.730
How much money will
this cost to Whirlpool?

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:20.729
Total money.

00:28:20.729 --> 00:28:21.270
You remember?

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:22.103
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:28:22.103 --> 00:28:23.000
PROFESSOR: How many?

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:23.916
AUDIENCE: $35 million.

00:28:23.916 --> 00:28:25.110
PROFESSOR: $35 million.

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:28.050
AUDIENCE: [? Since ?] 2008.

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:29.030
AUDIENCE: IFO?

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:30.487
AUDIENCE: IFO, yeah.

00:28:30.487 --> 00:28:31.362
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:37.830
AUDIENCE: That's
based on the fact

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:40.990
that there's 100 kilotons
of stuff being thrown away.

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:43.700
And 30% of it is Whirlpool.

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.815
And then I found some data
somewhere in a case study that

00:28:46.815 --> 00:28:48.390
had dollar per
ton, and I applied

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:50.550
the collection, transport
and processing--

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:51.780
numbers that were there.

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:52.405
PROFESSOR: So there
was [? an existing ?]

00:28:52.405 --> 00:28:54.470
to how all of this cost
per ton of collection,

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:55.720
dollars, et cetera, et cetera.

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.270
And you can apply that.

00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:59.960
You add it up that
gives you roughly

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.400
like $1,000 or something
of the collection costs?

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.025
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:03.025 --> 00:29:04.730
I assumed the most
expensive route

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:07.800
for the trucks, and the
full trucks, as well.

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.480
PROFESSOR: And that gave you
like $35 million to do IFO.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.521
AUDIENCE: For 2008, yeah.

00:29:11.521 --> 00:29:13.050
PROFESSOR: For 2008 figures.

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:15.299
AUDIENCE: I did something
similar with average numbers

00:29:15.299 --> 00:29:17.300
and ended up same
ballpark-- $24 million.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.540
PROFESSOR: $24 million?

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:22.350
$10 million more.

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:25.430
I will argue.

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:28.272
But still-- it's a big number.

00:29:28.272 --> 00:29:29.910
It's a big ballpark.

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:32.980
Someone got a different number?

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.880
So that looks like a big
number, but how big is it

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.260
compared to what it will cost--

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.388
AUDIENCE: It's tiny.

00:29:39.388 --> 00:29:42.717
They spend $202 million to ship
the stuff out to customers.

00:29:42.717 --> 00:29:43.550
How much they spend?

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:45.170
200 and-- how'd
you get the number?

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:47.170
220 million.

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:47.920
Other assumptions.

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:54.540
I assumed $40 per
appliance delivery--

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:57.199
PROFESSOR: How much
was the, $40 per--

00:29:57.199 --> 00:29:58.990
AUDIENCE: $40 per
appliance delivery, yeah?

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:02.980
And 5 million appliances, large
appliances shipped in 2008.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.620
Mind you that's I didn't
take the 30% of that number,

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:09.910
so it would be 30% of $202
million, so about $70 million--

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:11.300
PROFESSOR: Around $70 million

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:15.044
AUDIENCE: --for
Whirlpool washers.

00:30:15.044 --> 00:30:17.577
PROFESSOR: So that would be
about this number [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:17.577 --> 00:30:19.160
AUDIENCE: I'm sure
it was about right.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.152
AUDIENCE: That number
is going on the customer

00:30:21.152 --> 00:30:22.916
in terms of the delivery fee.

00:30:22.916 --> 00:30:25.330
PROFESSOR: And it says that
it counts for the costs

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:27.847
so the customer does pay for it.

00:30:27.847 --> 00:30:28.680
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.346
PROFESSOR: --right
now for the retailer.

00:30:30.346 --> 00:30:31.680
But this is the collection fees.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.180
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but I'm just
saying like right now like they

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:37.502
haven't, their cost for delivery
isn't really a cost to them

00:30:37.502 --> 00:30:39.918
because they're probably making
money off of the delivery,

00:30:39.918 --> 00:30:40.407
you know.

00:30:40.407 --> 00:30:42.657
They're probably charging
more than it actually costs.

00:30:42.657 --> 00:30:44.320
So, I mean, just a footnote.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:44.986
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:30:44.986 --> 00:30:50.520
So it's-- so to build to make
this choices we have to make

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.740
these calculations right.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.350
So the number I got--

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:54.570
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:55.950
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:30:55.950 --> 00:31:02.260
The numbers I have are more
towards the $35 million,

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:07.880
but for 2020 numbers,
no 2008 numbers.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.080
Why 2020?

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:12.700
Remember that in
some way you only

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.930
see things that are discarded.

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:18.490
The things that are kind of
naturally progress from one

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:20.360
place to the other,
you don't see those.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:26.890
The Whirlpool case had a table
somewhere-- exhibit seven--

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:31.660
and this gives you a sense of
the units discarded in 2020.

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:37.130
So those are the total discarded
units of all different kinds

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:37.820
of appliances.

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:39.780
So you can get
their refrigerators,

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:42.310
freezers, dishwashers,
cooking ranges, [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:44.440
[? and some ?] washers
and so forth, yeah?

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.050
Then there's a table,
I think on top,

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:52.585
that has more or less the amount
of steel, aluminum, copper, et

00:31:52.585 --> 00:31:54.490
cetera, and the weight
of each appliance.

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:57.530
So you can get the total
number of appliances

00:31:57.530 --> 00:32:00.599
times the weight of
those appliances,

00:32:00.599 --> 00:32:02.640
and they give you how many
tons you have to let's

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.300
say, get back.

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:09.310
Once you compute those
tons you need to get back,

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:11.320
those are now all yours, right?

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.490
You'll be responsible
for your market share.

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:15.400
You said 30%, but
actually Whirlpool

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.090
does Whirlpool and Kenmore.

00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:21.740
So it's close to 48% more
or less of the market.

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:26.490
48% of the market share, and
then you get those numbers.

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:28.070
And that's the total tonnage.

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:30.385
So what you can sell,
you make money out of it.

00:32:30.385 --> 00:32:31.760
Because you can sell it, right?

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.430
You get it and you
make money out of it.

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:37.500
And then you pay, and
that's the tricky part.

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:41.570
There's a collection
cost on exhibit four.

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:43.530
It's a collection per ton.

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:47.290
That's come from the previous
program, [? the We ?] program.

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:50.110
And it says, roughly-- you
know, in the [? We ?] program

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:51.700
is an IFO program.

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:55.680
It gives you $165
to collect per ton.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.700
And you can then add
all those numbers,

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:00.700
and it gives you $37 million.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.360
I'll put a table,
but those are more,

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.550
those are rough
numbers that you get.

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:12.140
And I give you 7 million
for the cost for doing this.

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:20.360
Which translates into a
$47 per unit more or less.

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:34.915
So the cost of IFO is
equal to $47 per unit sold.

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:41.980
$47 per unit.

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:46.315
How does that compare to
their distribution costs?

00:33:46.315 --> 00:33:48.900
That's how we know
it's expensive or not.

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.440
How do you compute the
distribution cost of Whirlpool?

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.460
Someone did that?

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:55.540
So we know more [? than ?]
to compare how they do it.

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:59.567
That's the reverse
part-- $47 per unit.

00:33:59.567 --> 00:34:01.275
AUDIENCE: Well, if I
know it's different,

00:34:01.275 --> 00:34:06.798
so I did do it with 30%
of market share, not 48%.

00:34:06.798 --> 00:34:10.000
But they said that it's
approximate for the industry

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.699
standard 10% of their sales.

00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:15.320
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:17.690
AUDIENCE: And so I
would say that they

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:21.790
were selling [INAUDIBLE]
per 100,000 units

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:24.510
but that's 30% of the market.

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:25.870
And you change it to 48%.

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:27.745
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but
that's the right number.

00:34:27.745 --> 00:34:29.479
So the approximate
costs are 10%.

00:34:29.479 --> 00:34:30.770
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so it changes--

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:31.969
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:34.244
So now there's another
number somewhere in the case

00:34:34.244 --> 00:34:36.969
that is $1,000 per unit.

00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:38.880
That's the average retail price.

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.550
Now you can also assume
a margin, you know,

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:42.150
of a retailer.

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:45.120
30% margin, 25% margin is
not uncommon for these kind

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.389
of appliances.

00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:51.489
So I give you $700 more or
less per the cost of the goods.

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:54.996
So the forward supply chain of
Whirlpool is more or less $70.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.470
Forward supply chain.

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:09.690
So it gives us like
$70 I guess per unit.

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:13.400
So it's 10% of our
sales price, $1,000.

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:18.030
30% margin, let's suppose if
our retailer they give us $700

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:20.550
is the cost of Whirlpool of
those 10% of distribution

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:21.230
costs.

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:23.960
So it gives $70 per unit.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.770
Now the IFO cost
here-- this cost

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:29.960
includes selling
the scrap metals

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.960
and recovering all the
value of those metals.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:38.022
If you get that out, this
costs you $80 per unit.

00:35:38.022 --> 00:35:40.040
If you just look at
the direct costs of,

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.734
you know, recovering
all this material.

00:35:42.734 --> 00:35:45.186
AUDIENCE: I just have
one other question.

00:35:45.186 --> 00:35:48.290
So for the Whirlpool
forward chain,

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:52.720
that's the 10% of the cost,
but that is usually bringing it

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.319
to the retailer, right?

00:35:54.319 --> 00:35:55.110
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:58.990
AUDIENCE: So should
we consider the fee

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:02.550
that is charged to customers
to get to their home?

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:04.460
Because for the
reverse supply chain,

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:07.880
we kind of would have to pick
them from the home, right?

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:10.270
PROFESSOR: So we could talk
about the network design,

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:10.770
as well.

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:11.050
Yeah.

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:13.350
Let's talk about the options
to try to be discussed.

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:15.440
But to get started,
these are the two numbers

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.860
we need to compare.

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:21.360
So $70 per unit is the cost
of getting to the dealer,

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:25.160
to the retailer, sorry-- or
the dealer of the appliance.

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:27.250
$70 per unit.

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:30.100
To get it back without getting
a scrap is $80 per unit.

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:38.254
Why is this higher, you
know, compared to this one?

00:36:38.254 --> 00:36:40.170
AUDIENCE: Well, it's
centralized distribution.

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:41.961
PROFESSOR: Centralized
distribution, right?

00:36:41.961 --> 00:36:44.847
This, my network is not
designed to collect stuff.

00:36:44.847 --> 00:36:46.680
So since it's not
designed to collect stuff,

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.100
the IFO model, even
if it's the IFO model,

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:51.850
Whirlpool is very
specialized in forward.

00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:54.310
These numbers, even the
rough numbers-- this

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:56.280
is the kind of
environment that you

00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:00.640
face the first time you go into
any reverse logistics cost.

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:03.200
That-- maybe the
numbers are not that big

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.300
when you look at the whole
Whirlpool corporation,

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:08.560
but when you start looking
back and try to nail down

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.430
and compute your
distribution costs,

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:13.520
This is more or
less the situation

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.670
you will face the
first time around.

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:18.510
Your forward cost per unit $70.

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:21.760
Your reverse could
be higher than that.

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:26.850
Mainly because you are not
using a optimized, well-designed

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:27.920
network.

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.840
Which get us to the
different options

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:33.070
that we have to
make this $80 down.

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:36.110
So it goes back to-- now we
can put a little bit more,

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:37.630
let's say, meat to this.

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:42.810
So if the IFO model, assuming
our estimates are OK,

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:47.130
costs us roughly $80
per unit, and this one

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:50.606
costs us roughly $70 per unit.

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:57.420
So if the IFO gets
super efficient,

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:59.690
and it really costs
me much less-- well,

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:02.290
actually it doesn't cost
me really $80 per unit.

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:03.600
It costs me $47.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.410
But I can also do it here
and then sell the scraps.

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:09.820
That's why I'm computing
this one to the other.

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:14.100
So if the IFO pure
distribution costs get down

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:19.840
to much lower than $70, right,
maybe is worth doing with them.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:23.540
If they can get to the
scale, and once they

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:26.350
recover the
investments, that they

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:29.350
have the plan-- if this number
gets less than $70, maybe

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:31.750
it's worth for me to jump there.

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:35.350
On a cost, pure cost
perspective, on the other hand,

00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:37.090
we have some of the
other options here

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:38.110
that will give me value.

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:44.042
So with that, let me just ask
how will a closed loop-- how

00:38:44.042 --> 00:38:46.000
do I want to compare the
actual networks to see

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.505
how different they are-- the
IFO versus the closed loop

00:38:49.505 --> 00:38:50.380
network of Whirlpool?

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:54.030
So who wants to draw
a diagram of how

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:57.630
do you think Whirlpool
closed-loop supply chain could

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:58.850
look like?

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:00.430
Someone volunteers?

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:03.470
I'll volunteer someone.

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:05.260
How is the current
supply chain working?

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:09.250
Go for it.

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:11.166
You can use that one.

00:39:11.166 --> 00:39:13.470
And let's go back to
where is the retailer,

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:16.110
where is the dealer,
and so forth.

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:18.905
Give it a shot.

00:39:18.905 --> 00:39:21.830
AUDIENCE: So forward
supply chain,

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:28.910
you have one or two factories
where they make the stuff.

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:34.245
They go to a series of
regional distribution centers.

00:39:34.245 --> 00:39:38.544
And each of these, in turn goes
to the series of retailers.

00:39:38.544 --> 00:39:39.210
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:42.010
So there's actually how many
factories does Whirlpool have?

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:44.360
[? No one ?] remembers?

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:46.630
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:48.428
PROFESSOR: I think
it was 17 in total.

00:39:48.428 --> 00:39:49.386
AUDIENCE: Oh, but for--

00:39:49.386 --> 00:39:50.136
PROFESSOR: Canada.

00:39:50.136 --> 00:39:51.780
For Canada, yeah.

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:54.782
So 17 factories up there.

00:39:54.782 --> 00:39:58.204
And those go to how many
DCs do they have in Canada?

00:40:01.452 --> 00:40:02.750
Someone remembers?

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:05.300
More or less?

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:05.840
30?

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:06.340
40?

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:07.750
24.

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:13.200
24 DCs 24 DCs, and
how many retailers?

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:19.580
1,000?

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:21.760
How about 2,400?

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:25.450
2,400 retailers.

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:27.250
So that's the network.

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:32.190
17 factories, 24 real
distribution centers,

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:36.580
2,400 retailers.

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:37.727
Thank you.

00:40:37.727 --> 00:40:38.810
Thank you for being brave.

00:40:40.691 --> 00:40:41.190
Great.

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:46.740
So, how would the
IFO model look like?

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:50.620
If I join an IFO,
what will happen?

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:54.570
So let me just do a
little change to this

00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:55.730
so we can add more models.

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:56.950
So we have a factory here.

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:04.065
And this will go to our original
distribution center, right?

00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:21.890
And then this goes to a
bunch of different retailers.

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:33.820
The same diagram so that we
can just grow on this side.

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:38.630
So what happens if we
decide to join an IFO model?

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:42.190
If someone comes
with an IFO model,

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:45.540
what will happen at this
point with the goods?

00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:48.251
Will I collect them
at the customer site?

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.862
So you think the
industry, the IFO,

00:41:56.862 --> 00:41:58.653
what is a standard
producer responsibility?

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:04.000
So what does it mean?

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.150
That I have to be
collecting it or I

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:09.230
have to keep options to dispose?

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:11.580
What does the legislation
say more or less, or at least

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:12.930
the way it is described here?

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:14.471
AUDIENCE 1: Probably
just that you're

00:42:14.471 --> 00:42:16.790
responsible for the ultimate
disposal of the product.

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:19.250
PROFESSOR: It doesn't say that
you have to go to your house

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:20.890
and pick it up, right?

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:23.237
It probably is not exactly
the way it will work.

00:42:23.237 --> 00:42:25.070
The way it will work
is that you will set up

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:30.550
some sort of mechanism
to get those goods back.

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:33.130
And the ones that get back, you
are responsible for properly

00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:33.900
disposing them.

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:37.100
And you have to create all the
right information, materials,

00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:39.770
and incentives for the
consumers to know where and how

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:41.800
to dispose of these materials.

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.577
It's like batteries.

00:42:43.577 --> 00:42:46.160
AUDIENCE: However, with the size
of stuff we're talking about,

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:49.590
refrigerators, and whatnot, I
think the only practical way

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:51.152
to do it is to go
get them for them.

00:42:51.152 --> 00:42:52.550
Maybe they have to call
and make an appointment

00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:53.630
several weeks out.

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:54.421
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:42:54.421 --> 00:42:57.700
So it will not be
Whirlpool in an IFO model.

00:42:57.700 --> 00:42:59.380
More or less, the
way you will do it

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:07.720
is that you will probably
get the retailers

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:10.480
or another network
of dealers, probably.

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.760
That's the way you will do it.

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:13.190
That's the way it
works probably today.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:14.690
You have a bunch
of dealers here.

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:31.835
[WRITING ON CHALK BOARD]

00:43:31.835 --> 00:43:33.210
PROFESSOR: And
then these dealers

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:44.350
are the ones that go to
some sort of processor,

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:52.680
some entity here that
deals with steel,

00:43:52.680 --> 00:44:00.804
sorry that deals with
decomposing the [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:00.804 --> 00:44:01.845
to get the raw materials.

00:44:07.924 --> 00:44:08.840
Out of the processors.

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:10.300
That's more or
less how the supply

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:18.550
chain will look like if you
do some sort of IFO model.

00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:21.460
Someone pointed out one of the
things that you are missing out

00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:24.220
is that you are losing that
connection with the consumer.

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:26.290
That's why I wanted
to draw the diagram.

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:28.320
So if you go to
an IFO model, you

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:32.360
will effectively remove your
connection with the dealers.

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.380
Maybe you wanted to do
that on that network.

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:36.420
Your consumer will
not have that.

00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:37.950
Let's talk about
practical reasons.

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:40.480
Somebody mentioned this
will cost some money

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:43.590
to be able to collect
those goods from the house

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:46.040
of the consumer to the dealer.

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:49.220
How will you recover this money?

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:50.958
What happens today?

00:44:50.958 --> 00:44:52.701
AUDIENCE: You charge
an up-front dealer,

00:44:52.701 --> 00:44:53.450
and they buy the product.

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:55.290
PROFESSOR: That's
exactly the way it works.

00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:58.870
All of us are paying for
this, we just do not know.

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:01.580
So when there is a
[? realization ?] like this

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:05.140
in Europe, or even
batteries in North America,

00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:08.940
we are paid-- or
bottles-- or any kind

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:13.600
of mandated collection, we
are being charged for it.

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:16.650
We are-- it's not itemized.

00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:17.707
And then what happens?

00:45:17.707 --> 00:45:19.040
What happens with those dealers?

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:22.320
Once you get them
collected, the dealer says,

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:24.560
I have a Whirlpool here,
and I take a picture

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.760
of the Whirlpool, I scan it.

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.730
I send it to Whirlpool,
and Whirlpool gives me

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:34.170
the money they collected
so I can get back my cost.

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:36.884
That's how you pay
in these situations.

00:45:36.884 --> 00:45:39.300
So you don't go and charge the
consumer for picking it up,

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:40.799
but they say, well
when you're done,

00:45:40.799 --> 00:45:42.930
call one of these authorized
dealers' 1-800 number.

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:44.462
We'll pick up for
your appointment,

00:45:44.462 --> 00:45:46.170
and then the dealer
goes and picks it up,

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:48.340
and then the whole
process continues.

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:51.270
That is probably
the most common way

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:53.430
that this actually is
implemented in practice.

00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:57.430
So who bears the cost
ultimately is the consumer.

00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:59.030
Which creates an
interesting dilemma.

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:00.690
If I'm charging
by consumer, can I

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:02.730
compete on the price
I charge my consumer?

00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:05.300
I can charge less.

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.870
This goes back to loyalty and
other [INAUDIBLE] the customer.

00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:09.620
What do you think about
the implementation

00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:11.140
of these programs?

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:13.920
That is how maybe it
starts making sense

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:14.950
to try to get into it.

00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:17.950
Because if I can
charge less for this,

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:20.240
I can actually sell my
product for less money,

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.310
for a prospective consumer.

00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:23.020
Maybe.

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:24.010
I can try to do that.

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:29.960
How will the network
look like if I

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:33.090
use my-- the close look
now becomes apparent.

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:36.210
What I will ask my
consumers is, whenever

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:39.490
you purchased the computer,
we will take it back.

00:46:39.490 --> 00:46:42.520
So I'm moving right now, so I
have all these things that I

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:45.860
buy for my new place.

00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:51.190
And I go to Ikea a lot this
last weekend, I went a lot.

00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:53.870
More times than I wanted to go.

00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:57.550
And there's this big
heart with open hands.

00:46:57.550 --> 00:46:58.750
Have you seen it?

00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:00.260
We'll take it back.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:02.950
So no matter when you
buy, we will take it back.

00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:05.020
So you could tell your
customer the same.

00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:10.790
If you bought your refrigerator
from Sears or from Kmart

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:13.810
or from Walmart, and it's
a Whirlpool refrigerator,

00:47:13.810 --> 00:47:14.590
don't worry.

00:47:14.590 --> 00:47:17.070
You can bring it back
when you're done with it.

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:19.020
And we will take it for you.

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:21.380
And in that opportunity,
I can also use that money

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:22.800
to give you a new refrigerator.

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:26.340
So that's the concept of also
engaging the consumer, where

00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:33.810
you go to the same retailer
where you purchased the goods

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:40.910
and return that refrigerator,
washer and dryer, et cetera,

00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:42.130
et cetera, et cetera.

00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:45.980
The question is, how do you
get it back from the retailers

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:48.310
to the rest of your network?

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:52.150
So one option is, which is
what GENCO does, pretty much,

00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:54.620
is that you still
keep that connection.

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:57.040
But you can still have
a separate network.

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:59.470
You have another network
that goes back here,

00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:02.730
where it goes back to
some sort of collector

00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:06.420
where you aggregate
some of these flows.

00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:10.865
And then you can get it back
to a processing facility that

00:48:10.865 --> 00:48:13.140
can take care of it.

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:16.010
This gives you the
intimacy with the consumer

00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:18.270
without having to deal
with the whole network.

00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:20.510
But in that case you will
not get a cost advantage.

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:23.379
You will have probably higher
costs than the IFO model has,

00:48:23.379 --> 00:48:24.920
because you don't
have enough volume.

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:27.980
Where you get the most
value is if you somehow

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:33.460
use the same flow, so
the same trucks that

00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:35.560
collect and deliver your
goods to the retailer.

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:36.976
Those are the same
trucks you use.

00:48:36.976 --> 00:48:38.997
You don't have to create
a new set of trucks.

00:48:38.997 --> 00:48:39.830
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:48:39.830 --> 00:48:41.540
PROFESSOR: They're
coming empty anyway,

00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:44.210
so why not bring them back?

00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:46.320
Also their return
volume is not as high,

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:48.880
so it's not 100% of the sales.

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:54.940
So what is the main bottleneck,
then, for this to work?

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:57.570
If you want to use your
retailer and use your own trucks

00:48:57.570 --> 00:48:58.744
that come empty.

00:48:58.744 --> 00:49:00.660
Some problems we will
find with this approach.

00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:04.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] so
why would I want to do it?

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:06.880
PROFESSOR: So that's
a big problem.

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:08.782
You are getting all this crap.

00:49:08.782 --> 00:49:10.490
I have to have it
around in my warehouse,

00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:12.060
or in my floor space.

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:15.280
I have to use a sales
associate to try

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.440
to spend time with the
customer and make sure it

00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:19.840
is something I should take?

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:20.710
Any Whirlpool?

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:21.930
So that's the first barrier.

00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:24.380
What's the other barrier?

00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:27.370
That way you can fix, maybe you
can give them some incentives.

00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:28.450
AUDIENCE: Oracle did
mention a systems barrier.

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:30.360
They're not able to trace
[INAUDIBLE] serial number

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:32.443
levels, so we can figure
out when these things are

00:49:32.443 --> 00:49:33.450
going to be coming back.

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:34.783
PROFESSOR: That's another thing.

00:49:34.783 --> 00:49:37.200
Which is the other one?

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:43.830
Who has ever kept a box of
the Whirlpool refrigerator?

00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:46.650
How do you move those things
in a truck efficiently?

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:50.510
Luckily, things are
very nicely packed.

00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:52.350
Not only because they're
beautiful for you,

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:54.760
but also easier to handle.

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.392
Your palate can now
go to the bottom,

00:49:56.392 --> 00:49:57.600
and put on top of the palate.

00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:59.558
Things are not sticking
out all over the place.

00:49:59.558 --> 00:50:01.190
The doors are not
opened and closed.

00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:04.880
So just the packaging of this
thing is meant to be moved.

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:06.990
Now once you return it,
it's just an easier scale.

00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:09.300
So that creates
equipment [? tear. ?]

00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:11.024
Eventually you have
to have more labor

00:50:11.024 --> 00:50:12.940
to put it on top of the--
all those things are

00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:14.580
the things that made it
a little more expensive.

00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:16.250
But you can come up
with some solutions.

00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:18.150
Some standard
wrapping or something.

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:20.030
But those are the
operational constraints

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:21.280
that you are probably getting.

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:23.790
Once you get to
face that problem,

00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:26.120
and you get to your RDC,
you have the same problem

00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:27.942
that the retailer has.

00:50:27.942 --> 00:50:30.400
And that's you don't want to
have all this crap in your DCE

00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:30.920
either.

00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:32.753
So you have to have
another area of your DCE

00:50:32.753 --> 00:50:34.664
so it doesn't
interrupt the flow.

00:50:34.664 --> 00:50:36.330
So those are the
operational constraints

00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:38.850
you have to face to set
up your own network.

00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:41.260
And in some ways
or another, that's

00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:43.280
what makes the IFO interesting.

00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:45.030
So even though the
cost could be high,

00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:47.480
all those little
barriers require

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:51.180
some really strong collaboration
with all your partners.

00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:54.180
Your retailers need
to be on board.

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:56.030
You have to give them
some incentives either

00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:59.360
on branding or market share,
some sort of incentive for them

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:00.660
to work with you.

00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:03.080
Otherwise why would
they work with you?

00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:05.190
And after that, you
still have to work

00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:08.330
with all those physical
barriers of actually moving

00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:11.890
used products back into where
they need to be disposed.

00:51:11.890 --> 00:51:14.086
And those warehouses and
DCEs are not available.

00:51:14.086 --> 00:51:15.710
You need more
investments, even if they

00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:17.510
were huge capital investments.

00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:19.990
They are big barriers on
operational investments.

00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:24.110
And that's why companies like
GENCO are very profitable.

00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:26.875
Because they still can
deal with that complexity,

00:51:26.875 --> 00:51:29.420
and you don't have
to think about it.

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:33.290
In this case, Whirlpool
has a big advantage.

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:35.700
Market share-- 48% market share.

00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:39.350
So you have the scale that you
need to work these details.

00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:44.280
And if you can somehow
include the value of the brand

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:48.800
into this whole equation, that's
where this becomes attractive.

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:51.100
Operationally, it's a nightmare.

00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:53.850
It's very upsetting to GENCO.

00:51:53.850 --> 00:51:56.490
Once you get a certain scale,
like maybe Whirlpool has,

00:51:56.490 --> 00:52:00.320
that's where you
can get into making

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:04.560
worthy investments plus you
get connection to the customer.

00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:07.240
Which I think is ultimately,
just as a side note,

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:08.950
what Whirlpool decided to do.

00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:10.820
Whirlpool, in this
particular case,

00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:13.010
they actually decided to
go towards a closed loop.

00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:16.060
But it was much more
expensive than they thought.

00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:20.140
So it did not go that
well for our manager.

00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:22.168
At least the first trial.

00:52:22.168 --> 00:52:27.074
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] They're
probably the first ones.

00:52:27.074 --> 00:52:29.260
Maybe they can become
the IFO and everyone

00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:29.790
else. can pay them to do it.

00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:31.760
PROFESSOR: And that's exactly
what was the thinking.

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:33.750
The thinking was, well maybe
we could become the IFO.

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:35.333
At the end of the
day, the legislation

00:52:35.333 --> 00:52:38.460
says, we pick one organization
to pick up everything.

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:41.160
So if things are not working
out, you could become the IFO.

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:42.840
So Whirlpool, in
this particular case,

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:46.320
they did decide to
try to close the loop.

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:49.700
And they actually talked, well
not in Canada, but in general,

00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:51.940
they talked widely
about these things.

00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:54.620
About how they are
taking things back

00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:56.480
and as part of their
valuable position.

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.896
And they believe this is going
to give them some long term

00:52:58.896 --> 00:53:00.180
value.

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:03.640
All right, so that was kind
of the underlying ripples.

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:07.260
So this is the way-- the
best data you can get

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:08.860
was in this case study.

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:11.147
You can get rough numbers
of how much it cost.

00:53:11.147 --> 00:53:12.730
You have to look at
other initiatives,

00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:13.660
the WEEE initiative.

00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:15.120
In different places
of the world,

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:18.050
they publish this kind of
numbers, price of steel,

00:53:18.050 --> 00:53:20.770
price of copper,
estimated number of units,

00:53:20.770 --> 00:53:22.790
and roughly going those.

00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:28.260
The mapping of the costs
here was a little bit harder.

00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:29.970
You need to have the
inside information.

00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:31.860
That's why you use 10%.

00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:34.900
But this is how you probably
can think through understanding

00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:36.260
what is the right trade off.

00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:38.010
That's always a good benchmark.

00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:39.790
Try to compute
how much it costs.

00:53:39.790 --> 00:53:41.080
Forward versus reverse.

00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:44.090
And that will give you a sense
of what-- don't be surprised

00:53:44.090 --> 00:53:47.220
if it is twice as much,
30% as much, 40% more

00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:49.500
than your forward, because
it's not optimized.

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:50.860
And later it will become better.

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:53.330
Volume is here the
key to do that.

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:57.050
And on homogeneous products
like the case of Whirlpool,

00:53:57.050 --> 00:54:01.380
their boxes-- [INAUDIBLE]
boxes-- makes it more viable.

00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:03.510
For a retailer, that's why
their GENCO starts with.

00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:06.260
You have shirts and
toys and cell phones.

00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:10.570
Everything in one bundle,
then maybe collecting

00:54:10.570 --> 00:54:12.380
to your former supply
chain is not as easy

00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:16.270
because the box is hard
to fit in your truck.

00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:17.880
Boxes like these
ones are easier.

00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:21.896
All right, Any other thoughts or
comments on the Whirlpool case?

00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:28.010
Tony or Alex, is there
anything I should add?

00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:28.730
Great lecture?

00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:29.550
OK, great.

00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:30.330
Let's keep going.

00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:32.720
So now I want to talk
about the final projects.

00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:35.560
So I want each of you
to come here in front

00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:38.590
and quickly tell the
rest of the group what

00:54:38.590 --> 00:54:40.480
are you doing, which
companies you picked,

00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:42.230
and that's what I ask
for your [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:47.310
Did everyone find a
nice clean green area

00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:49.920
in the [? work site ?]
of your companies?

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:52.410
With Alexis we joke, every
time we look at companies,

00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:56.050
they all say it is
eating our values, right?

00:54:56.050 --> 00:54:56.830
It's in our DNA.

00:54:56.830 --> 00:54:57.746
That's the word I use.

00:54:57.746 --> 00:54:58.660
It's in our DNA.

00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:01.090
So every single company
and website [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:02.560
the world should
be a better place.

00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:06.317
So the other company
is Indie Tech Zara.

00:55:06.317 --> 00:55:08.150
OK, so I can tell you
have lots of questions

00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:11.520
next class about how to compute
carbon footprint of energy

00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.549
and stores, and electricity.

00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:15.840
I think that's going to be
something to understand well

00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:17.714
because I'm sure all
your companies have that

00:55:17.714 --> 00:55:19.330
highlighted somehow.

00:55:19.330 --> 00:55:23.770
So are they smoke and mirrors,
or they're doing the real deal,

00:55:23.770 --> 00:55:24.270
I guess?

00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:26.920
We have to have to see after--
no pressure, Tony, but--

00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:29.180
AUDIENCE: I might have
more questions after

00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:29.822
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:29.822 --> 00:55:31.030
PROFESSOR: After the lecture.

00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:32.790
Great, so you know
that's Zaragoza,

00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:36.250
our center is actually in the
same logistics park as Zara,

00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:38.670
largest distribution
center in Spain.

00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:42.440
So that's one reason why our
partner center is in Zaragoza

00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:45.930
partly, co-located
with the plaza that

00:55:45.930 --> 00:55:50.340
is the logistics
activity zone of Zaragoza

00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:53.030
where the largest distribution
center of Zara is.

00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:54.580
To manage all the
global operations.

00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:56.810
They also fly things
around from there.

00:55:56.810 --> 00:55:58.270
OK great, thank you.

00:55:58.270 --> 00:56:00.690
So let's pick the next one.

00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:05.470
Any questions or comments
before I move to the next group?

00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:06.350
No?

00:56:06.350 --> 00:56:07.530
All right.

00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:08.860
Let me see.

00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:17.520
So the next one is
Hewlett Packard and Delll,

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.730
So thank you.

00:56:18.730 --> 00:56:21.450
I would like to just
highlight these two projects.

00:56:21.450 --> 00:56:25.830
So we look at, first
two pairs of companies

00:56:25.830 --> 00:56:28.260
have very different
business models.

00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:32.950
Zara has one, fast fashion,
lots of designs per year.

00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:35.124
Dell goes direct to consumer.

00:56:35.124 --> 00:56:37.040
And I think that really
has deep implications.

00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:38.950
And I think both of you
highlighted that's important.

00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:40.450
I also want to
point out, at least,

00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:42.150
the state of both
industries in terms

00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:44.440
of environmental practices.

00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:48.480
Electronics industry has moved
together for a longer time.

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:50.760
There's the WEEE
directive in Europe.

00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:52.500
They put electronics
under scrutiny,

00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:54.152
so they're both under
higher pressure.

00:56:54.152 --> 00:56:56.360
That's why maybe you see
more of the same initiatives

00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:59.926
like take materials
out of certain kind.

00:56:59.926 --> 00:57:03.030
It's outlawed in some countries.

00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:05.610
So you have to do it
because you have to do it.

00:57:05.610 --> 00:57:09.360
So there's a little
bit of that on one end.

00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:15.677
They also tend to collaborate in
other sectors, both the apparel

00:57:15.677 --> 00:57:17.260
industry and the
electronics industry.

00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:20.926
They collaborate on social
issues on a parallel for labor.

00:57:20.926 --> 00:57:22.800
So that brings them
together in other forums.

00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:28.310
In electronics, they also get
together for technology designs

00:57:28.310 --> 00:57:29.960
to keep processors high speed.

00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:32.320
So as you go into
both of your cases,

00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:34.970
take a look at maybe there's
some underlying themes that

00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:37.740
are common to the industry
that have brought,

00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:39.180
because of the industry really.

00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:41.736
And the US consumer has no
idea about these things,

00:57:41.736 --> 00:57:44.110
so for you it looks like every
company is doing the same.

00:57:44.110 --> 00:57:46.180
But this probably comes
from some other force.

00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:49.960
So in both cases, I know,
especially electronics.

00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:53.350
[INAUDIBLE] apparel are
more on that band width.

00:57:53.350 --> 00:57:54.920
So let's keep that in mind.

00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:56.745
All right good, let
me see who is next.

00:58:05.810 --> 00:58:06.310
BMW.

00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:14.280
So I think that this
is interesting to know

00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:19.300
that the company that started
the brand with the consumer--

00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:22.640
hybrid notion-- is not
the top rated company.

00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:26.410
You will imagine that where the
largest emissions are in a car

00:58:26.410 --> 00:58:27.880
is in the usage.

00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:31.930
So if you innovated there,
why are you number one

00:58:31.930 --> 00:58:34.076
for the next 25 years?

00:58:34.076 --> 00:58:35.200
But it looks like it's not.

00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:37.920
So I think that it's
interesting to know that.

00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:41.980
I also did not mention
much about the life cycle

00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:44.180
aspect of it in both
of these companies.

00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:49.470
It's very different
and in textiles-- Tony,

00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:52.070
I don't remember in
textiles or Alexis--

00:58:52.070 --> 00:58:54.240
the life cycle
emissions are not in use

00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:57.140
except if you
consider water energy

00:58:57.140 --> 00:59:00.180
use for washing your clothes.

00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:03.740
That probably dwarfs the
other emissions then.

00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:04.700
Do you remember, Tony?

00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:07.340
The life cycle
emissions of apparel,

00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:09.494
in general, or in the tex--

00:59:09.494 --> 00:59:12.470
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's the
wash, if it's the wash.

00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:16.029
PROFESSOR: So don't wash
your clothes if it's the--

00:59:16.029 --> 00:59:17.070
AUDIENCE:High efficiency.

00:59:17.070 --> 00:59:20.400
PROFESSOR: High efficiency--
no, don't wash them.

00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:22.310
Or use a solar washer.

00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:23.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:26.716
PROFESSOR: So this again
goes back to the life cycle

00:59:26.716 --> 00:59:28.340
and which pieces you
control versus you

00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:29.756
don't control of
their life cycle.

00:59:29.756 --> 00:59:31.560
But great.

00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:32.220
Thank you.

00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:33.620
Let's look at the other group.

00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:46.680
Phillip Morris International.

00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:51.330
OK thank you.

00:59:51.330 --> 00:59:58.110
I just want to add the comment
on do you work internally

00:59:58.110 --> 01:00:02.370
in your operations
or you do offsets?

01:00:02.370 --> 01:00:04.410
Plant trees, or--
we'll talk a little bit

01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:05.870
about that over time.

01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:08.230
But I'm glad that
one of the companies

01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:11.200
here highlighted offsets as
one of the strategies they

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:14.370
wanted to pursue.

01:00:14.370 --> 01:00:17.210
Let me see.

01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:19.390
The other one is-- so I skipped.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.800
So for our next class, the case
studies [INAUDIBLE] is ready?

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:28.344
The [INAUDIBLE] case study?

01:00:28.344 --> 01:00:30.510
GUEST SPEAKER: It's been
posted, it's pretty simple,

01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:32.170
so hopefully asking
good questions

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:35.629
about what you're actually
the mechanics of doing

01:00:35.629 --> 01:00:38.430
calculations, et cetera,
You can email me directly

01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:39.305
with those questions.

01:00:39.305 --> 01:00:43.135
But have that filled out and
turned in by Wednesday morning

01:00:43.135 --> 01:00:45.770
because we'll-- I'm going to
collect some of the data from

01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:48.507
that [INAUDIBLE]
discuss it during class.

01:00:48.507 --> 01:00:50.840
PROFESSOR: And you have to
use the numbers for that one.
