00:00:31.087 --> 00:00:33.910
PROFESSOR: Let's get started.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.932
How about the spring weather?

00:00:35.932 --> 00:00:37.300
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.045
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:38.045 --> 00:00:39.623
PROFESSOR: Tomorrow.

00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:41.515
AUDIENCE: Someone needs
to tell New England

00:00:41.515 --> 00:00:43.410
that it's the end of April
and it's got to warm up.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.100
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.940
It's getting boring now.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.830
We need the spring
weather to come quickly.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:49.330
Right.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.490
Good.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.990
Great.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.840
So let's see.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.372
So today we have the pleasure
to have Professor Noelle

00:00:55.372 --> 00:00:58.680
Selin to lead the lecture.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.510
And Professor Selin is
not only a professor

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.045
of [INAUDIBLE] systems
division, but also

00:01:04.045 --> 00:01:06.700
the Department of Earth,
Atmospheric and Planetary

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.510
Sciences.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:15.110
So Noelle previous was on
modeling of air pollution.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.940
And has been doing
lots of work on how

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.270
to develop an understanding of
policy related to air quality

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.110
and pollution,
specifically of mercury.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.210
And through work,
she has observed

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.141
firsthand international
negotiations of policy--

00:01:32.141 --> 00:01:34.140
basically how this
[INAUDIBLE] is done, I guess.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.556
A policy meeting,
where you really

00:01:35.556 --> 00:01:37.710
see all the parties
getting together.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.720
And they the role off
science and ultimately

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.830
how these effects how to
look at a global scale.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.550
And as we have been talking
throughout the course,

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.910
one of the aspects that is new
from a business perspective

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.490
as you get into
environmental topics

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.180
is you have to interface
more with stakeholders

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.540
or in other traditional ways.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.776
So last lecture we had a
chance to hear from EDF, NGOs.

00:02:04.776 --> 00:02:06.319
EDF is of the nice kind of NGO.

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:08.360
From a business perspective,
they want to engage,

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.259
but [INAUDIBLE] attack.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.240
On opposing front, as a company
you also need to understand

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.030
what kind of shape could
policy take in the future,

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.629
and what is the
role of business?

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:22.920
How could this impact business?

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.830
Especially how it impacts
supply chains are global.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.720
So with that, Noelle,
the floor is yours.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.763
And thank you for coming.

00:02:30.763 --> 00:02:33.240
NOELLE SELIN: Great.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.630
So I want to right off
that I don't know much

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.140
about supply chains.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.636
So I'm hoping that this can
be very much a discussion.

00:02:41.636 --> 00:02:43.010
I'm hoping to
learn from you guys

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.996
as well as talking to you
a little bit about mercury.

00:02:45.996 --> 00:02:47.370
AUDIENCE: Switch
your microphone.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.017
NOELLE SELIN: How do I do that?

00:02:49.017 --> 00:02:49.850
Can you hear me now?

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.610
All right.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.760
So why is the case of mercury
interesting in the context

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.820
of sort of international
business supply

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.930
chain regulation?

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.640
Well, mercury is the
latest, the most recent

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.596
global environmental treaty.

00:03:08.596 --> 00:03:09.970
So the Minamata
Convention, which

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.280
is an international
convention on Mercury,

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.240
was signed just this
past October, 2013.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.840
And it is widely
thought of as it's

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.900
the first real new global
environmental treaty

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.150
in over a decade.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.860
The previous one was also on
a chemicals related topic,

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.990
the Stockholm Convention.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.580
So it's an example of
international environmental

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.330
cooperation of which
we don't have a lot.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.954
We don't have a lot of concrete
stuff coming out of the climate

00:03:36.954 --> 00:03:38.370
negotiations right now.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.790
But this is a brand new
agreed global treaty.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.520
And it's widely thought of
as the first entire life

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.440
cycle international convention.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.970
So I'm going to talk
about that in that context

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.860
and how it emerged, what some
of the science behind it is,

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.070
and how it might influence
thinking about chemicals

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.800
regulation in a product
context, because products

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.990
are a core area--
mercury in products

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.480
are a core area of
mercury regulation

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.927
under the convention.

00:04:10.927 --> 00:04:13.010
I'm going to talk a little
bit about the interface

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.110
as well between
domestic regulation

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.720
in the US,
international regulation

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.480
in the European
Union context, which

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.030
sort of is a
sub-global regulation,

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.420
and how that interfaces
with the global context.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.290
So that's sort of where
I'm planning to go.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.540
Please feel free to interrupt
me if you have questions

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.115
or want to go in
different directions.

00:04:32.115 --> 00:04:33.740
So what I'm going to
start with is just

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.380
a little bit about the
scientific backgrounds.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.160
And we're on the
same page on why

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.990
we're concerned
about mercury, why

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.279
we're having a global treaty
on mercury in the first place.

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:46.070
The reason that mercury
is a global problem

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.486
is the mercury
that we're emitting

00:04:47.486 --> 00:04:49.700
doesn't stay within our borders.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.060
So the main criteria for having
an environmental regulation

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.479
internationally-- there's
a general principle

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.520
of international law that
you can do whatever you

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.255
want within your own borders.

00:05:00.255 --> 00:05:01.880
If you're ruining
your own environment,

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.120
it's kind of your problem.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.730
But the minute you start ruining
other people's environments,

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.940
that's when it's subject
to international concern.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.990
So if you just emitted
mercury deposited right next

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.862
to your power plant or
something and contaminated

00:05:19.862 --> 00:05:21.820
your local environment,
it wouldn't necessarily

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.710
be subject to
international regulation.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.107
But mercury in the atmosphere
is in a pretty volatile form.

00:05:28.107 --> 00:05:30.440
And mercury when you're
emitting it's to the atmosphere,

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.700
lasts for about half
the year to a year.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.180
So that means it blows around.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.100
And it blows around
pretty much globally.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.870
If you think about
watching the weather map

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:46.750
and about how far weather
goes in different winds,

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:52.450
you get about 7 to 10 days to
go across continents basically.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.812
So in about six months, you
can imagine that something

00:05:55.812 --> 00:05:57.770
that lasts in the atmosphere
that long is going

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.150
to mix pretty effectively.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.990
Intra-hemispheric mixing time
is about half the year to a year

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.934
as well.

00:06:03.934 --> 00:06:05.850
So anything emitted in
the northern hemisphere

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.840
is going to go to the
southern hemisphere too.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.890
So mercury all over the
world in the atmosphere.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.460
Now the reason it's a
problem is because of what

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.170
happens when it rains out.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.530
When it rains out, it
accumulates in ecosystems.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.160
It turns into methyl mercury.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.430
Methyl mercury is even
more toxic than mercury.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.705
It builds up in food chains--
goes into little fish,

00:06:28.705 --> 00:06:31.100
big fish eat the little fish.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.100
In the Arctic, there's a
really long food chain.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.210
Polar bears eat the big
seals, people eat seals,

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.490
you get high levels of
a neurotoxin of concern.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.100
So methyl mercury
is a neurotoxin.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:50.150
It has effects on people's IQs--
in particular, pregnant women

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.750
who consume things high in
mercury, particularly fish,

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.220
during pregnancy,
their offspring

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.170
have neurological impacts
even at of background doses.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.065
Lower IQ outputs.

00:07:03.065 --> 00:07:07.030
So this comes from a range
of epidemiological studies.

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.240
More recently, lest you
think all of you might be off

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.510
the hook, cardiovascular
impacts in the general adult

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.740
population.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.970
Some mercury is bad
for everyone, not just

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.150
pregnant women and kids.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.030
I'll talk a little bit about
gold mining communities.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:27.100
Mercury's used in artisanal
and small scale gold mining.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.040
And mercury itself,
at really high levels,

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.080
can also be very dangerous if
you breathe in too much of it,

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.410
but not really acutely
toxic in the concentrations

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.530
that we might likely
be exposed to.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.800
So although it's a concern
to break a thermometer

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.010
and you shouldn't
go and sniff it,

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:50.210
you're not going
to expect to see

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.940
effects at that
kind of a dosage,

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.420
and particularly not at
the dosage of ambient air

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.980
concentrations.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.400
But once it gets
into methyl mercury,

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.870
once it gets into the food
chain, you have a problem.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:07.970
Now think about sort
of what's happened

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:16.440
over the last several
decades in terms of where

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.590
mercury is coming from.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.570
So you have mercury
that's used in products.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.080
Mercury has been
used for millennia.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:30.140
In cinnabar ore, which is the
really red rock, used as a dye,

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.330
mercury was used in hat making.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.890
It was used in mining all the
way back to the Roman times.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.110
So it's a very useful substance.

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:41.590
But one of the really recent
things that's happened

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.440
is that mercury is also
a contaminant in coal.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.130
So if you look at what's
happened in the Arctic,

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.880
you can look at
the concentration--

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.935
this is kind of squished.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:58.980
This is sort of
normalized to levels

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.400
you can look in various
different archives.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.750
So what happens when they
find the unfrozen polar bear,

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.280
they can actually look at
what the concentrations are

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.980
in the unfrozen
polar bear that died

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.320
in the 1200s over here
that was stuck in the ice

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.950
and they found him, as opposed
to current day polar bears,

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.220
as opposed to the
museum polar bears

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.100
that they killed in the 1800s.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.210
And you can track that with
things like falcon feathers

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:25.388
and ringed seal teeth
and various things.

00:09:25.388 --> 00:09:27.846
AUDIENCE: What exactly does
the percent concentration mean?

00:09:27.846 --> 00:09:29.760
Surely, human teeth
are not pure mercury.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.610
NOELLE SELIN: Right.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:34.290
So it's normalized to
present day levels at 100%.

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:36.240
So because the
concentration just

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.902
to show everything
on the same scale,

00:09:37.902 --> 00:09:39.735
because the concentration
in polar bear hair

00:09:39.735 --> 00:09:41.490
is obviously different
from feathers,

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:42.780
is different from teeth.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.550
So with 100% present
day concentrations,

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:52.866
this is how much it would
have increased relative to.

00:09:52.866 --> 00:09:58.980
So we can do modeling of what
happens in the atmosphere when

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.620
you emit mercury and it blows
around all over the place.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.170
This is what the global
cycle looks like.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:09.360
It comes from some
of my modelling work.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.581
But again, you're
looking in the Arctic

00:10:12.581 --> 00:10:14.080
where there aren't
a lot of sources.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.410
You have a lot of increases.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:18.040
You have health
effects that you can

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.447
estimate hundreds of thousands
of new ones every year.

00:10:20.447 --> 00:10:22.905
So there's growing scientific
concern about this substance.

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:27.260
So now what you do about it?

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.344
You've got mercury
used in a whole range

00:10:29.344 --> 00:10:30.260
of different products.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.710
You've got mercury
coming out of coal.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:36.240
You want to figure out how
it gets into the atmosphere.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.780
So you do something like
an emissions inventory.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.770
And this is what
the UN Environment

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.430
Program put together on
anthropogenic emissions

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:46.380
to the air.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.080
Coal being about a quarter.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.625
This is this artisanal and
small scale gold production.

00:10:50.625 --> 00:10:53.030
I'll talk a little bit
more in detail about that

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:54.897
and how they get
their mercury later.

00:10:54.897 --> 00:10:56.480
The really interesting
part about this

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.530
is we didn't realize that
that was such a big chunk.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:03.540
I've been working on mercury
for over 10 years now.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:08.110
10 years ago, that wasn't
even in our inventory.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:11.176
So realizing how much
mercury was actually

00:11:11.176 --> 00:11:12.550
admitted to the
global atmosphere

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.990
from these gold
mining communities

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:18.020
was actually a big step.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:22.230
And you've got a bunch of
other different all kinds

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:25.470
of uses of mercury, uses in
the chloralkali industry.

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:27.950
Disposal of waste for
mercury containing products

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.130
is a chunk of
emissions to the air.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:36.270
Also important in emissions
to water, releases to water.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:39.561
Cremation is always
an interesting one.

00:11:39.561 --> 00:11:41.160
You got mercury in your teeth.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.330
Guess where that goes?

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:43.249
Yeah?

00:11:43.249 --> 00:11:44.790
AUDIENCE: Being a
heavy metal, what's

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:50.960
the mechanism by which say
someone mining for gold-- I

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.505
assuming it has to be
highly atomized to be

00:11:53.505 --> 00:11:55.942
able to go into the
atmosphere and travel a ways.

00:11:55.942 --> 00:11:57.900
NOELLE SELIN: So mercury's
a funky heavy metal.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.920
It's the only one that's
liquid at room temperature,

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.440
so you've got elemental mercury
that you can-- basically

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.210
thermometer kind of
elemental mercury.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:13.250
And if you put that in a pan
with gold, it'll form amalgam.

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:15.940
And then all you have to
do, you take that amalgam,

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.979
you burn, and mercury
will burn off.

00:12:18.979 --> 00:12:19.895
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:19.895 --> 00:12:20.880
NOELLE SELIN: Yeah.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.310
So sometimes that's
done in gold shops.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:26.316
And I'll have a slide
later about the process

00:12:26.316 --> 00:12:27.440
and where the mercury goes.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.690
But that's essentially
the principal.

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:30.940
And that's why it goes to air.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.140
Of course, there's going
to be some rinsing.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:37.760
And that's why that numbers are
all uncertain, because again,

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:43.260
this is a sector that's
not very regulated

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:44.900
where the mercury ends up.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.550
AUDIENCE: Why was it overlooked?

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:50.902
What changed that made it
show up in the rater again?

00:12:50.902 --> 00:12:55.180
NOELLE SELIN: So
it was whether it

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.240
goes to air was the
question, and what fraction,

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.800
and how much is used.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.550
So there weren't
very good estimates

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:03.780
because this is generally
kind of an illegal sector

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:08.660
in a lot of places, or at least
an unregulated informal one.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:11.882
So it may actually have
increased over time

00:13:11.882 --> 00:13:13.090
because of the price of gold.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.710
There's more money
to be made in mining

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:22.710
gold, so more use of mercury.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:26.610
And then what fraction you
assume of how much people

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:30.503
actually keep versus
how much they burn off

00:13:30.503 --> 00:13:33.390
has changed over time.

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:35.570
And just the
difficulty in-- it's

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:39.020
pretty easy to get
coal statistics.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:41.760
Actually, I was one
of the first ones

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.760
to actually put an estimate
into a global model of artisanal

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.330
and small scale gold mining.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.700
And what I did is I just
took the total amount that

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.919
was used, which we had
estimates of, and I said,

00:13:52.919 --> 00:13:54.710
these are the countries
in which it's used.

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:56.840
We're going to assume
30% goes to the air

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.080
and I'm just going
to grid it, because I

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.060
didn't know what to do with it.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.920
Now we have a little
better of a handle on it.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:01.420
Yeah?

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:07.266
AUDIENCE: What is [INAUDIBLE]
major discovery that

00:14:07.266 --> 00:14:11.090
will change [INAUDIBLE] that
you have showing on the site?

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.410
NOELLE SELIN: Probably.

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:18.010
I think that artisanal and
small scale gold mining

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:20.390
we could learn a lot more about.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:21.870
And the uncertainties are huge.

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:23.810
So we're doing some
work with the modeling

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:27.640
and also looking at
measurements in the atmosphere

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.430
to try to back calculate
what the emissions are.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:32.560
One of the key
uncertainties in emissions

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.730
is-- the key is that when you
emit mercury, it doesn't stay,

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:41.300
because it's a volatile
heavy metal, weirdly enough.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.195
So when it goes into the
soil, something like lead

00:14:44.195 --> 00:14:45.455
will stay there.

00:14:45.455 --> 00:14:47.490
But mercury pops back up.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:49.130
And because we've
been emitting mercury

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:51.920
for decades,
centuries, millennia,

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.450
there's mercury enhanced in
the surface ocean, enhanced

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:56.100
in the soil, it keeps
popping back up.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.330
We don't have a good handle
on what that source is

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.870
and how much of it is
human versus natural.

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:07.170
So this actually I
did the human in red,

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:11.672
and then it's technically
pre-industrial.

00:15:11.672 --> 00:15:13.880
But the problem is-- so
there was a recent paper that

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:18.330
came out that said, yes, mercury
circulating in the system

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.610
has gone about a factor of
three since pre-industrial

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.460
and we can use lake sediment
cores to figure that out.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.440
But again, the
Romans used mercury.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.280
So labeling pre-industrial
equals natural

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.850
is kind of problematic,
because although we've

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.800
had a real big spike
from coal, there's

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.310
probably human mercury
that's been circulating

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:40.784
that we don't have a good idea.

00:15:40.784 --> 00:15:42.700
So they're saying maybe
it's a factor of seven

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.370
now as opposed to
a factor of three.

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:49.550
But regardless, current
emissions play a role,

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:56.500
and if you look at
deposition to the US,

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.950
this is mercury
actually coming down

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:01.420
in rainfall entering
the US environment.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:04.770
What you see is you see
a bunch of patterns.

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:08.120
So the highest wet deposition in
the US is actually in Florida.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.190
And that comes from
global sources.

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:13.140
But you can see
that there's also

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.330
deposition in the northeast
that comes directly

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:16.500
from the coal power plants.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.610
So not going to go through
all the chemistry of this

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.026
because it has to
do with chemical

00:16:20.026 --> 00:16:22.010
reactions in the atmosphere.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:26.220
But the upshot is that if
you want to reduce deposition

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:29.180
over the US in all
these different places,

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:32.260
you have to tackle both the
local sources-- because some

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:36.190
of it actually deposits right
near the source, and some of it

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:40.490
circulates globally-- and the
global atmosphere deposits.

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:45.900
And then actually affects you.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.330
So this is really one of the
motivating things for the US

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.400
to get involved both
in mercury policy

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.540
nationally and mercury
policy globally.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:58.730
So just giving you a
little bit of the history.

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:01.520
I'll talk a little bit about
what happened in the US

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.890
as well.

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:07.160
But this is something that's
come up in the last 15 years

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.510
or so.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:10.890
The first global
scientific assessment

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:15.619
of mercury that gave this idea
that mercury is a long range

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:19.599
problem-- global action
is necessary to address it

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:24.040
was the main conclusion
that came out in 2002.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.890
So you get this
group of scientists

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:29.410
together under the UN
Environment Program Chemicals

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:33.290
Division and they say, mercury's
a problem, global action needed

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:34.300
to address it.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.360
Now, look, what do we do?

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:42.130
And so the global treaty
as I said was last year.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:44.850
Now that's a long, long state.

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:48.130
That's 11 years difference.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:51.600
So what happened
during that time.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.300
Well, what happened was
a lot to do with the US.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.940
And this shows sort
of the influence

00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:01.980
of domestic regulation in
the international context.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.590
Those of you who remember
2002 in the US, thee US

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:09.160
administration wasn't so
pro-internal environmental

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.690
regulation.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:12.950
Didn't really like
the idea of signing up

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:16.790
the US to something that
might be questionable in terms

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:19.470
of its cost benefit ratio.

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:24.150
And you know, why mercury?

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:27.640
International cooperation
wasn't necessarily a priority.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:32.480
International environmental
cooperation even less so.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.050
And the idea that we shouldn't
waste time getting everyone

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:37.570
on board, we should
just do what we

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:40.090
want to do with the
willing partners

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:43.274
was an idea that was
sort of widespread

00:18:43.274 --> 00:18:44.190
in the administration.

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:46.550
So they applied that
to mercury as well.

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:49.030
So what they have is the
global mercury partnership.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:54.310
They said, let's get
together various coalitions

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:56.080
that are going to
attack different aspects

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.320
of the mercury problem.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.800
So they had a task force on
artisanal and small scale gold

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:00.300
mining.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.590
They had a task force on
coal fire power plants.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:05.160
And they did some
voluntary activities,

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.930
capacity building in
different countries

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:08.380
to try to reduce emissions.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:12.190
But there was an
ongoing discussion about

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:14.640
whether that's actually
effective at reducing

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.443
the mercury problem or not.

00:19:16.443 --> 00:19:18.890
It's pretty much
keeping the mercury

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:21.560
levels constant at this point.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.640
And the European
Union in particular

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:28.270
was very in favor of a
global legally binding treaty

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:32.570
and had been since 2002.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:39.427
So every two years the UN
Environment Program governing

00:19:39.427 --> 00:19:40.010
council meets.

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:42.790
The governing council is
the environment ministers

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:44.260
of all the nations.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:48.100
And they're the ones really that
would set a mandate actually

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.336
negotiate a global treaty.

00:19:49.336 --> 00:19:51.710
It would be done under the
auspices of the UN Environment

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:52.470
Program.

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:53.690
Every two years they met.

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:59.740
And in 2000, 2003, US said
now let's do a program.

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:04.970
2005, not so much, US.

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:07.570
Now let's strengthen
the program.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:11.810
2007, still nothing, although
a couple of other countries

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:13.079
are on board by that time.

00:20:13.079 --> 00:20:15.620
Latin America's actually really
interested in doing something

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.661
particularly because of
the concerns on artisanal

00:20:17.661 --> 00:20:20.190
and small scale gold mining.

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:25.190
Canada also has its phases
of liking or not liking

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:27.560
international regulation.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.170
In the organic pollutants
example, the last convention,

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:34.936
Canada was very much in favor
of negotiating something.

00:20:34.936 --> 00:20:36.520
Canada mines a lot of metals.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.320
Not necessarily
mercury, but Canada

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.861
was a little afraid that this
was going to be a global metals

00:20:40.861 --> 00:20:44.020
treaty and didn't want to
really push for it so much.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.030
So Canada wasn't pushing.

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:50.930
Australia, again, up and down,
but likes its metals too.

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:55.790
So you didn't have a lot of
developed countries pushing.

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:59.150
You had some developing country
blocks getting on board.

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:00.870
So you think about
what countries

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:03.242
and what their different
motivations are.

00:21:03.242 --> 00:21:06.160
And then we get to 2009.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.700
And suddenly in 2009, you have
the European Union still saying

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.410
we need a global treaty.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.130
By then Latin
America's on board.

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:14.670
We need a global treaty.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:18.610
And now you have the US saying,
hey, let's not such a bad idea.

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:19.110
Guess what?

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:21.900
We had a administration change.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:25.240
One of the things that is
important to note about the US

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:29.890
is that President Obama has
made mercury a pet issue.

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:32.390
The US-- and I'll talk
about mercury in products

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:34.500
and how it relates
to the treaty--

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.390
has a mercury export ban.

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:44.900
That came in the mid-2000s,
when entry enforcement was

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:46.280
passed I'm not 100% sure.

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.530
But the sponsor of that
legislation in the US Senate

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:51.740
was Senator Obama.

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:56.500
So he had a interest
in mercury in general.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:01.190
And also the US had gone
through about eight or nine

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:03.850
years of trying to regulate
mercury from coal fired power

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:08.910
plants under a court order,
under the Clean Air Act,

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:11.260
and had kind of messed
it up under Bush.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:15.499
And when Obama came in,
the clean air mercury rule

00:22:15.499 --> 00:22:17.040
had been thrown out
of court and they

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.710
had to go back and do it again.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:23.030
And so Obama, being
interested in mercury,

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:25.470
said let's regulate again.

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:27.470
And the Mercury and
Air Toxic Standards

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:29.440
came in 2012 in the US.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.990
But that was well under way.

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:34.880
So the US starts saying, hey,
this isn't that bad an idea.

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.720
Because if we want to solve our
mercury problem domestically,

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:42.660
we need both international
and domestic action.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.720
This is kind of a win.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.840
It's also a political win
because protecting babies

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.170
and not having
mercury in our food

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:55.890
is a kind of clear
public message as well.

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:56.647
China-- yeah?

00:22:56.647 --> 00:22:58.355
AUDIENCE: Can you
speak a little bit more

00:22:58.355 --> 00:23:03.640
about the cost benefit analysis
and what type of decisions

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.472
a politician and
some of these people

00:23:05.472 --> 00:23:12.040
are making to make them more
attractive for this type

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:12.580
of law?

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:13.550
NOELLE SELIN: I can't.

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:16.420
I'm actually doing a lot of work
on that in my group right now.

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.660
So what they did for the
cost benefit analysis

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.580
for the Mercury and
Air Toxic Standards,

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:24.660
it was a little bit of an end
run around the idea of cost

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:25.480
benefit analysis.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.110
Because what they
said was, we're

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:28.534
going to regulate mercury.

00:23:28.534 --> 00:23:30.200
It's going to have
benefits particularly

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.260
on sensitive groups.

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:37.570
So in terms of overall
economic benefits,

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:40.090
it was hard to get
that number up,

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:43.110
in terms of a strict
cost benefit analysis.

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:45.300
Because the people who
are most harmed by mercury

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:48.180
are the people like
subsistence fishers,

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:54.220
who eat a lot of local fish,
particularly for the domestic.

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:59.860
A lot of general public gets
their fish from cans of tuna

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:01.816
from the Atlantic, the Pacific.

00:24:01.816 --> 00:24:03.940
That's going to respond to
global emissions and not

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:04.650
local emissions.

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:07.180
So in the US context where
you have to do a cost benefit

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:10.590
analysis, they ended up
showing the cost benefit

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:14.215
of-- the Mercury and Air
Toxic Standards passed

00:24:14.215 --> 00:24:15.590
the cost benefit
analysis because

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.890
of the particulate
matter benefits.

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:21.520
Atmospheric particulate
matter contributes

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.540
to cardiovascular impacts,
respiratory impacts.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:28.510
You can show a lot of
deaths if you reduce it.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:30.510
Multiply that by a value
of statistical like you

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:32.867
paid for almost
anything, and that's

00:24:32.867 --> 00:24:34.950
what they did for Mercury
and Air Toxic Standards.

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:38.240
Now are group is actually
doing a more thorough benefits

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.480
analysis of the Mercury and Air
Toxic Standards out to 2050.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:45.510
And we get some
reasonably big numbers

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:50.572
because we look at both the
Minamata and the Mercury

00:24:50.572 --> 00:24:52.780
and Air Toxic Standards,
the global and the regional.

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:55.360
But that work's in
progress right now.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.550
But as far as what they
needed for the regulation,

00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:58.430
that's what they did.

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:01.160
Globally, they didn't really
do a cost benefit analysis.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:05.240
It was we need to regulate
where we're kind of agreed

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.160
that this is a problem.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.154
Let's go with it.

00:25:09.154 --> 00:25:11.070
Partly that's because a
lot of other countries

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.530
don't have the tradition
of requiring cost benefit

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:16.240
analysis that the US does.

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:19.400
So hopefully that
gets to your question.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:19.900
Yeah.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:23.100
So again, China--
China is about half

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.890
of global emissions
of mercury right now.

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:28.810
China wasn't
particularly thrilled

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:31.480
about this whole thing.

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:34.770
But China came around.

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:37.020
Again, the US and the
EU and Latin America,

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:39.830
you get three major blocks.

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:42.000
Canada came around, too.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.370
Australia came around.

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:46.920
Africa didn't really
have anything against it.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.380
They probably a net
gain of resources

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:53.090
from this kind of analysis.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:57.230
So it's China and India really
who are the most worried

00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:59.145
about what they have to do.

00:25:59.145 --> 00:26:03.290
And in response to
China, it delayed a year

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:05.060
when negotiations
were going to start.

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:08.625
So they didn't start till 2010.

00:26:08.625 --> 00:26:10.000
China wanted to
delay them a year

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.020
because China was putting
in its own mercury

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:15.210
regulations for its power plants
as part of their next five year

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:15.860
plan.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.530
So China does have
mercury regulations.

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:19.267
They're not
particularly binding.

00:26:19.267 --> 00:26:20.600
They're not particularly strict.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:24.840
But they copied Germany's
and said let's put mercury

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:25.766
in our regulations.

00:26:25.766 --> 00:26:27.890
They do you actually have
quite a bit of technology

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:29.360
on their power plants.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.330
Whether it's operating
or not is another thing.

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:36.210
But in terms of build out
capacity, they're there.

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:39.720
So actually negotiating
the instrument

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.400
took five negotiating sessions.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.600
It was signed in 2013.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.120
Now once an
international agreement

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.060
is signed by
countries, they have

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:54.960
to go and ratify it, make it
consistent with their US law.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.530
That in the US usually has
to go through the Senate.

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:00.380
In this case, it did not.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:06.370
The US accepted a procedure
equivalent to that

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:08.170
of ratification,
the Mercury Treaty

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:11.100
becoming the first
party because it

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:15.790
was so consistent with US
law that it essentially

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:18.360
was an executive decision.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.110
The administration
said, we don't actually

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:21.400
need to do anything.

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.800
It's pretty much an
embodiment of US law.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.130
Because we're doing
so much on mercury,

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:31.720
this does not go much further
than the US already goes.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.940
So that's one
particular lesson is

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.790
that the US and the EU
in particular, and you

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:43.570
can see this also in the
reading about the EU,

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:45.630
these national
laws often are sort

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:49.480
of leading the
international standards.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:53.940
So it's actually
predictable in the sense

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.660
that you're not going to get
countries like China, countries

00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:02.220
in Africa, to do the same kinds
of end of pipe expensive power

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.920
plant controls that you
might expect in the US

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:08.610
when they don't even
have the basic controls

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:11.720
or maybe don't even have
power plants to begin with.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.830
So again, thinking
about what it's

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:15.540
sort of a lowest
common denominator

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:19.270
that you often get in these
international agreements.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:25.679
So one emphasis of the
agreement was emissions.

00:28:25.679 --> 00:28:28.220
And I'm not going to talk too
much about emissions given what

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.120
you guys are
interested in-- again,

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:33.730
that's the power sector
part-- but that was only one

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:34.660
component of the tree.

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:38.570
Another is mercury in
products and processes,

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:41.947
which I think is of probably
more interesting to you guys.

00:28:41.947 --> 00:28:44.030
So I'm going to talk about
products and processes.

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:46.363
And I'm going to talk about
what they did with artisanal

00:28:46.363 --> 00:28:49.170
and small scale gold mining,
because those both have kind

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:53.620
of supply chain type issues.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:59.040
So where do you see mercury
in products and processes?

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:04.260
So one that is pretty
familiar is thermometers.

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:07.920
So again, phasing out
in places like the US.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.010
You don't see them that often.

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:15.530
But thermometers, blood
pressure measuring devices,

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:23.340
some of the old
thermostats have mercury.

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:26.510
So this whole idea of electrical
control and switching,

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:28.640
measuring and control.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.680
Batteries, older batteries.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.320
Again, phased out in
the US and the EU,

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:39.030
but common elsewhere
sometimes still.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.700
Lighting.

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.070
Fluorescent lamps.

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:48.130
Both regular fluorescent
lamps, the tube versions,

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:50.690
and compact fluorescent lamps.

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:54.870
So save energy on balance, but
use a small amount of mercury.

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:57.010
LEDs don't have mercury.

00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:00.630
But again, with people
encouraging more and more

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:02.955
compact fluorescent and
fluorescent use in lighting

00:30:02.955 --> 00:30:04.830
because of their energy
efficient properties,

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:08.540
mercury becomes an issue, and
safe disposal becomes an issue.

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:12.850
The other is your teeth.

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:13.890
Dental amalgam.

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:21.470
So again, some countries have
phased out the use of mercury

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:22.810
in fillings.

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:24.810
Others don't.

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:27.110
It's pretty cheap.

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:32.430
Even in the US, if you
actually go to the dentist

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:33.950
and you need a
filling and they say,

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:35.783
do you want the silver
one or the white one,

00:30:35.783 --> 00:30:38.210
and the white one's a lot
more expensive even here.

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:40.120
So think about if
you're in a developing

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.200
country what your option is.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:46.490
Your option is probably
no dental care at all,

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:49.360
but the silver filling
is probably much better

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:52.630
to have-- you save your
tooth-- than the white filling,

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:57.070
the composite, which is much,
much more expensive for you.

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:59.890
So use of mercury
in dental amalgam

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:02.840
was, are we going to
keep using it or not?

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:06.030
Again, can be an
environmental issue

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:09.740
when people get
cremated and get across.

00:31:12.312 --> 00:31:14.020
And then there's a
bunch of other things.

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:19.640
Chloralkali plants-- so use of
mercury in industrial processes

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:25.650
that are phased out in some
cases, but not in others.

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:29.200
Vinyl chloride monomer,
particularly in China,

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.070
mercury is used.

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:32.950
So you've got a substance
that you think, mercury,

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:36.150
it's a really concrete
thing to regulate.

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:38.120
But then think about
all these industries

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:41.020
that you've now involved.

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:44.220
So you've got a group
sitting in negotiations.

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:47.280
I actually took a group
of 10 graduate students

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:50.260
to the final negotiating
session, which was in Geneva.

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:54.590
And you've got a group
of maybe 75 people

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:57.390
in the room,
representatives from all

00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:59.130
the different countries.

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:01.670
Industry could come
in as observers.

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:05.160
But again, if you're an
industry that does this,

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.900
think about how
long and how intense

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:10.800
your observation had to be.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.840
You're going to send a person
to every week long meeting

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:18.240
during five negotiating
sessions through 2010 to 2013,

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.940
spending a week in Geneva
each time just to think about,

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:24.750
if you're in the electrical
control and switching industry,

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:27.210
to raise their hand every
time electrical control

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:28.690
and switching comes up.

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:31.470
And they're not really even
allowed to raise their hand,

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:33.640
because the only people
that are technically

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:36.490
allowed to talk on the
floor are countries.

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:39.410
So what you can do as
an electrical control

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:41.290
and switching person
is you can go and lobby

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:42.660
your friendly countries.

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:46.050
You can put out a poster
in the lobby and say, hey,

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:48.411
this is how these
regulations would affect us.

00:32:48.411 --> 00:32:50.410
There's probably somebody
next to you that says,

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:52.310
we have the mercury
free version.

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:53.900
Come buy it.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:59.840
And so depending on your
country and where you are,

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.350
this is what it looks like.

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:06.770
In the products group, it became
a little bit more informal.

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:11.010
There were companies that
participated in discussions

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:12.760
as observers.

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:16.570
They talked about
thresholds of where mercury

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:18.720
would be restricted or not.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.390
And the companies
started saying, well,

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:23.400
there's an alternative
for this, but there's not

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.980
an alternative for this.

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:28.590
So as you think about
the major categories,

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:33.140
you have ones that are a
lot in developed countries

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.680
and then ones that are primarily
in developing countries.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:40.130
And these are things that used
to be in developed countries

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:44.860
quite a bit but have
often phased out.

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:48.540
So how do you think about
regulating something

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.260
internationally?

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:52.990
Now there was two
different approaches

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:56.710
and they refer to them as
positive and negative lists,

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:59.570
which is a little bit confusing
because it meant the opposite

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:00.790
of what you might think.

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:03.280
But the idea is
that you either say,

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.750
I'm going to list all these
things that are banned

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:07.460
and you can't use
mercury in them,

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:11.131
or I'm going to ban
mercury in all products

00:34:11.131 --> 00:34:13.380
and I'm going to make a list
of the ones you can still

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:14.783
use mercury in.

00:34:14.783 --> 00:34:16.699
So the idea of banning
mercury in all products

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:18.610
was kind of a nonstarter
because, again,

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:20.860
things like compact
fluorescent lamps

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:26.170
had benefits that were greater
than the cost of mercury.

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:29.300
Actually no one was really
suggesting that you go back

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:35.139
to incandescence because they've
actually done on the assessment

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:40.520
that if you actually have a very
heavy coal load in your power,

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.520
the mercury that you save by
going to a compact fluorescent

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:47.280
is much larger amounts than
the mercury that's actually

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.860
in the light bulb.

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:51.060
And there's a move to
get less and less mercury

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:53.030
in that light bulb.

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:55.800
So the idea that
they came up with

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:59.630
was-- there was a
lot of discussion.

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:01.940
Do you have the blanket
ban with the exceptions?

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:05.850
Do you just list the ones that
you're phasing out and banning?

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:07.570
And they came out
the latter approach.

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:09.070
But then they had
to negotiate which

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:14.680
of these things on this list was
on there, which was exempted,

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:18.780
and if there were
thresholds to each of these.

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:22.430
So what kind of level
of mercury would you

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:26.181
accept in these or not?

00:35:26.181 --> 00:35:26.680
Yes?

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:28.000
AUDIENCE: I'm just
wondering why they

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.320
would go about it
that way trying

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.280
to create an exhaustive
list when they don't know

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.090
future technology
that's going to come out

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:35.500
rather than setting
out a set of criteria

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.910
that's saying if thee
product meets a, b, and c,

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:39.026
then you can it?

00:35:39.026 --> 00:35:40.915
NOELLE SELIN: Who decides
on those criteria?

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:48.910
Or actually reviews whether
you actually met those?

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:51.710
And part of that
is transparency.

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:57.260
So what countries have to do is
then go back to their countries

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:58.820
and say, what am I allowing?

00:35:58.820 --> 00:35:59.950
What am I not?

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:03.850
You have to know what you
can put mercury in and not.

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:06.670
So there's kind of a
transparency approach

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:08.170
that happens.

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:10.210
I think the two
options that came up,

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:15.114
the either blanket ban
plus exceptions or the we

00:36:15.114 --> 00:36:16.780
list the things that
they we're banning,

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:21.310
were kind of the two approaches
that they most looked at.

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:24.294
Because again, that would
make it even more wishy-washy,

00:36:24.294 --> 00:36:26.210
I think, because then
you could show, oh yeah,

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:29.530
well I fulfilled these
three requirements.

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:32.010
So that wouldn't
be that stringent

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:35.380
in international context because
there's no body that can really

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:36.740
certify those requirements.

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:39.150
So the key with
international regulation

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:42.120
is that there's no
enforcement essentially.

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:48.480
It's an environmental treaty.

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:52.660
You can barely enforce the ones
that actually involve weapons.

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:56.050
You're not going to
go bomb someone that

00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:57.540
is using too much mercury.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:59.582
What's going to happen
is you're going to say,

00:36:59.582 --> 00:37:01.040
hey, you're using
too much mercury.

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:03.630
We're going to caution you.

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:06.560
We're going to shame you in
the international context.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:09.062
We're not going to let you vote.

00:37:09.062 --> 00:37:10.770
Maybe we'll actually
give you more money,

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:12.860
because probably the
reason you're not complying

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:15.526
is because you can't afford it.

00:37:15.526 --> 00:37:16.650
That's what really happens.

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:17.880
Yeah?

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:18.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:23.760
So I've heard from
friends that we

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:27.190
have an island in French
Polynesia called New Caledonia.

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:32.110
The island basically
has a lot of copper.

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:35.810
And so copper is
an industry there.

00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:38.120
And to say the only industry.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:42.060
And basically the
rivers that were blue

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:46.683
once have turned red
because of mercury.

00:37:46.683 --> 00:37:49.040
The level of contamination
of the rivers and the island

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.310
is-- it was a paradise.

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:54.160
It's extremely high.

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.640
And it's still
the only industry.

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:59.530
So it's the main and only sort
of employment in the island.

00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:02.020
And there's nobody who
will say anything about it,

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:04.950
or nobody pretends to do
anything about it because I

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:07.360
feel that if it's
not a consensus,

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.640
there's still an
understand that it's

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:12.550
the only way the island
can have any income.

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:14.260
And there's nothing to develop.

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.610
The [INAUDIBLE]
is not developed.

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:20.840
There's really [INAUDIBLE]
except for this.

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.415
So how would you go about it?

00:38:23.415 --> 00:38:24.790
Because when I
was there it there

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:29.240
it was really sad to see that
such a beautiful place could

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:33.365
be damage with nobody really
wanting to do anything.

00:38:33.365 --> 00:38:36.040
NOELLE SELIN: I think that's
really the larger challenge

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.040
that you see in these global
environmental negotiations

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:42.710
because you have a lot
of places like that

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:44.650
with various
different specifics.

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:48.140
But the idea is, how
do you balance benefits

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:51.130
to people-- like
building energy--

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:53.850
versus environmental damages?

00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:57.050
And the solution that the
international community

00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:59.570
does-- I wish I had a better
solution-- but it's basically

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:01.760
throw money at the problem.

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:05.570
Capacity building,
different techniques,

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:11.870
try to get cleaner
processes, build awareness.

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:13.290
That's pretty much the--

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:22.092
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] allowed
to the big countries or--

00:39:22.092 --> 00:39:24.540
NOELLE SELIN: A lot of
it's local awareness, too.

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:27.514
So in mercury--

00:39:27.514 --> 00:39:28.930
AUDIENCE: Seek a
solution locally?

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:30.410
NOELLE SELIN: Yes.

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:33.480
So in the mercury
negotiations, there

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.990
was a lot done-- so a lot of the
nongovernmental organizations

00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:38.870
have banded together
internationally

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:41.400
into a more mega group.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.370
So you have some local
nongovernmental organizations

00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:49.145
who have kind of partnered
across in mercury action

00:39:49.145 --> 00:39:50.020
network or something.

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:51.910
I forget exactly
what it was called.

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:54.300
But that was an umbrella
group of a bunch

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:57.000
of different very local
nongovernmental organizations,

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.900
a lot of whom work in these
artisanal and small scale gold

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.050
mining communities,
which is actually

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:07.790
very similar to
this kind of issue,

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:10.310
which I'll talk about next.

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:15.950
But yeah, the idea is that
you can do awareness raising

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:17.370
workshops.

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:19.710
So they bring in
international experts,

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:23.080
national experts, talk about
the damages of mercury,

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:27.240
talk about what you could
potentially be doing about it.

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.220
That's sort of where
the state of art

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:30.880
is, I think, at this point.

00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:37.390
But yeah, so you had to go
through these major categories

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:39.530
of mercury use.

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:43.780
And then I just want to flip
ahead a little bit to actually

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:45.970
what happened.

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:48.850
Again, you have different
phase outs and phase downs.

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:54.340
And then there's this very
legalese exemption period

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:57.190
where you can have
either general exemptions

00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:59.040
or specific exemptions.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.940
Another area where mercury
was generalized exemption

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:07.110
was mercury used as a
preservative in vaccines.

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:10.550
So that was one that, again,
this sort of cost benefit

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:14.710
analysis-- there's no
evidence that it's harmful.

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:16.550
Again, other than the
general sense that we

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:19.190
want to phase down mercury.

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:22.990
But it's been phased out
for precautionary reasons

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:25.580
and also because,
again, don't want

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:28.950
to use too much mercury
in developed countries.

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:31.260
But what happens is in
developing countries,

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:35.980
you have vaccines that it means
it doesn't need refrigeration

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:38.310
if you use a mercury
containing preservative.

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:39.820
So again, you're
getting vaccines

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:43.610
to places where you don't have
refrigeration if you use it.

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:47.906
So that's why that ended
up in a general exemption.

00:41:47.906 --> 00:41:50.380
AUDIENCE: I do go
through this process.

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:56.170
And when does the science
get into the discussion.

00:41:56.170 --> 00:42:00.160
Because you have at some
point to decide [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.650
They know exactly what
levels to be allowed

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:05.170
and they want to
just being reflected.

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:08.154
So I'm wondering where
does this get in.

00:42:08.154 --> 00:42:10.570
NOELLE SELIN: It's a lot less
technical than you think is.

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:13.830
So where the scientific
analysis came in

00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:17.280
was really in that global
mercury assessment 2002

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.700
and the updates of that.

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:20.590
And then the
negotiator said, yeah,

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:24.500
the scientific case is made
that we ought to reduce mercury.

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:29.260
There is no particular substance
by substance sense of when they

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:31.310
actually thought to phase out.

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:35.850
No one did an analysis of what
the benefits of phasing out in

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:39.050
switches and relays versus
linear fluorescent lamps.

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:42.410
That just wasn't even
on the radar screen.

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:46.230
There were assessments that
said where are the sources?

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:48.460
Where does mercury go?

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:51.266
But then it was really a
horse trading kind of thing.

00:42:51.266 --> 00:42:52.640
I'll give you
switches and relays

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.230
if you give me cosmetics.

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:57.050
Because each country
wants to sort of

00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:00.870
protect its own interests there.

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:03.870
Some might have mercury
free alternatives

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:07.030
that they might want to sell.

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:10.190
Others it might be a
particularly pressing issue,

00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:12.600
like this cosmetics.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.070
It might be a particular
public health issue

00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:17.680
in countries and in regions.

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:22.320
Mercury is a component
of some skin lightening

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:27.870
creams which have been--
people have tried to ban them.

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:31.820
But again, countries with less
of a regulatory infrastructure,

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:35.830
it actually-- again,
putting mercury directly

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:41.350
on your skin, not a good idea,
and can be a big public health

00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:43.440
problem in some
communities where there's

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:50.420
an interest in using these
things culturally and also

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:53.170
in cultural practices,
like use of mercury

00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:59.480
in religious types of practices
that can be dangerous.

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:04.650
So those cosmetics again,
greater than one PPM.

00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:07.810
Also topical antiseptics,
pesticides, biocides,

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:13.140
that kind of thing, use mercury
to toxic kill the bacteria.

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:15.430
There's other ways to do that.

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:20.210
But again, in countries where
you can't really control import

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:23.690
very well in terms
of your capacity,

00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:26.400
international
regulation can be an end

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:29.050
run around that to think about.

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:35.360
And again, for dental amalgam
there was a goal of phase down.

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:36.810
But again, no set date.

00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:39.270
So to the extent
that you can, use

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:42.060
the more expensive but more
environmentally friendly

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:42.960
alternatives.

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:45.210
And that actually ends up
getting into the environment

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:46.840
quite a bit.

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:50.907
Story in Massachusetts when
they required dental separators

00:44:50.907 --> 00:44:53.240
in dental offices-- it used
to be that they just flushed

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:55.610
the stuff down the drain when
they changed your filing--

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:57.594
they required dental
amalgam separators.

00:44:57.594 --> 00:44:59.010
You can actually
look at that date

00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:00.570
and look at the
mercury level in fish

00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:02.313
in the waterways
of Massachusetts

00:45:02.313 --> 00:45:05.280
and it goes dramatically
down right after that.

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:08.960
It actually does wash
right into the waterways.

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:15.094
Again, it's a lot of mercury
that's in a particular filling.

00:45:15.094 --> 00:45:15.594
Yeah?

00:45:15.594 --> 00:45:17.844
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:17.844 --> 00:45:19.510
When they pick a date
to phase this out,

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:24.390
2020, is this just sounds
good or is there some--

00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:27.100
NOELLE SELIN: It
just sounds good.

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:29.300
AUDIENCE: Let's make
it far, far, far away.

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:31.030
Not next year, not two years.

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.704
Something that--

00:45:31.704 --> 00:45:33.120
NOELLE SELIN: And
it's negotiated.

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:38.220
So people that want--
again, a lot of these things

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:40.020
are phased out in Europe.

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:43.520
And so the companies have
figured out a way around them.

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:48.380
Europe has an interest in
getting these things globalized

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:50.850
because they have very
strict regulations like we

00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:54.010
and like rows that
talk about what

00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:56.290
you need to sell
products in Europe.

00:45:56.290 --> 00:45:59.920
And to the extent that
becomes a global regulation,

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:04.060
that obviously favors-- Europe
thinks it's the right thing

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:06.070
to do, first of all.

00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:08.830
But also it makes
it a global standard

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:12.160
as opposed to different
standards throughout the world.

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:15.100
So you've got European
countries often

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:17.150
pushing for earlier
and earlier phase outs.

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:21.650
Now maybe China for example,
which actually produces

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:24.430
a lot of these compact
fluorescent lamps,

00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:28.060
probably wants later
phase in dates.

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:31.220
So 2020 emerges as a compromise.

00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:34.280
Again, thinking about the
timing of actually entering

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:38.390
into force for a treaty, I think
you need 50 parties ratifying.

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:40.900
US ratified really, really
quickly, because again,

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:43.490
it just said rubber stamped it.

00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:45.690
It's the only country
to ratify so far.

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:53.990
So conservatively at least 2015
before it enters into force.

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:57.730
So setting a day before
that would be kind of weird.

00:46:57.730 --> 00:46:59.760
So yeah, you have
to phase it out

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:03.020
before you actually signed it.

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:08.660
So 2020 is a relatively
early date in this area.

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:13.800
Mercury mining is phased
out also under the treaty,

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:16.080
and it's 2035.

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:21.390
Or no-- I think it's
15 years after entry

00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:24.240
into force for that particular
country or something like that.

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:28.920
So it can be quite a long time.

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:35.190
So going back a little bit
talking about mercury trade--

00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:38.220
so this just gives you a sense
of where mercury is flowing

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:41.650
and where it's going--
again, since we've

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:44.090
had the mercury export ban act.

00:47:44.090 --> 00:47:46.130
But this is actually just
of commodity mercury.

00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:48.940
So this isn't
mercury in products.

00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:53.740
So the compact fluorescent
bulbs that we import from China

00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:58.430
are not included in these flows.

00:47:58.430 --> 00:48:00.810
Yet primary mercury
mining in Kurdistan,

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:04.040
they're actually closing
their mine partly because

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:05.985
of US assistance.

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:13.370
China has no interest in
actually closing their mine,

00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:17.110
although they will have to under
the treaty if they ratify it.

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:20.980
But China's mostly using itself.

00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:24.570
So the mercury that
gets used in products--

00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:29.030
so you don't see much of an
arrow there coming out of China

00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:32.390
because it's not
internationally traded.

00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:35.250
But again, a lot of flows
for a lot of this mercury

00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:39.390
is coming from recycled mercury,
mercury stocks, mercury in use.

00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:41.764
So you've got mercury
flowing as mercury,

00:48:41.764 --> 00:48:43.430
then getting incorporated
into products.

00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:46.995
You get obviously the trade
in products, and then trade

00:48:46.995 --> 00:48:48.800
in wastes.

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:55.290
So once the product is no longer
useful, what do you do with it?

00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:58.190
I said that the mercury is a
full life cycle convention.

00:48:58.190 --> 00:49:00.640
It does is actually
sort of yield

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:03.260
a lot of the waste issues
to the Basel Convention,

00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:07.170
which deals with
wastes internationally.

00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:12.060
So it has sound guidelines
of trans-boundary movements

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:13.300
of hazardous waste.

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:15.990
And that pretty much
covers the mercury.

00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:17.960
So they tried to
make that consistent.

00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:22.580
Problem is that it doesn't
have the same set of parties.

00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:25.790
In particular, the US is not
party to the Basel Convention.

00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:29.680
But pretty much does
the required things

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:32.570
that the Basel Convention
does in the sense

00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:35.940
of being able to deal
with hazardous waste

00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:36.980
in a reasonable way.

00:49:38.956 --> 00:49:45.075
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] if they
cut off the influx of mercury

00:49:45.075 --> 00:49:47.158
then they will only be
stuck with trying to manage

00:49:47.158 --> 00:49:48.778
their own creation of mercury?

00:49:48.778 --> 00:49:49.720
NOELLE SELIN: Right.

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:55.620
And to the extent that
they actually use mercury--

00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:59.980
I'm not sure exactly what
the use of mercury will be.

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:05.010
But again, trade is
restricted under the treaty.

00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:06.330
US already has an export ban.

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:09.330
EU has an export ban.

00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:12.680
Mercury trade will only be
allowed for exempted uses.

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.430
So if you're making
one of those exemption

00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:19.570
processes like dental amalgam--
that might be Australia.

00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:21.650
It might just be
importing for teeth.

00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:22.680
Who knows?

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:25.590
But again, if you're using it
for an exempted use, it's OK.

00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:27.550
If you're not, it's not.

00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:30.280
And that sort of actually
is a really good segue

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:33.340
into the artisanal and
small gold mining story.

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:35.940
Because again, thinking
about where mercury goes

00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:39.910
and where mercury is in trade,
artisanal small scale gold

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:43.980
mining is a really big deal in a
lot of countries, big emission.

00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:47.610
But the question is, how
do they get their mercury?

00:50:47.610 --> 00:50:51.100
You're a small scale gold
miner in a developing country.

00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:57.430
You need to buy mercury to
figure out how you actually

00:50:57.430 --> 00:51:00.370
mine your gold.

00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:03.800
So this is a figure
from a paper that

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:07.030
looks at what the artisanal
and small scale gold mining

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:09.700
process is and how that relates
to the gold supply chain, which

00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:11.533
I thought would be
interesting for you guys.

00:51:11.533 --> 00:51:16.177
So you started at the top with
mercury exporting countries.

00:51:16.177 --> 00:51:17.760
And a lot of those
exporting countries

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:20.190
think they're
exporting to dentists.

00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:23.710
So one of my colleagues works in
the artisanal small scale gold

00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:26.280
mining area and he
showed this picture

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:30.010
of an artisanal small scale
gold mining community.

00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:33.850
And it was mercury dental shop.

00:51:33.850 --> 00:51:35.450
Like yeah, right.

00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:36.770
You're a mercury dental shop.

00:51:36.770 --> 00:51:38.830
You're in a gold
mining community.

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:41.390
But in a lot of cases,
they'll buy mercury

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:45.230
from dentists or
a dental middleman

00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:48.612
and actually sell
illegally to the miners.

00:51:48.612 --> 00:51:50.570
So then you're the miner,
and miners over here,

00:51:50.570 --> 00:51:51.900
they dig your pit.

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:53.820
You get the ore.

00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:56.760
And then mix it altogether.

00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:58.820
So then what you're
left with is you're

00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:02.350
left with some mercury
amalgamated with gold.

00:52:02.350 --> 00:52:05.600
And you've got some waste.

00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:08.122
And that's where you
have this amalgam ball

00:52:08.122 --> 00:52:09.080
and you have the waste.

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:10.740
Now the waste is going
to have some rock in it,

00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:11.870
it's going to have
some water, it's

00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:13.619
probably going to have
some mercury in it,

00:52:13.619 --> 00:52:17.522
because you couldn't get all
of it to stick to the gold.

00:52:17.522 --> 00:52:18.730
And what do you do with that?

00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:20.850
You just dump that.

00:52:20.850 --> 00:52:24.870
So you release mercury
laden byproduct

00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:27.860
into the waterways, which
could have local impacts.

00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:30.870
But probably not going
to enter the global pool.

00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:34.040
Because again, you just rinsed
it out into your local place.

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:35.380
It might.

00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:37.210
We don't know the
science on that.

00:52:37.210 --> 00:52:39.760
But you've got
amalgam ball, which is

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:42.860
must your money, with your gold.

00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:45.500
But it's bound up
with the mercury.

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:47.506
So what do you do?

00:52:47.506 --> 00:52:50.860
You can do a couple of things.

00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:53.520
You can burn it yourself.

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:58.680
So this would be
the artisanal part.

00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:01.170
You're actually going
to just get a pan,

00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:03.215
you're going to light
a fire under it,

00:53:03.215 --> 00:53:05.110
and you're going to let
the mercury burn off.

00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:07.200
Now that's not
particularly efficient,

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:10.110
but it's probably the cheapest
way you're going to do it.

00:53:10.110 --> 00:53:12.980
Now one of the ways to
minimize the mercury loss

00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:14.750
is to have a retort.

00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:16.670
So basically you have
a little cap on it.

00:53:19.727 --> 00:53:22.060
The mercury condenses and
then you drip the mercury back

00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:23.160
into a little cup.

00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:24.530
You could use the mercury again.

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:25.920
It saves it from going
into the atmosphere.

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:27.270
It also saves you
some money because you

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:29.120
don't have to go back
and buy more mercury,

00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:30.509
or buy less of it.

00:53:30.509 --> 00:53:32.050
So that's been one
of the things that

00:53:32.050 --> 00:53:35.770
has come up in trying to
minimize the mercury lost.

00:53:35.770 --> 00:53:37.614
But again, as you
think about it,

00:53:37.614 --> 00:53:39.530
not the most healthy
place in the world to be,

00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:45.860
breathing over a
burning mercury pit.

00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:50.000
Again, lots of local issues.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:57.060
So you've got this AGSM product.

00:53:57.060 --> 00:54:01.430
Sometimes that burning can
happen in local shops as well.

00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:02.650
That's more of a small scale.

00:54:02.650 --> 00:54:05.520
So you take your amalgam
ball to your local shop.

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:06.770
More efficient.

00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:08.020
That guy's going to get a cut.

00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:11.420
So you think about that
depending on the community.

00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:13.860
That might happen.

00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:18.740
Usually a buyer, who can
double as a mercury dealer,

00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:23.460
buys that intermediate gold
product, does a final burning

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:26.170
step that makes
it more pure gold,

00:54:26.170 --> 00:54:30.670
then you enter the
regular gold supply chain.

00:54:30.670 --> 00:54:34.930
And you end up with, on
the market, about up to 30%

00:54:34.930 --> 00:54:37.720
of artisanal and small
scale gold mining gold

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:41.530
that then goes to a combination
of jewelry and investors

00:54:41.530 --> 00:54:43.550
in industry.

00:54:43.550 --> 00:54:48.700
So it really is not a
insignificant amount

00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:54.190
of gold on the market that
comes out of this process

00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:55.800
and involves mercury.

00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:58.870
So again, with the
price of gold the way

00:54:58.870 --> 00:55:01.510
it is, this is
something that has

00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:05.200
a lot of influence on
the livelihood of people

00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:07.270
who are involved in this.

00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:09.570
So it's a development issue.

00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:12.000
It's a local community issue.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.890
It's also an international
market issue.

00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:21.030
So there's a lot of
different certifications

00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:24.220
that come into gold,
some of which--

00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:26.383
at least one, I forget
the-- I don't have it

00:55:26.383 --> 00:55:29.560
in my notes, the
particular ones.

00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:33.950
But one of which does
incorporate mercury

00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:37.950
into the certification
standards and one doesn't.

00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:40.640
So there's a difference in--
there's a couple of different,

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:42.840
like fair trade,
fair mine, the talk

00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:47.420
about the conditions of the
miners and various things.

00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:50.320
Whether or not-- and
how-- they cover mercury

00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:52.450
is an open question.

00:55:52.450 --> 00:55:55.330
So will that help if you
have more of a certification

00:55:55.330 --> 00:55:56.410
process?

00:55:56.410 --> 00:55:57.220
Not sure.

00:55:57.220 --> 00:56:00.660
Now how does the
treaty deal with this?

00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:02.960
Well, it has a
number of provisions

00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:08.960
that really boil down to
essentially capacity building,

00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:12.430
suggests that to the extent
possible these sectors be

00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:16.260
regulated and sort
of formalized,

00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:18.160
because they're often
informal sectors.

00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:23.330
Again, illegal mercury, black
market mercury essentially,

00:56:23.330 --> 00:56:26.780
that's from dentists.

00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:29.710
The types of
technologies that can

00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:32.930
prevent the releases of mercury
and make it a little safer

00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:36.950
be adopted in a more
widespread basis.

00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:40.420
But again, it's not eliminating
artisanal small scale

00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:43.680
gold mining because that is a
livelihood for a lot of people.

00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:47.670
It's trying to make it less
mercury dependent and less

00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:51.410
toxic, both for the miners
and for the environment.

00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:56.480
So they've basically estimated
that they could probably

00:56:56.480 --> 00:57:01.140
have the amount of mercury
based on these estimates.

00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:04.100
So there's a lot of opportunity
for reductions, again,

00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:08.950
because a lot of these processes
are really inefficient.

00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:11.320
So I want to just
end with talking

00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:16.360
about sort of the
general context

00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:19.340
in which this mercury
regulation is happening,

00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:24.670
which is the overall
international regulations

00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:27.750
and what's happening globally.

00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:32.570
Because obviously these
producers and people

00:57:32.570 --> 00:57:34.845
who are dealing with
mercury related issues

00:57:34.845 --> 00:57:37.470
aren't just dealing with this as
an international environmental

00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:38.450
issue.

00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:43.310
There might be other chemicals,
other different kinds

00:57:43.310 --> 00:57:44.210
of considerations.

00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:47.860
So this is a figure
that one of my students

00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:52.937
put together after going
through the negotiations of all

00:57:52.937 --> 00:57:55.020
the different international
organizations that had

00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:57.400
a roll in the mercury treaty.

00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:02.220
And one really obvious link is
through the existing chemical

00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:04.520
treaties and institutions.

00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:06.200
So the Stockholm
Convention is on

00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:07.560
persistent organic pollutants.

00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:12.140
So a lot of pesticides-- DTP,
PCB, industrial chemicals

00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:15.410
like PCBs, also regulating
dioxins and furans

00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:16.470
internationally.

00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:20.770
The Rotterdam Convention is on
trade in hazardous chemicals.

00:58:20.770 --> 00:58:22.440
It's a prior informed
consent provision,

00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:26.000
so it mandates
that countries that

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.200
are taking imports of
hazardous chemicals

00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:33.590
must give their informed consent
prior to that chemical being

00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:34.280
exported.

00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:37.330
This is trying to prevent
the idea of something's

00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:38.240
banned in the US.

00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:43.390
The US decides you
guys will take it,

00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:45.480
so let's just export it to you.

00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:48.550
The idea is it shifts the
burden to the exporting country

00:58:48.550 --> 00:58:51.300
to make sure that that country
knows what it's getting

00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:53.470
and knows that you
think it's dangerous.

00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:56.450
So there's a list of
chemicals on that convention.

00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:58.620
Again, that's similar to
the prior informed consent

00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:00.430
process that's in the
Basel Convention that

00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:02.129
deals with wastes.

00:59:02.129 --> 00:59:03.920
So again, there's
potential synergies there

00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:07.130
because Rotterdam
and Basel also have

00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:09.070
things potentially
containing mercury

00:59:09.070 --> 00:59:13.150
and also this issue of trade.

00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:16.590
Funding often comes from the
Global Environment Facility,

00:59:16.590 --> 00:59:20.052
which is basically donations
from the rich countries.

00:59:20.052 --> 00:59:21.760
Minamata Convention
has an additional new

00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:23.610
designed specific
funding mechanism

00:59:23.610 --> 00:59:26.400
to be negotiated fully.

00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:29.719
But that has to do with issues
that developing countries

00:59:29.719 --> 00:59:32.010
in particular have with the
Global Environment Facility

00:59:32.010 --> 00:59:33.370
and its responsiveness.

00:59:33.370 --> 00:59:38.250
So that was negotiated as
kind of a hybrid compromise.

00:59:38.250 --> 00:59:41.710
Possibly some
multilateral funds that

00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:45.810
actually influence other
environmental negotiations.

00:59:45.810 --> 00:59:48.960
But you have a bunch of other
international organizations

00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:53.180
like World Health Organization
that sets guidance

00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:56.420
for mercury levels
in fish and also

00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:59.800
is involved in
the vaccine thing,

00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:01.650
related to the dental thing.

01:00:01.650 --> 01:00:05.970
So thinking about connections
with that because you

01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:09.340
get very health relevant issue.

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:11.310
International Labour
Organization--

01:00:11.310 --> 01:00:15.880
obviously in
particular the miners,

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:20.580
and what people are exposed
to in particular factories is

01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:22.800
often in ILO.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:24.800
Food and Agriculture
Organization, to the center

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.980
that involves pesticides.

01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:29.330
That's one that comes up.

01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:31.960
So that's the
international bits.

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:35.440
You've also got a bunch
of guiding principles that

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:35.940
come out.

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:37.390
The idea that you
can do whatever

01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:39.156
you want to your own
environment but you

01:00:39.156 --> 01:00:40.780
have to watch out
with others comes out

01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:41.738
of the Rio Declaration.

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:43.090
That's 1992.

01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:47.190
There's the general discussions
over a sustainable development.

01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:49.290
These all kind of
inform in a general way

01:00:49.290 --> 01:00:51.180
the kinds of regulations
that are developed

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:53.685
under the Minamata Convention.

01:00:53.685 --> 01:00:55.310
Things like the
precautionary principle

01:00:55.310 --> 01:00:58.260
come out of these principles.

01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:01.330
And then, of course, you have
multilateral regulations--

01:01:01.330 --> 01:01:04.330
domestic agreements,
bilateral agreements,

01:01:04.330 --> 01:01:07.700
regional agreement--
that are also

01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:11.030
dealing with mercury
but on different levels

01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:13.540
and among different
countries that may or may not

01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:15.820
be consistent or not.

01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:18.570
Again, domestic
governments try to make

01:01:18.570 --> 01:01:20.850
it as consistent as possible
in the negotiations.

01:01:20.850 --> 01:01:24.330
But everyone's
trying to do that,

01:01:24.330 --> 01:01:26.950
so it might not be possible.

01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:31.400
So that's all I had
for prepared slides.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:34.470
I was told to keep it to about
an hour-- I think I made it--

01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:36.600
and open up for
discussion after that.

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.660
AUDIENCE: I was
just wondering what

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:42.540
happens to mercury
once whoever's doing

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:44.440
the proper disposal gets it.

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:46.197
Do they convert it to
some safe chemical?

01:01:46.197 --> 01:01:48.780
Do they put it barrels and bury
it under a mountain in Nevada?

01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:50.290
NOELLE SELIN: The latter.

01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:52.791
Mercury's an element.

01:01:52.791 --> 01:01:53.790
You can't get rid of it.

01:01:53.790 --> 01:01:57.330
So not much you can do about it.

01:01:57.330 --> 01:02:00.870
The nice thing is, the
quantities are pretty small.

01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:04.730
So again, encapsulating
it, burying it barrels

01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:09.000
is pretty much what
you want to do with it.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.250
Again, you're talking
about tons per year.

01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:15.330
When you're talking about
carbon it's gigatons per year.

01:02:15.330 --> 01:02:17.360
Mercury is in actual
tons per year.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:18.780
And mercury is pretty dense.

01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:23.785
So this is also why your
clump of mercury in your tooth

01:02:23.785 --> 01:02:26.640
or in the thermometer is
actually pretty significant,

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:32.300
because there's a lot of
mercury there in comparison

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:35.710
to the global budget,
whereas the amount of carbon

01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:36.720
is teeny tiny.

01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:43.151
But yeah, I'm not sure
about Nevada specifically.

01:02:43.151 --> 01:02:44.400
You could put it in a trailer.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.180
I've seen mercury trailers.

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:49.109
The strategic mercury stockpile
was in trailers for a while.

01:02:49.109 --> 01:02:50.400
AUDIENCE: Sounds pretty secure.

01:02:54.220 --> 01:03:00.010
So do you see a company
that you thought

01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:04.060
was doing something right,
in terms of understanding

01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:06.370
the role that they could play?

01:03:06.370 --> 01:03:08.880
Because this seems
pretty out of my hands.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.780
So as a company at
the end of the day,

01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:11.950
there's nothing I can do.

01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:16.120
I just probably can go
to local state official,

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:19.420
voice my concerns,
hopefully get him elected,

01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:22.145
and let the whole
thing just kind of--

01:03:22.145 --> 01:03:24.340
NOELLE SELIN: There were
definitely companies

01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:28.910
involved, but in a limited way.

01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:32.080
The lighting manufacturers
were there a lot.

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:34.930
But mainly I saw them
talk about their products

01:03:34.930 --> 01:03:38.900
and their minimization and
really kind of get the message

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:41.580
that we are trying to take the
mercury out of our lighting

01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:45.930
and we're doing a good
job, so don't ban us.

01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:49.340
And I think to that
extent there was

01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:52.020
a lot of awareness
raising of technologies

01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:55.170
and available technologies
that was done by companies

01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:58.060
in these international fora.

01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:02.780
Again, it's an
opportunity to trumpet

01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:06.010
your green technologies.

01:04:06.010 --> 01:04:10.660
So that would be sort of the
positive end of companies

01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:13.750
advocating-- mercury free
alternative companies,

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:14.490
definitely.

01:04:14.490 --> 01:04:16.950
If you had a
mercury-free something,

01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:21.000
you definitely were
waving the flag for it.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.300
There were other
companies that were there

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:27.460
to make sure that their
interests were protected.

01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:29.200
Oil and gas.

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.230
Mercury is a small
contaminant in oil and gas.

01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:35.820
Mercury is mostly
a concern on site.

01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:40.460
So because of the way oil is
distilled in the final product,

01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:41.880
there's not of mercury.

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:49.610
If you have the
unfortunate location

01:04:49.610 --> 01:04:52.930
of being near a mercury deposit
when you're drilling your oil,

01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:54.580
you've got a problem.

01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:56.450
But you've got a
problem there, and you

01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:58.200
have to deal with it there.

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:01.940
Because if you get mercury into
your oil distillation process,

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:05.020
it really gums up the works
as far as I understand.

01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:06.717
So the companies
were saying, hey,

01:05:06.717 --> 01:05:08.550
this is not really an
international problem.

01:05:08.550 --> 01:05:10.480
This is something we deal with.

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.770
We would really
prefer that you not

01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:16.290
regulate mercury and oil and
gas in an international way.

01:05:16.290 --> 01:05:19.770
And there were a lot of
countries on that bandwagon,

01:05:19.770 --> 01:05:21.550
too.

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:26.732
Once it was clear that mercury
emissions regulations were not

01:05:26.732 --> 01:05:28.710
going to be applied
to oil and gas,

01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:33.240
Saudi Arabia decided that they
were going to go to lunch.

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:36.830
So things like that.

01:05:36.830 --> 01:05:40.310
And again, awareness raising
of the kinds of things

01:05:40.310 --> 01:05:42.750
that international
industries do.

01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:47.050
So even if it's not
subject to the regulation,

01:05:47.050 --> 01:05:49.030
you have assessments
that come up

01:05:49.030 --> 01:05:51.570
that say, what are
best practices?

01:05:51.570 --> 01:05:54.760
Because your multinational
companies might know

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:58.780
this is what you do when you
hit mercury in your gas deposit,

01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:02.910
but not all companies
might be aware of that.

01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:06.300
So again, that comes into the
capacity building, awareness

01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:09.070
raising, making
toolboxes to figure out

01:06:09.070 --> 01:06:11.910
how much mercury you're
emitting in your process.

01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:15.200
These things come out of
international negotiations

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:18.539
a lot.

01:06:18.539 --> 01:06:21.410
AUDIENCE: The other
observation-- we

01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:25.750
we're going through
the importance of US

01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:31.946
and European relation to set
the way-- so in some sense,

01:06:31.946 --> 01:06:34.940
if you do what Europe
is doing, you're

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:38.710
in pretty good shape in
terms of anticipating

01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:40.470
what could become global.

01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:41.686
Is that a fair assessment?

01:06:41.686 --> 01:06:43.102
NOELLE SELIN: I
think that's fair,

01:06:43.102 --> 01:06:44.930
and I think that's
a strategic choice.

01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:48.270
So one of the things that
that's changed over the years--

01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:50.150
it used to be that
the US was really

01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:53.800
the global standard leader in
international environmental

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:54.340
things.

01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:56.300
And the US was kind
of a first mover

01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:58.530
in a lot of things
like the Clean Air Act,

01:06:58.530 --> 01:07:01.140
pesticide regulation, et cetera.

01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:03.960
And in the last decade,
decade and a half or so,

01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:05.545
it's really been the EU.

01:07:05.545 --> 01:07:08.330
The EU is really the
global standard leader

01:07:08.330 --> 01:07:10.590
in the international
environment,

01:07:10.590 --> 01:07:12.210
particularly in
the chemicals area.

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:18.480
And I think there's a
clear effort by the EU

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:23.380
to actually globalize
these kinds of standards.

01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:25.960
A strategic goal, in a sense.

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:28.070
And part of that's
competitiveness, part of that

01:07:28.070 --> 01:07:32.680
is, well, we think it's
the right thing to do.

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:34.970
Because it makes
everybody safer,

01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:38.200
and if we think something's too
dangerous for our population,

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:42.740
why should it be OK for others?

01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:46.080
But again, with these kinds of
chemicals regulations that are

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:50.150
going in the EU, you see that.

01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:53.120
Now, you do see
push back on that.

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:56.560
The US saying, hey,
this is too far.

01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:00.630
And it ending up in trade
disputes and various things.

01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:02.400
You see that with CO2.

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:08.250
But I think you do see
chemicals versions of that.

01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:12.090
But again, it's a
multi-level thing, too.

01:08:12.090 --> 01:08:15.140
In the US
traditionally how a lot

01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:17.189
of these environmental
regulations came to pass

01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:19.880
was that you have
a leading state.

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:23.191
So the US regulation for the
Toxics Release Inventory,

01:08:23.191 --> 01:08:25.149
where you have to report
if you release toxics,

01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:29.100
came out of really a state
initiative in New Jersey first.

01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:32.359
So you get a few leader states.

01:08:32.359 --> 01:08:35.430
California does a lot
in terms of leading

01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:36.479
environmental regulation.

01:08:40.090 --> 01:08:42.979
The interaction between
California and the EU

01:08:42.979 --> 01:08:45.200
is actually really
interesting because you

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:49.160
see California now copying
a lot of the EU regulations.

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:51.740
You do see a lot
of copying as well.

01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:54.100
A lot of developing
countries when

01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:58.144
stressed with the idea of doing
environmental regulations says,

01:08:58.144 --> 01:09:01.020
gee, what's Germany doing?

01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:03.899
What's the US doing?

01:09:03.899 --> 01:09:06.580
Can we just go with that?

01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:08.880
Because again,
the capacity to do

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:12.210
these kinds of real
technical analyses of, well,

01:09:12.210 --> 01:09:13.113
do we set it at five?

01:09:13.113 --> 01:09:14.029
Do we set it at seven?

01:09:14.029 --> 01:09:15.699
What does really make sense?

01:09:15.699 --> 01:09:17.790
A lot of developing
countries don't have that,

01:09:17.790 --> 01:09:21.320
so they say-- that's
really how China

01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:22.819
developed their
mercury threshold is

01:09:22.819 --> 01:09:24.656
took the one from Germany.

01:09:24.656 --> 01:09:27.670
I talked to the
Chinese researchers

01:09:27.670 --> 01:09:29.140
that have informed that.

01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:33.240
And there's a lot of
research on Mercury in China.

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:35.700
But we've interviewed
them and they said, yeah,

01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:37.000
basically took Germany's.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.270
Seemed reasonable.

01:09:39.270 --> 01:09:40.760
And also that's
going to be where

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:43.415
we're going to buy our emission
control equipment until we can

01:09:43.415 --> 01:09:45.790
figure out how to make it, so
if they're going to make it

01:09:45.790 --> 01:09:48.380
for German market,
we're not going

01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:49.880
to set a more
stringent one and then

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:51.838
we're not going to be
able to buy the equipment

01:09:51.838 --> 01:09:54.270
and meet it until
we can make it.

01:09:54.270 --> 01:09:56.780
It just makes sense
with a globalized market

01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:57.606
for those things.

01:09:57.606 --> 01:10:00.750
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
that the Basel

01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:05.733
did the same for [INAUDIBLE],
copy just like that.

01:10:05.733 --> 01:10:08.720
They just didn't-- no local
analysis, no country--

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:10.889
same thing.

01:10:10.889 --> 01:10:11.680
NOELLE SELIN: Yeah.

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:14.030
But that's something
that you really start

01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:15.490
to see in these negotiations.

01:10:15.490 --> 01:10:19.370
So it's even more
prevalent in climate.

01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:20.820
But even in mercury
you see this,

01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:23.070
that a lot of
developing countries

01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:25.580
have one person at
this negotiation.

01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:29.370
US delegation was
about 20 people.

01:10:29.370 --> 01:10:32.030
so US would have
someone from the EPA,

01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:34.110
and someone from the
State Department,

01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:37.520
and someone from the
US Trade Rep's office,

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:43.370
and they had some
health experts,

01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:46.806
they had people
that did vaccines.

01:10:49.530 --> 01:10:52.690
So they had a broad range
of expertise-- the emission

01:10:52.690 --> 01:10:54.515
control, the
products people, they

01:10:54.515 --> 01:10:58.000
were all in different groups.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.070
And even in mercury, which
is a fairly small area,

01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:03.060
you could assemble that team.

01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:05.850
Now, you've got people
from African countries

01:11:05.850 --> 01:11:07.240
and you've got one person.

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:09.547
You've got two or three
groups going at the same time.

01:11:09.547 --> 01:11:11.630
You have to deal with
emissions from power plants.

01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:14.480
You have to deal with products.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:17.120
And the way it
works in the US is--

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:19.460
I know the people who work
on mercury-- mercury's

01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:22.272
almost their whole job, because
they're dealing with mercury

01:11:22.272 --> 01:11:24.605
in Air Toxic Standards, they're
dealing with scientists,

01:11:24.605 --> 01:11:26.850
there are scientific
assessments going on.

01:11:26.850 --> 01:11:29.810
The person in a developing
country in mercury,

01:11:29.810 --> 01:11:33.110
they're probably running the
whole environment division.

01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:34.720
They might be
running environment

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:37.800
and labor and health.

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:40.550
Especially smaller
island states,

01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:44.700
you've got a couple of
hundred thousand people

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:45.960
in your population.

01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:48.860
How much can you
environment ministry?

01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:50.660
So a lot of these
regional consultations

01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:52.040
become very important.

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:55.330
But capacity really,
really comes into play.

01:11:55.330 --> 01:11:59.340
When we were at negotiations,
this negotiation to exhaustion

01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:00.510
comes in, too.

01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:02.720
Because like you
would expect, no one

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:05.010
wants to compromise till
the very last minute.

01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:07.700
So when we were there at the
final negotiating session,

01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:10.620
the deadline was-- the
meeting was scheduled

01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:13.980
through Friday, 6:00 PM.

01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:17.480
We got to agreement
Saturday morning at 8:00 AM

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:19.560
after negotiating all night.

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:23.440
So if you have a couple
people on your delegation,

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:25.340
you can take naps.

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:30.160
If you don't, you're
kind of challenged.

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:31.706
AUDIENCE: Take naps.

01:12:31.706 --> 01:12:32.590
NOELLE SELIN: Yeah.

01:12:32.590 --> 01:12:33.630
And you miss something.

01:12:33.630 --> 01:12:34.810
Yeah.

01:12:34.810 --> 01:12:36.920
Exactly.

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:39.170
So again, you have to rely
on other friendly countries

01:12:39.170 --> 01:12:40.750
in the region.

01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:44.060
And a lot of that is done
to try to facilitate--

01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:46.640
in a sense, a lot of
the African countries

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:51.430
have a lot in common in the
negotiation and sort of bond

01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:54.000
together.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.899
But again, countries that have
a very particular interest

01:12:56.899 --> 01:12:58.190
might not get that represented.

01:12:58.190 --> 01:13:00.200
And then they have to
go back and figure out

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:03.100
what it means for
their own legislation

01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:06.055
in the context of all the other
things that they're doing.

01:13:06.055 --> 01:13:08.320
AUDIENCE: So will
you please talk again

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:09.640
about this pace of negotiation?

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:12.640
Because I remember I saw in one
of your talks about basically

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:17.410
how exactly the dynamics
of the negotiation--

01:13:17.410 --> 01:13:19.220
so this kind of explains--

01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:20.900
NOELLE SELIN: So
yeah, nothing happens

01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:24.300
until the very last minute,
which is interesting.

01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:26.820
It's sort of like grad school.

01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:31.010
But there's a lot
of spinning wheels

01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:35.440
for we have to discuss things,
we have to be deliberate.

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:41.105
Again, 2002 was when there was
a global scientific assessment

01:13:41.105 --> 01:13:43.380
that says we ought to
do something about it.

01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:46.540
And then years and years.

01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:49.570
Mandate for
negotiations was 2009.

01:13:49.570 --> 01:13:52.380
So then you schedule a meeting.

01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:53.950
Usually scheduled
meetings may be

01:13:53.950 --> 01:13:57.310
for a negotiation like this
every six months or so,

01:13:57.310 --> 01:13:59.460
five or six day meeting.

01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:01.930
Everyone has to get there.

01:14:01.930 --> 01:14:03.910
You've got
interpretation issues.

01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:08.710
So the six UN languages
are simultaneously

01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:12.900
interpreted in the main room
in main plenary discussions.

01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:14.530
Most of the in the
card discussions

01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:18.240
are in English because
everyone speaks English

01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:20.180
except for a few.

01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:22.740
And if you're one of the few
that doesn't speak English,

01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:26.010
that's a problem.

01:14:26.010 --> 01:14:27.850
We try to avoid
sending those people.

01:14:27.850 --> 01:14:30.800
But some countries don't
have a great English speaking

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:31.370
capacity.

01:14:31.370 --> 01:14:33.950
That's been mostly a
problem in my experience

01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:36.444
with French-speaking
African countries,

01:14:36.444 --> 01:14:39.200
have the most problem with
finding the person who speaks

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:40.780
English.

01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:43.180
Lately it's been
a little better.

01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:47.120
The older people often
didn't speak English.

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:49.950
Younger people are actually
sort of taken over now

01:14:49.950 --> 01:14:51.640
in a lot of these countries.

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:58.980
And so the idea of the 65 year
old person that didn't quite

01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:03.740
get the message that
English was-- wasn't taught

01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:07.480
English in school is no longer
at the head of the delegation.

01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:10.139
It's now the 40 year
old that basically

01:15:10.139 --> 01:15:11.680
went to school in
an English speaking

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:14.480
country in a lot
of these countries.

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:16.778
So that's one issue.

01:15:16.778 --> 01:15:18.444
Again, if your country's
language is not

01:15:18.444 --> 01:15:19.660
one of the six UN
languages, you've

01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:21.451
got to speak on that
language on the floor.

01:15:21.451 --> 01:15:24.109
So if you're from
Brazil, you're probably

01:15:24.109 --> 01:15:26.400
speaking English on the floor
because Portuguese is not

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:27.770
a UN language.

01:15:27.770 --> 01:15:30.290
So again, if you're
from Japan, you're

01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:33.110
probably speaking English on
the floor unless for some reason

01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:34.477
you know French.

01:15:34.477 --> 01:15:36.060
But you've got to
pick one of the six.

01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:39.920
So English, French, Spanish,
Arabic, Chinese, and Russian.

01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:41.800
So that's another
thing that makes

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:43.480
things go fairly
slowly, when you have

01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:46.100
simultaneous interpretation.

01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:50.510
And it means that it can kind
of be a glacial pace for awhile

01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:53.880
while people say, hello,
I'm going to thank

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:55.330
the chair for negotiations.

01:15:55.330 --> 01:15:56.960
And I want to
respectfully say that I

01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:00.530
disagree with paragraph two.

01:16:00.530 --> 01:16:02.680
But in a 10 minute speech.

01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:04.810
And then the next
person says I also

01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:06.030
disagree with paragraph two.

01:16:06.030 --> 01:16:09.300
And you have to go through
everybody in the countries

01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:11.780
before they actually
say, you all

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:15.290
go talk about paragraph
two in the room over there.

01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:18.130
Once that happens and
you get to a deadline,

01:16:18.130 --> 01:16:20.950
you can agree on paragraph
two relatively rapidly.

01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:26.930
But you need that whole process
of getting to agreement there.

01:16:26.930 --> 01:16:29.300
So again, writing the
text-- the secretariat

01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:32.460
supports a lot of that.

01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:34.410
But again, you're
drafting in a big group

01:16:34.410 --> 01:16:37.910
of people with 160
countries going word

01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:42.260
by word through a document
that has legal force.

01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:44.301
It's a tough thing.

01:16:44.301 --> 01:16:46.800
And that's why the science, I
think, doesn't really come in.

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:51.370
Because the complexity of
the negotiations, it's part

01:16:51.370 --> 01:16:54.720
of the reason why I think
the chemicals program has set

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:57.287
up this process pretty
well, is that they say,

01:16:57.287 --> 01:16:59.120
we're going to do the
scientific assessment.

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:00.451
We're all going to agree.

01:17:00.451 --> 01:17:01.450
We're going to stamp it.

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:03.117
We're going to move on.

01:17:03.117 --> 01:17:04.700
If you have a question
on the science,

01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:06.491
we'll kick it back to
the scientific group,

01:17:06.491 --> 01:17:09.160
we'll do an assessment,
we'll agree, we'll move on.

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:11.700
So it's kind of like the
science sets the basis

01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:13.720
and then we're
going to negotiate,

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:17.740
which means it's not
always the optimal outcome.

01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:21.210
But it gets done.

01:17:21.210 --> 01:17:22.230
Something gets done.

01:17:22.230 --> 01:17:24.950
Now I did some analysis
actually of what

01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:26.700
would happen in mercury
in the environment

01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:30.920
as a result of this treaty
with the best guesses of what

01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:32.290
it would involve.

01:17:32.290 --> 01:17:37.480
And pretty much the conclusion
was avoided increases.

01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:40.790
So without the treaty,
our business as usual

01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:43.090
would be mercury increasing
in the environment.

01:17:43.090 --> 01:17:45.699
With the treaty,
probably pretty steady.

01:17:45.699 --> 01:17:48.240
So again, if you want mercury
to decrease in the environment,

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:51.750
you've got to then go through
and look at your technology

01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:53.730
regulations for
emissions and probably

01:17:53.730 --> 01:17:59.110
ratchet those down through
the treaty process itself.

01:17:59.110 --> 01:18:02.690
Otherwise, you're not
going to actually improve.

01:18:02.690 --> 01:18:05.020
It's also more legally
and politically

01:18:05.020 --> 01:18:07.600
important at this point then
environmentally important

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:10.660
because it sends a pretty
clear message that mercury

01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:13.290
is a pretty bad thing
internationally,

01:18:13.290 --> 01:18:17.940
and that has a really
big signaling mechanism.

01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:22.460
If you're a company and you're
thinking about using mercury

01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:25.590
in a process-- which might be
the easiest way to do things,

01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:29.470
because mercury has some really
neat chemical properties--

01:18:29.470 --> 01:18:32.980
this kind of thing will make
you think twice about it.

01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:39.230
So that idea that there's sort
of a consensus around mercury

01:18:39.230 --> 01:18:42.300
is bad, and they're increasing
amounts of regulation,

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:47.790
and countries are beginning to
figure out that mercury is now

01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:54.230
going to regulate more has
a strong political force,

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:56.280
whereas the technical
regulations might not

01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:58.642
be the operative part.

01:18:58.642 --> 01:19:00.475
So again, legally and
politically important.

01:19:00.475 --> 01:19:02.810
Not so much
environmentally yet-- but

01:19:02.810 --> 01:19:05.640
might be in the future
as amendments come in,

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:08.030
as the technical
requirements-- there's

01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:11.200
a lot to be decided on
exactly what technologies

01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:13.555
might be considered in terms
of emissions regulations.

01:19:13.555 --> 01:19:16.520
And that's an open
question right now.

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:19.760
And it's going to be decided
by the technical groups

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:24.420
and by conference of
parties negotiations.

01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:25.326
Yes?

01:19:25.326 --> 01:19:27.664
AUDIENCE: So after ten
years of working on this,

01:19:27.664 --> 01:19:30.020
do you eat fish?

01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:32.650
NOELLE SELIN: I do eat fish.

01:19:32.650 --> 01:19:35.460
There are fish that are
relatively low in mercury.

01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:41.150
So the key in dietary
advice on mercury

01:19:41.150 --> 01:19:44.420
is you don't want
people not eating fish.

01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:48.650
Fish high in omega 3s, but low
in mercury-- unfortunately,

01:19:48.650 --> 01:19:50.230
that's the herrings
of the world.

01:19:50.230 --> 01:19:51.960
And I don't want herring.

01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:55.017
But again, I also
figure there's lots

01:19:55.017 --> 01:19:57.600
of things that are going to kill
me faster, like French fries.

01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:02.980
So you've got to take
them one at a time.

01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:06.964
PROFESSOR: Any more questions?

01:20:06.964 --> 01:20:08.458
Thank you very much.

01:20:08.458 --> 01:20:11.944
[APPLAUSE]

01:20:11.944 --> 01:20:13.370
All right.

01:20:13.370 --> 01:20:18.870
So we're not going to go
through today your deliverables.

01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:21.870
Tony may have mentioned,
or Alexis last time,

01:20:21.870 --> 01:20:23.367
that we divided your groups.

01:20:23.367 --> 01:20:24.116
Did they tell you?

01:20:24.116 --> 01:20:24.795
Yeah?

01:20:24.795 --> 01:20:26.920
So we're going to be meeting
with you independently

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:29.510
over the next few
days to go over

01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:31.350
where your project
is in preparation

01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:32.940
for the final report.

01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:36.450
And then next week we're going
to be talking about strategy.

01:20:36.450 --> 01:20:39.240
So we're going to try to get
everything we have covered

01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:44.550
and try to frame it in a
more concrete discussion.

01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:48.450
So what are we going to do
with everything we've learned.

01:20:48.450 --> 01:20:50.390
You're going to
eventually want to make--

01:20:50.390 --> 01:20:52.280
drive a change in a company.

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:54.710
How should I start with
all these inventions,

01:20:54.710 --> 01:20:58.410
the technical side, now the
political side, the NGO side,

01:20:58.410 --> 01:21:01.660
the complexity of the networking
you have to deal with.

01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:03.160
And we're going to
have a discussion

01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:04.405
around that next time.

01:21:04.405 --> 01:21:05.780
And we're going
to probably bring

01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:07.530
some of the things you
have already worked

01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:09.340
on your specific case studies.

01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:13.780
And Wednesday we're going
to have the head of EMC

01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:17.474
to decide to actually
tell us how they did it.

01:21:17.474 --> 01:21:18.390
It's very interesting.

01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:21.270
Today I was meeting this
morning with-- the last few days

01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:25.530
I have met with P&amp;G, Intel,
and Nike sustainability heads,

01:21:25.530 --> 01:21:28.280
and how they have been
thinking through this process.

01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:31.980
So it strikes me they're
as confused as probably you

01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:33.610
are at the point.

01:21:33.610 --> 01:21:34.860
Exactly what do I do about it?

01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:36.985
At the end, you have to
make some specific actions.

01:21:36.985 --> 01:21:40.570
So we're going to at least bring
some of the ideas to the table

01:21:40.570 --> 01:21:42.705
over the next two sessions.

01:21:42.705 --> 01:21:47.340
With that, I that I
will see you on Monday.

01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:48.890
Thank you.
