00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.270
PROFESSOR: As it turns out, not
by coincidence, the Apollo

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.950
program that started after
Kennedy's speech was made up

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.270
of a few different elements of
things that had been sort of

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.590
percolating in the background.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.490
And one of them was studies at
MIT on guidance, not so much

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.290
to the Moon, but to Mars, and
coming out of Draper's

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.960
laboratories.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.290
So I wanted to say a little bit
about that story, because

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.290
it's an interesting story.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.970
And it's one you may not have
seen quite in this way.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.530
So what we've talked about
before and the inertial

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.150
guidance and all that
sort of stuff.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.990
This is the sort of very clearly
posed paradigmatic

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.240
picture of him.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.510
And during the Second World War,
they started making these

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.010
gun sights.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.860
And one of them was called
Doc's Shoebox.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.320
And then I think we talked about
that too, which allowed

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.930
him to sort of lead
the target.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.300
You can actually see, if you
go into the front door of

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.190
Draper Laboratories, they have
this prototype that he built

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.740
in his garage, sitting there.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.610
And then during the war,
as we talked about--

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.590
sorry, during the Cold War,
they built a lot of

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.380
different kinds of--

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.740
I'm going to skip
through these--

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.570
inertial guidance and
stuff, particularly

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.210
for ballistic missiles.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.155
And a bunch of these guys,
including this guy here, Dick

00:01:44.155 --> 00:01:49.190
Batten, really did some
fundamental work in the theory

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.740
of inertia guidance.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.980
It was pretty much literally how
do I get a nuclear missile

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.850
to land on a Russian city, given
the gravity field of the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.260
Earth is not uniform, and
there's a lot of calculations,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.650
and we don't have a lot
of different things?

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.210
And then this group--

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.430
the guy on the left, his name
is Hal Laning and he was a

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.630
computer guy from the
Whirlwind group.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.490
Milt Trageser is the guy in the
back there and Dick Batten

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.190
is on the right.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.560
Batten actually still teaches
a course in Core 16 on

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.940
astronomical guidance.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.000
Actually, he may not have
taught it this year.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.450
That's more or less a course
he's been teaching

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.060
continuously since
1945 or so, 1946.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.360
And if you've ever seen when
they send a probe-- actually

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.390
they just did this with the
Messenger probe to Mercury--

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.040
and then they sort of swing it
around another planet as a way

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.690
to get it accelerated toward its
goal, as opposed to just

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.635
sending it directly there,
that's actually an idea that

00:02:47.635 --> 00:02:49.110
Batten invented.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.010
It is now used commonly in all
these different space probes.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.040
And they made this Mars probe.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.740
And the idea behind this probe
was to go to Mars, take one

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.630
picture, and come back to
the Earth and reenter

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.890
and drop the film.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.130
And this thing, which looks just
like the Mercury capsule,

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.740
is the film canister.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.590
And they had also in the '50s,
they built the guidance system

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.080
for the Polaris missile.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.630
And the important thing about
the Polaris missile is it was

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.890
the first missile that could
be launched out of a

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.210
submarine, out of the
Polaris submarine.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.640
And was a major US, huge project
during the '50s.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.110
And basically they wrote a very
short proposal, proposing

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.150
to use that guidance system
to go to the Moon.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.730
And they were awarded a contract
August 4, I believe

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.120
it was, 1961.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.100
It was the first contract of the
entire Apollo program and

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.350
it came to MIT.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.920
Which is some indicator a, of
how important they considered

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.570
the guidance.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.070
Like how do you get there and
how you keep from smashing

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.360
into the Moon, and how do you
get home and keep from

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.010
smashing into the Earth
when you get home?

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.800
And b, it was the only major
contract of the entire program

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.290
that was awarded to
a university,

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.940
and not to a company.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.250
And of course, the president
was from Massachusetts.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.790
One of the very senior technical
people, Bob Siemens,

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.040
was an MIT guy, a student
of Draper's.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.560
He was essentially the chief
engineer at this point.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.710
And a little bit like the
Radiation Lab, there's no

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.980
question that those influences
helped steer this contract,

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.580
which was a lot of money.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.520
Although it was less significant
for the money in

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.050
some sense, than for
the prestige that

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.020
went along with it.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.420
And it was sole source.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.370
There was no competition.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.260
There was no proposals.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.840
It just came straight MIT.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.760
And all kinds of companies
protested it to Congress.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.120
And it turned out it was
fully legal, so they

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.920
never changed it.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.760
But it was not for a
computer, actually.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.360
It was just for this guidance
unit and it was over the

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.420
course of the project.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:09.070
And remember, this is 1961 and
all they thought about was how

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.620
do we get there and back?

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.560
And they begin working on this
problem in seven years or so.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.520
And the idea was that
the astronaut would

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.290
sit inside the capsule.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:25.180
And if you looked at the stars
with the telescope, you could

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.000
basically align yourself and
align the inertia platform.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.580
Remember the inertial platform
navigates with accelerometers,

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.940
which can be very accurate.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.300
But what's problem
with doing that?

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.860
It drifts.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.370
So it loses its absolute
accuracy over time.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.610
So every once in while, you have
to realign it and retell

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.480
it where it is.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.280
And you could align yourself by
just pointing at the stars

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.380
and knowing which way
is up, in what's

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.880
called an inertial frame.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.280
But if you wanted to actually
navigate, you had to do things

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.690
or closer to the planet.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.240
So you could look at particular

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.110
points on the Earth.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.810
The obvious one, the easiest one
is measure the size of the

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.610
Earth, because as
you go further

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:07.365
away, it get's smaller.

00:06:07.365 --> 00:06:09.620
It turns out that's not a very
accurate measurement.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.100
But it is one way to measure
where you are.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.610
The most accurate way to
measure it is star

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.070
occultation.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.270
So that if there's a star that
passes by the horizon, you

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.650
note the timing of that star and
that gives you a very good

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:23.790
sense of where you are.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.470
So there's a whole variety of
things-- is anybody into

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.160
astronomy here?

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.230
I never was particularly.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.670
But last year, my brother
brought me a telescope that

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.120
has one of these motorized
mounts on it, where you can

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.270
sort of tell it what star it
is and it'll go there.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.770
That's basically what the Apollo
guidance computer was,

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.990
where it would point out
different stars.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.500
It had a little database.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.580
And the database of stars that
was used in the entire Apollo

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.710
program was, I forget, something
like 100 stars long.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.230
And it was one junior engineer
in 1962, came to the MIT

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.990
libraries and looked up all the
star coordinates and put

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.650
them in the computer.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.760
And that's the one they used
all the way through.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.850
And astronauts were then trained
to know which stars,

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.610
and they each had a number on
them, and they could align

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:10.460
themselves with the catalog
and make sure they were

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.040
getting there.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.900
And eventually, they ended up
putting a digital computer in

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.900
it, which was a pretty radical
step at the time.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.990
Because again, computers
were room-size things.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.080
And this was a computer that
was briefcase size.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.540
And for those of you who are
into computers, it looked a

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.570
lot more like a microcontroller
than a

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.470
full-up, general purpose
computer.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:36.680
It was modest numerical
capability, but lots of I/O

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.530
and interrupts and things going
in and out, 16 bits.

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.440
And it wasn't actually a single
chip thing, like a

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.810
microcontroller today, but
it had a lot of those

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:51.000
characteristics, including this
interface for the crew.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.580
And it tied into the
inertial system.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.560
So you have this combination
of the gyroscopes, the

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.180
telescopes, the computer itself,
and this display

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.560
keyboard unit.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.620
And this is--

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.870
actually I forget who this is.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.790
I think it's Jim Lovell.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.360
No, Jim Lovell's the next one.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.170
One of the Apollo astronauts
operating this system.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:19.290
And there would have been a
display keyboard like that, up

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.480
on the main console, which he's
looking at, you can see

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.320
at the top.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.080
I don't know if you're
familiar.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.430
Has anybody seen the Apollo
capsules down in the

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:31.080
Smithsonian Air and
Space Museum?

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.500
They looked very awkward
on Earth.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.580
But they were easier in space,
where when they're launching,

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.220
this guy, he would be in the
launch position, and have his

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.470
back on the ground, looking
at this control panel.

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.539
And then when they get
into space, he

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:45.080
actually can move up here.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.460
And this is actually 90 degrees
from that position.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.300
And there's a whole station
where they navigate from.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:57.420
And what they would do would
be navigate by--

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.140
again, they're not flying the
spaceship doing this.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.750
They're just aligning
the inertial system.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:08.340
And then once the inertial
system knows where it's going,

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.160
they type in where they want
to go on the keyboard.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:16.930
And so every few hours or so,
the inertial system would need

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:17.690
to be realigned.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.620
So it would point at where
it thinks the star was.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.660
The astronaut would look through
these telescopes.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.360
One was a sort of low power, for
getting the thing in the

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:25.910
field of view.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.300
And one was a high power, for
the precision pointing.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.120
And then he had these
two little sets of

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.390
toggle switches here.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:35.840
One of them would just move the
mirror in one axis and the

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.830
other would actually rotate
the spacecraft around.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:41.330
And between those two things,
they would realign the star.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.600
It would usually be off center,
just a little bit.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.100
And they would say no, that's
not where it should be.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.390
It should be here.

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.790
And then enter it into
the computer

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:49.860
and say that's centered.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.550
And the computer would take
those error corrections, in

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.080
what today we call
a common filter--

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.130
Batten was one of the inventors

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:57.180
of the common filter--

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.835
and then update its
guidance solution.

00:09:59.835 --> 00:10:04.120
It turned out you could do
that very accurately in

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.270
getting to the Moon.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.880
And in Apollo 8, this is Jim
Lovell, who is probably best

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.480
known for his commanding of
Apollo 13, a few years later.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.490
But this is Apollo 8, where they
first flew to the Moon.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:15.900
And here you can see
him doing it.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.690
And there's the keyboard
unit up there.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:21.950
And there was essentially no
real hands-on of the joystick,

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:23.290
flying to the Moon.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.850
It was much more OK, we've
got our unit aligned.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:29.300
He did this 200 times over the
course of the trip to and from

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.810
the Moon on Apollo 8.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:34.170
This is where they orbited,
but they never landed.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:41.440
And he realigned it 200 times.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.790
It had very, very accurate
navigation.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.600
And the rest of it would be OK,
here's where we want to

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.920
go, here's the velocity
we want to achieve.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.330
And the computer would just
orient the spacecraft, set up

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.880
the big thruster to fire, fire
it, and then have the big

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.720
velocity change.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.280
A bit change in how the
astronauts expected

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.606
to fly to the Moon.

00:11:00.606 --> 00:11:01.538
Yeah, Sarah?

00:11:01.538 --> 00:11:03.402
AUDIENCE: Is that a picture of
the Command Module or the

00:11:03.402 --> 00:11:04.340
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.180
PROFESSOR: This is in the
Command Module, actually.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.220
AUDIENCE: So there was
a DSKY in both?

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.330
PROFESSOR: There was a
DSKY in both, yes.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.720
So there were two identical
copies of the computer, one

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.230
was in the Lunar Module and one
was in the Command Module.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.100
They had different software
running on them though.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:25.170
And in Apollo 13, that turned
out to be a huge benefit

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:28.680
because they could shut the
entire Command Module down and

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:37.670
transfer the coordinates from
one to the other and keep the

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:40.780
inertial solution of where they
were in the Lunar Module,

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.370
while they powered down.

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:45.460
So they had a redundant system
without really what being

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.780
aware of it, in a certain way,
without planning it, although

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.520
they did sort of plan it.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.690
And the interesting thing is
these were two separate

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:52.410
spacecrafts.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:53.830
How would you do that today?

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.220
Well, you'd have some network
and you just say, copy the

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.080
coordinates over.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.290
And all they could do there
was read it off the LED

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:03.820
display and yell it
down the tunnel.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.700
And the other guy would
type it in.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:06.700
There was no electrical

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.990
connection between two computers.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:16.610
This is actually-- the picture
in the MIT Museum, behind the

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.350
prototype of the computer
that's sitting there.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.840
It's Davey Hoag, one of the
engineers on it, just another

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:22.620
view of it.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.880
Although it's a very interesting
thing here, this

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.530
was the original block 1 version
of the computer.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.520
And the idea was the astronauts
would be able to

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.500
repair the computer in flight.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.470
And it's sort of like, anybody
ever have an old IBM PC where

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:36.080
you could pull--

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.870
I guess PCs are still
this way.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.950
You can pull the cards
out and put new

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:41.180
cards in them and stuff.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.100
That was the idea here.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.430
You'd be able to pull
the cards out.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.790
And they actually talked about
the astronauts having tools

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:49.060
and soldering irons and
things to repair

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.750
the computer in flight.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:57.220
That turned out to be a bad
idea because on a space

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.360
flight, and this is still
true today, the physical

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.180
environment becomes completely
contaminated with all of the

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.880
exhalations from the
human bodies.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.880
And on one of the Mercury
flights, one of the

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.840
electronics boxes shorted out.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:16.050
And it turned out there were
urine crystals from the

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:18.070
astronaut that had--

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:21.140
it was vapor I guess, that had
crystallized on the circuits

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.020
and shorted them out.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:25.990
And so after this, they ended
up going away from this

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.640
in-flight repair and just
building one sealed box that

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.270
was completely hermetically
sealed, no possibility of

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.240
repairing it.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.670
And how did they have redundancy
you might ask?

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:35.760
And the answer is they didn't.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.840
They just tried to engineer
it really well, to

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.050
make it really reliable.

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:44.520
Anybody know how many on the
Space Shuttle to control it?

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.170
Five.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:47.950
Five parallel redundant
computers.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:49.525
There's one in the
Apollo system.

00:13:49.525 --> 00:13:51.356
It never failed in flight.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.670
This is another view
of that process.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.730
Here's where the astronaut in
the Command Module can look at

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:08.630
the Lunar Module and
they can navigate

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:09.980
relative to each other.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.310
So you could think in your mind
about all the different

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.790
possible combinations of looking
at the Command Module,

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.090
looking at the Lunar Module,
looking at the Earth, a

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:19.380
million different things
you can do.

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:23.270
And it was an supremely
flexible program

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.630
that they could use.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:26.880
Here's another view.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.930
I probably just like the
way they make these

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:32.680
drawings and stuff.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.420
And you can see in all of them,
made by the computer

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:38.120
engineers at Draper, with
computers in the center of the

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.840
system and the astronaut is
like this minor peripheral

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.360
that contributes something
here and there.

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:49.450
Here's another one,
yet another one.

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:54.970
This is actually a view that's
kind of interesting to look

00:14:54.970 --> 00:15:03.350
at, of the position error at the
critical moment where they

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.920
left the Earth's gravitational
field and they entered the

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.690
Moon's gravitational field.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:14.190
And when they're sighting on
the Earth's horizon as they

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:17.460
get that far away, the
error is just rising

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.100
and rising and rising.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.040
And then at this critical
moment, they switched and they

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:26.970
sight on the lunar horizon
with these three stars.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:30.480
And you can see the error just
goes down almost to nothing,

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.720
compared to the later calculated
accurate value.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.840
So they plotted this stuff
obsessively and

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.140
were extremely clear.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.450
Actually, this is the
actual error.

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:47.040
That's the position of where
their orbit is and depending

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.110
on where you are.

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:50.890
And that was part of the common
filter problem is you

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:52.700
only want to take the sightings
to update the

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.110
solution when it's going to
really be better than the

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:57.320
noise in the process to do it.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.520
And Batten was very good
at figuring out

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.410
when that would be.

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:02.660
Another view of it.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.000
Here's the one in the
Lunar Module.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.720
Remember, the crews
are standing up.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:11.480
You can see them here.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.620
Here's the astronaut
right there.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.060
Again sort of considering
obviously this human and

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.850
machine computing thing
that I've been

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:20.100
talking about all semester.

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:27.960
Another view of the landing.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.800
So I wanted to show you one
little clip about the software

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.400
for this, because it's actually
really interesting.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:41.920
The entire work statement for
MIT's role in the Apollo

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.770
program is 10 pages long.

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:48.580
This is before it became
$140 million program.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:53.640
And one line says, of course MIT
will provide the programs

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:58.730
that are required to run
them the computer.

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:01.220
And it doesn't use the word
"software." The word software

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.240
hadn't been invented.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.440
And I'll show a graph
in a little bit.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.160
By the end of the program, they
were worried they may not

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.750
make the landing on the
Moon because the

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.230
software wouldn't be ready.

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:14.170
So the transition I would say
between people bragging about

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.430
how big their computers are and
Apollo, was the beginning

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:19.250
of people bragging about
how small they are.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:21.760
And then also the transition
from idea that hardware was

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.020
really unreliable.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.579
But one of the things this
computer used was really the

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:29.315
first silicon chips, integrated
circuits.

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:38.100
They bought 60% of the entire US
production of semiconductor

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.630
chips in 1964.

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:43.090
It gave a huge boost to this
budding, very uncertain

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:45.280
technology.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.610
And that made the hardware
actually really reliable.

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:52.420
And like I said, they
never really had a

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:53.730
hardware failure in fight.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:56.940
But there were all kinds of
funky software bugs that they

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.520
kind of uncover and the
beginning of that software

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.260
could kill you too.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.440
AUDIENCE: What was the
percentage again?

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.580
PROFESSOR: 60%.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.860
So I'll play this little clip,
which is from a video that we

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:07.760
made a couple years ago.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.080
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.720
PROFESSOR: So one of things
interesting about that is that

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.810
they wove this core-rope
memory.

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:16.930
And we started this class
talking about the relationship

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:20.240
of industry in New England,
and typically the textile

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.400
industry to the foundation of
MIT and how many of the people

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.200
who had founded that industry
were MIT's early trustees.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.540
And here we are a hundred years
later, and the textile

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:32.693
industry which is essentially
dying or dead by that time in

00:18:32.693 --> 00:18:38.250
New England, these workers are
still very much using those

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:39.230
same kinds of skills.

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:43.430
Literally, that software was
manufactured in an old textile

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.210
plant in Waltham, Massachusetts,
which still

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:46.800
exists today.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.660
And also we probably mentioned
Digital Equipment Corporation.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.860
They started in old
textile plants.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:56.320
If you go today to Manchester,
New Hampshire or even Lowell,

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.220
you'll find high-tech software
companies and stuff in these

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.270
old textile factories.

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:02.140
So there is this sort
of site all of

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.570
industrial decline and renewal.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:05.880
This is one model.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.390
You can see, those of
you familiar with

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:11.850
microcontrollers, it looks very
similar to what you might

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:15.110
see today, all the different
inputs, radars, and sensors,

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:19.520
and things, and the outputs for
the Lunar Module Another

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.360
view of the system.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:26.060
Totally fly-by-wife, so every
time any commands from a

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:30.180
joystick, which weren't used
very commonly anyway, they

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:33.140
always went through the digital
computer before going

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.390
out to any of the thrusters.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.790
At first, the astronauts wanted
direct wires, physical

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:42.520
wires, to control the solenoids
for the thrusters.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:47.550
But there are 16 attitude
thrusters on the Lunar Module.

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:51.800
And you can imagine trying to,
in these clusters of four,

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.890
imagine trying to control each
one of those individually.

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:57.170
It was just not possible
to do.

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:59.790
Here's one view that I like
to show from the Draper--

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:02.930
the instrumentation lab,
of no automation in

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:04.880
the cockpit, no software.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:08.460
The crew is completely busy,
overwhelmed, doing all these

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:09.420
different jobs.

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.030
And then full automation.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:13.560
They're sleeping and smoking
cigars and playing cards.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.860
And all they have to do is
look at the abort button.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.910
It's pretty much how the
launch happened.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:19.410
And still happens in
the shuttle today.

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:23.890
There's no manual control for
the first part of the launch.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:28.770
And the astronauts were
convinced they could fly the

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:32.790
Saturn V rocket by hand, off the
launch pad, which turned

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:34.750
out not to be the case.

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:37.350
And they tried to find a kind of
middle ground between these

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:38.805
two positions.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.620
Another view of that
navigation flow.

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:46.240
This one is a little bit later
and much more sophisticated

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.590
than the earlier ones.

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:52.490
I'll skip over a lot of this.

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:56.030
That's the DSKY, the
display keyboard.

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:58.990
Another view of it.

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:02.820
This type of digit, anybody
seen those before?

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.010
There's sort of a standard--

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:06.190
you can still see them
today in some places.

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:08.490
They're called 7-segment
displays, because it's seven

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:11.420
segments of a number.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:12.710
They're a little bit
obsolete today.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:15.270
But they're sort of part of
calculators and stuff.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.960
As near as I can tell, that
display was invented for the

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.210
Apollo computer.

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:32.100
There's one guy on the team
who claims that he did it.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.270
And I've never found anybody
who claims that they did it

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:36.070
before that.

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:39.320
So this kind of numerical
output, which became an icon

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:45.660
of the digital age for a long
time, was created for Apollo.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.680
Just beginning to see touch-tone
telephones.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.765
Anybody ever see a touchdown
telephone?

00:21:51.765 --> 00:21:53.050
Probably before your
time, mainly.

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:54.620
But.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:55.690
Instead of dial tones.

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:59.220
And this was the layout of
the touch-tone telephone.

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:02.650
And although in the end, AT&amp;T
flipped it upside down.

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:04.820
And the astronauts had a
lot of resistance to

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:05.710
typing things in.

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:09.800
Because again, typing was not
something that highly-trained

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.260
test pilots were
used to doing.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.200
They'd consider that office work
and mostly women's work.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.550
And now of course, everybody
types all the time.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:19.820
But at the time, that
sort of work was not

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.270
their idea of fun.

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:24.860
This guy is the guy you saw in
that slide show, Don Eyles.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:26.430
Here he is with Don Draper.

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:28.640
And I like this picture
because--

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.760
and it actually relates
us to some of the

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.800
readings for today.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.590
It captures the sense that this
Apollo project was partly

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:39.660
a product of what was
really the '50s,

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.200
kind of Cold War mentality.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.770
And by the time it came to
fruition in the late '60s, was

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:47.100
a whole different world.

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:50.640
In fact, if you look at the
naming of the Apollo capsules,

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.770
the first ones are called Eagle
and Colombia and these

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:57.010
kind of super high-brow,
patriotic names.

00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:00.170
And then by the later Apollo
programs, the capsules are

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:03.760
called Snoopy and Aquarius,
and much more kind of

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.240
reflecting '60s hippies
culture.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:12.900
And this guy Don Eyles, he
graduated from BU with a

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:16.310
degree in mathematics
in 1967, so two

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:17.310
years before the landing.

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:20.560
The Apollo program was already
beginning to wind down on the

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.600
engineering.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.840
He got a job at Draper Labs and
he started working there.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.310
And within a few months, he
was writing the code that

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.570
controlled the landing
on the Moon.

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:33.120
And most of the code was written
by him and a few other

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.950
people for the actual landing.

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:39.360
And he was 24 years old when
Apollo 11 landed on the Moon.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.450
And he was basically a hippie.

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:41.420
He had long hair.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:45.510
And he talks about, during his
lunch breaks, he would go out

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:48.730
in Cambridge to protest
the Vietnam War.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:51.510
And then come back to this
super-secret facility that was

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:54.540
working on nuclear guidance and
other things and work on

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:55.895
the Apollo program.

00:23:55.895 --> 00:23:57.110
And he's this great example.

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:58.270
And he's still around.

00:23:58.270 --> 00:23:59.560
And he's friend of
mine these days.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.620
And he comes to speak
in my Apollo class.

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.080
And he's actually
a visual artist.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:06.090
He does photography downtown.

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:11.470
And of the way that, on the
campus you have this mixture

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:14.500
of different kinds of cultures
and different sorts of

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:18.470
politics, mixing very freely
on the campus.

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:21.330
And he never found any
problem with that.

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:24.960
And he did his job just fine.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.030
And he worked at Draper Labs for
another 25 years until he

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:32.120
retired about 10 years ago.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.340
This is an interesting
one because it

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:34.860
also shows you how--

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:36.810
this thing right here
is a paper tape.

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:40.260
And they would literally take
the code from the computer,

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:42.950
and very much in the same spirit
of the numerically

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:46.070
controlled machine tools that we
talked about, feed the code

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:48.590
into this paper tape, into
this big machine.

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:51.980
And it would automatically
position this frame over the

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.680
hole, where she's putting
her needle through.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:57.250
So they did manage to automate
it somewhat, where all the

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:59.300
worker had to do was thread the
needle, wait for the thing

00:24:59.300 --> 00:24:59.920
to move, and thread it.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.020
She didn't have to look
up a binary chart and

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:03.910
then find it there.

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:06.025
So that work was becoming
increasingly automated.

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:13.950
These are some of the people
who were involved in the

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:15.770
thing, some of who you
saw in the video.

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:18.390
This guy Joe Gavin
was at MIT grad.

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:21.730
He just died, I think less
than a year ago.

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:25.100
And he was vice president of
Grumman when they made the

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:29.210
Lunar Lander and then became
president of Grumman later.

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:30.730
And these other guys are mostly

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:32.400
programmers of various kinds.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:35.170
And they mentioned Margaret
Hamilton, one of the very few

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:38.550
women engineers on
the program.

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:43.530
Here's the manpower for
hardware, which peaks in '65

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:44.500
and goes down.

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:48.690
And then the software manpower
just goes right up and almost

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:50.380
swamps them by the end.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.315
I'll just say a little bit
more about the landing.

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:07.820
The landing was the most
challenging part

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.850
of the entire mission.

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:13.360
And up until this point right
here, at about 50,000 feet, it

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.590
was entirely controlled
by this computer.

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:18.700
So all these programmers down
in Cambridge are sitting

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:20.460
there, watching it on
the big screen.

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:22.980
And there's a room full of
people like this size.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:25.090
And each one of them has a
little piece of that program

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:26.180
that's written in.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.680
And they're all sort of
contributing in real time.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:31.760
While the astronauts are
standing there monitoring,

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.700
until about 500 feet.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:37.770
And they have this very clever
thing where the computer would

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:41.480
spit out a number, which you
could see down here, like 43.

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.210
And then the commander, this
would be Neil Armstrong, would

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:48.000
look through his window at this
number, minus 43, and he

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.960
could look out and see where
the target point was.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.630
And the idea was then he could
change the target point if he

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:56.190
didn't like where it was.

00:26:56.190 --> 00:27:00.550
And this is another view
of what he might see.

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:03.820
So there would be that the
landing site there, just sort

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:06.256
of a passive heads-up display.

00:27:06.256 --> 00:27:09.350
And he could actually jog his
joystick and just say, I don't

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:10.200
like that landing site.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.530
I want to kick it over there.

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:12.700
It would move by a degree.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:14.940
And then the computer would
recalculate the entire

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.720
trajectory and bring
them that way.

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.830
And he could do that laterally
and fore and aft, as many

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:22.330
times as he wanted in the
course of the landing.

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:24.280
And in some of the landings,
they actually did it up to 18

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.430
or 20 times.

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:27.290
And the idea was it would
gradually converge on a

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:28.980
perfect spot.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.920
And the interesting thing about
that, which is sort of

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.650
the topic of another story, is
that on all six landings, they

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:39.080
turned that system off at about
500 feet and they flew

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.120
it in a more semi-automatic
mode, still

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.580
very much fly by wire.

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:47.920
But then the story of the Apollo
landings became, the

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:51.300
astronaut intervenes, turns
off this sort of balky

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:54.360
technology, which is landing him
in a crater, and saves the

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.260
day by finding the perfect spot
and bringing it down.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.220
And it was not really an
accurate story because the

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:03.380
whole system was designed to
interact with the operator to

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.680
allow them to select the
right kind of spot.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.680
But they all turned
it off anyway.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.630
They just wanted to fly.

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:15.060
Actually Dave Scott, who
is an MIT graduate--

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.910
it's about a third of the people
who walked on the Moon

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:19.190
had degrees from MIT.

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:25.250
And I teach a graduate course in
AeroAstro with Larry Young

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:27.540
on this whole story.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:31.560
And we often have the Apollo
astronauts in to

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:32.390
speak to the students.

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:34.850
And they'll tell you, they were
either Larry's office

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:37.410
mates or a few of them were
his master's students when

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:39.230
they were here in
the early '60s.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:41.280
And actually tomorrow, Dave
Scott is going to come.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.160
He was the commander
of Apollo 15.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.420
And he's the only one who I
think gave a really accurate

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:48.290
description of what happened
in these last seconds.

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:52.790
He said, you can say that you
wanted to be in the loop if

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:53.670
anything went wrong.

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:55.490
But you knew that if something
went wrong with a computer,

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:57.680
you were dead anyway.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.210
But I came away that whole
way and darn it, I

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:00.480
just wanted to fly.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:04.600
And so they all ended
up flying it the

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.310
last 500 feet or so.

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:10.260
And then NASA and the public
and the press could all say

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:18.610
that sort of traditional
American values were confirmed

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:21.190
by these sort of cowboy
astronauts landing on the Moon

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.870
by themselves.

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:25.280
But actually there was this
MIT-designed computer there.

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.960
And it's an interesting story
too about MIT educations,

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:31.700
because the earlier crews--

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:35.480
Aldren had a Ph.D. from MIT.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.680
And the earlier astronauts
were not

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.310
very academic engineers.

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:43.880
But gradually over
time, they became

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.440
much more highly educated.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.700
And MIT, with the exception of
West Point and the Naval

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.930
Academy and Air Force Academy,
the service academies, MIT has

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:54.660
trained more astronauts
than any other school.

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:59.150
And it became increasingly sort
of de rigeur to have a

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:01.380
master's or a Ph.D
in engineering.

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:05.290
And those crews were much more
accepting of these advanced

00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:07.810
techniques for the guidance and
much less interested in

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:10.270
just flying it on in
by themselves.

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:12.400
Alan Shepard, and we mentioned
his flight, he

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.650
commanded Apollo 14.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.750
And he said, aah, if the
computer failed, I could have

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:22.990
just taken over and landed
by myself on the Moon.

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:25.750
Which is physically impossible,
because you're

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:30.090
looking at a terrain landscape
that has zero indicators of

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:31.690
how far away from it you are.

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:33.950
You could actually be six inches
or six miles and you

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:35.330
wouldn't be able to tell the
difference because there's no

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:40.480
trees, there's no trucks,
there are no highways,

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.640
anything to give you
a sense of scale.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:47.295
And he had a problem with
his landing radar.

00:30:47.295 --> 00:30:49.300
It didn't come in until
the last few minutes.

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:52.330
But if the landing radar had
never come in, he said he

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:53.380
would have landed it anyway.

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:55.175
And he probably would
have crashed, if he

00:30:55.175 --> 00:30:56.990
had tried to do that.

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:58.710
They're actually using this--

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:01.010
anybody want to guess
what this is, what

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:02.260
this diagram portrays?

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:08.140
It's actually a model of
the lunar terrain.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:10.506
So if you've ever programmed a
control system-- we used to

00:31:10.506 --> 00:31:13.680
have this problem building
underwater robots all time--

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:17.040
and you want to hold
a fixed altitude.

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.170
If you're cruising along the
bottom of the ocean in a robot

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:21.320
that's programmed to hold a
fixed altitude, so it's

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:24.270
sending a sonar beam off the
bottom and trying to hold an

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:27.940
altitude, and then you go over
a hole, the vehicle is going

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.440
to dive down like this
and smash into

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.720
the side of the hole.

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.360
And same thing here.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:36.640
If you're trying to fly over
a mountain range--

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.940
it's not a coincidence that
the site for the Apollo 11

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:41.760
landing was called the
Sea of Tranquility.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:45.070
They found the flattest, most
even terrain they could find.

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:47.270
But the geologists who were
running the science

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:50.220
experiments, really wanted to go
into places where there was

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.190
a lot of geological activity,
so the terrain

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:54.690
was a lot more crazy.

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:58.360
And on the later flights, they
really did land very much high

00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.560
up in the mountains.

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:03.450
And this is just a way, where
with five line segments, in a

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:07.310
very, very simple computer
model, all it takes is these

00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:11.770
five line segments and like six
numbers, you could model

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:12.960
that there were mountains
here.

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:15.440
And then you expected the
terrain to go like that.

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.060
And the computer model could eat
all that stuff for lunch

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:20.300
and it would keep a very stable
trajectory and allow

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:23.030
you to go over the mountains,
and then land right at the

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:26.820
edge, which is what they did on
Apollo 15, and 16, and 17,

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:28.130
a very clever thing.

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:34.930
That's the view out the window,
of Aldrin's side.

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:38.750
AUDIENCE: When do you begin to
see the sort of the decline in

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:44.570
the pilot-orientedness
of the astronauts

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:47.230
wanting to control more?

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:51.070
Because the thing that your
lecture brings to my mind is

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:54.320
the book, The Right Stuff, in
which that's a big issue.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:58.880
But clearly what you're saying
is over time, that declines.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.900
PROFESSOR: Hopefully,
we're seeing it now.

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:03.280
After the Moon landing,
what did they do?

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:06.240
They started sending an
airplane into orbit.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.020
It wasn't the wisest choice.

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.540
But it was because the
astronauts wanted to fly

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:12.860
something that had
wings on it.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.310
And it's not a very efficient
way to go to and from space.

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:21.890
AUDIENCE: So was Alex Roland
right all along?

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:24.140
PROFESSOR: Yeah, in some way.

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:28.060
But from MIT's point of view,
again building into the Bill

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:34.720
Leslie piece from today, the
Apollo program ends in 1972.

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:37.230
It has this huge triumph
in 1969.

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:40.000
And that's right when all
these protests end up

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.050
happening and the Draper
Labs gets spun out.

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:45.840
They were extremely offended
and insulted by that move.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:49.310
And there is still hard feelings
about it today.

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:52.950
A lot of the people who worked
at the Instrumentation Lab

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:55.050
were happy to work on
a civilian project.

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:57.660
And one of the reasons they
liked working on Apollo was

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.410
that it was a non-weapons
kind of project.

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:03.240
And then they felt like they
got the bad end of the rap

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.690
during a lot of the
protests anyway.

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:06.710
There was still a lot of
military funding and a lot of

00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:10.139
weapons work going on there.

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:14.590
But it's sort of this irony of
this moment when this part of

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:20.159
MIT has this world shattering
technological triumph in a

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:23.580
way, and then also becomes
the brunt of it.

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:26.210
And it just shows you again the
ways that all these things

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:27.870
on this campus and in
the country were

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:29.159
conflicted at the time.

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:33.530
And somebody wrote recently
that at the time it seemed

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:36.060
like the hippies and the Moon
landings were the furthest

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:36.650
thing apart.

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:39.690
One of them was the military
industrial complex and one of

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:42.400
them was this kind of Utopian
vision of the world.

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:45.030
But looking back 30 years later,
you can see they have a

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.690
lot in common.

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:48.469
They were both sort of Utopian,
futuristic visions

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:52.239
that never quite succeeded in
the promise that they held.

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:55.210
And yet they both influenced
the world in different ways

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:57.139
that people hadn't
really expected.

00:34:57.139 --> 00:34:58.460
And that was true on campus.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:01.170
So mentioned in their response
paper, I'm forgetting who,

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:08.310
about how it was really the
one moment there was major

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:09.930
political activism on campus.

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:11.060
There were other places too.

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:15.100
But in this entire story, we
were teaching you the history

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:19.670
of Yale University or
NYU or Columbia.

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:22.280
It's a very political story
the way the students are

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:25.600
responding to the currents in
the outside world and how

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:26.900
those things played
out on campus.

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:30.870
And it's a much more muted story
here for reasons that

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:31.890
might be worth discussing.

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:35.740
And in the discussion, it's
really remarkable and notable

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:39.700
this one moment in the '70s,
when it happened.

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:45.455
And whereas, I went to college
at Yale in the '80s and there

00:35:45.455 --> 00:35:49.080
were students being arrested all
the time for protests and

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:51.470
occupying the president's
office and things.

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:55.680
It became almost a kind of
a cartoon of itself,

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.040
it happened so often.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:04.400
Well, if you noticed in the
150th Exhibit, one of the 150

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:07.960
objects is a tape of the
Grateful Dead playing on the

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.710
front steps of the
student center.

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:13.390
And I think it was April 1970,
was that when Kent State was?

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:17.010
And the thing they write about
it, it was within a week after

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:18.940
Kent State.

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:21.130
And the campus was
extremely tense.

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:23.540
Everybody was very unsure what
was going to happen.

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:26.360
And when they played their
music, they were very aware of

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.240
that and really tried to make
it be a sort of soothing,

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:34.980
calming moment as opposed to
a fractious, contentious,

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:36.360
potentially violent moment.

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:39.080
And that's one of the reasons
Debbie chose it as part of the

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.330
150 objects.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.930
AUDIENCE: Very interesting.

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:48.040
PROFESSOR: So that takes
us up to 1970 or so.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:51.220
And then there's four more
decades to deal with, between

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:53.360
now and then, some of
which we read about.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:58.670
The Cambridge recombinant DNA
story is in some ways very

00:36:58.670 --> 00:37:01.200
much a continuation of
this sort of story.

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.113
Cambridge was, I'm not sure how
much it still is, it still

00:37:04.113 --> 00:37:07.280
is a little bit, a very
left-leaning community outside

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:11.520
of the university, very
activist, very concerned about

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.900
these big, potentially
scary technologies.

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:19.730
That was very much the mood of
the time, was what is this big

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:22.670
nasty force of technology
doing to our world?

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:24.900
And MIT, it was pretty
easy for to become

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.460
the center of that.

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:30.040
And John Durant's piece shows
you how that played out,

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:35.950
arguably in a constructive way,
a very interesting one.

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:38.140
And then in '80s,
the military--

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:40.940
we talked about this a little
bit last time--

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:43.100
got very much going again
under Reagan.

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:47.060
And a lot of money came into
computer science and other

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:49.250
engineering disciplines.

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:53.840
But also the economics of
technology and the challenge

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.470
from Japan became a big issue.

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:57.490
That had a lot of influence
on campus.

00:37:57.490 --> 00:38:01.480
All the while, biotech and
biology is sort of creeping up

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:06.138
in importance and
dollar value.

00:38:06.138 --> 00:38:09.040
And then the Cold War ends.

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:13.840
Chuck Vest becomes president in
the late either '89 or '90,

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.590
'91 I think.

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:17.660
He became president right about
when I came here as a

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:18.930
grad student.

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:21.550
And the big question on
everybody's mind was what at

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:22.800
that point?

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:29.690
MIT is dependent on government
funding for so long.

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:32.720
Now that the Cold War is over,
are we going to just shrivel

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.140
up and die?

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:36.600
And the pendulum goes again.

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:39.010
Where do they go?

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:40.210
Back towards industry.

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:41.980
And the '90s is very much--

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:44.100
I mean the government research
support is always there, but

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.040
very much industry.

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:52.240
I remember Chuck Vest saying--
it was probably pretty late in

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.950
his presidency, soon before he
stepped down, in a faculty

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:58.030
meeting, I've spent so many
years cultivating industrial

00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:59.830
sponsors, it's very difficult.

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:01.320
It's very time consuming.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:03.570
I would be very happy for the
government to start up again

00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:04.350
and support--

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:07.770
I mean it didn't go down
ever, as much as

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:09.460
people feared it did.

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:14.890
But it became less of a
percentage of MIT's income.

00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:18.480
Then the financial crisis in '08
happens and the stimulus

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.890
package comes in,
more government.

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:23.980
And the government runs out
of money, less government.

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:25.770
So this pendulum
keeps swinging.

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:30.440
AUDIENCE: The periods
are shorter.

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:31.710
PROFESSOR: The periods
are maybe shorter.

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:32.960
It could be true.
