00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.270
OK.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.850
Let's get started.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.040
One announcement
is a reminder.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.040
There is a paper due on April
4, and Michaela will be

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.805
sending out a formal assignment
about that within a

00:00:42.805 --> 00:00:43.320
day or two.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.490
So you can get started on
that whenever you like.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.680
And we can talk about it more
next week after the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.950
assignment comes out.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.260
But for the most part, what it's
going to look like is an

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.390
assignment to do a little more
digging and some research

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.410
into, basically, people, place,
or thing in the part of

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.750
the history of MIT that
we've covered so far.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.530
So take a particular person--

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.280
maybe one of the signers of
the charter or one of the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.600
early professors or an
early student here--

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.760
a place, one particular building
from the period up to

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.970
1915 or so.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.480
And we say thing, but I think
that could be an instrument or

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.070
a laboratory that is of interest
and do a little

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.770
profile of that about what was
it used for, what were people

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.330
studying in the laboratory,
and how were

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.530
people being taught--

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.800
and basically, to focus on the
first 65 years or so--

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.330
50 years or so.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.010
The 50th anniversary of MIT is
1911, so something from that

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.270
early period that
interests you.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.720
There's a lot of material, both
online, but also in the

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.020
MIT archives, in
the libraries.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.310
Actually, a really good source
is just, of the books that

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.460
we've been assigning pieces of,
you can just look further

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.280
into those books.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.730
And Michaela will help you with
that and actually have

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.150
maybe a special session on some
of the research methods

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.740
and what to expect for that.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.400
So that's coming along.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.300
And next week, we'll have Ros
Williams in, who will talk

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.430
about a combination of things.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.860
She's a historian of
technology as well.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.520
She's written about the
history of MIT and the

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.415
chemical engineering department,
which happens to

00:02:37.415 --> 00:02:39.830
have been founded by her
grandfather, who had a lot of

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.830
interesting personalities on
campus and things he was

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.050
involved in.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.550
Today, we are lucky to have Ross
Bassett with us who is a

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.780
colleague of ours from NC State,
has written a very good

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.020
book on the history of CMOS
technology and the equation of

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.380
the semiconductor integrated
circuits.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.880
And now, he's working on this
book part of the assignment,

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.660
which was the reading today on
the Indian students at MIT.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.000
And he's going to talk to us
a little bit about that.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.990
And over lunch, it was just
becoming clear how many of the

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.790
issues that were raised both
in the readings and also in

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.800
the response papers for today
are, as some of you pointed

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.400
out, relevant for issues
on campus.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.080
We happened to be sitting two
tables down from Tom Mangnati,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.560
who's the former dean of
engineering here and the

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.430
president of the new university
in Singapore that

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.090
MIT has founded based
on the principle of

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.250
organizing around design.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.880
And so as many of you will have
heard from a variety of

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.600
things, MIT's relationships with
the rest of the world--

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.380
its profile abroad is very much
a topic of conversation

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.890
at MIT these days.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.220
How many of you work in a lab
that has some connection with

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.340
Singapore or some other
international research group?

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.620
So a few of you do.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.430
And how many of you were born
and raised in the US versus--

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.400
so yeah.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.680
Undergraduates--

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.290
very much more American-based.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.089
The undergraduate population
is capped at about 8%

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.730
international students, whereas
the graduate student

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.760
population is probably--

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.380
I don't know the
exact number--

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.785
50% or 60% international
students.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.140
But even of the US-born,
US-raised undergraduate

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.170
students, many come from
families, first generation

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.990
immigrants or whatnot.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.140
We've talked about that
a little bit before.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.750
So Ros will talk to us a
little bit about Indian

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.890
students at MIT.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.455
It's a very interesting case.

00:04:47.455 --> 00:04:49.540
There's a lot of interesting
reasons to be interested in

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.860
India and MIT's relationships
there-- but also not

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.610
necessarily typical, but
representative of MIT's

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:03.670
relationships with Japan, China,
Iran, Middle East--

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.020
lots of different places
around the world.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.970
All of them are a little bit
special, but they're certainly

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.290
part of a longer story here.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.490
So he's going to talk for a
little bit, put the article in

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.650
the context of a larger project
that he's working on,

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.220
and then we can pick up
the discussion there.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.770
And I think that'll naturally
segue into also this

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.370
particular period that
we've come into--

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.090
turn of the century up through
the beginning of World War II,

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.120
the technology plan,
relationships with industry.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.710
Again, so many of the issues
from the reading that were on

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.700
the table in 1915, 1930 are
still issues that are on the

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.956
table today in some
form or another.

00:05:42.956 --> 00:05:46.270
ROSS BASSETT: Thanks, David
and Roe and Michaela.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.170
I think it's a good strategy to
start out by sucking up to

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.700
your audience.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.460
So let me do that.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.090
I've got my Ph.D.
from Princeton.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.670
And there was a Professor,
Michael

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.450
Borden, who went to Harvard.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.020
And when he went to Harvard, he
had a roommate at Harvard

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.140
who was of Indian ancestry.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:08.760
And Michael reported that his
roommate told him how all his

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.360
family back in India were all so
proud that they had someone

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.860
in their family who went
to a school near MIT.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.010
And it gives you an idea, I
think, of what the sense of

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.170
MIT is in India.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.830
And so I've been to India
a lot and I've

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.520
seen that first hand.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:34.540
So a couple things, just to put
this in context and why

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.650
I'm interested in this.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.700
I've been interested in India
for a long time, and I'm also

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.710
interested in globalization,
of course.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.900
That's a big buzz
word these days.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.850
But one of the ways I think
about history and how we can

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.580
find interesting history topics
is sort of a thought

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.230
experiment.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:57.530
Imagine, say, what would
surprise someone coming to the

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.970
year 2011 from, say,
100 years ago?

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.560
Say, President Maclaurin--

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.890
what would surprise them
about the world

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:08.200
today if they saw it?

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.160
And so I think about that,
I guess, especially

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.230
with regard to India.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:15.370
And let me just say some of the
things that I think would

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.050
be pretty surprising.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.250
I guess anything involving
Indians in the United States

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.300
would be surprising, because
they were actually laws

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:30.100
limiting Indians from staying
permanently in America.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.820
It was very questionable whether
an Indian, someone

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.720
from India, could even become a
citizen of the United States

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.926
until 1920.

00:07:36.926 --> 00:07:41.240
Until 1965, the United States
had laws which basically said,

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.280
we really don't want Indians
in the United States.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.770
There was an annual quota
of 100 people.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:51.230
But let me tell you some things
about the world of 2011

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:54.090
that is sort of surprising
in that regard.

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:56.330
Silicon Valley--

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:57.130
my apologies--

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:58.710
but the most dynamic

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.570
technological area in the world.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:05.270
It's commonly said that Silicon
Valley runs on ICs.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.050
And that doesn't mean
integrated circuits.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.560
It means Indians and Chinese.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.060
People understand that Indian
and Chinese entrepreneurs are

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.670
some of the key figures who
really start businesses

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:20.560
successfully, help move
the technology along.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:26.100
I think of that school
down the road a bit.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:30.290
They just appointed a new dean
of their business school.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:36.929
His name is Nitin Nohria, an
Indian who came to Harvard.

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:40.890
MIT itself, the former dean of
engineering, Subra Suresh,

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.419
also from India.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:45.430
Now he's the head of the
National Science Foundation,

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:50.230
one of the leading funders of
science and technological

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:53.570
research in the United States,
setting the agenda for

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.170
scientific research.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.520
I think of--

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.200
do you know the building that's
right across Vassar

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.350
Street from the Stata Center,
the Institute for Brain

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:05.780
Research, that the
train tracks go

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.370
through the middle of?

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.480
That was designed by Charles
Correa, an Indian, someone

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.010
who's the leading Indian
architect.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.520
And so he lives in India.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.970
This was his first commission
ever in the United States for

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.960
an American client.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.220
And so the point of this is
that Indians play a very

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:32.070
prominent role in technology
in the United States today,

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.710
which I think would have been
very, very surprising to

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.500
anyone 100 years ago.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.100
And then if we look at India
itself, there are a number of

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.520
things, I think, that are
surprising as well.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.910
We're used to seeing everything
that we buy from

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:48.660
Walmart or Target or whatever
having a "made in

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.110
China" stamp on it.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:55.840
We can't really judge the
provenance of software code or

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.630
something like that.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:00.500
But if could, we'd probably be
surprised at how much software

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.600
would have the tag
"coded in India."

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:09.530
And I was in India in October
and visited a place where they

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:14.000
made transmission components for
Fords and GMs in a place

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.840
in Pune, India.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:22.150
Another big Indian company is
set to, I think this year,

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:25.920
begin selling its model SUV
in the United States.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.120
So India is playing a remarkable
technological role

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.700
in United States.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.980
We might have considered
that inconceivable 100

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.660
years ago or so.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:41.140
So that's what I've been
interested in looking at.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:47.820
And the way I decided to do this
was I was trying to look

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.340
for some way to understand the
relationship between the

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.860
United States and India.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.870
And the way I finally decided to
do it was that I found that

00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:00.280
MIT has a series of commencement
programs that

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.230
they publish with every
commencement

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:03.920
that lists every graduate.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.230
And they've listed the hometown
of every graduate.

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:09.590
And so they have these
available for

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:11.170
the whole 20th century.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.030
So what I did is I
made a database.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:16.270
I went through these and pulled
out every single Indian

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:21.310
who graduated from MIT
in the 20th century.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:23.260
So I have this database,
and I kind of think

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.010
of this as a filter.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:29.740
India is a country with a
population now of a billion

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.410
people or so.

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:34.290
We can't look at all
1 billion people.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:37.790
So what I'm looking at is those
Indians throughout the

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.610
century who came to MIT.

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:43.970
And so again, we can't look at
every student at MIT from the

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:44.710
20th century.

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:45.940
But we can look at--

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.550
this is a rather small group.

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:50.330
It's about 1,500 people or so.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:54.150
And so let's look at these
students and say, how did they

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:59.440
end up getting from India,
7,000 miles away, to MIT?

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.270
How did that happen?

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:03.360
And then what happened
to them afterwards?

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.690
What did they do?

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.610
Did they make any difference
in India?

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:10.520
What were their careers like?

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.880
And so that's what
I've been doing.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.460
And so in the last five years
or so, I've been running

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:20.400
around India trying to track
down Indian graduates of MIT,

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.490
their family and so on,
just to find out some

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:24.920
things about them.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.010
And so a couple of general
themes that

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:32.570
come up from this--

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:36.250
one is the idea of a
technological nationalism, I

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:42.710
would say, and then also the
development of the information

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:46.020
technology industry in India
and globalization.

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.640
Then also--

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.840
in Star Trek, they have this
tractor beam that sometimes

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.380
will pull things into
the spaceship.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.850
You could say MIT has been
a tractor beam for global

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:01.560
talent, that it's pulled
international talent into the

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:06.000
United States, and very often
it's stayed in the United

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.790
States after it's
gotten there.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:15.680
So these are some of the things
that I'm touching on in

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.720
what I'm doing.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:24.560
And so one of the things that
you do see is students who

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:29.670
went to MIT in the early
20th century--

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.090
very often, going to MIT,
you could say, was

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:33.720
a nationalist act.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:39.910
India was a British colony, and
most people, in some ways,

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:43.860
the intuitive thing to do would
be to make ties with the

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.760
British, British society,
with Britain.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:52.580
So those who went to MIT were
in some ways doing something

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:56.550
that didn't make a lot of sense
in some ways, having

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.940
ties with the British.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:02.870
And so that that's a big theme
that I've discovered.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:06.980
And one of the other aspects of
this that has been kind of

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.110
intriguing--

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:11.110
what do you think of when you
think of Mahatma Gandhi?

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:13.270
What sorts of things
come to your mind?

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:14.760
What sort of images?

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.830
What kind of things
do you think of?

00:14:19.776 --> 00:14:21.740
AUDIENCE: Small, peaceful man.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:24.200
ROSS BASSETT: Small,
peaceful man.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:28.710
Anything else you think
of about Gandhi?

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.290
AUDIENCE: He was fairly
well to do and then

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:31.820
he gave it all up.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.140
ROSS BASSETT: He was
a very wealthy

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.602
lawyer, gave it all up.

00:14:36.602 --> 00:14:37.520
AUDIENCE: Spiritualism.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:37.930
ROSS BASSETT: Pardon?

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:38.847
AUDIENCE: Spiritualism.

00:14:38.847 --> 00:14:40.097
ROSS BASSETT: Spiritualism.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.460
Anyone else?

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.700
So we have those images
of Gandhi.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.600
One of the intriguing things
about this research--

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:57.750
when I look at the Indians who
went to MIT in the 1920s and

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:00.580
1930s and try to look at the
networks of people they're

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:04.500
involved in, where they come
from, one of the things that I

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.150
find is, if I try to identify
where is the

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:09.500
heart of these people--

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.090
what sort of, again,
networks are they

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:14.240
involved in and so on--

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.920
if you look at a large number
of them, you get connected

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.090
back to Gandhi, that a large
percentage of Indians were

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:26.280
from the part of India where
Gandhi was from.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.380
A large number of them
actually had

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.390
connections with Gandhi.

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:35.790
One young man who grew up in
Gandhi's ashram went to MIT.

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:40.230
And so this has been the
intriguing thing.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:43.280
And it's suggested some
things to me.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.240
I've gone back and looked
at Gandhi's papers.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:52.920
And Gandhi has often been, I'd
say, captured by political

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:53.510
historians--

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:56.480
most people who are interested
in him are people interested

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:01.500
in political history, Gandhi's
spiritualism, his philosophy,

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.300
his philosophy of nonviolence,
and things like that.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.645
But Gandhi was very interested
in technology himself.

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:14.290
Maybe the most common image
of him being interested in

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:16.340
technology, of course,
is handspinning.

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:19.960
And it's easy to see
that as very

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.900
regressive, you might say--

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:23.910
very archaic.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:26.980
But he was really very
interested in efficiency, as

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.200
he was interested in spinning.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.470
If you were a contemporary of
Gandhi's and you told him you

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:36.790
spun, he would ask you what
your production rate was.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:40.320
And he was very concerned about
increasing production.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:44.520
His magazine had statistics
all the time about what

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.090
people's spinning production
was and so on.

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:52.970
And so it seems like Gandhi had
this-- and I think this

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.420
term has come across before in
some of your other readings.

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.830
He was almost tailoristic is
taken some of his ways, that

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:01.510
he was very concerned
about efficiency.

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:06.109
He once wrote a piece
in his newspaper--

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:09.410
20 rules that anyone who was
going to meet him at the

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:11.630
railroad station
should follow.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:17.280
And he was kind of upset in this
that he said, a lot of

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:21.560
people who met him at the train
station would block his

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.940
path of going out of
the train station.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.250
He said, normally, it should
take me five minutes, but now

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:27.740
all these people are there.

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:28.930
It's taking me 30 minutes.

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:30.470
I'm wasting all this time.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.540
And so he was very frustrated
with that.

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.790
And so he was very interested
in efficiency.

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:41.640
And it seems one young man who
grew up in Gandhi's ashram

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.960
basically said later on, I
became an engineer at the

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.850
hands of Gandhi.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:48.400
Gandhi made me an engineer.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:52.240
And again, it seems, in some
ways, fairly counterintuitive.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:57.530
But that was what he said he saw
and that was how he became

00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:58.110
an engineer.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:03.040
And so many of these people
went to MIT as this act of

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.760
technological nationalism.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:08.600
They saw that if India was going
to be an independent

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.380
country, they needed to have
a technological base.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.680
They needed to have
technological capabilities so

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.500
they wouldn't be relying on
British people, Americans,

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.880
that they could develop their
own technological

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:21.990
infrastructure.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:25.750
And so that seems to have been a
very big theme among Indians

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:31.450
who went to MIT in the early
part of the 20th century.

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:33.580
I want to flip through
some of these--

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:34.260
PROFESSOR: We can if you want.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.700
ROSS BASSETT: Sure,
that'd be great.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.410
This is Alfred Marshall,
the British economist.

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.560
One man had studied
at Cambridge--

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:49.340
an Indian man-- and Alfred
Marshall told him, as I

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:52.820
mentioned in the paper, that he
thought Indians should not

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.730
be going to Cambridge,
but instead

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:56.550
should be going to MIT.

00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:00.050
This is [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:03.040
who I mentioned in
the article.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.790
He started a chemical works
in Western India.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:11.740
This is a drawing of the
chemical works in the small

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:13.040
town of [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.300
in Kathiawar.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.940
You can just flip
through that.

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.590
This is a picture of Mahatma
Gandhi and [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:24.790
So here's Mahatma Gandhi and
this is [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:26.910
So this is in 1950.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:30.750
Gandhi had just come back
from South Africa.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.070
And [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:36.560
was this person who was very
interested in sending people

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.355
to MIT, sent a number of his
family members to MIT.

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:46.930
And this is a young man I
mentioned in the paper.

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:53.370
Again, Gandhi was present
at his wedding.

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:56.740
And then, the next year,
he went to MIT.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:59.810
And he was in the cooperative
program in electrical

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:02.110
engineering and he got a
Bachelor's and Master's degree

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:07.370
in electrical engineering and
then returned to India.

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:10.570
And in India, he had this double
life, you could say.

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:14.040
I would say he was probably
one of the best trained

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:17.720
engineers in electrical
engineering in India, having

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.540
this Master's degree in
electrical engineering.

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:26.400
But if you were to look at his
career from a purely technical

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:31.760
standpoint, he kind of
under-utilized his education.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.190
He was very much involved in
the Nationalist Movement.

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:38.570
He was thrown into jail for his
participation in the Salt

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:39.950
Satyagraha.

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:43.320
He later led a large strike at
one of India's leading steel

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:49.560
plants and was thrown into jail
for 18 months after that.

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.100
If you can just hit
the next slide.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.440
Here's a picture of
him at MIT again.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:21:00.910
He apparently got training in
the military cadet program.

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:06.020
And again, it was kind
of intriguing to me--

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.890
after he was in jail for 18
months, he still maintained

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:12.250
very good relations with his
former MIT professors.

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:15.840
He kept in touch with them,
exchanged letters.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:20.750
So he didn't see some sort of
dichotomy between his role as

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:26.400
a protester for freedom, as a
Gandhian, and his career as an

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.340
engineer at MIT, or as
MIT-trained engineer.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:37.350
This is the diwan, sort of the
prime minister of a princely

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:42.770
state of India in Bhavnagar
in Western India.

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:48.550
This man was an associate
of Gandhi.

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:51.110
India had these princely states,
and he paid for a

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:52.680
number of Indians
to go to MIT.

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.510
And then this is a kind
of intriguing

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.080
meeting in the late 1930s.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.870
The diwan, Prabhashankar Pattani
is sitting down there

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:05.810
in the turban.

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:11.670
He came to MIT and he hosted all
the Indian MIT students to

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:14.150
have lunch at the Ritz
Carlton Hotel.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:16.410
And so here they all are.

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:19.420
One of them was married
to an American woman.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:23.220
So you see this small collection
of Indian students

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:32.260
there at MIT around 1939.

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.660
And then this is a young
man, Bal Kalelkar.

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:37.295
He was the young man who was
raised in Gandhi's ashram.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:43.990
Here's Gandhi right here.

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:49.620
And then this is Kalelkar
right behind him.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.050
This is a letter that
Kalelkar wrote.

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.300
And Gandhi was a
famous editor.

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.360
He was an editor
of a newspaper.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:03.390
And Kalelkar wrote this letter
to GD Birla, who was one of

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:04.890
India's richest businessmen.

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:07.650
You might think of him
as an analog of Bill

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:08.870
Gates at the time.

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:13.470
And Kalelkar wrote GD Birla,
asking him to fund his

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:15.300
education at MIT.

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:20.530
And Gandhi edited the
letter, helped him

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:21.520
make the right approach.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.310
Gandhi was a friend
of this man.

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:26.770
And so he went through and make
corrections and so on.

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:33.160
This is something that I found
in India, and this is the next

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:33.640
part of it.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:37.430
This is, again, Gandhi's
editing.

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:42.000
He tells Kalelkar, incorporate
these changes and send it off.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.160
But the point is, I would have
thought the natural tendency

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:50.400
of Gandhi would be to not be so
enthusiastic about someone

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.250
going to MIT.

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:57.170
And he obviously could have
refused to support him in

00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:58.650
seeking this funding.

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:03.840
But Gandhi supported him
to get this funding.

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.960
Once, Gandhi had asked his
friend to provide funding,

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.580
once he had given him this
letter, it would have been

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:10.800
fairly hard for this
person to resist.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:16.900
So Gandhi did not see someone
going to MIT as a betrayal of

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:20.630
his movement, as someone who was
turning his back on him.

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:23.990
He was willing to support him.

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:30.740
And this is four Indians at MIT
in about 1940 having fun

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:34.460
in the snow and having
a snowball fight.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:41.800
There was a fairly rich social
life among the Indians in

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.920
1920s and 1930s.

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.840
There are records of a number
of pranks that they did on

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.500
each other and so on.

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:57.540
After one of them completed
doctoral examination, he

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:01.770
invited a number of friends out
to a restaurant out west

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.020
of Cambridge.

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:07.010
And then he and his friend snuck
out and drove back home

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:10.480
and stiffed everyone else and
left them both rideless and

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.040
having to pay the bill.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:16.460
And this caused a number of
repercussions afterwards.

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:26.810
This is a cartoon of Anant
Pandya, who was the first

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:29.590
Indian to get a Ph.D.
from MIT.

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:32.430
And then he became the first
Indian principal of an

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:34.200
engineering college in India.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.490
This was at college near
Calcutta called the Bengal

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:38.740
Engineering College.

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:41.520
And again, it's hard
to imagine what

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.400
this would have meant.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.790
I think, generally, the Brits
had to the general idea that

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:49.840
they were superior, that in some
ways, one of the aspects

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:53.600
of colonialism was that the
British, the Europeans were

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.910
superior in technology.

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:57.880
And that was in some ways the
basis for colonialism.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:02.540
Once people like Anant Pandya
came out and were able--

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:07.330
Pandya won this position as a
principal of this college in

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:10.870
an open competition
with Brits--

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:13.660
and Brits then worked under
him, it really made a

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.630
statement that technology was
not just something that was

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:19.100
limited to Europeans
and Euro-Americans.

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:26.650
I mention in the paper, again,
that one of the key moments

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:28.960
before independence--

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.000
you think about technological
nationalism--

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.440
was that, as India stood on
the brink of independence,

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.230
Indians began to say,
we need something

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:40.410
like an MIT for India.

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:44.930
And so this was the committee
report that established the

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:47.720
Indian Institutes of Technology,
which were, again,

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:52.560
India's institutes
analogous to MIT.

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.350
Two Indian MIT graduates sat on
this committee and helped

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:59.450
establish this committee.

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:01.580
This is, again, a picture
of Anant Pandya.

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:07.070
He had a position as the head of
the major Indian aerospace

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:10.900
company, and again, was the
first Indian director of that.

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:16.840
And then he died, tragically,
in a car accident.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:20.720
And then he was at memorialized
in a magazine

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.620
that was talking about
his career and his

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:24.710
connection with MIT.

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:27.030
And this seems to have had a
big effect on a number of

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:30.860
people, just making them want
to become engineers and also

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:33.175
making them want to go to MIT.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:41.930
Now, I just want to say a little
bit about India and IT.

00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:47.100
One of the interesting things,
I think, about globalization

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:51.740
is I'd say globalization is,
in some ways, based on

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.690
similarities and differences
between countries, that if you

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:58.860
think of the boundary
conditions--

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:01.920
if every country was exactly the
same, there'd be no point

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.290
in globalization, because
India would be just like

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:04.980
United States.

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:09.800
There would be no point in
moving work or doing things

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:10.860
between countries.

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:16.170
But if countries were
diametrically opposed and had

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:19.580
nothing in common, then
they couldn't relate.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.160
They couldn't communicate
technologically.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.780
They couldn't have this
technological work done

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:25.840
between them.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:30.190
And I guess what I'd say is that
Indian graduates of MIT,

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:34.550
especially in the 1950s and '60s
and 1970s, were the key

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:37.830
people who connected the United
States and India in a

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:42.530
technological way, that they
had this possibility of

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:44.550
joining these two countries
together.

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:45.980
They had knowledge.

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:51.790
They were often from upper class
parts of Indian society,

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:56.290
had a lot of knowledge of India,
and then, by virtue of

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:57.970
their education, the
United the States.

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:00.280
They had a great knowledge of
America and understanding of

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.680
American technology.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:06.130
This is the first Indian
IT company.

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:08.970
It was called Tata Consultancy
Services.

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:12.010
And it was founded by
three MIT graduates.

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:16.060
They were basically in
their early 20s.

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:19.590
Tata is a large Indian business
company that has a

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:22.490
number of different business
enterprises.

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:24.180
And they said, we'd like
you to start a

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.820
computer business here.

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:28.280
And they didn't really know
what exactly they

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:28.780
were going to do.

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:32.480
They thought of it like an
Arthur D. Little-- if you know

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.940
what that is-- a consulting
firm.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:35.840
So they started this.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.430
And you can see it.

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:43.180
They started it almost on an
American model, and it didn't

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:44.430
work very well initially.

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:54.800
This is their operation
in Bombay.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:58.290
Again, they thought of it
almost like as a very

00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:00.060
academic-oriented thing.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:04.250
And it wasn't too much concerned
with profit making

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:06.980
And finally, the Tatas got a
little bit frustrated with it.

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.100
And these three guys left.

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:12.770
And they ended up hiring
as the head of

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:15.150
it another MIT graduate.

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:18.670
This is a man by the name of
FC Kohli, who is sometimes

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:21.350
considered one of the key
figures in the development of

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:25.430
the information technology
industry in India.

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:29.470
And what he had was-- he
had studied at MIT.

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:34.240
He had a lot of connections in
the United States by virtue of

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.530
his time at MIT.

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:39.370
But also, he understood India
and was able to really develop

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:44.590
a successful business doing
software work in India for

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:45.570
American companies.

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:49.450
And so that stood him in very
good stead and helped him

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:51.140
become very successful.

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:56.100
And one of the things I'd say
about him is that when India

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.630
started thinking about computer
technology, a lot of

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:01.070
Indians thought in terms
of, let's try to

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:02.340
make our own computers.

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:05.210
Let's try to make our own
computer business.

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:08.470
Let's try to build all the
hardware ourselves.

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:12.230
And Kohli didn't
think that way.

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:15.900
I think he understood what
American industry was capable

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:19.320
of, and he knew India could
never compete with United

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:22.610
States in building computers--
that it was a very capital

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:25.305
intensive business, that they
would never have the volumes

00:31:25.305 --> 00:31:26.880
that America would have.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:30.960
And so it was a losing
proposition to try to think of

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:31.990
doing something like that.

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:34.610
And he had the idea of, let's
just write software.

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:37.080
Let's not try to do all
the computing work.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.000
Let's do software.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.260
That's something where
we have an advantage.

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:44.930
Our labor costs are much less
than American costs.

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:46.270
We can do that.

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:48.490
And he had connections
in America.

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:52.030
I think people in America were
willing to trust him because

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:56.070
of his connections, because
of his MIT education.

00:31:56.070 --> 00:32:00.620
And so he got a lot of business
for this company,

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:07.080
Tata Consultancy Services
from the United States.

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:10.800
This is another early
IT information

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.225
technology pioneer in India.

00:32:12.225 --> 00:32:14.520
His name is Narendra Patni.

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.850
And again, he did a great job
of connecting India and the

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:20.950
United States at a time when
there weren't a lot of

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:21.680
connections.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:23.890
A lot of people in America
didn't know

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:24.790
that much about India.

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:25.840
I could imagine--

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.710
this is in the late
1960s, 1970s--

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:35.020
that if you said I'm from India,
I would like to do

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:38.880
computer business for you, I
think that's a pretty big

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.770
stretch for a lot of people--

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:45.380
what they knew about India, what
sort of confidence they

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.440
have in Indians.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.190
But again, Patni had
come to MIT.

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:56.690
He had work with Jay Forrester,
who was, as a great

00:32:56.690 --> 00:33:00.020
academic entrepreneurian,
involved in a lot of things.

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:03.940
And so he had the contacts that
really enabled India to

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:08.350
get this sort of business.

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:11.250
And I think I have
one final slide.

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:14.220
So you see Bill Gates
on the left there.

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:15.780
And then the person
on the right is

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:17.690
named Narayana Murthy.

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:21.570
And he's the founder of another
big Indian IT company

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:23.860
called Infosys.

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:28.040
And Narayana Murthy never went
to MIT, but he was influenced

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.480
by MIT in a lot of ways.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:31.580
He went to this Indian
Institute of

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:33.500
Technology at Kanpur.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:38.510
And there, his mentors were
Indians who had gone to MIT.

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:43.550
Then he went to another school--
the Indian Institute

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:44.190
of Management--

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:47.630
where his mentor there was
another man, Indian, who had

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:49.220
gone to MIT.

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:53.230
Then he worked for Narendra
Patni, the person that I had

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:54.480
mentioned before.

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.390
In a form to an American would
appreciate, after he had

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:04.030
worked with Narendra Patni for a
while, he got tired and quit

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:05.840
and started his own business.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.880
And this became Infosys.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.540
The point of this is he never
could have done that on his

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:13.460
own, but after he had worked
with all these Indians who had

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:15.980
gone to MIT, who had a lot of
connections to the United

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:19.210
States, he had these connections
himself.

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:25.219
And they really helped him to
develop those connections.

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:28.239
One other point--

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:31.920
in some ways, it's easy to see
this is a great success story,

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.290
the development of the
Indian IT industry.

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:38.179
One other point I feel like I
have to mention as well--

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:43.250
the greatest industrial accident
in world history

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:46.610
happened in India at
Bhopal in 1984.

00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:51.060
Union Carbide had a plant making
methyl isocyanate.

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:53.960
And there was a leak at this
plant, and it killed--

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.590
we're still not exactly
sure how many--

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:58.000
maybe 10,000 people.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.050
The manager of this
plant was also an

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:02.620
Indian graduate of MIT.

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:07.560
And again, the point of this is
in the 1960s and 1970s and

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:11.080
1980s, where the United States
and India were linked together

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:15.560
in technology, generally
speaking, you would often find

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:18.320
an MIT graduate somewhere
there.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:23.440
And so you see them in both
of these contexts.

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:28.270
And so finally, just one other
thing I want to mention is

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:36.430
MIT, as I said, has become for
50 years or so, a tractor beam

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:39.960
for talent coming to
the United States.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:44.740
Many Indians, as they go
to school in the Indian

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:48.820
Institutes of Technology, want
to pursue their education.

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:53.790
And for them, they see the best
possible place to go to

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:56.320
continue their education
is MIT.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.820
You see it as a dream
for them.

00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:00.810
Many of them, when they come
to the United States, don't

00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:04.270
imagine that they're going to
stay in the United States, but

00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:06.790
often they end up staying
in United States.

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:10.250
Sometimes their education,
I'd say, unfits

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:11.430
them for work in India.

00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:15.140
Sometimes they just get so
caught up and see the

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:17.670
opportunities in
United States.

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:21.810
But that seems to be
a major trend.

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:24.200
Now, there are some questions
if it will continue, that

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:27.860
there are enough opportunities
in India that maybe Indians

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:30.910
wouldn't feel such a strong
need to come to the United

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:34.290
States for graduate school.

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:37.190
So these are some of that
the basic themes.

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:44.475
Most of it will be
on the people who

00:36:44.475 --> 00:36:46.270
came from India, though.

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:51.050
It wasn't until 1965 that there
were immigration laws

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:53.450
that really let Indians come
to the United States on any

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:55.700
sort of a fair basis.

00:36:55.700 --> 00:37:01.930
So you see Indians who are
Indians Americans or second

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:03.900
generation Indians--

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.610
you only see them starting
to come to MIT in any

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:07.660
numbers in the '80s.

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:12.030
And then it is ramped up as more
and more Indians are in

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:12.780
the United States.

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:16.130
So it's sort of a later
part of the story.

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:22.890
The two most prestigious fields
you can go into are

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:24.140
medicine or engineering.

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:30.260
And in India there is, I'd
say, almost an idea-- you

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.250
don't think of what
you want to do.

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:34.980
You think of what you can do.

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:38.430
And if you can get into an IIT,
then you should do it,

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:41.430
even if you were thinking you
don't have an interest in

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:43.380
engineering-- that you
should just do it.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:49.210
But they're very, I guess I
would say, focused on things

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:53.910
that will make you a
remunerative career.

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:57.770
And there is a lot of
skepticism, I would say,

00:37:57.770 --> 00:38:00.570
generally, that liberal
arts will make you a

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:01.770
remunerative career.

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:09.240
There are some good liberal arts
schools, but relatively

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.610
few people go that route.

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:15.790
Most people feel, in a country
of a billion people, that

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:20.300
competition is just so fierce
for jobs that everyone feels

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:26.430
the need to get into some area
where they're sure that

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:27.700
they'll have a good job.

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.880
I spoke to a professor at one
of the Indian Institutes of

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:34.920
Technology whose daughter wanted
to go into economics.

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:38.460
And he was kind of horrified
that she wanted to do this.

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:42.530
And he wanted me to explain to
him what economics was, what

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:44.670
kind of job she would get.

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:48.510
And he was half-convinced
afterwards.

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:52.360
He said, well, OK, maybe I'll
let her do economics, but I'm

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.000
never going to let her
do liberal arts.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.650
That's drawing a line that
that's not going to happen.

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:03.510
And there's a very strong
feeling that way, that

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:04.440
engineering--

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:07.500
and even within engineering,
there's a certain hierarchy.

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:10.980
Computer science is at
the highest level.

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:14.640
And so these Indian Institutes
of Technology--

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:19.480
entrance to the schools is
determined by one exam called

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.470
the joint entrance exam.

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:25.260
You get a score on it and there
might be 100,000 or it

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:29.080
might be 300,000 people
who take this exam.

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.720
Your score on it is a rank.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:34.720
So you're ranked one
to 300,000, say.

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:41.190
And the person who scores one
can choose their seat major in

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:43.770
any of these Indian Institutes
of Technology.

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:52.080
And then the person who gets the
last seat is forced to go

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:55.380
wherever there's an open
seat in a major.

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:58.830
And so invariably, the number
one student would take

00:39:58.830 --> 00:39:59.860
computer science.

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:02.520
That's just what they do.

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.910
And then there's a hierarchy
of computer science,

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:08.140
electrical engineering,
chemical engineering,

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.290
mechanical engineering--

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:13.610
civil engineering is one of the
lowest of the engineering.

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:16.100
And then there's naval
architecture, which is a bit

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:18.390
lower than that, too.

00:40:21.668 --> 00:40:23.660
AUDIENCE: In these institutions,
the Indian

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:27.644
Institutes of Technology,
they're all funded by

00:40:27.644 --> 00:40:29.640
development or are they
privately funded?

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:34.010
ROSS BASSETT: So these are
funded by the government&lt; and

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:37.440
the tuition is pretty low.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:42.410
And it's been kind of a
political issue in India.

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:49.670
One issue is how many seats
should be reserved for people

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:51.500
from what's called
the scheduled

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:53.170
caste or backward caste?

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:57.970
So it would be a bit analogous
to affirmative action, say.

00:40:57.970 --> 00:41:00.060
And so this has been
very controversial.

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:03.590
How many seats should be
reserved for them?

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:08.430
And then also people in the
middle class have been

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:10.110
clamoring for access to these.

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:12.270
A lot of people have
been shut out.

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:16.050
There were originally five of
these Indian Institutes of

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:17.110
Technology.

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:18.660
Then there were seven.

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:20.860
And now, recently, they've
doubled that.

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:26.780
Each one has become the mentor
to a new Indian Institute of

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:27.065
Technology.

00:41:27.065 --> 00:41:29.770
And they've done this for
political reasons, because

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:36.610
there's such a great demand
and so many people want to

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:38.830
enter into these institutions.

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:39.850
And it's very controversial.

00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:43.740
A lot of people associated with
the Indian Institutes of

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:46.780
Technology think they'll never
be able to maintain the same

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:50.780
quality in doubling the
institutions that

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:52.180
they've had so far.

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:56.530
And so there's worry of brand
dilution, if you use a

00:41:56.530 --> 00:42:00.520
business term of what that's
going to do to these schools.

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:07.120
More stay in India now, and more
of the leaders, I'd say,

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:14.360
from now have been mostly
educated in India than in the

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.650
'50s and '60s and so on.

00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:20.230
But the system is still-- at
these IITs, they're very good

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:22.040
undergraduate institutions.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:26.740
But if you want to do serious
graduate research, there's no

00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:32.920
question that they are not at
all competitive with MIT.

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:35.850
There is this hierarchy.

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:40.120
It turns out that at an IIT,
if you go there, the best

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:41.930
students are the undergraduates,
and then the

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:44.830
graduates are usually actually
worse students than the

00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:45.690
undergraduates.

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:51.250
They're students who are sort
of percolating up from less

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:54.800
prestigious institutions, and as
they go to graduate school,

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.430
they go to these IITs.

00:42:57.430 --> 00:43:01.200
But the people from the IITs
who want to go to graduate

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:05.050
school almost invariably go to
the United States to go to

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:06.090
graduate school.

00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:08.440
There's a clear understanding
of--

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:11.140
they don't have research
funding that American

00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:14.680
institutions have that would
enable them to do the same

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:19.900
kind of research that would be
done in the United States.

00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:23.510
The system in both politics--

00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:25.850
in politics, I don't think you
would ever go to an IIT,

00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:29.190
because it's more about
connections within India.

00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:32.280
And it's more about being
a political player.

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:33.530
In business.

00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:40.830
the environment is so dynamic, I
don't think you need to have

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:42.980
gone to an IIT There's
many institutions

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:45.050
where you can go to.

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:47.810
The IIT--

00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:52.430
you clearly can get into an
American institution.

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:57.930
IITs in some ways, for a
long time, were paths

00:43:57.930 --> 00:43:59.330
to the United States--

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:02.120
the paths to American
graduate school.

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:05.230
Now, they're paths to American
graduate schools, but they're

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:12.960
also paths to Google in India or
Microsoft in India or other

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.620
multinational companies
in India.

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:20.010
So their paths to those
types of jobs.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:23.870
But if you wanted to be an
entrepreneur or something,

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:27.550
many of them come from some of
the wide diversity of other

00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:29.002
schools in India.

00:44:29.002 --> 00:44:32.030
PROFESSOR: And also, on that
question, I think a little bit

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:34.820
about one of the themes from
your paper about different

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:36.890
kinds of modernity.

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:39.470
And it's interesting that we've
talked a little bit

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:42.190
about how, in this country,
engineering is not as high

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:44.150
social prestige as--

00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:46.920
even to this day, to some
degree-- law, possibly

00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:52.160
medicine are, and that the
kind of modernism of this

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:55.350
country coming out of the
American Revolution had as

00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:59.300
much to do with both philosophy,
legal philosophy,

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:03.470
commerce, and that America
was considered a very

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:05.550
industrializing country
in the 19th century.

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:08.440
But it was still
unprofessionalized.

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:11.640
Whereas, as you see through
this period of the 20th

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:14.860
century, where one of the big
issues for a developing

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:17.230
country like India is how modern
is it, how is it going

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:18.430
to catch up with the West?

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:23.070
And through these mechanisms,
the whole idea of nationalism

00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:26.280
and building the country
literally has this kind of

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:27.430
engineering connotation.

00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:31.170
And I think that generated
that level of prestige.

00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:33.290
It's interesting.

00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:36.370
I told an anecdote from Bob
Siemens, who is an MIT grad,

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:40.680
who came here about 1940, who
was from an elite family and

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:41.800
did his undergrad at Harvard.

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:45.470
And his parents said,
upper class boys

00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:47.110
just don't go to MIT.

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:50.350
And here you have these students
who are upper class

00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:53.290
boys from India coming to MIT
during the '30s when most of

00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:55.990
the other students would have
been pretty middle class, if

00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:58.660
not even still kind
of blue collar.

00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:01.380
Did you see anything as
far as differences?

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:03.760
They look very finely dressed
in the photographs you show.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:07.240
And they would, in addition to
not having not been American,

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.660
feel out of place in some
way in that way

00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:11.050
during those years.

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:14.290
ROSS BASSETT: So you do have
very many wealthy Indian

00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:16.150
families sending kids to MIT.

00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:21.970
India has this system of family
businesses, where the

00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:25.610
business is passed down from
generation to generation.

00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:29.880
And the next generation takes
very active part in managing

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:30.880
the business.

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:36.780
And very often, in the '50s and
'60s, what some of these

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:39.420
business families would do
would be to send the heir

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:43.340
apparent to the business
to MIT to prepare them.

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:47.950
So these people were
billionaires and so on.

00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:53.970
And so you have, again, these
people who are really of the

00:46:53.970 --> 00:47:03.300
highest social standing in
India coming to MIT and

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:10.810
studying, really, in some ways
quite a bit differently, than

00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:12.060
American families.

00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:20.968
PROFESSOR: Are there questions,
comments?

00:47:20.968 --> 00:47:26.940
AUDIENCE: I'd like to ask a
question about the five IITs

00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:32.250
that are founded in India in
the late '50s, early '60s.

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:36.305
The interesting thing was that
each of them was sponsored by

00:47:36.305 --> 00:47:38.560
a different country.

00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:42.760
And that raises a question
with me about--

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:48.160
we talk about, in this
discussion, MIT being the

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:52.590
focal point for many of the
elite young people that were

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:53.220
coming here.

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:56.950
But given the fact that the
Indian government in 1946 is

00:47:56.950 --> 00:48:03.500
proposing that you sample from
around the world, it's curious

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:11.660
that the selections
they made were so

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:13.650
un-American in many ways.

00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:15.090
And what was the reasoning?

00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:18.270
Was it just that they wanted to
see what was out there and

00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:21.230
then to draw the best?

00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:23.650
ROSS BASSETT: So it seems like
part of it was maybe a

00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:25.660
strategy of--

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:28.310
India had this policy of
non-alignment that they

00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:34.840
weren't going to really fly
under the American flag or the

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:35.460
Soviet flag.

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:36.870
They were going to say
we're not allied.

00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:39.040
There was this Cold War,
but we're going to

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.220
chart our own path.

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:50.220
But part of it was using that
to coerce a variety of

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:51.310
countries to support them.

00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:56.565
So when they started this Indian
Institute of Technology

00:48:56.565 --> 00:49:02.520
in Kanpur, the United States
engineers at MIT and nine

00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:04.030
other schools supported it.

00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:06.460
And there was really the idea
of we are going to make this

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:07.900
the preeminent IIT.

00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:09.120
It is going to be the best.

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:11.670
And so there was this
competitive aspect.

00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:17.460
And I think the Indians
purposely promoted this to get

00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:23.690
each of these countries
to the table.

00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:27.390
For example, when the Brits
supported their Indian

00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:30.660
Institute of Technology, they
had the idea that if we can

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:35.180
train Indian engineers according
to our system, then

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:39.410
maybe when they're out in
companies, they'll buy British

00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:41.920
stuff and that will help us.

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.370
And so they had that idea.

00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:48.060
That was part of why
they were doing it.

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:52.870
And the Soviets, I think, had
the idea that this would be a

00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:58.580
model, that this would be a foot
in the door into a way

00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:01.360
for them to influence the
development of technology.

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:04.810
So each country, I think,
had that idea.

00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:09.090
And India encouraged them
to have that idea.

00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:11.740
AUDIENCE: Why not the French?

00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:12.800
They're left out.

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:16.190
And yet, the Grands
Ecoles are there.

00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:19.510
ROSS BASSETT: So I think if
you had the money and were

00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:23.110
willing to do it-- so I think
it must have been that they

00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:25.190
weren't willing to put
up the bucks--

00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.648
AUDIENCE: Post war.

00:50:25.648 --> 00:50:26.106
ROSS BASSETT: Yeah.

00:50:26.106 --> 00:50:27.830
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:32.370
ROSS BASSETT: The British we
were always complaining that

00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:35.960
they didn't have the money to
do anything on a scale that

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.240
United States did.

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:43.070
And so I could imagine that
the French didn't either.

00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:44.690
I mention this in the article.

00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:47.310
There was a bit of an irony
that the British were

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:51.090
supporting the an IIT, because
the British themselves

00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:54.860
admitted they had no
MIT in Britain.

00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:58.830
So they were kind of trying to
do in India what they hadn't

00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:01.200
done in England in
a certain sense.
