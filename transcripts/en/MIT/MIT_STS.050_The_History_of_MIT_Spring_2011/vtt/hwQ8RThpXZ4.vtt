00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.860
PROFESSOR: I just came across a
couple of interesting quotes

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.330
about cybernetics.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.630
What did cybernetics have
to do with any of this?

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.510
Well, an awful lot.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.440
Here's a quote from
Jerry Wiesner.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.010
"We were all fired up by Norbert
Wiener's cybernetics.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.600
We have explored the far-ranging
implications of

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.040
the complex concepts
of information and

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.790
communication theory.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.190
It ranged from man-made
communications to computing

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.250
systems to the sciences of
man, inquiries into the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.890
structure and development of
the nervous system, the

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.080
phenomena of inner life and
behavior in relation to other

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.730
men."

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.290
So you get the sense of, like,
the whole interdisciplinary

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.110
thing, which is a big
topic, of course,

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.160
on our campus today.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.370
RLE was one of the major kind
of early points in that.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.780
"Neurophysiologists and other
biologists, linguistics,

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.380
economists, social scientists,
and psychologists recognized

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.300
almost intuitively the
usefulness and relevance of

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.100
feedback information theory
to their fields.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.780
For all of them, the concepts of
information theory, coding,

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.350
feedback, prediction, and
filtering provide new pathways

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.490
to explore pathways that seemed
to wind unendingly."

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.720
So this whole idea--

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.240
this is another one of these
places where you see the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.670
relationship between the
institutional structures at

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.330
MIT, how the labs are organized,
what the overall

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.660
policy is that's coming from
the federal government to

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.470
support the work, and actually
the content of the work, what

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.070
sorts of things people are
studying, how they're thinking

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.220
about these problems, what
the innovations are.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.120
And, I think-- and this is one
of the threads I want to

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.580
communicate to you today--

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.200
there's a real common thread in
a lot of what MIT does in

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.320
these realms, including SAGE
and Lincoln Labs and that

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.170
stuff, going back from probably
before the war around

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.400
computing and interaction and
all the different aspects of

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.960
communications.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.655
The Department of Linguistics
itself is formed by research

00:02:20.655 --> 00:02:26.000
from RLE in 1961.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.150
There's actually a real
relationship between, for

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.070
those of you familiar--

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.020
anybody know what Chomsky
and linguistics is?

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.370
So Noam Chomsky, who is the sort
of founding father, in a

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.740
lot of ways, of modern
linguistics, created this idea

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.270
in the '50s called generative
grammar, which is the idea

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.120
that the structures
of language are

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.690
built into the brain.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.510
They're not things that you
learn as a toddler or as baby.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.240
And that's one of the special
things that makes human brains

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.680
different from all other
kinds of brains.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.820
And that's called generative
grammar--

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.940
that the basic grammars
are some that is

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.910
inherently inside of you.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.370
A very radical idea, at the
time, for a number of

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.180
different reasons, partly
because it was connected to

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.470
what's called the cognitive
revolution in psychology.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.040
Up until that point, the kind
of leading paradigm, even in

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.150
Cambridge psychology, was
behaviorism led by B. F.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.600
Skinner at Harvard.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.500
The idea that, well, it's too
complicated to understand

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.550
what's going on inside either
our brains or anybody's, any

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.590
animals' brains.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.940
We're just going to look at the
behaviors, the inputs and

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.720
the outputs, measure the
behaviors, and try to

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.890
understand that anything that's
going on inside only

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.420
matters if it's expressed in
a particular behavior.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.110
Well, around this time period,
led by many people around

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.790
here, there's a thing called the
cognitive revolution, they

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.670
call it now, where people
rejected that view.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.460
And they began looking inside
what thinking was all about,

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.070
very much driven by parallel
developments in

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.450
computing, in AI.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.860
And in some sense, the whole
idea of psychology at MIT was

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.360
superseded by what?

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.880
Cognitive science.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.050
Which now we have a Department
of Brain and Cognitive

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.120
Science, which was sort of--
do we have a psychology

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.050
department here?

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.250
No.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.660
We used to, at one point,
but we don't anymore.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.840
It was sort of folded in.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.750
It's interesting.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.640
It's a separate topic and way
to think about what those

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.790
differences are.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.460
Partly, I'm dwelling on this
because tomorrow is the

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.440
symposium, the last of the 150th
Anniversary Symposia,

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.120
which is on Brains, Minds, and
Machines, and is a new

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.550
research initiative that's
trying to look at the problem

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:57.430
of intelligence by combining
AI, cognitive science,

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.820
neuroscience, and linguistics.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.180
And these things are all not
that far apart, again, from

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.740
this early history, but they've
developed separately,

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.925
in some ways, for the last 50
years, and the idea is to tie

00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:08.510
them together.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.340
So if you're familiar with AI,
there's not been a lot of

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.760
neuroscience in AI.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.420
But now there's an attempt to
bring a lot of that together.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.770
It's going to be a really
interesting, exciting thing.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.940
I have to introduce the
symposium tomorrow night, and

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:23.970
I'm working on my comments.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.980
And, usually, when I introduce
these symposia, I talk about

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.680
what happened at MIT before
the people in

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.280
the room were there.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.780
And then, when they got up and
they talk about their own

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.670
experiences, then they cover
the last 50 or 60 years.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.940
There's not much that happened
at MIT in linguistics or in

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.490
psychology or in anything
cognitive before Marvin Minsky

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.980
and Noam Chomsky and a
few of these other

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.220
sort of critical people.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.280
Interestingly, the
whole efforts--

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.870
these things also manifested
themselves in biology.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.730
How do you think, in the 1950s,
biology took up some of

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.900
this influence from cognitive
science or, particularly, from

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.150
communications theory?

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.960
What's the word that people
use to describe DNA?

00:06:16.856 --> 00:06:18.620
A code.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.440
The whole idea of DNA as a code
and biology as a kind of

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.460
informational science emerges
right at this time, not only

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.550
at MIT, a lot of other places,
but very much taken up there.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.640
Last year we read an article
about that, but we compressed

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.400
the syllabus a little bit.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.650
OK.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.860
The political context
during those years--

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.790
after the war, again, the
Radiation Lab dies down.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.430
The country is really
demobilizing.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.960
Troops are coming back
from the war.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.580
Everybody's going away from the
military back to civilian

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.980
life, until 1949, 1952.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.930
Critical events happen then.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.180
Anybody want to guess?

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:13.580
Russians explode an H-bomb in
1949, much, much sooner than

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:19.240
anybody expected, and the Korean
War starts in 1950.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.360
And that's really the beginning
of the Cold War.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.700
So you really have this--

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.700
it's not correct to think about
the Cold War as just the

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.170
continuation of World War II.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.590
There is this sort of brief--
but it is a kind of 5-year

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.620
period where everything's
shrinking before the Cold War

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.460
really gets going.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.350
And then you begin, during the
'50s, you really have the

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:42.340
civilian sense of being under
threat by nuclear warfare.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.770
It was before my time, but
perhaps your parents or even

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.700
your grandparents
will remember.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.920
In the 1950s, if you were in an
elementary school in this

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.150
country, you were trained how to
respond to a nuclear attack

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.150
when you were in school.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.175
And you'll hear the phrase "duck
and cover," which so

00:07:59.175 --> 00:08:00.890
many people were
trained to do.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:04.080
Hide under your desk, pretty
much, which I'll leave it as

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.960
an exercise to the reader to
what that'll do for you when

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.590
there's a nuclear
weapon coming.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:22.730
And so during this period, in
some sense, it's the golden

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.970
age of science policy.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.670
People often talk about that.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:29.980
And we'll come back to this
after Sputnik, where

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.630
scientists are involved in
high-level decision making in

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:36.539
a way they've never really
been since then.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:41.618
In the world of computers, all
the way up through 1960,

00:08:41.618 --> 00:08:45.250
three-quarters of the world of
computing was simply run and

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:46.760
funded by the government.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.540
So there was hardly any
computation to speak of.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.120
And the quarter that was not
there was mostly in the

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.370
business world of punch cards
and IBM punch card machines.

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:08.575
And a lot of that work was done
in high-end computational

00:09:08.575 --> 00:09:15.100
at Los Alamos, fluid dynamic
simulations and things for

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.420
nuclear weapons.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.910
So during the Cold War, you have
all kinds of new kinds of

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:26.460
institutions emerging, in
addition to new technologies.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.440
Outside of MIT, you have
the Rand Corporation.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.520
Anybody hear of the Rand
Corporation before?

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.300
It's still around.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.180
You still hear them issuing
reports and things.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.150
I have colleagues
who work there.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.700
Founded in 1946 by the Air
Force, and that's the place

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:43.000
that pretty much invented
the term "think tank."

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.760
So you have these kind
of not governmental--

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.220
Rand is not part of
the government--

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.910
but it's a not-for-profit
corporation where they do a

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.230
lot of large-scale strategy,
operations

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:57.400
research, nuclear strategy.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.830
I mentioned already the Office
of Naval Research, which sort

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:04.320
of carries on the OSRD tradition
for the 10 years

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.590
after the Second World War.

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:07.370
And they came up in the reading
because they funded

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:14.060
the early part of Whirlwind and
lots of different types of

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.390
new theories, from engineering
science--

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:21.380
you hear that phrase coming up
a lot at MIT in that period--

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:25.140
systems engineering, systems
dynamics, systems analysis,

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.180
operations research.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.610
I mentioned cybernetics,
control theory, general

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:29.970
systems theory.

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:34.560
And all this stuff is sort
of buzzing around.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:41.440
And before I show you this
film about Whirlwind--

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.780
well, let me show you the
film about Whirlwind.

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:55.990
OK.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:11:00.680
And so then, the other one
I called up is the--

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.080
you'll remember from
the reading

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.400
that they build Whirlwind.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.170
It starts out as this sort of
flight simulator thing.

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.840
Rather quickly, Jay Forrester
has these huge ambitions for

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.770
it and starts into
this just large

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.820
machine computation project.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.940
And then they switch their Navy
funding into Air Force

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.710
funding, and they look at this
problem of air defense.

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:29.970
Starting in the early '50s,
there's a physicist at MIT

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:32.860
named George Valley.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:36.310
And they start looking at this
whole business about how do we

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.910
defend the continent, which is
an interesting question.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.340
Remember, we talked last time,
or the time before, about

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.990
anti-aircraft control.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:46.340
SAGE is really the exact same
thing, just the updated '50s

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:47.490
version of it, right?

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:48.840
How do you shoot down
airplanes that

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.990
are attacking you?

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:53.190
And air defense is a typical
problem that civilian

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:58.340
scientists like, and that
government, especially elected

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.880
officials, like because it
plays well politically.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.240
It seems to be, morally, a
little bit more comfortable

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.190
than offensive weapons.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:07.750
Of course, you can shoot someone
down if they're are

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:09.210
about to drop bombs on you.

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:17.100
The military, also, generally
dislikes it because the people

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.790
who run the world regarding
aircraft in the military--

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.850
even at this point, they
were the Air Force--

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.700
the Air Force doesn't like to
think a lot about shooting

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:24.350
down airplanes.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:27.810
It's not one of their favorite
hobby topics.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:29.610
And they generally aren't
big on defense.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:33.010
They want to go out and kill
the enemy and offense.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.780
So you constantly see this
question of air defense rising

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.460
up in scientific circles.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.630
It's still true today, actually,
with things like

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:40.880
missile defense.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:49.080
And they put this system
together called SAGE--

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.870
and, again, you read
about it--

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.390
sort of continental air defense
system, I think,

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:04.110
partly comes from the way that
engineering really dominated

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:05.820
here, above the other
sciences.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.490
And in many of these other
schools were--

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:11.690
where the engineering is
sort of separated off

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:13.090
as a separate school--

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:15.230
but the really high-prestige
work was going to the

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:16.970
mathematicians.

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:19.480
I also think that, actually,
a lot of the history of

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.680
computing was written later
by mathematicians.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.660
And so they kind of remade it
the way they wanted it to.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:26.590
You can see--

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:31.780
actually, even Norbert Wiener
does that, John Von Neumann.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:37.130
John Von Neumann plays a role
in the ENIAC project very,

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:40.830
very late and does some very
important fundamental,

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:42.600
theoretical work, but
it's basically

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.250
an engineering project.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:48.360
Whereas here, partly because
of the military connection,

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.720
partly because of the Rad Lab,
there's always this focus on

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:58.240
the human relationship and the
real-time interaction, and

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.870
partly because they're enabled
to do these big projects and

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.800
kind of build these big,
experimental systems, rather

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.150
than having one single.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:08.340
There's a great quote.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:14.160
It's from later on, where a
university administrator is

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:19.250
told that they just, the
University, just bought a

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:22.170
giant computer for millions of
dollars, and now they need to

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.930
form a department of
computer science.

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.440
And the administrator says,
that's ridiculous.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.880
We just bought a giant air
conditioning unit for millions

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:30.770
of dollars.

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:33.180
Nobody's telling me I need to
make a department of air

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.590
conditioning science.

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:39.850
And so the struggles of sort
of-- is the computer just a

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.130
big, glorified calculator,
or is it something

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.480
fundamentally new--

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.700
are all happening during
this period, too.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:46.870
Anybody know when the
Computer Science

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:50.260
Department here is founded?

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:51.730
Everything I'm showing
you here is from the

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.700
'50s, 1950 to 1956.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:58.550
When does MIT create the
CS part of EECS?

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.760
1968.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.530
Takes a long time to actually
recognize that there's a new

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:08.780
science there.

00:15:19.022 --> 00:15:21.700
As I said, this is
really IBM PR.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:26.890
So they were showing this to
maybe generals and other

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:29.470
people who would be their
military customers or just

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.290
generally the public.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:32.830
It's not very technical.

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:35.450
It's, like, got the kids on the
playground, like defending

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:37.580
your people sort of thing.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.170
But you see throughout this
the computers are there as

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:41.780
these control centers.

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.100
And this is real-time
interactive computer graphics,

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:48.160
which is going on nowhere else
in the world at the time.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.680
And the idea of a computer,
not as this kind of

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.480
calculator/switcher, but
as this interactive--

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.140
not just interactive
but also very much

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.970
networked kind of computer.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:02.050
Some of the things you saw that
were really done for the

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:05.830
first time with SAGE and
Whirlwind, real time, they

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:07.420
mention graphic displays.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:11.050
Modems were invented
for this system.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:12.530
You don't even use
modems anymore.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.930
Does anybody have a modem that
they use these days?

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.260
I haven't used one in, probably,
close to 10 years at

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:21.790
this point, but used
to use them a lot.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.580
Real-time memory allocation,
all kinds of stuff that you

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.860
use in the software
engineering world.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.700
And SAGE was really the first
big software project, too.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:34.380
It really taught the American
industry how to organize these

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.480
big software projects.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.080
And there were many others
that were built that were

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.330
similar to it.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:47.470
And as the film kind of
makes clear, it's

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:48.850
oriented towards civilians.

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:53.170
It's built to make civilians
feel comfortable.

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:55.580
It's not built because the
military wants to go out and

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:56.570
get the Soviet Union.

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:58.760
That's what they do
for a living.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.360
And it's built to make people
feel comfortable.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.160
And was pretty much obsolete
by the time it was

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.300
operational, so it had,
essentially, no military

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.060
impact despite all the money
that was spent on it.

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.310
But it had some technological
input.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:15.069
Nobody's really ever was able
to know if it would have

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:17.540
worked if we were actually
attacked.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:21.240
But there was a brief period
where air attack by Soviet

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.829
bombers over the North Pole was
a great fear of people.

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:28.659
What ended that fear or
made it irrelevant?

00:17:28.659 --> 00:17:29.520
AUDIENCE: ICBMs.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.610
PROFESSOR: ICBMs.

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:32.950
Where this system wouldn't
work against ICBMs.

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:34.510
But you still see that fear.

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:36.410
And all the debates about
missile defense

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:37.870
in the last 20 years--

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:40.340
Patriot missile during the Gulf
War and all that stuff--

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.060
is just an extension of
this kind of fear.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:48.290
So this is sort of
what's going on

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:51.410
around here in the '50s.

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:53.420
I have a couple more videos,
let me see which ones.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:13.050
And a lot of people really
actually did question, is this

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:17.210
really the kind of MIT that
we want to be living in--

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:21.250
big military projects, lots of
money flowing in, lots of

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:23.400
focus on building
large systems--

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.660
as opposed to research projects
or kind of individual

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.200
scientists doing things?

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:33.910
And that's where-- and I want to
say a little bit before we

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:38.100
move on, and Roz Williams
mentioned this.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:41.810
I don't think we've assigned
it this year for reading.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:52.840
Was a bunch of people at MIT
got together in 1949.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.840
It was called the Committee on
the Educational Survey, but it

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.260
became known as the
Lewis Report.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.190
And, again, Roz Williams
mentions it.

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:02.000
The Lewis--

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.710
who it was named after was her
grandfather, Doc Louis of

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:05.960
chemical engineering.

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:11.840
Other people on the committee
were Stratton, who I

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.610
mentioned, Elting Morison, who
was a historian who actually

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:18.750
founded the department that I
head now, Viki Weisskopf, who

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:21.990
was a famous Manhattan
Project-era physicist.

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:23.300
Jerry Wiesner we've
talked about.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.580
Gordon Brown we talked about.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.710
John Burchard, who was the first
Dean of Humanities and

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:31.630
Social Sciences, and Harold
Hazen, who was the Dean of

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:34.620
Engineering at the time that
we talked about before.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.240
And there were these problems
that were on peoples' mind at

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.950
the beginning of the Cold War.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:40.660
I'll read you a couple of quotes
from it, which are

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.300
pretty interesting.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.590
"We continue to claim that our
primary mission is to teach,

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:47.440
but other activities
have assumed an

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.730
unprecedented role at MIT.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.970
Service to the community and to
the national government has

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:55.180
always been recognized as a
primary obligation, but now

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.600
the dollar volume of government
contracts,

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.900
government-sponsored research,
amounts to far more than the

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.390
academic budget.

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:05.060
Postwar government funds have
been used to maintain a very

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.710
large technical staff without
the privilege of tenure.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:11.030
And the major part of the
Institute's personnel is now

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:12.570
dependent on the
continuation of

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:15.020
short-term financial support.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:18.360
Government money has made
available to us magnificent

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.010
facilities that have become
a permanent part of the

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:23.790
Institute and that involve
continued responsibility for

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:25.190
their maintenance."

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:27.560
So there was this problem
of just big size.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.730
Like how do you maintain it?

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:31.310
Once the Institute grew that
big, people had to-- it's like

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:33.960
a big animal in a cage that you
need to shovel money into

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.560
all the time.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.820
Whereas before, the Institute
was primarily focused on

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.720
undergraduate education, and
it was really a kind of

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.120
technical institute college
kind of environment.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.600
It became much more focused
on research.

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.360
And these sponsored projects,
particularly military

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.800
sponsored, were bigger
and bigger.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:58.460
They asked, "Is all this work
genuinely creative?

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.670
Can it, indeed, be justified
on the ground that it

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:03.420
strengthens our educational
program?

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.270
Have our staff members not
on occasion been lured by

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:09.210
prestige that accompanies an
enlargement of activities

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:11.370
without considering the loss
in their professional

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:13.230
competence that the undertaking
of added

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:15.090
administrative burdens
may entail?

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:17.210
So these were all real questions
that come up for the

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:20.610
next 60 years, in
a way, about--

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:24.110
are the faculty members now
big managers managing big

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:26.870
research projects more than real
thinkers sitting down and

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:28.270
actually thinking
things through?

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:35.980
"Is there not a danger that the
interests and energy of

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.670
our faculty are being diverted
from education to

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:40.010
income-producing work?

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:48.230
And secondly, many large
projects emphasize design and

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:49.420
construction problems--

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:51.750
like Whirlwind, SAGE--

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:55.010
engineering development or
applications of science rather

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:59.320
than fundamental scientific
inquiry.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.720
We must be careful lest the
great preponderance of

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.930
activities of this type divert
interest from the more

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:08.610
fundamental aspects of
scientific research.

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:11.230
And the third concern is the
preponderance of military

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:13.490
projects in the sponsored
programs.

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:14.380
Two difficulties--

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:17.390
first, national security
requires some of

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:20.040
it be done in secret.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.710
And second, it would be
unfortunate for MIT to become

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:25.530
regarded as an institution
that is dependent on the

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:28.200
development of war weapons as
it is for an industrial

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.370
organization to be
[? required ?]

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:32.050
in a similar light.

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:34.100
We suggest that future planning
should look forward

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.340
to the possibility of increased
emphasis on

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.640
activities more directly
related to the public

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:38.920
welfare."

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.770
This is a very interesting
moment where major people at

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:44.470
MIT get together and they say,
is this really the world that

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:45.740
we want to live in?

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:47.030
What's happening to MIT?

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:48.640
Is this really a good idea?

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:52.630
And again, that's 1949, right--
really, the year

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:54.930
before the Cold War
really hits.

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:57.830
And a lot of people feel those
concerns were sort of buried

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:01.550
throughout the '50s, in a way,
as the Institute became more

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:04.630
and more dependent
on these things.

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:08.700
A couple other things to mention
from that period.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:12.730
Baker House is built in 1947,
and it's really the beginning.

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:14.470
We've talked about this before,
I think, of the

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:17.980
residential part of campus
growing on the west side of

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:22.810
Mass Ave. and then on down
the street, of course.

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:24.880
The other dorms are
built then.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.870
The mid-century convocation is
1949, when Winston Churchill

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:30.600
comes to town and speaks.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:34.420
And, again, sort of says MIT
has an obligation to think,

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:37.160
not just about the sciences and
technology it's creating,

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.110
but what are the social
implications of those

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:40.200
technologies.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.670
And that's when--

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:45.330
the School of Humanities and
Social Sciences is founded,

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:51.180
essentially, right after
he says that in 1949.

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:54.130
And also at that mid-century
convocation is the

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:58.760
inauguration of James
Frank Killian--

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.620
James Killian, James
R. Killian,

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:02.100
forget his middle name--

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.890
as president.

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:08.700
He's the first alumni, alumnus,
to become president,

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:09.660
which is kind of interesting.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:14.640
It took almost 100 years
for that to happen.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:19.010
And he's as much of a kind of
executive manager, not a

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:22.330
career scientist, in the way
that his predecessor Karl

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:23.700
Compton was.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:27.220
He really ran MIT during World
War II when Compton, as we

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:31.480
mentioned, was off around the
globe getting these weapons

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.210
into service.

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:37.435
So what is the end of this sort
of early Cold War period?

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.940
When does the world that this
film is describing really come

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.190
to a shocking end?

00:24:52.786 --> 00:24:53.720
AUDIENCE: Sputnik.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:54.020
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:57.740
October 4, 1957 you
have Sputnik.

00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.770
We read a piece about that.

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:02.230
And there is this just this
incredible sense of shock.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:04.670
You can see from this video--

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:09.600
I actually don't remember what
the year on this was--

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:15.310
1956, so right before then.

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:19.400
And there's a sort of sense of
arrogant confidence that we're

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:23.300
doing everything right, and the
whole world follows us.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.760
Couple people raised this in
the response papers, too.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.280
And then Sputnik is launched.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.510
And it's this incredible
shock to the American

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:33.660
system because suddenly--

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:37.700
it's somewhat similar
to the explosion

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.640
of the Soviet H-bomb.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.980
Remember, we come
out of the war.

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:43.410
We have this world-changing
new weapon and

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:44.860
nobody else has it.

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:47.420
And then, not only the Soviets
get that one, but

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.750
they get the A-bomb.

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:55.860
They get the H-bomb, also,
in very short order.

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:59.950
And there's a lot happening in
the '50s, and there's a lot of

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:00.960
debate going on.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:05.680
And people see space, somewhat
like computing, as sort of

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.140
like this exotic new field.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.210
Nobody's quite sure what it's
good for, but it must be

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:11.710
important for the military
somehow.

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:13.700
And there's a lot of
debate about that.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:16.930
Meanwhile, President Eisenhower
is this sort of

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:19.360
interesting, ironic figure in
that we have a military

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.480
general in the White House,
which doesn't happen that

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.030
often in American history.

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:26.870
And yet, at the same time,
he's a conservative

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:27.450
Republican.

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:29.410
He wants to keep government
small.

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:34.300
He wants to rein things in and
control military spending as

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:35.150
best he can.

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:38.460
He actually calls military
spending theft at one point.

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:46.550
But in a certain sense, he's
pushed by the forces of

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:49.050
history in ways that he's not
able to control and is,

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:57.030
actually, not very sensitive
to what Sputnik means.

00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:59.550
And a lot of people aren't,
even as soon as

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:01.220
it first goes up.

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:04.010
And somebody mentioned
this about--

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:05.550
why wasn't the US first?

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:08.330
Well, partly the US wasn't first
because they didn't see

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:10.740
that being first was going
to be a priority.

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:16.300
And it wasn't, necessarily, an
objective comparison of US

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:20.200
technical competence versus
Soviet technical competence.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:23.035
That's how most people in the
world, including in Congress

00:27:23.035 --> 00:27:26.310
and the American public and
the media, read it, but it

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:30.060
wasn't necessarily that way.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:32.270
Eisenhower was very concerned
about some of the legal

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:33.380
implications of--

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:36.260
if you send a satellite over
somebody's territory, is that

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:41.080
considered an invasion, or
is the space above your--

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.840
it had already been legally
established that air space is

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:44.620
like territory.

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.480
You can't go into it
without permission.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.690
But that wasn't established
about orbital space.

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:51.530
And they were actually,
in some ways, happy.

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:53.590
One of the Assistant Secretaries
of Defense

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:56.400
immediately wrote, "The Russians
have, in fact, done

00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:00.180
us a good turn in establishing
the concept of the freedom of

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:04.630
international space." And now
we can overfly them with

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:06.430
impunity because they've
done it to us.

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:11.240
And so, there was this
sort of question.

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.810
Eisenhower said, "Sputnik
does not rouse my

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:15.700
apprehension not one iota.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:19.950
They've put one small
ball into the air."

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:24.790
Yet, the press assumed that this
meant Soviet superiority

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:26.100
in technology.

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:27.960
They sort of pushed
the panic button.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.670
People in Congress, particularly
Lyndon Johnson,

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:33.865
took every opportunity
to rub it in.

00:28:33.865 --> 00:28:36.610
Let me see if I have
the quote.

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:41.750
Because the US military said,
oh, that's not a big deal.

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:43.660
We have four projects that
are going to get that

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:44.980
going, at the time.

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:49.190
And Johnson said, in public, he
said, knowing that we have

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:53.800
better rockets on the drawing
boards is not very reassuring.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.370
It's like being told that, I
suppose, our next model will

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:59.960
have tail fins and automatic
windshield wipers, which was

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:03.590
sort of the sarcastic comment
about what we're going to do.

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:05.700
What they hadn't really
recognized was that space was

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:10.030
this incredibly, symbolically,
potent thing and that people

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:13.240
responded to it way out of
proportion to what the direct

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.740
implications of it were.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.690
If the US had decided that
being first in space was

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:20.340
important, they probably could
have rushed ahead and gone

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:21.200
first in space.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.020
They didn't.

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.970
They had some bureaucratic
infighting.

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:26.860
They had the unfortunate failure
of another rocket

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.780
right after there.

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:33.430
And the world really changed,
in 1957, from a science and

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:35.025
technology point of view
in this country.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:45.620
I teach a lot about
science policy.

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:47.760
And one of the things you learn
about science policy in

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.500
this country is that practically
every agency that

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.780
exists in the federal government
concerned with

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:56.240
science and technology arose in
response to a crisis of one

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.930
kind or another.

00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:00.130
The most recent example is the
Department of Homeland

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:02.720
Security, which was created
after 9/11.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.700
No matter what a good idea they
thought it might have

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:07.760
been or not been beforehand, it
was a response to crisis.

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:11.200
And after Sputnik, you had
several things which were

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:16.470
really quite important for MIT
and for the development of

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:17.530
technology.

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:25.390
One was reorganizing R&amp;D in
the Defense Department to

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:28.300
avoid what they called
technological surprise.

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:32.750
And that involved creating a new
agency called the Advanced

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:36.280
Research Project Agency,
called ARPA, which

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.910
was founded in 1958.

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:42.120
Its first director was a
professor from MIT named Jack

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.650
Ruina, who's still around.

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:47.420
And I'll talk about that a
little bit in a minute.

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:52.880
Vastly increased accelerations
in R&amp;D funding and also, of

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.940
course, the NACA, National
Advisory Committee for

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:59.430
Aeronautics became what?

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:03.520
NASA, National Air and Space
Administration in 1958.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:11.040
Both those agencies were
founded in 1958.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.820
And then there's also
the National Defense

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:15.190
Education Act in 1958.

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:20.050
This may sound like a long time
ago, but most, if not

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:21.410
many, of your professors--

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:23.080
if they're older, age 50--

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:26.920
were probably educated with
funds from that Act, including

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.010
President Susan Hockfield.

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:31.600
She came here-- in her inaugural
speech she said, I

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.000
was a post-Sputnik child.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.850
I was educated and got into
science because there was a

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:39.970
huge push in scientific
education in the late '50s and

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:41.800
early '60s to get kids
into science.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.400
And I was one of the
beneficiaries of that.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.380
So we're very much living in
this kind of post-Sputnik

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:47.650
world in that way.

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:53.900
And I want to talk
then a little bit

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:56.420
about ARPA and DARPA.

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:59.140
Show you a couple more movies
that take this whole same

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:01.870
story, in a way, into
another realm.

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:12.950
People have heard of DARPA
before this, right?

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:15.260
Has anybody not heard
of DARPA?

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:17.980
So, obviously, it's most famous
because the internet

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:23.210
started as the ARPANET and was
created in very much this

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:27.090
period, slightly after, but
only in the early '60s.

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:29.430
And one of the things
about computing--

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:32.240
one of things that's special
about DARPA was that it's not

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.230
the Office of Naval Research
or the Air Force Office of

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:38.560
Scientific Research or the
Army Research Lab.

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.580
ARPA reports directly to the
Secretary of Defense, so it's

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:45.610
outside of all of these
inter-service rivalries.

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:48.170
And it doesn't own-- in fact,
it tends to stay away from

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:51.990
things like big ships and big
airplanes, much like the OSRD

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:55.000
did, and focus on these
technologies that are so far

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.840
out and wacky that nobody
really knows what

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:57.780
they're good for.

00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:59.530
At the time, space
was one of them.

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:02.530
In fact, ARPA was responsible
for space until--

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:04.900
it was only a few months
NASA was created--

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.780
and then they had space
taken away from them.

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:08.290
And computing was another one.

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:10.370
That everybody had the sense it
was good for something but

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:12.170
nobody really knew what.

00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:17.630
And so let me show you a
coupleof images, couple of

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:19.960
other neat little films about
what some of the ARPA

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.210
computing work did.

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:34.550
So that's another kind of late
'50s version of this whole

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:40.750
idea of machine control, which
is Air Force still and not

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:41.560
ARPA funded.

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:44.125
But then you get into the
ARPA-funded stuff.

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:09.199
So this is sort of the
next logical step in

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:10.400
a lot of this work.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:14.860
And Ivan Sutherland is someone
who's, remarkably, still alive

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:17.710
today, too.

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:20.360
Not that he's remarkably
still alive,but.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.270
He went from here out to the
University of Utah where he

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:24.230
founded the computer graphics
program there.

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:27.050
And practically every
fundamental concept in

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:30.150
computer graphics came out of
either his work or his lab.

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:33.389
And then his students went on
to found Silicon Graphics,

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:41.060
Adobe, many of the other
really critical--

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:43.560
a lot of them worked for
Industrial Light and Magic,

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:47.889
the George Lucas company and
sort of migrated west,

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:49.969
continuing into Hollywood.

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:53.949
Pixar, that was the other one
I was trying to think of.

00:34:53.949 --> 00:34:56.219
And that, again, comes
from this.

00:34:56.219 --> 00:34:58.860
We didn't watch that part of the
film on SAGE, but they had

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:01.580
these light pens in SAGE, too,
as the beginning of this sort

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:04.180
of graphical user interface.

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:07.050
And then the last one I want
to show you about has to do

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:08.300
with time-sharing.

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.010
So Corbato is still around.

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:22.530
I saw him last week,
and he still

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:23.770
teaches in computer science.

00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:28.090
And they came up with this
time-sharing system where--

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:30.335
I mean, how many of you use
a console window ever

00:35:30.335 --> 00:35:33.550
on your Mac or PC?

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:36.030
So, basically, that's the idea
behind time-sharing.

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:39.000
That you have a computer there,
before a graphical

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.910
interface, that you could type
commands and programs to, and

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:43.770
it would respond to
you immediately.

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:46.190
Before that, you had only batch
processing, where you'd

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:49.710
put your punch cards in at
night, and you go home and

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:52.380
come back the next morning, and
there would be the thing.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:54.500
And they're again, following
this thread.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.300
There was this idea that you
could be so much more creative

00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:01.580
with a computer if you could sit
there and hack away at it,

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:03.830
and it would respond to
you in real time.

00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:08.170
And that's really where
time-sharing comes from.

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:13.980
That led to a thing called
Project MAC in the 1960s,

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:16.010
which was a DARPA funded--

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:18.530
it was the predecessor to the
Laboratory for Computer

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:22.030
Science, which is now CSAIL.

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:25.750
And Project MAC was run by Bob
Fano, who I mentioned before.

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:28.860
And had all these different
kinds of creative computing

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:32.180
things inside it, including a
lot of Minsky's work in AI,

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:36.030
although they split out and
formed a separate AI lab.

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:39.000
Then they came together
with CSAIL.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.640
And all these sort of
time-sharing experiments, the

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:47.150
origins of a lot of the
late-night hacker culture from

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:49.400
MIT, come from people working
late at night

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.790
on Project MAC projects.

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:55.140
A lot of the early computer
games, Spacewar and whatnot,

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:57.180
were developed in
that context.

00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:00.920
And even a lot of the early
later stuff for PCs, like

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:05.090
spreadsheets, sort
of came out of a

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:08.030
Project MAC sort of setting.

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:10.540
And then I also mentioned, of
course, the internet, or the

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:13.950
early ARPANET, one of
the first nodes on

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:15.820
the ARPANET was MIT.

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:18.740
A lot of the first routers were
built by a company called

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:21.640
Bolt, Beranek, and Newman, which
still exists here, sort

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:22.390
of down the street.

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:25.970
So there's this sort of
continuous thread that's then

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:33.620
updated through all these
different crises and periods

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:34.260
and whatnot.

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:39.760
And through the '60s, that's
sort of how this very, very

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:42.930
heavily military still, but sort
of different agencies and

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:47.250
different contexts bears
on the campus.

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:47.730
I think you're right on.

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:51.780
I mean, I think the atomic bomb
had a lot to do with--

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:55.420
it's hard for us to imagine,
but before

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:56.690
World War II, two things.

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:59.430
First of all, science was
mostly the realm of

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:02.840
pointy-headed professors and
was very interesting and

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.610
philosophically important but
didn't always feel like it had

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:08.930
a big impact on daily life and
certainly not on public

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:10.510
policy, per se.

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:13.250
Again, the US government was
hardly involved in the

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:16.470
scientific world.

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:18.820
Maybe in the world of
agriculture it seemed to have

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:20.460
a big impact.

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.410
Most of industry didn't
have a lot of science

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:24.380
associated with it.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.950
And it really took the atomic
bomb, not just for technology,

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:29.800
but also for science itself,
the idea that it--

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.740
like something that presidents
should care about.

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:34.490
I mean, even--

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:38.070
you look at the scientific
revolution and the Copernican

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:39.170
view of the universe--

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:40.430
doesn't affect the
way I govern my

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:43.210
kingdom an awful lot.

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:46.470
And secondly, same thing with
technology, where the idea

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:49.370
today that whoever has the best
technology wins the war

00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:51.490
was just not an accepted idea.

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:54.620
And there was no real evidence
for it up until that point.

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:57.020
Maybe a little bit here in the
Naval arms race around the

00:38:57.020 --> 00:39:02.040
turn of the 19th century, the
turn of the 20th century.

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:08.480
But today, almost everyone who
is a leader in the military is

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:11.020
trained in engineering in one
way or another, not everybody

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:12.560
but a very large
amount of them.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:16.150
That was not true, even at the
beginning of World War II.

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:18.490
Military science was
this other thing.

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:20.640
There was this whole sort of
tradition about fighting wars.

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:23.580
There still is, still
very prominent.

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:25.850
And it took World War
II to really bring

00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:28.970
those two ideas together.

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:31.110
And even then it was still a
little bit under question

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:33.140
because it was really about who
had the most planes and

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:36.320
the most tanks, not always the
best tanks and the best guns.

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:43.030
Then, to some degree, you can
say that Bush sort of served

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:45.010
as the president's science
adviser during the

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:45.870
Second World War.

00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:48.870
But, again, most of the
decisions to be made were

00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:51.370
either grand political decisions
for the president as

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:57.510
far as how to be allied with
the Soviet Union and how to

00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:02.440
work with the British.

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:05.130
And at the same time,
military decisions--

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:06.160
where do we invade?

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.560
At what time do we do it?

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.770
And there's technologies that
bear on that, but they're not

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:11.990
things that rise to the
presidential level.

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:14.480
It's really during the Cold
War that you see the

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.970
prevalence of atomic
weapons and ICBMs.

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:22.300
Again, ICBMs don't really come
out until the late '50s.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:26.170
It's all through the Cold War
you're living with bombers and

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:28.730
nuclear bombs that are as big
as this room that you need a

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:30.350
huge bomber to deliver.

00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:32.340
That's why something
like SAGE came out.

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:37.030
It's only around the late '50s
you get this sense of mutual

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:39.150
assured destruction, where we've
got all these missiles

00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:40.345
ready to go, and they've
got all these

00:40:40.345 --> 00:40:41.670
missiles ready to go.

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:42.980
That's the world that
dominated the

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:46.310
next 30 years or so.

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:49.820
And that's where arms control,
different technical issues,

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:52.180
become merged with politics
in a way.

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:54.710
And the presidential
science adviser--

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:57.610
it varies from administration
to administration--

00:40:57.610 --> 00:41:01.150
but it's never been as prominent
a position as it was

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:05.290
when Killian and Wiesner
were in that job.

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:09.620
Nixon actually outright
abolished it in the '70s,

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:11.460
didn't want it all.

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:14.000
Anybody know why that's
a troubled position?

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.360
So it's sort of science policy
talk more than an MIT talk,

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.610
but it's relevant.

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:21.700
There's an inherent
contradiction in being the

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:22.950
president's science advisor.

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:32.290
AUDIENCE: It's not pure
science [? anymore ?]

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:32.800
PROFESSOR: That's true.

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.050
There's a lot of people
who do that.

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:40.920
So, first of all, are you
representing to the president

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:46.510
the conclusions of the
scientific community, or are

00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:49.650
you representing the president's
opinion and his

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:53.860
policy goals to the scientific
community?

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:55.170
Right?

00:41:55.170 --> 00:42:01.440
And those things can easily
be 180 degrees at odds.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:03.960
In fact, the story was-- this
was all kind of leaked in the

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:04.640
newspaper--

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:07.300
that George W. Bush
asked Chuck Vest

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:08.550
to be science adviser.

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:11.460
And Vest said no because he
felt he would be forced to

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:13.900
take positions on things like
climate change that he didn't

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:16.280
think were going to be
acceptable to him.

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.740
So, if you look at what the
Secretary of Defense does, or

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:22.670
even the head of NASA, their job
is to take the president's

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:25.670
policies and implement them
through the agency.

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:27.980
And any time a big decision
comes up you'll always see

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:29.760
them on TV saying, well,
that's for the

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.060
president to decide.

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:33.450
Robert Gates doesn't decide
whether we're in

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:34.460
Afghanistan or not.

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:37.060
That's the president's
job to decide that.

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:38.370
Well, what happens when--

00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:44.300
in the defense world, at least
there's an understanding that

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:46.160
decisions on defense
are sort of partly

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.760
political and whatnot.

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.830
In the science world that's
not so clear.

00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:52.810
And there's any number of cases
where the president's

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:57.060
policy preferences are at odds
with what the science says,

00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:00.650
and that was very clear in the
previous administration.

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:03.290
But I'm sure that John Holdren,
who is now the

00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:06.310
president's science adviser,
who is a much more powerful

00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:10.770
guy and better-respected science
adviser and scientist

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:15.970
than the previous guy was,
gets pulled in a lot of

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:18.520
competing directions
all the time.

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:21.400
So it's a very difficult
job and not

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.080
everyone succeeds at that.

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:24.600
I thought it was interesting
that, even in the little,

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:27.470
short film clip I showed you
about the APT programming

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:30.300
language, the guy on the board
said, well, now there's a new

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:34.320
kind of person in here who is
the kind of machine-oriented

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:35.730
programmer.

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:40.150
And he's going to take these
requirements and--

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:41.840
let me give you a little
background on David Noble,

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:44.410
which is actually interesting.

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:49.670
He was a professor here in the
kind of early to mid-1980s and

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:54.580
was in STS and did a lot of
collaboration with the

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:55.690
engineering departments.

00:43:55.690 --> 00:44:00.060
And he wrote this book that was
extremely critical of both

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:02.740
the Air Force and MIT's role
in numerically-controlled

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:04.060
machine tools.

00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:07.010
And he was turned down for
tenure a couple years later,

00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:09.790
and ended up suing MIT.

00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:13.660
He said because he was a
Marxist, and they turned him

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:16.210
down for tenure because
he was a Marxist.

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:19.050
MIT's response was, you didn't
get denied tenure because

00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:19.700
you're a Marxist.

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:21.890
You got denied tenure because
you're a jerk.

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:23.510
And that's actually legal.

00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:25.430
It's not legal to deny
tenure to someone

00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:26.460
because of their politics.

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:29.590
It is legal to deny tenure to
them because of their personal

00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:31.060
style of interaction.

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:32.500
I don't know many of
the stories there.

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:33.980
And I actually only have
met the guy once.

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:37.490
He died about three months ago
at a fairly young age.

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:46.280
And he's a well-respected
historian.

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:48.720
And he's always raised these
sort of questions about these

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:50.330
kinds of arrangements.

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:52.980
And it's very worth reading it
because of the questions it

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:56.050
raises, although I do think he
misses a couple of things--

00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:58.850
kind of like what you said.

00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:01.640
In his world-- and I don't
remember if this comes through

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.670
in that essay or if it's
in the larger book--

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:10.980
people who operate computers are
managers, and people who

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:14.680
operate machines are workers.

00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:17.900
And anything like
numerically-controlled machine

00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:20.170
tools has that worker--

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:23.150
white-collar managers oppressing
the workers.

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:25.100
I mean, first of all today,
almost everybody sits in front

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:26.870
of a computer.

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:30.050
Many, many jobs-- some of them
are high-level executives and

00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:32.140
some of them are blue-collar
operatives--

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:35.220
but the fact that you're using
a computer has almost nothing

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:39.610
to say about what level
job you're in.

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:42.170
And in the world that he came
out of, he only had this

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:44.660
association of white-collar
managers.

00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:48.160
So anytime anything became
computerized, it also became

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.620
white collarized for him.

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:52.570
Where, actually, we actually
know today that the opposite

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:53.500
is often the case.

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:56.140
That when something becomes
computerized, the skill level

00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:58.510
of the people who operate the
computer is lower than the

00:45:58.510 --> 00:46:04.290
skill level of the people who
did it before it was operated.

00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:06.640
And it's funny because he
actually wrote an essay, after

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.010
he wrote the book, about a
study of machine tools in

00:46:09.010 --> 00:46:11.570
Sweden, where he was like, oh
look, they did it this way.

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:14.210
It's much more democratic and
open, the way they use

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:16.330
numerically-controlled
machine tools.

00:46:16.330 --> 00:46:21.860
And there's an implication
in his work that a given

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:25.540
technology has a given social
organization that comes along

00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:28.290
with it because of what's
inherent in the technology.

00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:31.180
That's basically what he
says in that "Command

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:33.790
Performance" piece.

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:38.370
And the jargon in the field is
called, it's deterministic.

00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:41.030
A certain technology dictates
a certain set of social

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.970
conditions.

00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:44.105
But actually, if there's one
thing we know from research in

00:46:44.105 --> 00:46:46.730
the field is that you can have
lots of different social

00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:49.940
organizations around any
particular technology.

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:53.150
You can use the internet as
a tool of authoritarian

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:56.050
repression, or you can use the
internet as a tool of people's

00:46:56.050 --> 00:46:57.260
liberation.

00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:02.020
Depends how you use it, but the
tool itself can be used in

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:02.890
different ways.

00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:05.270
I don't think that Noble would
have seen himself, at the

00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:08.240
time, as a technological
determinist, although, to some

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:10.630
degree, all Marxists are
technological determinists

00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:12.620
because Marx was a technological
determinist.

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:14.620
He said--

00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:16.350
I'm not going to get the quote
exactly right, but

00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:17.680
it's sort of like--

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:20.800
the spinning wheel gives
you feudal society.

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:25.080
Industrial production gives
you capitalist society.

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.920
And he, more or less,
put it that way.

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:31.290
And we actually know that's just
empirically incorrect.

00:47:31.290 --> 00:47:33.410
What Noble did say that I think
is really valuable to

00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:37.400
keep in mind that underlies a
lot of the stuff that we saw

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:40.680
in the video is that--

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:45.030
what are the implications of all
of this military funding

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:49.160
going to support university
research and engineering

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:51.260
research and scientific
research?

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:54.770
And I've tried to show the
connections between where the

00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:57.910
money comes from and what the
ideas are that got created.

00:47:57.910 --> 00:48:00.860
And I think one of the most
legitimate criticisms of it is

00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:07.780
that military systems end up
focusing almost exclusively on

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:09.530
performance.

00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:11.760
And that's kind of the title
of his piece, "Command

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:17.710
Performance." That everyone
was always pushing toward

00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:23.210
thinner wings and more precise
tools and, obviously, faster

00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:28.140
airplanes, bigger bombs,
heavier rockets.

00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:29.440
You don't care about costs.

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:32.180
You don't, necessarily, care as
much about schedule, other

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:35.280
things which are sort of related
like maintainability,

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.090
sustainability.

00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:40.080
Lots of other ways to think
about how a system performs

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:43.440
besides simply performance.

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:46.100
You know, an interesting example
of that was the-- has

00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:48.792
anybody ever heard of the SST?

00:48:48.792 --> 00:48:51.666
What was the SST?

00:48:51.666 --> 00:48:54.558
AUDIENCE: Boeing's supersonic
transport [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:54.558 --> 00:48:56.010
Newer version of the Concorde.

00:48:56.010 --> 00:48:56.410
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:48:56.410 --> 00:49:01.210
So Boeing was trying to make,
in the '60s, a supersonic

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:03.600
transport--it was actually a
competitor to the Concorde--

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.100
that would be Mach 3.

00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:06.880
And it was a big American
project.

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:10.290
And the idea was, gee, the
Wright brothers were going at

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:13.750
20 miles an hour, and we went
200 miles an hour in 1940.

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:15.730
And we're doing 500 miles
an hour with jet

00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:17.040
aircraft in the '60s.

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:19.660
Clearly, the whole world is
going to go supersonic.

00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:22.070
And if you focus only on
performance, as the military

00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:24.000
does, and sure enough,
military systems go

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:24.670
supersonic.

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:27.240
And that's the faster, the
better, generally.

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:29.510
Also just straight
economics of--

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:30.470
I just read this
the other day.

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:33.480
The Concorde took as much fuel
to put 100 people across the

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:36.380
Atlantic as a 747
takes to put 400

00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:37.490
people across the Atlantic.

00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:40.300
So, just run the numbers
on that.

00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:41.396
AUDIENCE: Also, there
was the huge noise

00:49:41.396 --> 00:49:42.460
problem with the Concorde.

00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:43.340
PROFESSOR: Noise problems.

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:45.956
AUDIENCE: Anyone who lived
anywhere near the place where

00:49:45.956 --> 00:49:50.170
it lands with the rumbling.

00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:50.960
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:53.450
So actually it's a very
interesting moment because, in

00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:57.390
the civilian world, the
cancellation of the SST and a

00:49:57.390 --> 00:50:01.430
lot of other things that
happened in 1970 are all about

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:02.470
this sort of, like,
you know what?

00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:04.700
Performance isn't the
be all and end all.

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:07.590
There are other things that
matter with our systems like,

00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:10.070
especially, cost because
that's a

00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:12.790
straight economic one.

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:16.840
But also environmental impact in
a bunch of different ways,

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:20.180
whether it's noise
or emissions.

00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:23.600
Reliability is a big one that
often ends up being cost.

00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:27.920
And the reason I'm bringing this
up, partly, is it gets us

00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:33.490
to a little bit later part of
MIT's life in the 1980s.

00:50:33.490 --> 00:50:35.130
What's happening in the 1980s?

00:50:35.130 --> 00:50:37.470
Maybe this is the Sputnik
moment of the 1980s.

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:39.330
Actually, it's not as
much of a moment.

00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:41.700
What causes the US
a big crisis of

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:44.510
confidence in the 1980s?

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:45.890
AUDIENCE: There was
a fuel crisis.

00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:48.850
PROFESSOR: OK, the fuel crisis
precipitates it for sure.

00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:51.880
That's in the '70s
really, 1973.

00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:58.710
What's the big issue
in the '80s?

00:50:58.710 --> 00:51:00.168
AUDIENCE: Iran-Contra.

00:51:00.168 --> 00:51:01.630
Iran-Contra, or is that
the late 70's?

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:04.070
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's
political more.

00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:04.790
That's '80s.

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:07.230
But it's the Japanese
car companies

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:09.393
start eating our lunch.

00:51:09.393 --> 00:51:12.620
And we have the greatest car
industry in the world--

00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:15.410
General Motors and Henry Ford,
and we invented it all.

00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:17.710
And suddenly, Toyota and Honda,
which were making

00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:20.180
motorcycles, start coming in.

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:23.440
And not only are they doing well
economically, but their

00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:24.810
cars are better.

00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:25.720
They get better mileage.

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:27.060
They're much higher quality.

00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:31.650
And the American car companies
just will not listen

00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:32.920
or learn from it.

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:36.110
And then people say,
very much like with

00:51:36.110 --> 00:51:37.260
Sputnik, what do you mean?

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:39.680
We're the most technologically
advanced nation in the world

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:40.710
with the biggest economy.

00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:44.040
How is it that these car
companies from this little

00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:46.530
island that we defeated in World
War II are now doing so

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:47.860
much better than us?

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:50.670
And it led to this thing
called the crisis of

00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:51.880
competitiveness.

00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:53.250
You may hear that phrase
sometimes.

00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:55.160
It was a big issue
in the '80s.

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:57.980
And one of the things people
said was, gee, are we not

00:51:57.980 --> 00:51:59.680
spending enough on R&amp;D?

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:02.460
Now we're spending tons and tons
on R&amp;D, but it's all in

00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:06.050
the military realm or so heavily
in the military realm.

00:52:06.050 --> 00:52:09.270
And the military is focusing
on performance--

00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:13.460
very, very high-speed computers,
very, very advanced

00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:15.450
materials for this, that,
and the other thing.

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:18.990
And none of that technology is
getting out of the lab into

00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:21.060
the field as much.

00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:23.740
MIT does a big study in--

00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:25.910
I want to say it comes
out in about 1988--

00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:28.090
called Made in America.

00:52:28.090 --> 00:52:31.160
And it's edited by Richard
Lester, who is now the head of

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:34.220
nuclear engineering, Michael
Dertouzos, who is the Director

00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:37.520
of the Computer Science
Laboratory, a few others,

00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:40.510
Lester Thurow, who is the Noble
Prize winner, Dean of

00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:43.410
the Sloan School.

00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:45.890
And Made in America
sort of says--

00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:49.190
how do we get the same level
of achievement in the

00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:51.910
manufacturing industry in this
country that we've got in the

00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:53.680
military industry?

00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:55.770
And there's a whole series of
concrete steps that they

00:52:55.770 --> 00:52:56.670
suggest to do that.

00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:59.580
One of them is creating a dual
master's program, which is

00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:00.885
still here, called--

00:53:00.885 --> 00:53:03.190
it was called Leaders for
Manufacturing, where you get a

00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:06.290
master's at Sloan and a master's
in engineering.

00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:08.650
They changed the name, and I
think it's Leaders for Global

00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:11.300
Systems or something now.

00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:16.420
So the competitiveness crisis
very much came up as, like,

00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:19.270
this military focuses too
much on performance,

00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:21.050
too much only on--

00:53:21.050 --> 00:53:24.100
if you look in AeroAstro, it's
all about supersonic, or

00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:28.580
dynamics, and not enough about
more efficient engines or

00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:29.540
cleaner engines.

00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:32.570
And there really was a
kind of shift after

00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:35.310
the '80s toward that.

00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:38.640
Interestingly enough, another
flip side of that, which a lot

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:40.400
of people don't realize--
because someone mentioned it

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:42.830
in one of your response
papers that--

00:53:42.830 --> 00:53:45.530
well, you know, it looks like
when I'm in my double E

00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:49.880
classes, I end up learning a lot
about consumer technology.

00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:52.330
And I'm building mobile
technology and

00:53:52.330 --> 00:53:53.340
mobile this and that.

00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:57.100
And where does all that
stuff come from?

00:53:57.100 --> 00:54:00.850
Where do we end up developing
advanced, small RF and

00:54:00.850 --> 00:54:03.880
microwave integrated circuits?

00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:06.230
I can tell you that stuff wasn't
originally developed

00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:08.130
for the cell phone industry.

00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:10.950
That was all military
communications stuff.

00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:13.850
And Qualcomm and a lot of those
other big companies

00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:15.770
really developed a lot
of those techniques

00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:17.030
early in that world.

00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:20.070
Then, there is a general
consensus, probably somewhere

00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:23.200
in the '90s, the sophistication
of computation

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:27.450
and information technology in
the commercial world exceeded

00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:29.570
that of what happens in
the military world.

00:54:29.570 --> 00:54:32.880
Now I go to meetings and half
the problem is, how does the

00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:35.380
Navy and the Air Force take
advantage of all the amazing

00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:37.920
stuff that's coming out instead
of having obsolete

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:39.370
electronics and all
those things.

00:54:39.370 --> 00:54:42.070
But that was somewhere
in there.

00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:42.870
What's their concern?

00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:45.120
Well, actually it was something
that was raised by

00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:48.570
Norbert Wiener, late in his
career in the early '60s, that

00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:51.260
all of this automatic technology
was going to put

00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:53.600
all the workers out of work.

00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:56.140
And I think the Air Force
was then concerned--

00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:58.140
gee, is there going to be a
workers' revolt, and we're

00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:02.170
going to be facing a communist
revolution sort of thing?

00:55:02.170 --> 00:55:04.720
So when people talked about
social implications of

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:08.740
automation, they talked about
technological unemployment,

00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:10.510
essentially.

00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:12.960
Some of which did come to pass,
and there's certainly

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:14.160
fields today.

00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:17.030
I think, today, it gets more
called outsourcing than it

00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:22.230
does called replacing workers,
but it has the same effect on

00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:23.740
unemployment in this country.

00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:28.390
And it is interesting,
especially at a place like

00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:30.810
Boeing, where all the engineers
at Boeing are

00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:31.700
basically workers.

00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:33.030
They're unionized.

00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:36.090
And Boeing, these days, makes
big decisions based on their

00:55:36.090 --> 00:55:39.270
relationships with their unions,
both machinists and

00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:40.570
the engineers.

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:43.710
And so, again, the clean
distinction between factory

00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:47.780
workers as blue collar and
white-collar engineers--

00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:50.460
engineers in many places are
more and more like blue-collar

00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:53.590
workers in a lot of ways, partly
because of CAD and

00:55:53.590 --> 00:55:55.160
computer-aided design.

00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:58.870
How many people in here have
ever designed a circuit,

00:55:58.870 --> 00:56:01.320
actually designed a new circuit
that no one's built?

00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:08.570
I mean, I can open up my CAD
software, and I get a library

00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:11.680
of all these demo circuits,
and I can sort of copy and

00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:12.380
this sort of thing.

00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:15.380
And there's certainly changes
that have come into what

00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:18.210
engineering practice means in
a lot of different fields

00:56:18.210 --> 00:56:21.970
because of computer-aided design
in different ways.

00:56:21.970 --> 00:56:26.500
Which, arguably, maybe makes it
easier to outsource jobs in

00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:28.130
ways than it was before.

00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:31.520
Running a university has become
a 24-hour job in a way

00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:35.610
that maybe it wasn't always
before, partly for reasons

00:56:35.610 --> 00:56:37.870
that all jobs have become
so 24-hours.

00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:40.600
And it's just a very
big complex place,

00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:42.410
and it's harder for--

00:56:42.410 --> 00:56:45.470
it's hard to picture an
MIT president taking a

00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:47.960
simultaneous job in
the government.

00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:50.330
I don't remember what Killian
did, if he stepped down when

00:56:50.330 --> 00:56:54.850
he took that job, or if he did
them both at the same time and

00:56:54.850 --> 00:56:57.360
for how long.

00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:00.470
And yet, at the same time,
the presidents do--

00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:03.040
like, Chuck Vest chaired one of
the big review committees

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:08.180
on the space station, and it's
called the Vest Report.

00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:11.310
And it was kind of a midway
design review in the early

00:57:11.310 --> 00:57:14.780
'90s, and the cultural authority
of being the MIT

00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:17.240
president, I think, had
a lot of impact there.

00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:21.030
And he sat on the President's
Council on Competitiveness.

00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:25.560
And I don't know what Susan
Hockfield's official titles

00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:28.520
are that way.

00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:30.040
But she does--

00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:34.230
when Obama rolled out a big
energy initiative two or three

00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:36.600
years ago that was part of his
administration's science

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:38.760
policy, she was standing
right there next

00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:40.140
to him on the stage.

00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:43.750
So she's very involved with
presidential science

00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:46.750
advice in that way.

00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:51.820
And I think it's also true that
different presidents just

00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:54.210
emphasize different
parts of the role.

00:57:54.210 --> 00:57:55.440
There is a sense--

00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:59.950
and Chuck Vest was extremely
enthusiastic about this--

00:57:59.950 --> 00:58:04.120
where, from this earlier history
of a lot of these

00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:06.660
things you've read about by now,
there is a sense that the

00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:10.370
president of MIT is not just
in Washington speaking for

00:58:10.370 --> 00:58:14.520
MIT, but is speaking for the
research enterprise in general

00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:16.980
and research universities
in general.

00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:21.850
And that the kind of privilege
of the bully pulpit that you

00:58:21.850 --> 00:58:25.130
get from being the president of
MIT is not used to go down

00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:28.440
to Washington to just scoop up
more money for Cambridge.

00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:29.930
Clearly, we've seen
that happen quite

00:58:29.930 --> 00:58:31.310
a lot in the history.

00:58:31.310 --> 00:58:34.820
But also to go down and speak
for research overall and why

00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:37.490
it's important to maintain
that in the economy.

00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:41.580
And when Vest became president,
which I think was

00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:45.910
'91, was really right after the
fall of the Berlin Wall.

00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:47.590
And there was this thing people
kept talking about

00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:49.460
called the peace dividend.

00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:52.230
And there was the sense that
all of that DOD funding--

00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:53.600
and some of it really
did-- was about to

00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:54.980
fall off the cliff.

00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:56.800
And people were really
questioning, why are we

00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:59.400
spending money on universities
at all.

00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:01.610
When Newt Gingrich was Speaker
of the House, he basically

00:59:01.610 --> 00:59:06.150
wanted to end it altogether, and
Vest, and a lot of related

00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:08.840
similar people, really spoke
out against that.

00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:11.110
By the way, that's about
to happen again.

00:59:11.110 --> 00:59:14.040
And I do think you'll see Susan
Hockfield in Washington

00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:15.980
speaking on that behalf.

00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:16.510
Anybody see her?

00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:19.610
She was on Charlie Rose a couple
of months ago with the

00:59:19.610 --> 00:59:21.780
President of Harvard talking
about almost

00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:23.930
exactly that topic.

00:59:23.930 --> 00:59:26.300
So I think there's a lot
of behind the scenes

00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:27.750
work that goes on.

00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:30.290
It's not necessarily secret or
hidden, but it doesn't have a

00:59:30.290 --> 00:59:31.760
big public role.

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:34.280
And at the same time-- you know,
MIT has an office in

00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:35.400
Washington.

00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:38.685
And the guy who runs it is a
very experienced guy, and they

00:59:38.685 --> 00:59:41.350
are registered lobbyists.

00:59:41.350 --> 00:59:43.860
And they're extremely effective
at taking MIT

00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:47.230
professors and showing them
around Washington.

00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:50.520
And I know this because about
2 and 1/2 years ago, I was

00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:53.530
part of a group that wrote
a report on space policy.

00:59:53.530 --> 00:59:56.800
And we called these guys
up-- we developed it in

00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:58.080
parallel with them.

00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:00.850
And within a few weeks, we were
sitting in the room with

01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:04.430
the transition team for Obama,
who was working on NASA, and

01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:06.820
the people in the White House
who work on space policy.

01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:08.120
And that's what lobbyists do.

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.840
They open the door, and
they get you in there.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:13.640
Now they're not lobbyists in the
sense of they go down and

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:16.890
say, give us more money, but
they have to be registered

01:00:16.890 --> 01:00:20.040
because they are performing
that function.

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:22.950
Now, MIT hasn't always had that
office in Washington, and

01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:25.390
may not always have that office
in Washington, but

01:00:25.390 --> 01:00:29.000
there's a lot of that sort
of stuff that goes on.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:34.940
So, it is harder to picture--

01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:37.430
again, I think it has much to
do with just the demands on

01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:41.080
one's time than happened
before.

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.440
Fundraising--

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:45.310
most of what the president does
these days is fundraising

01:00:45.310 --> 01:00:48.770
as far as out on the road,
getting the alumni excited

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:50.010
about what's going on here.

01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:55.520
And that's a pretty
time-consuming job.

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:57.250
Any other comments about that?

01:00:57.250 --> 01:01:00.610
It's not an exaggeration to
say the field of computer

01:01:00.610 --> 01:01:04.740
science was created by DARPA
over about 25-year period from

01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:07.270
1960 to 1985 or so.

01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:10.550
And then from Star Wars, which
is a separate agency but

01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:11.380
similar kind of thing.

01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:14.990
Just wouldn't exist without
that kind of money.

01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:19.030
Still today, a lot of the CSAIL
funds are from DARPA, in

01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:21.480
a lot of different ways, or
other parts of the military.

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:22.660
How many people here
have worked on an

01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:26.450
industrially-funded project?

01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:27.700
Nobody?

01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:31.110
How many people here know where
the funding comes from

01:01:31.110 --> 01:01:32.360
for the projects you work on?

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:36.950
Only a few.

01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:38.200
OK, interesting.

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:47.240
So you know, again, the military
funding is not

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.020
as big as it was.

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:52.240
I think it's very clear to say
the mindset of that kind of

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:55.510
work does not dominate the way
that it did during the period

01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:57.290
when we were watching those.

01:01:57.290 --> 01:02:00.150
But there's still a lot of it,
and the industrial funding has

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:01.710
its own set issues, too.

01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:09.170
And then there's always new
forms of this kind of thing.

01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:10.920
What's down the street there--

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:12.560
down the street, it's right
over there-- is the Koch

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:21.060
Institute that opened up just,
what, a month ago.

01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:23.590
And that would seem to
be, oh, how perfect.

01:02:23.590 --> 01:02:26.560
It's endowed by a private
individual.

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:28.330
Doesn't have any of the strings
that government or

01:02:28.330 --> 01:02:31.070
industrial funding comes with
or any of the sort of

01:02:31.070 --> 01:02:35.192
implications, but what were the
issues there that came up?

01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:43.560
Anybody read about it when the
Koch Institute was opened?

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:51.360
Well, that man, David Koch, he
has a lot of funding for other

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.880
kinds of political--

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:55.350
well, not other kinds--
but political.

01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:58.420
He funds a lot of Tea Party,
right-wing conservative stuff

01:02:58.420 --> 01:02:59.330
in the country.

01:02:59.330 --> 01:03:02.440
I mean, MIT is very clear about
what the boundaries are

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:05.720
for what's acceptable when
money is accepted.

01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:07.070
I mean, there's any
number times.

01:03:07.070 --> 01:03:08.850
It's happened to me.

01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:13.390
I had, essentially, a contract
with an oil company that

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:17.040
wanted to fund some of the work
I did C, but they had a

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.450
restriction in what the contract
was supposed to say

01:03:19.450 --> 01:03:20.600
about intellectual property.

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.060
That's actually the place
it most comes up.

01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:25.560
That was just totally
unacceptable, both to me and

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:28.230
to the lawyers at MIT, who
looked at it, and we ended up

01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:31.040
not taking the money because you
couldn't work under those

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.750
conditions.

01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:35.440
And those things get massaged
in a lot of different ways,

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:39.290
but people have a pretty clear
sense of their intellectual

01:03:39.290 --> 01:03:41.880
freedom and aren't always
willing to sell

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:44.360
that off in that way.

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:46.750
So, there's all sorts
of things.

01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:48.800
Another one that comes up
a lot now is foreign

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:49.810
governments.

01:03:49.810 --> 01:03:54.890
And we have a lot of potential
arrangements with foreign

01:03:54.890 --> 01:03:56.810
governments that raise
interesting questions.

01:03:56.810 --> 01:04:01.130
Like, say the government of
India were to come to MIT and

01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:06.480
say, we'd like to give you $50
million to help study poverty.

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.900
Well, a lot of professors on
campus would say, I don't feel

01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:14.180
comfortable taking research
money from a country that has

01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:16.400
x numbers of hundreds of
millions of poor people in

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:19.030
their country and shouldn't be
MIT's role in the world to

01:04:19.030 --> 01:04:25.070
take money from governments that
have very, very serious

01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:25.830
pressing things.

01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:30.920
Or Saudi Arabia, where they
don't allow women students or

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:33.420
women professors or Jewish
students or Jewish professors

01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:34.670
on their campuses.

01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:36.600
Should we go into collaborations
with them?

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:40.110
So it's actually pretty hard
to think about a source of

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:43.640
funding that comes to the
Institute that doesn't have

01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:50.700
some kind of complicated set
of circumstances around it.

01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:53.360
And that's one of the
interesting things in your own

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:55.850
work but also, as a historian,
to look at this about how

01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:59.720
those things get negotiated
in any given era.

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:01.780
There's certainly, clearly,
things that are just off

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:04.380
limits that won't be done.

01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:06.350
There are other things that
are pretty easy, like the

01:05:06.350 --> 01:05:08.940
National Science Foundation,
where they come and they give

01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:12.240
you money and your only job in
response is to write a paper.

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:13.300
And there's a lot of
things that are

01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:14.540
kind of in the middle.

01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:17.540
I actually happen to think
that some of the military

01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:20.030
funding, particularly the DARPA
funding, is actually a

01:05:20.030 --> 01:05:24.060
lot freer and has fewer strings
attached than the NSF

01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:26.690
funding because the NSF is
always peer reviewed.

01:05:26.690 --> 01:05:30.280
And you're always being pulled
by other people in your field

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.340
who want you to do
what they do.

01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:37.280
Whereas with, sometimes, with
what-- it's a little bit less

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:38.600
true now than it used to be--

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:40.760
with DARPA funding, they can
really just give you the money

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:43.300
and let you do want you want to
do because they're a little

01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:44.960
bit protected politically
because

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:46.210
they're within the DOD.
