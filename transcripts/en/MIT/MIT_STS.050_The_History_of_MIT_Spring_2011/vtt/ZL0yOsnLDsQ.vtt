00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.600
PROFESSOR: But the topic for
today is a big topic and an

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.440
interesting one.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.710
So there's a lot to
say about it.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.520
So I guess we're going to want
to get started on that, which

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.770
is MIT in World War II.

00:00:43.394 --> 00:00:49.915
I asked you to read I believe
three pieces, the Hunter

00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:53.860
Dupree article, four, right,
Hunter Dupree, Debbie Douglas

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.200
piece, "Science Analysts
Frontier," and

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.460
the cybernetics piece.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.380
AUDIENCE: The Lily Kay too.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.720
It was on the copy I have.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.540
PROFESSOR: Was the Lily
Kay article on there?

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.710
AUDIENCE: There was no
Lily Kay on there.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.700
PROFESSOR: Well, maybe
last year's syllabus.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.600
I think we took that one
off for this year.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.850
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.750
I read more than you
did this year.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.690
Nyeh, nyeh, nyeh, nah.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.420
PROFESSOR: But that's a
good one to add, as

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.940
well in some ways.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.270
And the reason that I picked
those four is--

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.870
and actually, I think they're
quite interrelated.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.060
And some people kind of
picked that up in

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.530
the response papers.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.390
And I'll sort of underscore
that a little more.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.440
In that one of them is about the
overall kind of national

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.210
science policy sorts of stuff.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.930
That's the Dupree article.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.270
One of them is about how those
changes affected life on

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.100
campus here on a day-to-day
basis.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.470
The Wiener one is about how
those changes affected the

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.280
core content of what people were
doing on campus and the

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.490
actual kinds of science and
engineering that were going

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.830
on, because cybernetics
was very much a

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.460
product of that time.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.960
And then "Science Analysts
Frontier" is a sort of outcome

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.310
of the end of the war,
looking forward.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.730
And all of those things I think
have a big impact on the

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.520
MIT that you experience today
and the landscape of how

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.300
science is funded and organized
in this country that

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.890
you'll experience, probably
regardless of whether you go

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.010
into a research career or a
career in industry, certainly

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.520
if you go into a career
in research, how

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.770
technology gets generated.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.350
So I just wanted to say a little
bit by way of review

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.140
and then go into some
other things.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.330
And I have lots of pictures to
show, to give it a little bit

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.580
of texture.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.610
So Hunter Dupree talks about
what he calls the Great

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.605
Instauration, which is actually

00:03:01.605 --> 00:03:04.060
was allusion to Bacon.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.020
And a few people comment on his
distinction between the

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.430
Baconian scientists who sort of
engaged in the affairs of

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.900
the world and the more
Cartesian model of a

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.940
scientist, who is sort of
isolated in the laboratory in

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.140
a purely intellectual space, and
that's an interesting way

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.510
to think about this whole thing,
and how these things

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.370
sort of formulated in the
years leading up to the

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.720
Second World War.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.840
What is the generally accepted
start of the Second World War?

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.090
Anybody know?

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.210
Just date-wise?

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.258
Yeah?

00:03:43.258 --> 00:03:45.680
AUDIENCE: Was it August 1939?

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.180
PROFESSOR: Close.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.270
Within a month, September
1939.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.390
AUDIENCE: The first
day of September.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.080
PROFESSOR: What happens
in September 1939?

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.030
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.710
AUDIENCE: Nazi invasion.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:58.030
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.610
Nazi invasion of Poland.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.190
That's the sort of generally
accepted moment, although

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.770
there's the Spanish Civil War
before that and what not.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.619
When does the US get
into the war?

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:09.010
AUDIENCE: December 7, 1941.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.560
PROFESSOR: December 7, 1941,
Pearl Harbor, more than two

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.970
years later.

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.529
A very long period, where Europe
and most of Asia is at

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:23.800
war and the US is not only not
as the war-- it's not like

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.000
when we get into it, there are
a lot of people who really

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.805
don't want us too and think we
should stay out, Charles

00:04:28.805 --> 00:04:32.090
Lindbergh among them.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.340
And so this is this kind
of limbo period where--

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.720
and it's actually in a
way the same as in

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.830
the first world war.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.030
The US is very late getting into
it and has a lot of time

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.280
to prepare.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.920
If the US had gotten into the
war in September 1939, we

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.180
would have been a
lot of trouble.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.470
There was nothing.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.410
There was no military to
speak of in a sense.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.120
Whereas by December 1941,
things had been

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.800
gearing up for a while.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.810
And that's this period where
not only does Bush get

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.770
interested and involved, but
also the predecessor is--

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.720
there's this very interesting,
sort of curious committee

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.010
called the Scientific Aids to
Learning, that is done under

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.690
the National Academy of
Sciences, which includes

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.810
Vannevar Bush, James Bryant
Conant, who's is the president

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.620
of Harvard, a chemist, and also
Frank Jewett, who we've

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.930
mentioned before, who
is an MIT graduate.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.840
He taught here.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.070
He is then head of Bell Labs,
head of research for AT&amp;T, and

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.350
actually president of the
National Academy of Sciences

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.910
in the 1930s.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.920
And these guys all get together
on this sort of

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.310
abstract study about--

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.480
anybody know what
that refers to,

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.600
Scientific Aids to Learning?

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.260
It's a very modern
topic in a way.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.210
How can we use new technology
to help education?

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.160
What are the new technologies
they're talking about?

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.000
LP records, 33 and
1/3 records--

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
does anybody know what
a record is?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.450
LP records, 16 millimeter
film, to some degree 35

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.390
millimeter photography, these
are all the cutting edge media

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.400
technologies in 1939.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.490
And there are people saying,
gee, there must be way to

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.640
improve education using
these things.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.510
And it's interesting when
you think about--

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.950
we may have mentioned
this before.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:28.290
We'll certainly mention
it later--

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.230
Vannevar Bush's great paper,
"As We May Think," where he

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.780
introduces this idea of the
memex, which is very much

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.760
credited as being a kind of
predecessor to the World Wide

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.150
Web, so right about
this time period.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.180
So he's got exposure to these
sort of media film

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.690
technologies at the time.

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.950
And in the course of that
committee, these guys get

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.520
together and they think there's

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.990
really something happening.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.940
The United States is generally
mobilizing.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.390
Even though there's a lot of
political debate, people

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:58.210
really see that the US needs
to build up the military

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.110
during this period.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.340
And it's not at all clear that
the scientific talent of the

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.870
country is going to be utilized
in the best way.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.720
And a lot of people, and we
talked about this, during

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.600
World War I felt that it really
wasn't utilized in the

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.790
most effective way.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:18.420
And Dupree talks about, there's
a lot of different

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:23.030
options for ways that you might
bring either scientists,

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.400
to use that term generally, or
people like you, to bear on

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.030
the war effort.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.310
What might those ways be?

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.000
What are the different options
you might have?

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.170
Well, one option is to just
draft you all, send you into

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.270
the military, and then I've got
lots of smart MIT people

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:48.050
working in the army.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.460
Especially the army in 1940,
you'd probably spent a lot of

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.270
time peeling potatoes.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.370
You'd probably get handed a
rifle and told to run into the

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.640
machine gun fire.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.790
I'm going to draft you and
rather than you being sent to

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:05.940
the front, I'm going to send
to the Watertown Arsenal to

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:09.830
make guns or to help engineer
the manufacture of guns.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.660
OK, you go work for the
government, you work in a

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.700
government facility, and you
help with some important job.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.160
That's not a bad way
to do it actually.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.130
But you end up working
on things

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.230
that are already existing.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.200
And so there are labs internal
to the government.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.020
The Navy has them.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.180
The Army has them.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.409
Even the Army Air Force had
some stuff like that.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.820
But they were generally seen as
not the most cutting edge.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.620
And there's a lot of truth
to be said to that.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.770
They were sort of concerned
with building weapons that

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:50.240
they had built for a long time,
not really very good at

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.100
dealing with things like
electronics or other new

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.880
things, and very, very hard for
them to think about stuff

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.260
that was outside the box.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.900
If you were in the Navy, the
Navy had a great cadre of

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.480
people who knew how to build
warships because they built

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.490
best warships and that's
all they did.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.510
But outside of building
warships, it was very hard to

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:08.780
think about what you might do.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.170
Because that's what the Navy
did, was they built warships,

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:13.290
to some degree airplanes,
mostly warships and

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:14.940
submarines.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.780
You could send all the
scientists and engineers into

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.700
industrial labs and have them
work in industry and close

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:20.950
down the school.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.920
You could organize a separate
corps, where you say--

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.800
actually there are some things
like this today.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.270
There's the Public
Health Service.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:35.360
There's the NOAH corps, which
is the oceanographic corp.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.330
These are sort of little
quasi-military organizations

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.470
that are peppered around
the government.

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.420
You could say let's have
a government--

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.850
well, there's a Peace Corps.

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.180
I'm sure you've heard of that.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.730
You could have the War Corps.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:51.630
And a lot of different options
there for organizing.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.460
And these guys started to
become worried that they

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.720
didn't think that left to its
own devices, it was going to

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.150
go the right way.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:02.320
And so Bush and his group,
particularly Bush in using his

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.530
political connections, gets them
took to create this thing

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.580
called the National Defense
Research Committee.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:12.440
And he writes this famous memo
that Dupree talks about, in

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.930
June of 1940, which
happens to be--

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:19.530
anybody know that picture is?

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:23.988
What happens in June 1940?

00:10:23.988 --> 00:10:25.470
AUDIENCE: Germans take France.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:26.000
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.070
France falls to the Nazis.

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.480
So this is what, about
less than a year

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.000
after the war starts.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.270
And here you have Hitler
walking down--

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:39.770
there's Hitler right there,
Albert Speer, by the way,

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.300
right there, touring Paris.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.990
And that's a pretty shocking
image for the West to see.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:55.240
And it was a time of
doom and gloom.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.112
A time of really the sense that
if the US didn't get off

00:10:59.112 --> 00:11:02.990
its rear end and start doing
things, bad things

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:04.220
were going to happen.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.420
And you also have the
Battle of Britain.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.960
And the Battle of Britain
refers, of course, the Nazi--

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.380
they were next going
to invade England.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.120
But Hitler wouldn't do it until
Goering could give him

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.520
air superiority.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.690
And so they started going
over and bombing and

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.050
preparing the ground.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:22.420
And they never quite got air
superiority, because of the

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.210
Spitfires and the Hurricanes and
all this, not least of it

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:26.500
aided by radar.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:30.440
And so in the spring of 1940,
into the summer of 1940, is

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.000
what they call the
Blitz in London.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.140
I'm sure if you've
been to London,

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.170
you've seen that stuff.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:39.100
Not only is there this sense
of military emergency, but

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.390
there's this sense that
a lot of the danger is

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:42.770
coming from the sky.

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:45.090
And we really don't know how to
shoot down airplanes and we

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:46.570
don't know how to combat
airplanes.

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:49.080
And there's this sense
of defense that is

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.330
not being taken up.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:55.640
And so these guys from the
Scientific Aids to Learning,

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.160
and this memo that Bush writes,
particularly concerned

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.460
about anti-aircraft defenses--

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:11.550
and Harry Hopkins, who is the
chief of staff for the

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:14.270
president, basically puts this
memo in front of him.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:18.410
And he writes across
it, OK, FDR.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:19.890
And that's the letter.

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:22.470
And with that letter, in the
government world, if you have

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:25.360
that signature on your letter
you can pretty much do

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.060
anything you want.

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.140
It's literally like
a blank check.

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.970
And Bush goes around in the
summer of 1940 collecting all

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:35.520
these people to work
in this National

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.000
Defense Research Committee.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.280
And they divided
up initially--

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.950
it's later called the OSRD.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:46.570
And it's a little bit confusing
the way the

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:47.820
terminology works.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.060
But they divided up into
different divisions.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.630
There's a division for transport
and communication;

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:01.140
aircraft, submarines, and mine
defense; guns, projectiles,

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.940
and armor; and bombs, fuels,
gases, and chemistry.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.540
And these tend to be things that
are not things that they

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.380
feel are being addressed

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.550
adequately through the services.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:14.540
What's the one thing they
leave out, by the way?

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.180
They don't go near, they
don't touch it?

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.410
Aviation.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:24.280
They feel that the NACA, which
Bush has then been chair of,

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.680
the predecessor to NASA
has aviation sewed up.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.260
AUDIENCE: Is fire control
listed there?

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.430
PROFESSOR: Fire control is
under guns, projectiles,

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:34.670
armor, and materials.

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:39.660
And so what they do in a sense
is they grab onto all of the

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:45.060
technologies that don't fit
neatly into the services, the

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.340
military services.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.420
And you'll see this again when
we talk about DARPA.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.990
Because the Navy knows
how to build ships.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.040
They're not going tell the
Navy how to build ships.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.170
But the Navy doesn't know the
first thing about radar, and

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.730
they're not particularly good
at radio, and they certainly

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:03.320
don't think very much about
other sorts of things.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.310
There's this great quote.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.700
I don't know if it's in that
reading, from Bush, where he

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.740
says, there were those who
protested that the action of

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:12.750
setting up the NDRC
was an end run.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.080
A grab by which a small company
of scientists and

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:19.160
engineers, acting outside
established channels, got hold

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.240
of the authority and money
for the program of

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.340
developing new weapons.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.920
So they met a lot of resistance,
particularly from

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.980
the military itself, saying why
are you guys doing this?

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.170
And Bush says, that's in fact
exactly what it was.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:33.030
It was an end run.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:34.940
They went around all the
established people.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.750
There are millions and millions
of dollars flowing

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:40.590
into Navy laboratories, flowing
into other things, but

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.140
building very traditional
weapons and things along the

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.860
lines that they didn't feel
were going to be really

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.210
thinking differently.

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:49.570
So they set this thing up.

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:51.730
It's outside the Army.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.780
It's outside the Navy.

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:57.350
And you have no idea what a
bureaucracy is like until you

00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:00.640
look at the Army or
the Navy in 1940.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.230
These are organizations that
have existed for hundreds of

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.690
years practically, or at least
150 years at that point.

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:12.410
There was not a lot of rapid
change going on, except maybe

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:15.940
in the air arm in the Army.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:21.350
And they bring these people on
who can actually understand,

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:25.900
who can manage the research and
pretty much write checks

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.030
with government money,
with a handshake.

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:31.230
This is not the NSF, where you
have to go through peer review

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.230
and you have to get your program
approved and all the

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:35.070
sort of things that a
lot of people here

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:36.370
on campus do today.

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:40.680
This is like, show up at
somebody's lab, ask them if

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.750
they'd like to be involved?

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:45.330
And the next thing they know,
they got a check for $250,000,

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:47.735
which in 1940 is a lot of
money for scientist.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.940
And one of the things they
really get right early on is

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.720
this whole business about
electronics and what role

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.930
electronics could potentially
play in the war effort.

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:02.280
There's radar.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.470
There's computing.

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:05.980
There's different kinds of
systems integration.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.080
I'll talk more and I'll show
you some pictures about

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.880
proximity fuses and
fire control and

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.410
I'll mention radar.

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:14.940
And also of course, and Dupree
mentions this, there's this

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:15.920
uranium committee.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.350
Which is another one of these
things that gee, it seems like

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:19.270
it has potential.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:22.210
It's a bunch of pointy-headed
scientists telling us some

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.700
abstract thing that could be
the greatest ever, but

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:25.980
what do they know?

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:29.350
These are like Hungarian
physicists, who just have this

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:31.520
idea on a blackboard.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.360
And this uranium committee
had sort of existed.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.820
But the Army didn't
really own it.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.180
The Navy didn't really own it.

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:42.700
And of course it belongs then,
it gets folded into the NDRC.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.060
What does it become?

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:45.560
AUDIENCE: The Manhattan
Project.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.730
PROFESSOR: The Manhattan
Project.

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.600
Then it actually branches
out of NDRC.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.540
For a grant from the NSF.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:57.170
And say I want to get $100,000,
how much do I need

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:00.000
to get from the NSF?

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.710
Anybody know what the
overhead rate is?

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.930
It's like-- and I'll get this
within 5% because I don't

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:14.560
follow it every year-- it's
like 63 and 1/2%.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.040
So if I want to get a grant,
any faculty member you work

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.280
with that goes to the NSF and
needs $100,000 to do the work,

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.359
I have to get $163,500.

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:26.599
And that $63,500 from the top,
just goes right off the top

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:29.260
into MIT's bank account.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.743
And the reason I ask if you've
heard about it, because a lot

00:17:31.743 --> 00:17:33.470
of faculty complain about
it a lot because it

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.050
feels kind of painful.

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:37.200
And what does it do?

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.830
Theoretically, it goes to pay
for keeping the lights, on

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:43.600
keeping the heat on, somebody
to come in and sweep the lab

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.500
out at night, all the different
things, the

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.610
paperwork, that it takes to
actually run these grants.

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:52.280
And it is expensive
to do that.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.260
And most faculty see it as a
big burden because gee, my

00:17:55.260 --> 00:18:00.560
$63,500 which the NSF gave me,
suddenly gets taken as rent by

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.480
my landlord.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.780
And what do I get in return?

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.970
All I do is get somebody who
comes in to sweep the floor

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:09.100
and it sounds like
a lot of money.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.770
And Dupree really tells you
why that was so important.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:15.670
And it was invented in this
month, pretty much.

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:18.710
And it was one of the most
critical ideas of getting all

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:21.540
this stuff to work so
impressively, which was--

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:29.070
MIT's total research budget in
1940, before this started, was

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:33.340
on the order of $300,000, the
entire research budget for the

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.230
entire Institute.

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:37.535
I wrote the number down here.

00:18:43.460 --> 00:19:01.550
Well, in total MIT got from
the NDRC, $116 million.

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:09.340
$116 million, even in today's
world, is a lot of research.

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:10.070
And what does that mean?

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:12.400
It mostly means people and desks
and laboratories and all

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.530
that stuff.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:18.050
If MIT had to pay for building
all those buildings and

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.730
building all those desks and
building all that heating and

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:23.620
all that infrastructure, it have
bankrupted the Institute

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:26.630
by the time it got
to $3 million.

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:32.250
But they added this overhead
charge on there so that any

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:36.810
time money came for research to
hire post-docs or research

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:40.160
assistants or technicians or
other people, it came with

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.120
this overhead.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:46.160
That meant that the dollar
figure could grow infinitely

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.970
large, infinitely large.

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:53.320
And again, think about that
$300,000 to $116 million in

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.040
under five years.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.690
We wish we saw that kind
of growth now.

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:01.360
And it was only able to happen
because they built into this

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.380
idea of the research contract,
this notion of indirect costs.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.040
It was really a very fundamental
thing that we

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.390
still live with today.

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:09.940
That means that if I as a
faculty member went to DARPA

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:13.340
and I got $100 million
contract, MIT

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:14.100
could support it.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.510
And they might have to build me
a building, which happens

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:18.700
all the time, you see these
buildings around here.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.240
But they could actually do it.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:29.770
The other thing about it was all
of the research contracts,

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.100
the military, the only thing
they knew how to do up until

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.625
then was to buy stuff.

00:20:33.625 --> 00:20:34.560
It's called procurement.

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.910
It's still something
they do a lot of.

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:39.450
So if I wanted to do an
experimental radar set, the

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:42.080
only way I had to do it was to
come to MIT and go, we'd like

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.030
to buy 10 radar sets.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:45.960
And we probably won't even use
them and they may not even

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.970
work, but at least we'll have
a contract that has a

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:49.460
procurement.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:52.280
And what they invented during
this period also with this R&amp;D

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:56.380
contract, where MIT doesn't
deliver anything other than

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.240
promising to put out its best
effort to do the research and

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.850
hopefully publish some
papers on it.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:03.700
That was also a pretty
revolutionary

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:04.780
idea in that point.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.330
Until that point, there
was no way for the

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:07.580
government to do that.

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:15.520
So here's what Dupree
says about it.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.240
It's a nice little sentence
that captures it all.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.910
The contract was the device
by which universities and

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:24.550
industrial research labs were
preserved as institutions,

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:27.840
even while their social role
was radically changed.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.985
I mean this was very much the
vision that people like Bush

00:21:29.985 --> 00:21:33.330
and Conant had, was we want to
keep MIT for what it is, keep

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:35.400
it as the character
that it has.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.300
Obviously, it changed during
the war in some basic ways.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:41.640
But it didn't change permanently
in some sense.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.650
Where there's a free flow
of ideas, there's an

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:46.390
open flow of ideas.

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:50.510
But I haven't addressed all
these other kinds of problems.

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:54.070
Without becoming part of the
Army, or without it becoming

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:56.940
part of the Navy, or having
just everybody drafted and

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.250
closing the place down
for five years.

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:08.720
So the NDRC is created
in June of 1940.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:09.780
It gets up and running.

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:14.830
It starts to issue its first
contracts in September,

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.970
October of 1940.

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:19.040
I'll talk about the radiation
lab in a couple minutes when I

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:19.990
show the slides.

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:23.160
Well, it's worth knowing that
they get started under the

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:27.270
NDRC in October, I
believe, of 1940.

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:30.160
They deliver their first
radar set in March of

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.000
the following year.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.420
So think about the turnaround
there, to take a completely

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:37.650
new technology and to deliver
something the military can use

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:40.300
in the field in four months.

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.480
It was a pretty remarkable
turn-around.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.650
And in fact, some people in
their response papers

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:48.060
mentioned the intensity of the
environment that sort of

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.380
developed around here
during that period.

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:59.650
And commenting, a couple people,
that it was hard to

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:02.370
imagine it was any more intense
than it is today.

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:04.970
Although it probably was.

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:07.230
And one thing that wasn't
really captured in the

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:11.850
readings is why it
was so intense?

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:16.060
What was it that was driving
people to work such long hours

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:17.940
and put such incredible
time in?

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:20.270
Again, most of the people doing
this work are people

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:20.890
just like you.

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:24.870
They're either students or just
recent graduates who are

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:26.120
occupying these labs.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:36.320
Especially for the men, what
happens to all your friends?

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.120
AUDIENCE: Going and
getting drafted.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:41.350
PROFESSOR: Well, what are
all your friends doing?

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:42.180
AUDIENCE: Getting drafted.

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.915
PROFESSOR: Either getting
drafted or signing up.

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:49.310
It's not that the people who
are working in the labs are

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:51.420
trying to avoid getting
drafted.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.870
That's more of a product
of later wars.

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:57.420
They're exempted from the draft
because they're doing

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:58.920
critical work.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.410
And there's a lot of social
pressure about not shirking

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:03.960
your service.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.370
So it can be seen as a kind of
embarrassment to be exempted

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:10.650
from the draft to do
laboratory work.

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:11.815
It's a sort of cushy
assignment.

00:24:11.815 --> 00:24:15.200
It's the sort of thing that
people like Dick Cheney and

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.370
George Bush were criticized
for during

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:20.920
presidential campaigns.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.080
All your friends are going off
to war and you're staying home

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.770
in Cambridge, working at MIT.

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:29.500
A lot of I think the motivation
for people was they

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.810
really wanted to prove they were
doing something important

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:34.880
and making a contribution to
the war effort and not just

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.150
avoiding the draft.

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:39.230
Because they were exempted
from the draft.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:43.850
And that they really were
serving their country in the

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:44.940
same kind of way.

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:47.500
This was not the Vietnam War,
which was very contentious

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.260
about who went and who
didn't go and who

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:50.210
wanted to get drafted.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:53.160
This was where the entire
country literally mobilized.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.430
And everybody's job, everybody's
home life,

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:57.530
everybody moved around.

00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:58.770
And it really fundamentally
changed the

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:00.160
country for that period.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:03.830
So you have this environment
inside the laboratories which

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:05.080
is very different.

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:11.170
So a couple of statistics, as I
mentioned MIT was the single

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:14.790
largest recipient of OSRD
already funds, I think by a

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:19.200
factor of two or three, $116
million over five years.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.210
Again, that's a lot of money in
today's world, much less in

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:25.450
1940 dollars, where the
total budget was

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:29.250
$300,000 before then.

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:33.120
There were about 2,300 contracts
overall in the OSRD,

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.750
totaling $500 million.

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:38.850
So MIT got more than 20%
of the total funds.

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:42.700
It was a bit of an inside
job, no doubt about it.

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:46.110
The Radiation Laboratory by
1942, again it was only

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:50.180
founded in the end of 1940, so
within a year it was as large

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:53.410
as the rest of MIT
all together.

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:55.390
And it was of course,
right there.

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:02.930
The overhead started
out as 30% and got

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:04.410
reduced down to 10%--

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:06.470
again today it's 63 and 1/2%--

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:09.670
because they didn't want to be
seen as raking off all this

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:10.920
cash that came in.

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:20.580
And again, there was a
lot of resistance.

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:22.870
There's a great quote by Harold
Bowen, who was the head

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:24.120
of the Naval Research
Laboratory.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:24.980
He was an MIT graduate.

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:26.540
He said--

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.800
he's coming from within
the Navy--

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.160
those of us who had been working
in applied science for

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:35.090
years cannot be blamed for not
always enthusiastically

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:37.800
endorsing all the efforts of
the Johnny-come-latelys who

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.540
inevitably steam into
Washington at the

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:40.830
beginning of the war.

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:42.710
So that was how they viewed
Vannevar Bush and all these

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:44.450
scientists, was they
were coming in.

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:45.750
We've been working on radar.

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:46.360
In fact, they did.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.750
The Naval Research Lab really
invented radar.

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:52.000
And here comes Vannevar Bush,
saying we're going to do it

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.280
all at MIT.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.410
And in a certain way, taking
it away from the Naval

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:56.200
Research Lab.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:00.930
Very contentious stuff, lots
of power politics going on.

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:03.470
Also with AT&amp;T. I'll
talk about that a

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:04.720
little bit in a minute.

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.580
Some of the other big
benefactors, and I mention

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:14.270
this because these places all
still exist and may be places

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:17.990
you'd come across, the
Jet Propulsion

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:20.150
Laboratory at Caltech--

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:21.880
anybody ever heard
of that place?

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.530
Founded right during
this period.

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:27.645
What do they do now?

00:27:27.645 --> 00:27:29.010
AUDIENCE: Stuff for NASA.

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:30.560
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's
part of NASA.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.290
They do a lot of deep
space probes.

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:35.210
They did the Mars Rovers
that you've read about.

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:39.070
They do essentially nothing
with jet propulsion.

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:41.882
But they were founded, under the
direction of Theodore von

00:27:41.882 --> 00:27:45.550
Karman, to do rocket
research basically.

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:48.010
There's a whole new institution
out there created

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:51.310
right about the same time,
by the same thing.

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:53.780
The Applied Physics Lab
at Johns Hopkins.

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.810
Anybody ever hear of that lab?

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:58.050
Also a big government lab,
associated with the

00:27:58.050 --> 00:27:59.790
university.

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:02.560
They do all kinds of interesting
secret stuff.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.915
They do submarine tracking and
they do a lot of space design

00:28:05.915 --> 00:28:07.220
and they build satellites.

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:10.925
And in fact, the former
head of NASA, Mike

00:28:10.925 --> 00:28:13.710
Griffin came out of there.

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:17.090
And they were founded in the
same period to develop the

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:19.530
proximity fuse, which was
a little radar device.

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:21.770
It was built into an
artillery shell.

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:24.280
It was designed to explode when
it came near an airplane.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:30.980
So these are all places
that still exist.

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:34.320
A lot of these big government
or quasi-government research

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.570
labs exist.

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:39.820
Let me maybe turn
to the slides.

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:41.270
Any questions on any of that?

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:53.345
I have a few more numbers
about the Rad Lab radar.

00:28:53.345 --> 00:28:57.720
AUDIENCE: I mean one of the
things that comes out in the

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.850
article by Debbie Douglas is
that the significance of the

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:05.210
microwave research here at MIT
was it that allowed people to

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:07.580
make radar units smaller.

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:09.200
So what had existed before?

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.890
You mentioned the Navy.

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:11.990
PROFESSOR: I think I have
pictures of that.

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:13.440
AUDIENCE: OK, great.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.750
PROFESSOR: So here's
one example.

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:21.970
This will become relevant when
we talk about Apollo actually.

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:27.200
Again, one of the big concerns
was about gunfire control.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.470
And this is a device--

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:31.860
I may have mentioned
this before.

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:34.790
Did I show this picture
before so far?

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:36.710
I actually have two of these
things in my office.

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:40.290
I bought them on eBay for about
$25, still brand new in

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:43.520
the box from 1945, when there
were manufactured.

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:47.080
And this is a gun site for a
guy, an anti-aircraft gunner,

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.330
aboard a Naval ship.

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:51.960
And what it does is it's got
two gyroscopes in it.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:55.510
And it has a little mirror and
it automatically calculates

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.230
the lead for the gunner.

00:29:57.230 --> 00:30:00.880
So if there's an airplane coming
in and you've got to

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:05.260
lead it by some amount in order
to fire ahead of it,

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:08.150
because it takes time for the
bullets to get there, and it

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:10.520
can be very hard to train people
to do that, that's how

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.640
you shoot skeet and stuff.

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.060
And what this thing does, is it
just says, if you just put

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:19.980
the cross-hairs in your site,
on the actual airplane, it

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.400
will automatically calculate
the lead and sort of force

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.710
your hands to lead the gun.

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:28.990
And this was built by, not only
by Charles Stark Draper

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:32.300
in the Instrumentation Lab here,
but also by Bob Siemens,

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.600
who was one of his students,
who then became second in

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.430
command at NASA during
the Apollo program.

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:37.920
We'll talk about that.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:43.040
And was one of their first
forays into gyroscopes, which

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:46.620
then became really important
during the Cold War and later.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:49.560
I keep pushing the wrong
side of the mouse.

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.820
And this is actually
how it worked.

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:56.650
So you can see they can just
see the site and it sort of

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:59.790
forces the gunner, if he keep
the cross-hair on the plane,

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:01.620
to calculate the lead.

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:05.190
And one of the reasons I show
you this is that one of the

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:09.240
real themes that runs through
the work that gets done at MIT

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:12.450
is not just the microwave
physics itself, but the user

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:14.130
interfaces for a lot
of these things.

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:16.690
And building on that work that
we talked about with the

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:20.110
differential analyzer, how you
actually kind of match these

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:23.300
systems to human performance
is really one of the big

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:24.360
themes in the research.

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:27.400
And that sort of leads us
obviously up through Weiner

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.650
and cybernetics.

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:35.370
This is one of the divisions of
the NDRC, which was devoted

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:39.320
to fire control, which is that's
the same issue about

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:42.130
how do you aim these different
kinds of guns?

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:45.620
And I give you this list because
I want to show you the

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:50.410
combination of people who were
here and the representatives

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:54.990
from both industry and the
government and then also in

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:56.630
the world of computing.

00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:59.560
So just to give you
a couple examples.

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:03.380
This guy here is Warren Weaver,
who is one of the

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.590
senior people at the Rockefeller
Foundation, who

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:08.300
funds Bush's differential
analyzer.

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:12.410
Also is the guy who invented the
term "molecular biology."

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:16.200
And so he comes from the kind
of pre-World War II private

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.980
foundation world of
science funding.

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:21.330
This is Preston Bassett, who is
the president of the Sperry

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:25.050
Gyroscope Company, which makes
a lot of these kinds of

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:27.060
control systems.

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:30.580
Harold Hazen, who is a student
of Bush, who writes the first

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:34.610
paper on the theory of
servomechanisms in 1934 and

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:36.395
becomes dean of engineering
at MIT.

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:44.430
This guy here is
George Stibitz.

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:48.590
He invented the word "digital"
and built all kinds of control

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:51.840
computers out of telephone
relays during the war.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:52.800
This guy is Ivan Getting.

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:54.450
And I'll talk about him
in a little bit.

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:56.610
He did a lot of the early
work on radar.

00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:59.480
And later on, was really
the father of the GPS

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:04.180
constellation, that we now
use to navigate our cars.

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:06.150
Karl Wildes, also a electrical
engineering

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:08.740
professor here at MIT.

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:11.950
George Philbrick, who really
kind of invented the analog

00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:14.140
computer, electrical
analog computer.

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:17.290
And we'll talk a little bit more
about that in a minute.

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:19.330
So you have all these people
sort of coming together on

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:20.330
this problem.

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:22.680
None of them had ever thought
about this problem before in

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.920
their entire careers.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.060
Which was sort of a benefit,
right, because the Navy

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.760
figured they knew how to do it
and all these guys just sort

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.930
of came in and did it
in a different way,

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:35.520
with some fresh ideas.

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:38.130
This is an electronic,
analog electronic

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:39.380
computer that they built.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.530
You see these two guys here
looking through these sites.

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:47.470
The actual electronics for
the computer is here.

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:50.850
And they follow an airplane
with these optical sites.

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:54.050
And then it actually has giant
servos on the gun that

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:56.740
actually point the gun to aim
it in the right place

00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:57.810
and then fire it.

00:33:57.810 --> 00:33:59.050
So it's the beginning
of a kind of

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:00.840
integrated control system.

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:06.550
And anybody here ever hear the
term "operational amplifier"

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:08.580
or use an operational
amplifier?

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:11.530
It's one of the basic building
blocks of modern electronics.

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:13.409
It's sort of the basic
feedback loop.

00:34:13.409 --> 00:34:16.739
Any of you take, what is it
6002, I think they probably do

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:18.595
op amps in that course.

00:34:18.595 --> 00:34:23.380
The first op amps are invented
to go into this device.

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:25.969
And the whole idea of a feedback
amplifier being used

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:29.560
to do addition and subtraction
and multiplication and

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:32.620
division and integration and
differentiation, all comes out

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:36.194
of this device, from again, from
the telephone company.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:41.909
Again, we read about Wiener.

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:44.400
Weiner is a sort of mathematical
adviser to all

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.949
these guys.

00:34:45.949 --> 00:34:51.860
The book that I assigned the
intro for you is from 1948,

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:52.810
Cybernetics.

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:55.250
But as he talks about in there,
really kind of the

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:58.620
genesis of it was him thinking
about anti-aircraft fire

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:01.136
control during the
Second World War.

00:35:01.136 --> 00:35:05.110
And of course, now we have the
idea of cyberspace and cyber

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:08.800
this, and my Sony Cyber-shot,
and all this kind of stuff.

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:13.680
The basic ideas of a lot of
this came from people like

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:16.700
Norbert Wiener, working
out not only the basic

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.746
mathematics--

00:35:18.746 --> 00:35:21.550
in fact, you can see them
on the board here.

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:26.650
If you read the rest of that
book of Cybernetics, which is

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:31.540
a lot of mathematics, a lot of
it is the basic equations for

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:35.000
what today you call signal
processing or digital signal

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:35.460
processing.

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.250
It wasn't digital
when he did it.

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:39.940
But the whole idea of
correlation and convolution

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:43.700
and different kinds of
filters and stuff

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:44.900
is came out of there.

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:45.880
Yup?

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.330
AUDIENCE: So actually I got
curious and went onto

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:49.800
Wikipedia and looked them up.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.500
Those equations are actually on
Wikipedia under an article

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.080
called the "Weiner filter."

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:55.100
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.760
The Weiner filter is a sort of
classic optimal filter that is

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.650
a predecessor to the common
filter, which is something

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:02.340
that people use all
the time today in

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:03.590
design and control systems.

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:12.810
There's Building 20, which is
the actual radiation lab.

00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:16.000
Let's see if we can orient
ourselves to it.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.090
Well, I'll let you see
if you can do it.

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:20.340
What are you seeing there?

00:36:23.904 --> 00:36:25.370
AUDIENCE: Is that
Vassar Street?

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:25.650
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:28.920
This is Vassar Street here.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.330
AUDIENCE: Oh, wow.

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:32.210
It's really big.

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:33.650
PROFESSOR: It's big.

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:35.480
It was built in about
four months.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:38.780
It lasted about 40 years,
probably longer, 45 years.

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:43.180
It was basically built like
an army barracks.

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:47.840
What's this right here?

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:53.680
I think that's us.

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.900
AUDIENCE: That's where
we are now.

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:58.110
PROFESSOR: Where we
are right now.

00:36:58.110 --> 00:36:59.515
In fact, yeah.

00:36:59.515 --> 00:37:01.270
AUDIENCE: Almost exactly.

00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:02.280
PROFESSOR: What's this?

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:02.990
AUDIENCE: Swimming pool.

00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:04.580
PROFESSOR: That's the alumni
pool, which is right out the

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:07.290
window, which was already
built then.

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:10.480
Everything that happened
is built around that.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.740
And so here is the--

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:17.310
I'm not sure which
building that is.

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:21.070
That looks like one of the
original main group buildings.

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:22.700
So there's the Rad Lab.

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.140
You can see this huge
loading dock.

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:27.020
Lots of stuff going
in and going out.

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:28.410
These different kind
of fingers.

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:30.960
And all these wacky radar
antennas up on the roof for

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.170
experimental testing.

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:39.190
Does nobody know what was it--

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:40.960
it's still there today--
the Christian

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.920
Science church downtown?

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:46.100
If you go like to Boston
Symphony Hall, there's a big

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.560
plaza and there's a dome.

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.390
Which before Boston was built
up, that was one of the

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:53.430
prominent features of
the Boston skyline.

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:56.680
That was the first microwave
radar target in history, from

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.810
a building at MIT, fired over
and reflected off that dome.

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:14.390
This is just an image
of the various labs.

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:18.950
There's many of these different
labs in the Rad Lab.

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:22.190
And it's considered a kind of
prototype of what a modern R&amp;D

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:24.250
lab could be set up like.

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:25.960
You can see here,
it's divided up.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:31.000
There's a receiver lab, an
indicator antenna lab, a

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.280
shielded room, a darkroom.

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:37.450
If you know the history
of physics,

00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:38.840
you'll know a lot of--

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.890
Lee Dubridge was
the head of it.

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:44.410
I.I. Rabi is a famous
Columbia physicist.

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:47.280
Kenneth Bainbridge I think
was a Nobel Prize winner.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:50.440
I'm not sure about that.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:52.030
Pollard later won
the Nobel Prize.

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:58.990
So lots of people, who later
became very, very important,

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:02.030
including people like Paul
Samuelson, the Noble Prize

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:09.860
winning economist here at MIT,
that you might not expect.

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:11.720
So the Rad Lab gets started
around this

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:13.580
device, the cavity magnetron.

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:15.170
Anybody seen something
like this before?

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.556
There's two places you
might have seen it.

00:39:20.556 --> 00:39:22.420
AUDIENCE: It's on the
poster in Lab 7.

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:22.930
PROFESSOR: So three.

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:24.540
It is on the poster in Lab 7.

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:25.370
Very good.

00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:27.550
I forgot about that one.

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:28.160
Where else?

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:28.680
AUDIENCE: The museum.

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.800
PROFESSOR: So there's
one in the museum.

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:34.790
One other place you might have
seen it, knowing what MIT

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:37.560
students might be like.

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:39.520
If you ever take apart a
microwave oven, you'll see one

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:42.200
of these things inside there.

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.310
In fact, that's kind
of the only place

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:44.650
you'll still find them.

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:48.910
So this device is only
about this big.

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:50.330
If you go to the museum,
you'll see it.

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:52.070
It's one of the 150 objects.

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:57.480
And radar had been invented
in the early '30s really.

00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:59.350
But it was pretty
long-wave radar.

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:01.750
I may have a picture of it.

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:03.150
Yeah.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:06.590
So this is pre-World
War II radar.

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:08.500
This is built by Western
Electric, which is

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:09.930
part of Bell Labs.

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:12.450
And there's a couple of key
things to notice about it.

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:13.790
What do you notice about it?

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:18.250
It's really big.

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:19.500
Why is it big?

00:40:22.758 --> 00:40:24.160
AUDIENCE: With long waves.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:27.360
AUDIENCE: It's using relatively
long wavelengths,

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.090
in the sort of hundreds of
megahertz wavelengths.

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:31.940
You can see the antenna
and all the wires

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:33.090
for it on the left.

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:34.710
And this is pretty much
state of the art when

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:36.220
the Rad Lab is founded.

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.530
And more or less, this
is an American radar.

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:40.840
But the British have a version
of this that they used during

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.740
the Battle of Britain, they call
it Chain Home, that is

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:45.880
able to detect attacking
aircraft.

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.694
And it does actually
work in fact.

00:40:48.694 --> 00:40:52.680
In fact, the Pear Harbor attack
was detected by one of

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:56.380
these right radars, as SCR-268
268, before it happened, a

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:57.670
couple hours before
it happened.

00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:00.480
But nobody really had any
faith in the technology.

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:01.070
And it was new.

00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:02.350
And people didn't really
understand it.

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:04.220
And it was just a bunch of
blips on the screen.

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:09.120
And the warning that the radar
station issued, was ignored.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.970
Tells you something about any
technology needs to develop

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:15.260
its own credibility and to have
people believe in it.

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:19.100
After that, they tended to
believe in it, once it--

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:20.920
But it's a very big radar.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.850
It's pretty unwieldy.

00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:24.710
You can see, it probably didn't
work very well in the

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:28.720
rain, because the guys are all
standing there outside,

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:31.740
exposed, and the electronics
are fairly exposed.

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:34.800
He's just looking into an
oscilloscope right there.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.760
That's a pre-World War
II oscilloscope.

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.685
It's the size of a Volkswagen
practically.

00:41:38.685 --> 00:41:43.610
And you see he's looking in
through just a darkened hood.

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:45.840
And the British, the problem
was that for higher

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.750
frequencies, it was that very
hard to generate enough power,

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:51.310
at what they call microwave
frequencies, which is sort of

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:54.970
centimeters and below, in the
kind of high hundreds of

00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:57.870
megahertz up to several
gigahertz range.

00:41:57.870 --> 00:41:59.380
And the British come
up with this thing

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.440
called a cavity magnetron.

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:09.420
There it is.

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:12.310
And again, it's not a
big device at all.

00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:17.080
But I'll show you the shape
of it in a little bit.

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:20.200
It's got a central hole and
there's little resonators all

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.720
around it, a very characteristic
shape of what's

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:22.610
inside there.

00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:24.780
You put that in a magnetic field
and pump a very high

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:27.960
voltage into it and it generates
really large, very

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:29.990
high-power microwaves.

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:33.040
And this has all kinds
of advantages.

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:35.760
But the key one is that it's
just small and the antennas

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:38.250
are small and it allows you to
do all kinds of different

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:39.110
things with it.

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:42.720
But it implies a whole new
kind of electronics.

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:46.070
For example, you may be familiar
with this, but

00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:48.370
microwaves at high powers
don't really like to go

00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:49.820
through wires.

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:51.810
They need to go through pipes.

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:52.670
What are those pipes called?

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:54.090
Anybody know?

00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:54.560
AUDIENCE: Wave guides.

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:55.730
PROFESSOR: They're called
wave guides, right.

00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:57.150
So you have to invent
a whole new kind

00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:58.440
of wiring or plumbing.

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.750
You literally plumb this
kind of stuff through.

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:04.220
And all that stuff
didn't exist.

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:05.960
But what the British did
was they built this.

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:08.030
They figured out
that it worked.

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:11.530
And in September of 1940, they
were being bombed to

00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:14.830
smithereens by the Nazis
on a regular basis.

00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:16.780
They were barely surviving
the war effort.

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:18.920
And they didn't have a big
electronics industry.

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:22.020
So it wasn't easy for them to
contemplate how to manufacture

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:23.700
this thing in large numbers.

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:28.380
So one scientist, his name was
Sir Henry Tizard, he came over

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:32.140
to the US on an ocean liner,
exposed to Nazi submarines.

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:33.630
And he brought one of these.

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:37.630
Actually, I think he brought
three of them in a trunk that

00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:39.600
he kept under his bed
on the ocean liner.

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.100
It was probably the most secret
military technology of

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:44.000
the war at the time.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.390
And he just brought it on this
civilian liner, sort of

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:51.340
wrapped up in his socks
and underwear.

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:52.280
That's exaggeration.

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.510
I think he had a special
box for it.

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:55.310
And he brought them.

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:57.990
And he brought them to the
government and said, we have

00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.870
this thing.

00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:01.470
And we want you to have it.

00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:03.080
And we want the Americans
to figure it out.

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:06.480
They actually intended for Bell
Labs to deal with it.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:09.160
And they brought it to the NDRC
and Bush sort of said,

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.470
well, we'll bring
this up to MIT.

00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:12.130
And they founded
a lab about it.

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:15.230
That's what happens in
October of 1940.

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:17.620
And that's when the Radiation
Lab is founded.

00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:19.760
And it's interesting, because
Rabi is said to

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:20.970
have taken it out.

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:23.570
And people said to him, he said
well, how does this thing

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:25.050
actually work?

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:25.800
And they said well,
that's easy.

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.620
It works just like a whistle.

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:31.040
It's like an electronic whistle,
because you put power

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:33.350
into it and it generates
a resonance.

00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:36.020
And then Rabi looks up at it and
he says, OK, well tell me

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.600
how a whistle works?

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.625
And nobody at the time could
really explain to him how a

00:44:39.625 --> 00:44:41.120
whistle worked.

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.780
But that's not a bad way to
think about what the cavity

00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:46.530
magnetron does.

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:48.860
AUDIENCE: So are you implying
that the establishment of the

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:52.970
Rad Lab here really rested on
the proposition that it's not

00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:54.980
what you know, but you know?

00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:56.370
PROFESSOR: To some degree.

00:44:56.370 --> 00:44:59.140
And actually it should be said
that of the three, I can't

00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:01.060
remember the exact number that
came over, one of them

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:03.450
went to Bell Labs.

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:06.130
And they also did a lot of work
in microwave radar during

00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:08.715
the war, but there was work
enough to do for everybody.

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:14.720
So this is an image--

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:17.170
I actually have a blown-up
picture of this on the wall in

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:20.110
my office, because one of the
great things about the Rad Lab

00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:24.590
is that photography was kind
of newly cheap at the time.

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:27.890
And they documented a lot of
the research with thousands

00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:29.300
and thousands of photographs.

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:32.510
And years ago, I was working
through some of those

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:36.020
photographs at the MIT Museum
and I said to Debbie Douglas,

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:38.576
there's great pictures of daily
life at MIT during World

00:45:38.576 --> 00:45:42.070
War II in the Rad Lab things,
that are not the sort of PR

00:45:42.070 --> 00:45:44.250
photos you usually see
about the Rad Lab.

00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:46.090
And then she took a bunch of
those photos, and they're all

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:49.430
beautiful four by five
negatives, and blew them up

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:52.610
and did a little art
show of them.

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:54.510
And this is one which
I really like.

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:56.480
And I'll turn the lights
off, if I can.

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.600
Just generally you can
see them better.

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:14.000
That do anything?

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:14.940
Nope.

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:16.190
OK.

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:24.490
Just to look at them a little
bit about life at MIT during

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:26.630
the war, which Debbie's chapter
does a nice job of

00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:27.810
describing.

00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:29.590
What can you observe
from this image?

00:46:33.964 --> 00:46:34.936
Yep?

00:46:34.936 --> 00:46:37.970
AUDIENCE: The really, really
high waist lines.

00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:39.780
PROFESSOR: OK, high
waist lines.

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:41.040
AUDIENCE: God, who wears there
pants up that high?

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:45.750
AUDIENCE: Both women.

00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:47.390
PROFESSOR: There are
women there.

00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:50.500
A lot of women worked at the
Rad Lab, very, very mixed

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:52.650
gender environment.

00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:54.620
AUDIENCE: That would be sort of
the scientific version of

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:57.190
Rosie the Riveter
in that sense.

00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:59.690
Lots of women go into the
workforce doing this--

00:46:59.690 --> 00:47:02.438
AUDIENCE: They were going to
work as scientists or as other

00:47:02.438 --> 00:47:02.900
technicians.

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:04.540
PROFESSOR: Mostly as
technicians and

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:06.190
administrators.

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:08.810
Actually, I'm not even aware of
one that worked as a senior

00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:10.405
scientist or even an engineer.

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:14.510
What else?

00:47:17.576 --> 00:47:19.052
AUDIENCE: The facilities
are not like--

00:47:22.004 --> 00:47:23.901
I can see piping.

00:47:23.901 --> 00:47:24.370
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:26.020
So that's pretty much the
inside of Building 20.

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:27.490
That's what it looked like.

00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:29.920
It was literally built
in a few weeks.

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.170
What else?

00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:38.220
This one just captures this, I
think the sort of sense of the

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:40.270
pace that the place
must have had.

00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:41.470
You have a sense, everybody's
busy.

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:43.220
They're walking somewhere
quickly.

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:44.290
They're moving things around.

00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:46.070
There's equipment coming
across the hall.

00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:47.680
That is a microwave
radar antenna.

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:50.110
That's a pretty radical
departure from the previous

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:52.570
slide I showed you of what a
radar antenna looked like.

00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:56.720
That you can imagine putting
on board an airplane.

00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:59.830
And there's also the two
cigarettes there.

00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:01.440
These guys all sort of
identically dressed.

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:04.150
You get the sense it's a place
where just things are moving

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:06.370
fast, sort of like MIT today.

00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:09.350
It wouldn't be out of place that
scene, in the Infinite

00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:11.620
Corridor between
classes today.

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:20.340
Here is another image, a much
more formal one obviously, of

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:23.630
the steering committee
of the Rad Lab.

00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:27.590
You see people in here, like I
mentioned Ivan Getting, who is

00:48:27.590 --> 00:48:34.700
here, who later went on, as I
mentioned, to sort of spun the

00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:36.780
GPS project.

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:41.510
Anybody know who that
is right there?

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:44.070
That's Jerry Weisner, who
later became President

00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:47.540
Kennedy's science adviser
and president of MIT.

00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:50.930
I think this is Lee Dubridge,
who's the head of it.

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:52.665
But again, a pretty informal
environment.

00:48:56.670 --> 00:49:00.110
Part of the weekly meeting,
another one.

00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:03.970
This may be the first time here,
and Debbie had mentioned

00:49:03.970 --> 00:49:06.080
in her article and a bunch you
mentioned in your response

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.260
papers, the secrecy
that was going on.

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:13.240
Now, these days if any of have
ever worked in even a mild

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.320
corporate lab, you probably
have to wear a

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:17.720
badge all the time.

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:19.320
This was probably the first
time people had to

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:20.960
wear badges at MIT.

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:22.270
And this is what a badge
looked like.

00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:23.770
It was a little button.

00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:29.120
It had your picture on it,
your employee number, and

00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:31.430
allowed you to get into certain
places and not into

00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:34.050
other places.

00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:36.180
Again, it was called
the Radiation

00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:38.030
Laboratory for a reason.

00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:40.266
What was the reason?

00:49:40.266 --> 00:49:42.680
AUDIENCE: Disguise.

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:44.850
PROFESSOR: To fool people into
thinking it might be a nuclear

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:47.120
physics laboratory.

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:48.650
It was about radiation.

00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:52.510
But it was not called the
radar-- well, the word "radar"

00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:55.620
wasn't even well recognized
anyway at that point.

00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:57.535
But it tried to disguise it.

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:02.080
Again, as we mentioned,
lots of women

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:03.330
working in these labs.

00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:10.770
Probably a pretty different
work environment than what

00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:11.560
people were used to.

00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:16.130
Even though we've talked about
women at MIT before, not in

00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:18.240
these kind of numbers and
this much involved in

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:19.490
the technical work.

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:25.090
This is just a page out of the
yearbook that the Rad Lab

00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:26.720
produced, showing all
the different kinds

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:28.120
of things they did.

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:30.280
It didn't come out that well
in the slide here.

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:36.640
Another image, I love their
images of this sort of

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:38.645
electronic experimentation
stuff.

00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:43.940
It has s sort of thrown
together sense of the

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:47.100
director's chair,
an oscilloscope.

00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:49.110
What I find interesting is that
a lot of the connectors

00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:51.220
on all these machines are still
connectors you might use

00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:54.010
today, like a BMC connector.

00:50:54.010 --> 00:50:56.250
You still see those
everywhere.

00:50:56.250 --> 00:50:58.430
And this is what it took to get
this stuff up and running.

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:10.160
More pictures of the labs, in
this case without people.

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:17.890
So this is probably the radar
that was shown before in that

00:51:17.890 --> 00:51:22.100
hallway photo and is one of the
more famous products of

00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:22.490
the Rad Lab.

00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:24.010
It was called H2X.

00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:26.810
And what H2X did was
it allowed, if

00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:28.720
you were in a bomber--

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:32.160
the US and the British were
bombing Germany on a regular

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:34.750
basis during most of the war--

00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:37.940
but they had this famous Norden
bombsight, which would

00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:39.570
allow you to sight bombs.

00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:41.060
What was the problem
with the Norden

00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:42.310
bombsight, anybody know?

00:51:46.514 --> 00:51:50.130
If it was cloudy, you
couldn't use it.

00:51:50.130 --> 00:51:52.790
And if anybody's ever been to
Germany or northern Europe,

00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:57.330
during eight months of the
year it's pretty cloudy.

00:51:57.330 --> 00:51:59.640
And what this is, is
a microwave radar.

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:06.320
Again, it's not just an
advantage that the antenna is

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:08.230
small, but the wavelengths
are small enough.

00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:10.190
You can see things that are very
small, so you can make

00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:11.310
out a lot of detail.

00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:14.240
But you could actually fly over
in cloud cover and map

00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:16.890
out a river and a city
and all this stuff.

00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:23.150
And it allowed them to bomb with
radar, either at night or

00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:24.500
in bad weather.

00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:26.130
It had a huge impact.

00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:27.940
The other thing about H2X,
it was very important.

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:29.940
It's worth keeping in mind about
radar, because you see

00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:31.590
this with other weapons
projects.

00:52:31.590 --> 00:52:34.590
Almost any weapons project that
got made during the war,

00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:37.990
that actually was designed to
blow something up, it was

00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:42.600
very, very hard for it to have
impact in the war because for

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:46.950
one thing, to go from a
prototype in October of 1940

00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:50.210
through development and testing
and production pretty

00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:51.790
much took the whole war.

00:52:51.790 --> 00:52:53.660
So there was basically one full

00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:55.080
product development cycle.

00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:57.590
If you look at like the great
airplanes of the Second World

00:52:57.590 --> 00:53:01.270
War, the B29, the B17, these
were all finished by the time

00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:04.170
the war started and it still
took them years to get into

00:53:04.170 --> 00:53:06.110
production.

00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:09.860
Whereas, if you had, a radar,
you could basically make one

00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:14.410
of them, send it out in the
field in one of a bombing raid

00:53:14.410 --> 00:53:16.770
of 1,000 bombers and
make a difference.

00:53:16.770 --> 00:53:20.410
So radar had this leveraging
effect, where you could use

00:53:20.410 --> 00:53:21.980
very, very small numbers
of them and

00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:23.750
still have a big impact.

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:27.750
Which any kind of gun, if you
didn't make a gun in numbers

00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:29.730
of the tens of thousands, it
was not going to have any

00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:30.980
impact on the war.

00:53:34.888 --> 00:53:35.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:37.734
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:53:37.734 --> 00:53:41.220
AUDIENCE: How long between the
development of that product

00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:44.720
would it be then on plane?

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:46.210
PROFESSOR: In the case of the
radiation lab, it would be

00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:46.955
weeks or months.

00:53:46.955 --> 00:53:47.670
AUDIENCE: Weeks or months.

00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:51.200
PROFESSOR: And actually, no
small number of MIT engineers

00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:53.170
went in the field,
made them work,

00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:55.100
went on bombing missions.

00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:58.700
A few of them were killed,
literally taking these things

00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:00.570
in the field.

00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:03.520
Think about it any lab prototype
you've ever made, it

00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:06.770
may be a little rickety in terms
of its robustness for

00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:07.580
being in the field.

00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:10.340
It takes a lot of engineering to
go from there to a package

00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:12.480
that some soldier is going
to take out of a box.

00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:13.950
They didn't always wait
for that time.

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:16.610
And they did send people
directly from the Rad Lab into

00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:19.490
the field, to train the troops
and help them get up to speed.

00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:23.260
In fact, Karl Compton, the
president of MIT, was not--

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:26.780
in a sense, Bush, before then,
he was junior to Compton.

00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:30.020
He goes in and becomes head of
the NDRC and is senior to him.

00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:32.400
Compton became head of what was
called the Office of Field

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:34.250
Service, where they
did exactly that.

00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:36.490
They took all these things out
and they helped people

00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:39.100
understand how to use them.

00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:42.780
There's a B17 at Hanscom
Field, right out in the

00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:48.920
suburbs here, where the
Rad Lab had a station.

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:52.560
And they would do a lot of
testing and a lot of different

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:54.910
experimentation and flight
tests and stuff,

00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:57.380
also at Logan Airport.

00:54:57.380 --> 00:55:05.480
Here's a H2X installation inside
a B17, to allow the

00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:07.320
radar operator to look
through the sight.

00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:09.130
And again, think about
what a different kind

00:55:09.130 --> 00:55:10.600
of radar this is.

00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:13.970
The one I showed you from
before, the prewar radar,

00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:16.150
they're basically soldiers on
the battlefield, these guys.

00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:19.170
They're wearing helmets and
they're very exposed.

00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:22.180
Here, not only are you in a
high-altitude bomber, but the

00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:23.010
guy has a desk.

00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:26.940
It's much more like bringing a
laboratory out into the war

00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:27.970
time field.

00:55:27.970 --> 00:55:31.340
And there's a lot of interesting
stuff about

00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:34.410
thinking about radar as a way
to isolate yourself from the

00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:36.645
battlefield and manipulate
things on screens.

00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:41.480
One of the technicians who
worked on these radars was a

00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:43.080
guy named--

00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:45.430
well, what's the name--

00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:47.290
Douglas Engelbart.

00:55:47.290 --> 00:55:48.540
Anybody know what he did?

00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:54.180
He invented the mouse.

00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:57.240
And he'll tell you, during the
war I worked on radar.

00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:59.930
And I started to deal with like
moving things around as

00:55:59.930 --> 00:56:02.870
blips on screens using things
to turn things around.

00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:04.940
And after the war, when I
started to work at Stanford

00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:09.680
and user interface stuff, he
was not an MIT guy, some of

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:12.540
the ideas for interactive
computing really came out of

00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:15.830
this idea of looking
at a screen.

00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:22.440
This is a famous image,
one of the Rad Lab's

00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:24.400
sort of iconic images.

00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:25.906
Anybody know what it is?

00:56:25.906 --> 00:56:26.860
AUDIENCE: It's Cape Cod.

00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:27.930
PROFESSOR: It's Cape
Cod, right.

00:56:27.930 --> 00:56:30.430
So this here is just a
map showing you where

00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:31.650
the airplane was.

00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:32.760
And there's a radar on there.

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:34.670
The antenna spins around.

00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:39.870
And this is one of the first H2X
images, plotting out the

00:56:39.870 --> 00:56:42.870
contours of the land there.

00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:46.570
And so you'll see this appear in
another second in something

00:56:46.570 --> 00:56:48.260
I'll show you.

00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:51.180
But this gives you the sense of,
very, very different from

00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:52.150
blips on a screen.

00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:54.860
You're really able to sort
of map where you.

00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:57.740
A whole other level of detail
and in the military setting,

00:56:57.740 --> 00:57:00.630
that was very, very important.

00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:03.090
Here's even a higher
resolution one.

00:57:03.090 --> 00:57:06.360
This is an image from an
airplane, looking at another

00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:08.380
airplane nearby.

00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:11.265
And just to get a sense for
that resolution, too.

00:57:11.265 --> 00:57:13.840
You know, crude by today's
standards in some sense of

00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:20.510
digital radars and stuff, but
pretty fancy for that day.

00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:26.570
And anybody know what this
is, dead giveaway?

00:57:26.570 --> 00:57:28.780
This is the northern coast
of France on D-Day.

00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:33.770
And here is the radar image of
the fleet that's going to be

00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:36.140
the invasion force, taken
from an airplane.

00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:43.030
And you can see 6 June, 7:00
o'clock in the morning, taken

00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:44.160
from a plane that was above.

00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:46.530
This is Western England.

00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:52.760
Another interesting
radar is this one.

00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:55.540
It's a SCR-584.

00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:57.460
It was actually the first
tracking radar.

00:57:57.460 --> 00:58:00.310
And so in the history of control
theory and feedback

00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:02.200
control, it was the first radar
that could actually move

00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:05.020
its antenna based on
where it's target

00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:07.500
was and follow something.

00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:13.840
And they actually used these to
track the buzz bombs that

00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:17.050
came across to England
later in the war

00:58:17.050 --> 00:58:18.580
and shoot them down.

00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:23.710
It became also sort of an iconic
radar, because this

00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:24.940
tracking head, it's
interesting,

00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:26.485
it was made by Chrysler.

00:58:26.485 --> 00:58:28.400
And a lot of the gearing
in it was taken

00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:30.650
out of Chrysler trucks.

00:58:30.650 --> 00:58:31.680
And it has these servos on it.

00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:35.120
It was a very, very good, very
high precision tracking head.

00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:37.970
You see it in post-war
photographs for tracking

00:58:37.970 --> 00:58:40.980
rockets and doing sort
of early NASA work.

00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:44.330
And you'll still see
these radar mounts.

00:58:44.330 --> 00:58:46.690
If you ever watch like storm
trackers or anything, and

00:58:46.690 --> 00:58:49.510
their people who track tornadoes
and stuff, they

00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:53.250
actually use army surplus
radar mounts like this.

00:58:53.250 --> 00:58:56.930
But this radar also, sort of
serves the same purpose as the

00:58:56.930 --> 00:58:59.040
268 that I showed you before.

00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:02.530
but again, they bring the
operators inside the trailer,

00:59:02.530 --> 00:59:04.500
inside this sort of
closed laboratory.

00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:07.760
And it's very much thinking
of the battlefield and the

00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:10.680
electronic battlefield of
bringing all these blips into

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:12.620
a laboratory setting.

00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:16.250
And again, but the ultimate
culmination of that are these

00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:18.280
big command and control centers
you see during the

00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:21.570
Cold War, you see during the
space program, but it's just

00:59:21.570 --> 00:59:24.040
the beginning of that.

00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:27.420
That's the inside of a CR-584,
where they can plot

00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:29.370
things on the map.

00:59:29.370 --> 00:59:31.010
Also, this was one
of the early air

00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:32.950
traffic control radars.

00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:35.600
It was precise enough that they
could tell the pilots

00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:39.350
where they were and guide them
by radio, say come up, come

00:59:39.350 --> 00:59:43.030
down, come up and down, and land
them in very, very rough

00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:44.280
weather conditions.

00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:49.470
So I think this is
the last image.

00:59:49.470 --> 00:59:54.210
This is actually an
important image.

00:59:54.210 --> 00:59:57.370
At the end of the war, anybody
know what happened to the

00:59:57.370 --> 00:59:58.620
Radiation Lab?

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:03.470
Is it here today?

01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:05.270
Any of you students
in the Rad Lab?

01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:07.331
Nope.

01:00:07.331 --> 01:00:10.140
AUDIENCE: I think part
of it became the RLE.

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:12.730
PROFESSOR: Part of it
did become the RLE.

01:00:12.730 --> 01:00:14.810
And the rest of it?

01:00:14.810 --> 01:00:16.830
It just closed down one day.

01:00:16.830 --> 01:00:24.220
And went from 1945 to 1946, it
shut down by a factor of 95%,

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:28.400
and then all together in 1947.

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.720
Which is a very interesting
thing.

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:31.850
It would be very hard to
do in today's world.

01:00:31.850 --> 01:00:35.750
Remember from the Hunter Dupree
article about Bush, one

01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:38.380
of the reasons he was able to
grow this thing so quickly and

01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:41.160
so rapidly was that he always
promised it would only last

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:42.580
until the war was over.

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:44.630
And then it ended and he
kept true to his word.

01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:46.630
And the OSRD closed down.

01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:49.590
The NDRC closed down.

01:00:49.590 --> 01:00:53.820
And the Rad Lab just
closed down.

01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:58.600
Which by the way, was not a
bad way to influence the

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:00.090
American electronics industry.

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:02.855
Why?

01:01:02.855 --> 01:01:04.707
AUDIENCE: Probably there were
lots of people who knew about

01:01:04.707 --> 01:01:06.100
electronics looking for work.

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:08.050
PROFESSOR: It dispersed
all that knowledge

01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:09.710
out into the world.

01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:12.980
And a lot of those people, many
of them went to work on

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:15.470
radar, but a lot of them went
to work on television.

01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:18.800
The early American television
industry was largely composed

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.760
of Rad Lab graduates,
who knew a lot about

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.770
high frequency control.

01:01:23.770 --> 01:01:27.690
Also a lot of the early vacuum
but computers, Eckert and

01:01:27.690 --> 01:01:32.210
Mauchly, who built ENIAC at
University of Pennsylvania--

01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:33.250
I know I'm going to
forget which one--

01:01:33.250 --> 01:01:35.610
I think it was Mauchly, came
from the Rad Lab, where he

01:01:35.610 --> 01:01:38.580
learned about how to make vacuum
tubes do high-speed

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:41.740
pulse electronics, which by the
way is essentially digital

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.780
electronics.

01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:46.140
So these people all dispersed
into the world.

01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:49.510
The RLE, which still does exist
today, became the kind

01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:55.150
of intellectual core, people
like Wiesner and Wiener, a

01:01:55.150 --> 01:01:55.980
bunch of other people--

01:01:55.980 --> 01:02:00.550
I'll talk about that in the
next two weeks, I think.

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:02.910
And otherwise, the Radiation
Lab closed down.

01:02:02.910 --> 01:02:06.440
But before they did, I meant
to bring one of these, they

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:10.310
published everything they did in
a big series of textbooks.

01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:13.250
I think it's like
28 textbooks.

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:16.240
And they just published it out
to the world by McGraw Hill,

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:19.350
not secret, not classified,
none of that.

01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:23.780
And some of the first books in
servomechanisms were there,

01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:25.700
antenna design, systems
engineering.

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.780
The first book ever in systems
engineering came

01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:28.570
out of the Rad Lab.

01:02:28.570 --> 01:02:30.860
It was called Radar System
Engineering.

01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:32.730
And they have this
characteristic.

01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:34.290
You can still get them.

01:02:34.290 --> 01:02:36.000
But the original ones
had this sort of

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.540
burgundy cover with it.

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:39.410
And this was the logo they
had on the front.

01:02:39.410 --> 01:02:40.660
So what is that logo?

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.880
It's the Cape Cod image.

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:48.180
Anybody know what this is?

01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:49.120
AUDIENCE: That's the cavity.

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:49.360
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:52.710
That's the shape inside
the cavity magnetron.

01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:54.990
It's sort of their logo.

01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:57.410
And if you cut a cavity
magnetron open, that's what

01:02:57.410 --> 01:03:00.320
you'd see, is those little
circles that are all the

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:03.900
different resonate cavities,
where I believe the wavelength

01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:06.785
of the radar is the
circumference of that cavity.

01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:11.360
I meant to bring--

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:13.570
I have a few of the volumes.

01:03:13.570 --> 01:03:14.680
I don't have the whole set.

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:15.730
You can buy the whole
set on eBay.

01:03:15.730 --> 01:03:16.685
It's not hard to fine.

01:03:16.685 --> 01:03:19.070
Because most people think
of it as obsolete.

01:03:19.070 --> 01:03:23.590
But you can find them in
the libraries, as well.

01:03:23.590 --> 01:03:25.660
And it's a very famous
textbook series.

01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:28.440
And for most people who studied
electronics in the

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:32.100
postwar period, they learned a
lot of it from this Radiation

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:33.810
Lab series of textbooks.

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:36.400
So we were talking about secrecy
and the effects of

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.280
secrecy on campus.

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:41.460
This is a sort of anti-secrecy
effect, that it really just

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:42.990
had the goal of--

01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:44.630
yes, the Russians got it.

01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:46.310
Yes.

01:03:46.310 --> 01:03:48.280
Maybe some of our enemies
learned something from it.

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:52.930
But that was probably way less
proportional than what our own

01:03:52.930 --> 01:03:55.726
people learn about it and
what came out of it.

01:03:55.726 --> 01:03:59.480
I think that's my last slide.

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:01.970
AUDIENCE: That was the origins
of OpenCourseWare?

01:04:01.970 --> 01:04:03.250
PROFESSOR: The origins
of OpenCourseWare,

01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:04.140
in some way, yeah.

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:06.010
I mean I think that was the
same kind of spirit.

01:04:06.010 --> 01:04:08.170
And that's one of the reasons
that people like Bush felt

01:04:08.170 --> 01:04:10.190
that this stuff belong
in universities.

01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:13.220
Because if it was in the Navy
lab or in an Army lab, it

01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:15.110
would go behind closed
doors and stay there

01:04:15.110 --> 01:04:15.880
forever pretty much.

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:17.670
It's very hard to get stuff
published out of there.

01:04:23.530 --> 01:04:25.840
I'll just look at in
the numbers I have

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:27.090
here, if any of them--

01:04:30.930 --> 01:04:35.580
So then going on from there,
I mean the Research Lab of

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:38.050
Electronics is a really
interesting

01:04:38.050 --> 01:04:39.240
topic in and of itself.

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:43.670
And they get into acoustics
in a big way.

01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:47.330
People like, as we mentioned,
Jerry Wiesner is there.

01:04:47.330 --> 01:04:49.100
Weiner is there.

01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:50.980
People like Amar Bose
come out of there.

01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:53.310
And the Bose Corporation, who
may make your headphones or

01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:56.900
your speakers, is a spin-off
from the RLE.

01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:59.460
Even people like Noam Chomsky
kind of get their start in

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:00.000
that world.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.520
And there are a lot of
intellectual ties to, this is

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:07.630
a little bit of a diversion, but
if you think about some of

01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:10.780
the early work that goes on in
linguistics here that Chomsky

01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:13.650
does, it has very much the
same kind of systems

01:05:13.650 --> 01:05:18.290
engineering approach to it,
about thinking about grammar

01:05:18.290 --> 01:05:21.290
and language, along the lines
of people are thinking about

01:05:21.290 --> 01:05:24.830
these different kinds of systems
and systems ideas.

01:05:24.830 --> 01:05:27.210
That was the Lily Kay piece that
Will mentioned, that we

01:05:27.210 --> 01:05:28.540
cut off the syllabus
for this year.

01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:31.300
The same thing in biology,
people thinking about

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:33.830
information and communication
in these more and

01:05:33.830 --> 01:05:35.510
more unified ways.

01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:39.110
So what's remarkable about the
war is that this effort ended

01:05:39.110 --> 01:05:41.810
at the end of the Second World
War, but it had all of these

01:05:41.810 --> 01:05:43.740
kind of fingers that lasted.

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:47.730
We'll talk next week about
Whirlwind and digital

01:05:47.730 --> 01:05:52.230
computing and aerospace
and stuff on campus.

01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:55.510
But it's not a coincidence the
way that Cybernetics is

01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:58.750
published in 1948, Claude
Shannon's information theory

01:05:58.750 --> 01:06:02.260
is published in 1948.

01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:06.550
Also interestingly, I think it's
1948, Kurt Vonnegut first

01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:10.230
novel, Player Piano, is
published in 1948.

01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:12.670
Has anybody read that book?

01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:13.870
It's a really interesting
book.

01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:19.400
And the lead character in it,
I believe is named Norbert.

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:20.290
Am I right about that?

01:06:20.290 --> 01:06:21.270
It's been a while.

01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:23.470
It's got a very clear allusion
to Norbert Wiener.

01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:25.980
It's all about the implications
of cybernetics in

01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:29.960
factories and other
kinds of settings.

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:33.220
And there is this intellectual
thread that runs through a lot

01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:37.570
of this work about this link
between systems, and human

01:06:37.570 --> 01:06:41.900
machine interfaces, and
communication, and feedback

01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:44.720
control, and computing,
that you can carry

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:45.710
that through at MIT.

01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:47.430
And we'll talk later
about Project MAC,

01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:49.420
which is the 1960s.

01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:53.450
20 years later, people are
still thinking about

01:06:53.450 --> 01:06:55.800
interactive computing in
very similar ways.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:07:00.010
I mentioned Doug Engelbart, who
was not an MIT guy, but

01:07:00.010 --> 01:07:03.370
very much is very clear in his
memoirs, that he started

01:07:03.370 --> 01:07:05.380
thinking about these issues when
he was interacting with

01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:07.410
the radar during the war.

01:07:07.410 --> 01:07:11.180
And then it's only out of this
that you really get the

01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:15.620
beginnings of digital computing
and I think, and

01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:18.910
I'll talk about this next time,
a very particularly MIT

01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:22.600
take on those technologies
that's not so much focused on

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:25.710
the kind of basic mathematics
of them, but really thinking

01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:28.850
of these computers as embedded
in control systems, much in

01:07:28.850 --> 01:07:30.830
the way that all these different
radars were embedded

01:07:30.830 --> 01:07:31.680
in control systems.

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:35.000
So that's where you can sort of
see that the way that MIT

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.030
is organized, the way that the
federal government is funding

01:07:38.030 --> 01:07:40.920
science and technology, and
the politics of Washington

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:43.720
around it, and the actual
content of what kind of work

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:46.480
people are doing, and what sort
of ideas they're doing,

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:49.350
are all really very much
connected in this story about

01:07:49.350 --> 01:07:50.220
World War II.

01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:55.190
It's hard to overemphasize how
much profound influence on the

01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:58.110
world that we live in, even just
even just the local world

01:07:58.110 --> 01:08:02.000
here, came out of this really
just five-year, seven-year

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.790
period at MIT.

01:08:04.790 --> 01:08:08.690
We also looked at "Science,
The Endless Frontier." And

01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:12.560
that was where Truman came to
Bush at the end of the war,

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:14.550
pretty much at the end of the
war, because Truman isn't even

01:08:14.550 --> 01:08:17.540
president until right before the
war ends, and says, what

01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:18.920
are we going to do in
this in the future?

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:20.670
How are we going to
take this forward?

01:08:20.670 --> 01:08:24.109
And Bush writes this report,
whereas somebody commented in

01:08:24.109 --> 01:08:26.450
the response for today, it's
really very forward thinking

01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:28.800
where he says, OK, we're
done with war.

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:29.630
That's important.

01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:32.810
But let's really think about
doing this in a context that's

01:08:32.810 --> 01:08:35.740
really going to help our people,
and that's medicine

01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:40.830
and biomed and other sorts of
civilian applications to it.

01:08:40.830 --> 01:08:45.069
And that report to this day,
I mean that's sort of--

01:08:45.069 --> 01:08:49.090
has anybody read that before the
class or heard about it?

01:08:49.090 --> 01:08:51.640
It's sort of basic required
reading, if you have a career

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:52.620
in science in the US.

01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:56.330
It really is considered the
template for how the NIH and

01:08:56.330 --> 01:09:00.229
the NSF and a lot of other
federal agencies work.

01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:03.350
Interestingly, it's not so much
the continuation of the

01:09:03.350 --> 01:09:05.359
OSRD model.

01:09:05.359 --> 01:09:09.300
The OSRD model kind
of dies in 1945.

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:11.700
If anything, it's carried on
by the Office of Naval

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:14.919
Research, which is a very small
office, during the five

01:09:14.919 --> 01:09:16.890
years after the war.

01:09:16.890 --> 01:09:19.750
And then late in the '50s, I
think it's picked up again

01:09:19.750 --> 01:09:22.840
when DARPA is formed in
1958, also with a

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:24.130
very big MIT input.

01:09:24.130 --> 01:09:26.470
We'll talk about
that next time.

01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:30.490
But if you want to look at the
modern heir to the OSRD, it's

01:09:30.490 --> 01:09:31.729
not the National Science
Foundation.

01:09:31.729 --> 01:09:32.990
The National Science Foundation

01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:34.649
works by peer review.

01:09:34.649 --> 01:09:37.529
It has a charge to not only fund
the best science, but to

01:09:37.529 --> 01:09:41.319
do education and to sort of
spread its resources out,

01:09:41.319 --> 01:09:44.910
throughout the country in
a kind of even way.

01:09:44.910 --> 01:09:47.870
Whereas DARPA is much more
based on the model of the

01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:50.510
OSRD, intentionally or
unintentionally.

01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:54.010
You have very strong program
managers, who can sort of

01:09:54.010 --> 01:09:56.700
shape the fields the
way they see fit.

01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:59.800
It's within the military, but
it doesn't belong to the Air

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:01.370
Force or the Army or the Navy.

01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:03.110
And it has does its
own sort of thing.

01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:05.480
And it's sort of set apart,
very much in the same way.

01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:06.210
But that's--

01:10:06.210 --> 01:10:07.230
AUDIENCE: It's run academics.

01:10:07.230 --> 01:10:07.990
PROFESSOR: --another story.

01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:10.450
It's run by academics, yeah.

01:10:10.450 --> 01:10:13.680
And the first director was
Jack Ruina, who was a

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:15.380
colleague of ours here.

01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:16.590
We'll talk about
that next time.

01:10:16.590 --> 01:10:17.830
That's a post-Sputnik thing.

01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:19.790
That's the next big thing
that happened.
