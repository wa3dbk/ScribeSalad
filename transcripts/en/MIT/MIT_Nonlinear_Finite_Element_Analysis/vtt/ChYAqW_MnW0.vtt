00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.830
PROFESSOR: Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to this

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.660
lecture on nonlinear finite
element analysis of solids and

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.210
structures.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.250
In this lecture I would like to
discuss with you the total

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.880
Lagrangian formulation of the
two-noded truss element.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.210
In the previous lecture, we
considered the updated

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.390
Lagrangian formulation
of the same element.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.360
We started from the general
continuum mechanics equation,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.180
and obtained the governing
finite element matrices.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.440
I would like to do the same now
for the total Lagrangian

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.460
formulation.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.690
And we will see that to find
element matrices are indeed

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.690
the same that we obtained in
the updated Lagrangian

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.110
formulation.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.210
Here we have the governing
equation of the principle of

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.519
virtual work that we derived
in an earlier lecture.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.660
This, of course, is a governing
equation that we

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.100
apply to obtain the governing
equation, finite element

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.450
equations, for two or three
dimensional analysis, and also

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.580
for the truss element.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.280
It's a very general equation
that we discussed earlier in

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.290
great detail.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.870
We use this equation now
for the truss element.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.620
And the first point that we have
to look at is what stress

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.040
measure and corresponding
strain measure do we

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.290
need to deal with?

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.340
Now for the truss, it is
important to realize that the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.670
only non-zero stress is this
stress here, t0 S11.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.990
In other words, only the 11
component is non-zero.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.460
Let us look at this
fact in detail.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.250
There's first of all, what we
might call a mathematical

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.820
explanation.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.050
Let us assume, of course, that
the cross-section here is

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.020
constant, the same way as we did
in the discussion of the

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.790
updated Lagrangian
formulation.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.430
And here we have the element in
its original configuration,

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.790
and the element has undergone
large displacements and large

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.700
rotation to get into this
configuration at time t.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.180
Notice the length is
almost constant.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.190
We have an epsilon there.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.140
That, of course, stands for the
strain that the truss has

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.670
undergone, but that epsilon
is assumed to

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.590
be very, very small.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.430
We will later on also look at
a similar picture, but this

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.410
red truss element at time t
will have to be moved into

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.870
this configuration here,
starting, in other words,

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.130
starting on the left-hand side
here, we simply move this

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.150
truss element here straight back
so that this node lies on

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.290
top of that node.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.240
In other words, if I just show
it to you like that, it will

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.810
have rotated like that.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.170
Notice that as far as the
derivation of the stiffness

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.770
matrix of the truss element in
this configuration, and as far

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.150
as the element force vector
derivation are concerned, it

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.210
does not matter whether we look
at this particular truss

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.750
element in this configuration,
or whether we move it back to

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.600
make this point coincide
with that point.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.670
Well if we drive using what we
have discussed earlier the

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.650
deformation gradient for this
particular element, we

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.330
recognize that this is the
general expression.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:41.960
Notice that X, of course, is
equal to R times U, R being

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.190
the orthogonal matrix, and U
being the stretch matrix.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.340
Notice that in this X matrix
now, this here really is the R

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.970
component, and the U matrix is
nothing else but the identity

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.510
matrix with an epsilon added
to the 11 component.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.060
And the product of R times U
gives you then, of course,

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.860
this right-hand side.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.410
Since the truss carries only
the Cauchy stress, tau11,

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.890
corresponding to the tensile
force in the truss, we can

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.209
directly write down the Cauchy
stress in the stationary

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.280
coordinate frame
as given here.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.490
This, of course, is nothing
else but a Mohr's circle

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.710
transformation.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.670
Notice that our truss element
moves through the stationary

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.500
coordinate frame.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.870
I pointed out earlier very
strongly that we always deal

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.290
with stationary coordinate
frames.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:44.670
So this is the expression of
tau, the stress in the truss,

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.920
but written now in the
stationary coordinate frame.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.140
So we have sheer components
and normal components.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.220
Of course, if theta's is equal
to 0, then we have only here a

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.110
1, and all of these are the
components drop to 0.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.380
If we now use our general
formula, that once again we

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.140
discussed earlier, to evaluate
from Cauchy stresses, second

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.820
Piola-Kirchhoff stresses,
we directly

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.160
obtain this result here.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.400
Since epsilon is small, we
set this equal to 1.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.950
And we have, indeed, that's
the only non-zero stress

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:27.720
component in this stress tensor
is the S11 component.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.370
Well there's also a physical
explanation.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.880
And that physical explanation
goes as follows.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.730
We have initially, say, this
situation here in the

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:45.170
configuration at time zero
where 0S refer to the

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.700
configuration at time 0 is equal
to tau0, and that is

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.340
equal to nothing else than the
initial force in the truss

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.470
divided by the area, 0
components, of course, here.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:04.180
If we now think of first
extending that truss element

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:10.570
by a very small amount as shown
here, notice that blue

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.130
truss element here corresponds
to the extended truss element.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.460
It lies really on top of the
black, but in separating it

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.150
slightly out so that you can see
the different coloration.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.730
Then this blue truss element can
be sort of corresponding

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:32.320
to, and I'm showing it now up
here, equal to a time T star,

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.000
which is really a
conceptual time.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.220
We are pulling out the truss
first, and this means of

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.830
course, corresponding to that T
star conceptual time, we can

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.650
write down this equation here.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.020
Surely there are 0
components here.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:58.780
Now, we start rotating the truss
about the left node, and

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.820
the result is shown
on this U graph.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.670
Now we have the RAD
configuration, theta is here,

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.180
and the stress tensor
that we are talking

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.760
about has not changed.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.480
Why has it not changed?

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:20.290
Well because of this statement
down here, the components of

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.830
the second Piola-Kirchhoff
stress tensor do not change

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.725
doing a rigid body motion,
in particular doing

00:07:26.725 --> 00:07:29.170
a rigid body rotation.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:32.600
We discussed this statement
earlier in an earlier lecture.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.300
It's a very important property
of the second Piola-Kirchhoff

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.230
stress tensor.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:40.870
And this means, of course, that
the 0s which we had here

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.470
in blue remains 0's
here in red.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.650
Very important point.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:52.980
Well having identified then that
S11 is the only non-zero

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.810
stress component that we really
need to deal with in

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:59.090
the general principle of virtual
work, we can directly

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.500
write down this relationship
here.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.070
It's nothing else than the
application of the general

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.860
equation, which we looked at
earlier, reduced to the

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:13.360
special form of the truss
element taking only the S11

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.070
component into account.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.680
See here, S11, of course,
corresponding strains--

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:24.790
eta11, and here we have only
the 11 components as well.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:30.560
The next step is to look at what
are the individual terms

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.210
in that equation.

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:43.340
Recognize that S11 is nothing
else than tP over A. C1111 is

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.940
equal to E. The volume,
of course, is

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.700
given as shown here.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:51.770
And of course, we also recognize
that the stress and

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:54.310
strain states are constant
along the truss.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.350
Once again, because we're
dealing with two nodes only,

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:00.090
and we can only have a lean
interpolation of displacement

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.790
between these two nodes, meaning
that the strains must

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.660
be constant, and the
corresponding stresses must be

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.000
constant as well.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.540
We substitute these things into,
these relationships up

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.740
here, into the equation that
I showed you earlier and we

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.900
directly obtain this equation.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.160
Notice that in this equation
now, we want to, of course,

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:28.570
express the strain terms
e11, eta11 in terms of

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:32.330
displacements, nodal point
displacements.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:37.950
And that is achieved as
usual via a strain

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:39.470
displacement matrix.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:43.120
This is the relationship here
corresponding to the linear

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.910
strain increment, and that is
the relationship corresponding

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:50.350
to the variation on the
nonlinear strain increment.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.010
Notice again, and I've pointed
it out a number of times

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:57.500
already earlier, that we write
this right-hand side in such

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.760
way that the right-hand
side is equal to

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.020
the left-hand side.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:06.480
Therefore, these BNLs are
defined such that the

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.070
right-hand side is equal
to the left-hand side.

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:14.740
Also remember, u hat here, this
hat up there, the nodes,

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:15.710
the [? discrete ?]

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:19.090
nodal point displacements are
listed in this vector.

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:20.700
And here they are.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:26.410
Notice upper superscript refers
to the nodal point.

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:31.340
Lower subscript refers to the
directions, the coordinate

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.250
directions that we
are looking at.

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:37.910
Similarly, of course, for node
two, 2 up there, and

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.460
1 and 2 down here.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.060
We go back to our general
continuum mechanics relations

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:49.300
that we discussed earlier, and
identify that the total

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:53.010
increment in the
Green-Lagrangian strain is

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:56.150
given via this relationship
here.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:11:00.285
Notice that this relationship
is obtained from the general

00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:06.210
equation of this epsilon 0 IJ.

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:09.500
Of course, I and J are now
equal to 11 for the truss

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.700
because S11 is the only non-zero
stress that we just

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.960
have been considering earlier.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:21.170
So we'll go into our earlier
view graphs, the information

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:23.320
that we discussed earlier.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:29.030
To look up the equation on 0
epsilon IJ, we set I and J

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:31.080
equal to 1.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.190
There is a k also in that
equation if you look back.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:38.010
That k goes from 1 to 2 now
because we're looking at the

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:40.460
two dimensional motion
of the truss.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.700
If you have a three dimensional
motion, then, of

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:47.210
course, we would have to let
k go from 1 to 2 to 3.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:50.960
Here we have k only going from 1
to 2, that's why you see the

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.580
2 at the highest
subscript here.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.780
And automatically, you would
get this equation.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.850
Notice that the linear part in
here gives us the linear

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:03.100
strain increment.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.910
And that the nonlinear part in
here gives us the nonlinear

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:10.720
strain increment.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.360
And if we take the variation
on that part, we directly

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.690
obtain this relationship here.

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:21.430
We like to write this now in
matrix form, and that is

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.800
achieved as shown down here.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.130
Notice this part, of course, is
nothing else than what we

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:31.180
have up here written
in matrix form.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.585
There is, of course, in the
total Lagrangian formulation

00:12:36.585 --> 00:12:39.410
the initial displacement
effect.

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:43.040
And that initial displacement
fact lies in

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.960
these derivatives here.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.070
This one and that one.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:48.800
And we need to evaluate them.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.350
We can evaluate them from
kinematics, as shown in this

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.910
picture here.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:56.180
Notice that we have moved
the truss now, as

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.090
I pointed out earlier.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:02.910
We would do to the nodal point
to coincide such that, I

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:06.940
should say such that the
nodal points or nodal

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.510
point one has not moved.

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.030
Once again, that is quite OK.

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:15.230
If we want to derive the
stiffness matrix and force

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:18.540
vector of the element, because
those quantities are not

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:23.860
affected by this rigid
body translation.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:31.150
Here we have theta, and notice
these are displacements that

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:36.460
we call delta tU2, delta tU1
with a negative sign there

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:41.150
because this displacement would
be measured positive in

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.560
the opposite direction.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:48.180
And we can directly see that
this differentiation here is

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.730
nothing else than this
value right here.

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:52.710
From the kinematics.

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:56.540
Similar, this differentiation
is nothing else than sin

00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:00.870
theta, once again, from
the kinematics.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:05.270
So we have the initial
displacement effect in these

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:11.060
derivatives, and can evaluate
those as shown by these

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.820
functions here.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:17.480
We also want to, of course,
evaluate these derivatives

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:23.910
here, 0U11, and in fact,
0U2 comma 1.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:27.640
And we recognize that, as I
pointed out earlier, the

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.310
strains are constant.

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:32.360
Therefore, this is a constant
value, and in this

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:36.370
differentiation it's really
nothing else than this

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:37.780
relationship here.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.290
We take the difference in the
nodal point displacement, and

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:46.470
divide by L. Quite the same
way as we did it for the

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:48.540
updated Lagrangian
formulation.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.840
You can, therefore, write down
this differentiation, these

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:55.450
two derivatives here, as shown
on the right-hand side.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:03.750
Now, we are ready to take
these expressions and

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:09.300
substitute into the right-hand
side of the

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:10.580
linear strain term.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:15.000
Notice that this gives
us one term here, and

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.750
another term there.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.160
Let's look at these terms.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.530
This term here comes from
that part there.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:33.670
And this term here, down here,
comes from that part there.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:37.580
Let's look at this second
term a little closer.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:41.440
This here is, of course, the
initial displacement effect.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.210
All of that I should say
is really the initial

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:44.240
displacement effect.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:48.000
But if these terms are 0 here,
then, of course, initial

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.820
displacement effects drop out.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:55.180
So therefore, these two terms
here are the important ones,

00:15:55.180 --> 00:16:00.720
and we can see that they are
written in this vector here.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.980
We just derived them earlier.

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:08.650
Notice that this matrix, this
vector here, is given by this

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.820
matrix there multiplied
by the nodal point

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.390
displacement vector.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:17.760
And of course, this total here
gives us the initial

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.620
displacement effect, which
is captured in t0BL1.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.320
The sum of t0BL1 and t0BL0, of
course, gives us a linear

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.585
strain displacement matrix.

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:37.360
And that summation
is performed on

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.250
this view graph here.

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:43.430
Notice we have written these
terms once again.

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:46.630
Of course, if you had to
multiply out in order to get

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:51.640
t0BL1, the sum of these two
gives us this strain matrix,

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:56.190
the linear strain displacement
matrix.

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:59.370
And we now notice that in the
linear strain displacement

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:02.840
matrix, cosines and
sines of thetas of

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.200
the angle theta appear.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.310
That is something
to keep in mind.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:13.670
For the nonlinear strain
displacement matrix, we look

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:17.930
at our nonlinear variation on
the nonlinear strain term.

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.730
Here it is on the
left-hand side.

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:24.140
And we substitute for the
differentations the way we

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.030
have been doing it for the
updated Lagrangian formulation

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:28.040
of the truss.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:35.010
And we recognize, of course,
that this part here is given

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:39.610
by what is underlined as blue.

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:42.620
And this part here is given
by, again what's

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.330
underlined in blue.

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:49.420
And then this part here is the
nonlinear strain displacement

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:52.040
matrix, the BNL.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.080
That part right there.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:18:01.400
Well if we now use all this
information, we directly

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:06.712
obtain the stiffness matrix and
stiffness matrices, and

00:18:06.712 --> 00:18:10.050
force vector off the
truss element.

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:15.740
We substitute into here from
what we derived earlier, and

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.490
directly obtained
this expression.

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:21.790
And what's underlined here in
blue is, of course, the linear

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:24.390
strain stiffness matrix
of the truss element.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.910
And notice that this linear
strain stiffness matrix is

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:34.570
identically equal to the linear
strain stiffness matrix

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:38.990
of the updated Lagrangian
formulation truss element.

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:43.750
We use this term to obtain
the nonlinear

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:45.490
strain stiffness matrix.

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:48.380
And we notice that this
nonlinear strain stiffness

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:53.340
matrix is identically equal to
what we derived earlier in the

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.410
updated Lagrangian formulation
as well.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:03.740
The force vector, the F vector
for the truss element is given

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.930
on this view graph and
is obtained from this

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:08.650
relationship here.

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:12.250
Notice it's, once again,
identically equal to the force

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:15.570
vector of the updated Lagrangian
formulated truss

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:17.390
element as well.

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:20.290
And so we notice that to find
all the matrices that we

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:23.020
obtain in this total Lagrangian
formulation are the

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:27.130
same matrices that we already
had derived in the updated

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:28.380
Lagrangian formulation.

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:34.630
Important point to recognize
is that the coordinate

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:38.540
transformation used in the U.L.
formulation is contained

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:43.430
in the initial displacement
effect of the T.L. formation.

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:46.090
Let's look at that a
little bit closer.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:51.400
What this means is that in
the updated Lagrangian

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:55.120
formulation, we did the
evaluation corresponding to

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.740
the configuration
at time t with a

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.300
local coordinate system.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:06.030
And then after that derivation
was performed, we transformed

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:10.050
the nodal point variables to the
global coordinate system.

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:14.360
In the total Lagrangian
formulation, we obtain the

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.980
matrices directly corresponding
to the global

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.240
coordinate system through the
initial displacement effect.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:25.090
Now, the same can also be shown,
of course, for other

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:28.450
elements, and we have looked
here, particularly at a

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:32.030
two-noded beam element.

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:37.060
And we have asked ourself the
question then which method or

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:40.920
which formulation is always
more effective?

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:45.800
If you use numerical
integration, as we might want

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.620
to use for the beam element,
particular we have to use if

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:53.690
we want to capture
elastoplasticity effects.

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:57.230
Then clearly, the updated
Lagrangian formulation must be

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:00.680
more effective because what
you are doing in the total

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:06.370
Lagrangian formulation is to
carry these cosines and sines

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:11.170
theta terms along for every
integration that you're

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:12.420
considering.

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:20.970
In the numerical integration,
the product of B transpose CB,

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:24.380
with the B containing the
initial displacement effect

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:29.990
now, is much more expensive
than the product for the

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:34.250
updated Lagrangian formulation
where the B does not contain

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.410
this initial displacement
effect.

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:39.830
So in the updated Lagrangian
formulation, the B matrix is

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:40.760
much simpler.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.010
We do the numerical integration
with a simpler B

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:48.960
matrix along the beam element,
and the details are given in

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.080
this paper.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.240
And once we have done the
numerical integration, we

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:57.220
simply transform the nodal point
displacements from the

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:59.580
local coordinate system.

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.100
The [? coord ?] system, we call
it a [? coord ?] system

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.220
when we discuss the updated
Lagrangian formulation of the

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.970
truss element, and we transform
these nodal point

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:12.570
displacements to the global
system only once by this t

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:15.550
transpose kt product.

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:20.060
So this means then that
certainly for a two-noded beam

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:25.750
element, the total Lagrangian
formulation is not as

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:28.620
effective as the updated
Lagrangian formulation, and it

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:30.930
is very natural to use the
updated Lagrangian formulation

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:35.830
because you get the same
result in the end.

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:39.720
For the two-noded truss, of
course, the numerical

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:44.280
operations involved are so
close, so close, that one can

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.490
really say the updated and total
Lagrangian formulations

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:50.510
are basically the same.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:55.370
Let's now look at an example.

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:59.730
Here we have a truss, a simple
truss structure.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:05.350
And we perform the analysis of
this truss structure using the

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:09.430
U.L. formulation, the T.L.,
total Lagrangian formulation

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:13.380
would give the same result,
as I just discussed.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:17.670
And we want to particularly
calculate the collapse load of

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:19.580
this truss.

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:23.520
We also want to test the MNO,
the Materially Nonlinear Only

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.470
formulation.

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:29.880
The reason for testing this
formulation is to identify

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:35.630
what differences do occur, and
to understand more clearly the

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:38.950
U.L. Formulation, as well
as the MNO formulation.

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:42.420
Notice that for this truss,
the [? geo ?] matrix, the

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:44.910
geometric data are given here.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:50.620
The material data are given
here in this table.

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:54.110
Notice that, of course, these
nodes dawn here are fixed.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:58.260
Notice that we are putting a
load that pulls on the truss,

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.720
P, as shown.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:05.530
And that we have two degrees of
freedom, U and V. So it's a

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:09.430
fairly simple problem, yet there
is quite a bit of meat

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:13.370
in it when one looks closely
at the solution.

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:16.060
And that's what we
like to do now.

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:19.250
We calculate first analytically,
the limit load,

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:20.880
the elastic limit load.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:25.630
In other words, the load for
which the yield point is

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:28.680
reached in one of the members.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.300
And in fact, for this particular
load, the side

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:34.720
trusses just become plastic,
and this is the

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.100
value of that load.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:41.160
The ultimate limit load, when
the side trusses are plastic

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:45.990
and the center truss is plastic
as well, is reached at

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:47.240
this level.

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:53.940
If we use an automatic load
stepping incrementation, we

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:58.550
will discuss that in one of the
next lectures, we obtain

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:00.200
this response.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.730
Notice P plotted vertically
here, and V, the displacement

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:08.490
corresponding to P, plotted
horizontally.

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:15.340
Notice that we come up here in
the step-by-step solution and

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.860
march along here.

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:22.940
There are two solutions
given, actually.

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:29.220
One with v1, very small,
and one with v1 larger.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:32.490
This is here the parameters
that we use to start a

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:34.620
solution algorithm.

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:39.210
We have to start the solution
algorithm by imposing a small

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:43.730
value of displacement to a node,
and then the solution

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:46.610
algorithm can perform
automatically the total

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:48.230
step-by-step solution.

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:50.910
We will discuss that in one
of the next lectures.

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:54.430
And as you see, with the larger
value here, we get

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:55.780
these discrete points.

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:59.260
No difficulty solving
for this response.

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:03.290
Notice also that there's no
difficulty going beyond this

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:08.480
analytic elastic limit load,
shown here by the blue line.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.190
If we were to look very closely
at this slope here, we

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:14.780
would see that it is
slightly positive.

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:16.760
You can hardly see it
from this graph.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:23.360
This is the solution obtained
with the U.L. formulation,

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:24.580
with the U.L. formulation.

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:26.930
And once again, the T.L.
formulation would give

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:30.000
identically the same result.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.190
We now consider an
MNO analysis.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:35.640
MNO means Materially
Nonlinear Only.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.490
No large displacement
effect included.

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:41.940
No geometric stiffening
effect included.

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.830
Geometric stiffening, meaning
the effect of the nonlinear

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:47.450
strain stiffness matrix
being included.

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:51.210
So we want to use this
formulation, and once again,

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:54.150
apply the automatic load
stepping incrementation.

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:57.560
If the stiffness matrix in
that automatic load step

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.460
incrementation is not reformed,
in other words, we

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:05.030
keep the original stiffness
matrix, then almost identical

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:08.760
results are obtained to the
U.L. or T.L. formulation

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.890
solution results.

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:17.160
However, if the stiffness matrix
is reformed in the MNO

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:21.140
formulation, and for a load
level larger than the elastic

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.460
limit load--

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.320
remember, the elastic limit load
is quite a bit lower than

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.510
the ultimate limit load--

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:32.990
then the structure is found to
be unstable, as 0 pivot is

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:35.790
obtained in the stiffness
matrix.

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:41.250
I like to ask the question why
is that so to you now?

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:45.100
And ask you to just think
a little bit about it.

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.400
A few minutes.

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.680
And then when I come back, I
give you the explanation by

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.580
looking at the problem
once again.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.020
I'd like to now address the
question that I asked you

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.270
before the break.

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:39.510
Namely, why, if we use the
MNO formulation do we get

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:41.910
virtually identically the same
results as in the U.L.

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:47.370
formulation if we only set up
a stiffness matrix that

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:51.050
corresponds to a configuration
below the elastic limit load.

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:53.840
If on the other hand, we setting
up a difference matrix

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:57.210
above the elastic limit load in
the MNO formulation, then

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:59.120
we cannot, so it's a problem.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:06.740
Well the answer is that as soon
as the two trusses on the

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:11.100
side have become plastic, the
MNO formulation does not have

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.760
any more stiffness corresponding
to this degree

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:18.240
of freedom, meaning the matrix
is singular, and we cannot

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.540
solve the system of equations.

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:26.510
Whereas if we look at the U.L.
formulation, then we see that

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:30.530
the geometric stiffening effect,
or the KNL effect, the

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:36.830
nonlinear strain stiffness
effect, introduces the forces

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:40.460
that are acting in these two
elements into the structure

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:44.040
into the structure assemblage
as the stiffening part.

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:47.500
And of course, is a KNL matrix
corresponding to

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.170
this element as well.

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:53.450
So in other words, these three
KNL matrices corresponding to

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:56.940
these three elements, these
three truss elements,

00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:02.930
introduce a stiffness into the
total structure assemblage,

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:06.500
meaning that we can still solve
the system of equations.

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:11.320
We also notice that these KNL
effect that we are carrying

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:16.615
along in the U.L. formulation,
when measured on the KL effect

00:30:16.615 --> 00:30:18.520
are rather small.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:22.020
And this means that the
response of the U.L.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:25.700
formulation calculated with
the U.L. formulation is

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:29.430
basically the same as the
response calculated with the

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:30.770
MNO formulation.

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:33.730
As long, of course, we use
in the MNO formulation a

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:37.040
stiffness matrix that
corresponds to a configuration

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:40.240
below the elastic limit load.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:43.860
Well this completes
this example.

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:46.000
Let us look at another
example.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.900
And in this example, I like to
consider with you a pre-stress

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:59.980
cable, as shown up here, that
has initially a span of S. And

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:04.230
we then prescribe on the
right-hand side a displacement

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:08.780
to this node to bring this node
towards the left, meaning

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.350
that the cable will
sag through.

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:15.520
We want to calculate the
deformations of the cable, and

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:19.320
in particular, we want to have
the final deformations when S

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.420
is equal to 30 meters.

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.820
Notice that the cable
carries an initial

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:26.580
tension of 500 Newton.

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:32.130
And here we see the other data
corresponding to the cable.

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:32.940
This, of course, is a

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:35.350
geometrically nonlinear problem.

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:38.950
We want to use here the
U.L. formulation.

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:45.320
And the interesting part is that
to solve this problem we

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:49.820
have to use relatively small
time steps, or load steps,

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:51.830
because they're considering
it to be, of

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:54.680
course, a static solution.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:58.180
We need to only allow small
perturbations in the nodal

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:04.170
point coordinates, because if
we do will allow too large

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:06.610
perturbations in the nodal point
coordinates, we find

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:10.520
that the out of balance loads at
the nodes become very large

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:13.140
and we have difficulties
solving the equation.

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:17.700
So we use many load steps with
equilibrium iterations so that

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:21.980
the configuration of the cable
is never far from an

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.720
equilibrium position.

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:30.150
In this particular problem, we
used full Newton iterations

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:31.150
without line searches.

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:36.750
We will talk about this scheme
in detail in the next lecture.

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:40.560
We use also convergence
criteria because we're

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:43.850
iterating, we have to break up
that iteration or stop the

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:45.500
iteration at some point.

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:49.270
And we will use these two
convergence criteria.

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:52.490
We consider these convergence
criteria in quite some detail

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:54.090
in the next lecture.

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:56.230
Notice that basically we are
saying is that the out of

00:32:56.230 --> 00:33:01.010
balance loads shall be small
enough, and here we have an

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:04.805
energy criterion that
also has to be--

00:33:04.805 --> 00:33:08.050
this measure has to be small
enough for convergence.

00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:11.480
Once again, we will talk about
these in detail when we

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:15.550
consider the solution
of the equation.

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:18.665
Here we have a table that
summarizes the results.

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:24.470
In the first time step, puts the
gravity loading onto the

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:28.820
cable with a mass density that
was given, of course, on the

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:30.030
earlier view graph.

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:33.050
And we notice that with this
iterative scheme, we need to

00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:35.400
14 iterations.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:41.860
We then from time or load step
2 to 1,001 prescribed the

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:46.230
displacements in 1,000 equal
steps on the right-hand side

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:47.320
of the cable.

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:51.790
And we notice that we need
less than 5 or equal to 5

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:54.480
iterations per load step.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.990
This might appear to
be a fairly large

00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.970
number of load steps.

00:33:57.970 --> 00:33:59.640
Of course, one could
now experiment

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.000
and bring this down.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.980
If you try to bring this
down, this number, of

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:05.870
course, would go up.

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:07.610
And one could experiment
around.

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:11.770
But it shows what kind of
considerations are necessary

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:15.090
when you solve this problem,
namely that you don't want to

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:17.870
be too far away from the
equilibrium configuration

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:21.489
force of the cable in any one of
the load steps, and if you

00:34:21.489 --> 00:34:24.199
are, then, of course, you will
need a large number of

00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:27.010
iterations here, and your
iterative scheme might not

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:28.540
even converge.

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:32.530
Pictorally, the results are
shown on this view graph here.

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:37.780
Notice we have the undeformed
cable here.

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:42.600
And then with S equal to 55
meters, the cable takes on

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.929
this configuration with
S equal to 30 meters.

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:47.909
We see this configuration.

00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:51.530
And if you were to try to bring
this point in further,

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:54.230
then to model the curvature
down here, of course,

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:57.200
properly, you would have to have
a finite discretization.

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:02.660
So this is probably the largest
amount that you want

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:05.950
to bring this point over
with this particular

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:07.200
discretization.

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:14.000
If you were to use a finite
element discretization, this

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.400
curve, of course, would
hardly change.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:20.040
And this one here will change
a bit down here.

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:23.740
But these results are quite
acceptable up to S equal to 30

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:26.140
meters with this coarse
discretization.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:29.230
And we have learned a bit
from this problem.
