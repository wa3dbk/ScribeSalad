00:00:20.896 --> 00:00:23.260
PROFESSOR: Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to this

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.400
lecture on nonlinear finite
element analysis of solids and

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.690
structures.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.340
In the previous lectures, we
talked about the basic process

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.160
of the incremental solution
that is used in

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.990
finite element analysis.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.890
And we talked about quite some
important continuum mechanics

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.980
variables that we are employing
in nonlinear finite

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.760
element analysis.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.750
This was really preparatory work
for the discussion of a

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.760
general formulation that is very
widely used to analyze

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.350
nonlinear systems using
finite elements.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.250
And this formulation is called
the total Lagrangian

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.720
formulation.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.990
This is the formulation that I'd
like to discuss with you

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.820
now in this lecture.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.250
The total Lagrangian formulation
is a formulation

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:17.420
that refers the stress and the
strain variables at time t

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.700
plus delta t to the original
configuration at time zero.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.910
Total, in fact, means reference
to the original

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.000
configuration here.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.270
And notice we, of course,
encountered this equation

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.860
already earlier in the
early lectures.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.080
We have on the left hand side
again the total internal

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.125
virtual work.

00:01:38.125 --> 00:01:40.880
And on the right hand side,
the total external virtual

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.200
work all at time
t plus delta t.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.210
We have here the second
Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.380
Here we have the Green-Lagrange
strain tensor.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.870
And on the right hand side, of
course, all the body forces,

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.040
surface forces et cetera
would enter.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.900
We discussed in a previous
lecture how the right hand

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.140
side is calculated in general
and what it all contains.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.090
We also discussed that this
equation here is quite

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.860
equivalent to this equation.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.580
And in this equation, we have
the Cauchy stress tensor

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.450
operating on the virtual
strain tensor, an

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.050
infinitesimally small
strain tensor.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.460
And this product is integrated
over the volume at time

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.550
t plus delta t.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.200
On the right hand side,
we have the same

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.380
quantity as up there.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.700
Now notice that we really want
to solve, of course, this

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.880
equation here in finite
element analysis.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.630
But we discussed earlier that in
order to do so effectively,

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.740
we need to introduce a new
stress measure, a new strain

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.830
measure, and that, of course,
brings us then to this

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.400
equation up here.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.370
Let us recall briefly some of
the important points that we

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.010
made earlier in the
other lectures.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.450
We said that this equation here,
applied at time t plus

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.870
delta t, is an expression
of the equilibrium,

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.070
compatibility, and the
stress-strain law at time t

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.440
plus delta t.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.180
Let's just look at this equation
once more, where

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.660
these quantities enter.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.940
Well, if equilibrium is
satisfied locally everywhere

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.090
in the continuum, then this
equation must be holding for

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.760
any virtual displacements that
satisfy the displacement

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.050
boundary conditions, and
corresponding virtual strains.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.810
Notice that the virtual
displacements enter on the

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.600
right hand side, and these here
are the corresponding

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.400
virtual strains.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.462
The compatibility enters in
here because we would, of

00:03:47.462 --> 00:03:50.730
course, use compatible virtual
displacement, and we would

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.930
calculate also the stresses from
compatible displacements.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.410
The stress-strain law enters
in the calculation of the

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.910
stress here from the
strains given.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.670
And once again we apply this
at time t plus delta t.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.580
We also noted earlier that
we will be using

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.430
an incremental solution.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.640
Namely, that the solution at
time t plus delta t will be

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.300
calculated from the solution at
time t by incrementing the

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.630
displacements by ui.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.570
Notice that we will assume,
of course, that

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.370
the tui's are known.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.690
That the displacementts at time
t are known, and that

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.520
these are the unknown
quantities that

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.490
we're looking for.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.140
Of course, that gives us then
the unknown quantities that we

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.050
actually want to solve for.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.430
Our goal is, for the finite
element solution to linearize

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.530
the equation of the principle
of virtual work, so as to

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.370
obtain a set of equations,
finite element equations, that

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.390
read as follows.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.420
Here we have a stiffness
matrix, a

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.310
tangent stiffness matrix.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.630
Here we have an incremental
displacement vector.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.790
And on the right hand side, we
have a load vector, a vector

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.590
of nodal point forces
corresponding to the

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.930
externally applied loads
at time t plus delta t.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.300
And here we have a nodal point
force vector that is

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.060
equivalent to the current
element stresses, in this

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.150
particular instance at time
t, as indicated by the

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.430
superscript t here.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.916
Now this incremental
displacement vector, of

00:05:34.916 --> 00:05:38.310
course, will be added to the
displacement that we know

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.170
already, and that correspond
to time t.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.480
And that will give us then
a first estimate for the

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.400
solution, displacement
solution, at time

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.060
t plus delta t.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.780
Notice this is also summarized
down here.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.550
Notice, however, that this
vector here is only an

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.240
approximation to the actual
vector that we're looking for,

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.260
because of the linearization
process that leads us to this

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.950
system of equations.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.600
The equation tku equals r
minus f is, of course,

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.700
applicable for a single element
as well as a total

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.150
assemblage of elements.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.670
In other words, this equation
here, tk delta u1 equals t

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:25.130
plus delta r minus tf, would be
applicable to an element in

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.710
which n then would mean just
the degrees of freedom, the

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.350
number of degrees of freedom
of that element.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.510
And also for a total structure
in which n then, of course

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.910
means the total number of
structural degrees of freedom.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.010
The tk matrix, the r vector,
and the f vector would be

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.780
constructed using the direct
stiffness method the way we

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.370
are used to it in the linear
elastic analysis.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.060
In other words, there is
nothing new here to be

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.820
discussed really, as far as a
construction of these matrices

00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:01.910
go, when we talk about a total
element assemblage from the

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.660
individual element matrices.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.850
However, an important point
is that we cannot simply

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.140
linearize the principle of
virtual work when it is

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.210
written in this form here.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:15.650
And the reason was, of course,
that we cannot integrate over

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:16.560
an unknown volume.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.680
The volume t plus delta t is
unknown, or the volume at time

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.890
t plus delta t is unknown, and
we cannot directly increment

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:29.150
the Cauchy stresses the way we
discussed it already earlier.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.410
To linearize then, we need to
choose a known reference

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.700
configuration.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.630
And one known reference
configuration that is a very

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.850
natural one to use really,
is the one

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.710
corresponding to time zero.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.880
In this case, if we use that
reference configuration, we

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.830
talk about the total Lagrangian
formulation.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:51.440
If we use as a reference
configuration the

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.560
configuration corresponding to
time t, then we talk about the

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.380
updated Lagrangian
formulation.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.120
I'd like to make
one point here.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.180
Namely, that of course we have
calculated already from all

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.430
the configurations from
time zero to time t.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:08.590
So you may ask yourself, why
is he not choosing as a

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:12.350
reference configuration, for
example, the configuration t

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:13.740
minus delta t?

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:17.040
In other words, one
configuration prior to time t

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.150
as a possibility.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:21.580
Well, it would be a possibility,
but if you choose

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:25.290
to do so, you would lose the
advantages that you have in

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:27.880
the updated Lagrangian
formulation, and the

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.370
advantages that you would have
in the total Lagrangian

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:31.580
formulation.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.140
Of course, there are differences
here and we will

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.140
talk about the advantages and
disadvantages of either of

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.870
these formulations.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:41.539
And you would be left with that
choice of t minus delta t

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:45.700
reference configuration,
with basically all the

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.170
disadvantages only.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.740
And therefore, we generally want
to choose either this one

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:56.130
or that one as the reference
configuration.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:00.330
Let us now discusses the total
Lagrangian formulation.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.190
In the total Lagrangian
formulation, we use the

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:07.470
reference configuration zero,
and therefore we talk about

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:08.230
this stress.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:11.130
We use this stress and that
strain, this was a second

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.610
Piola-Kirchhoff stress referred
to the configuration

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:14.630
at time zero.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.060
This is the Green-Lagrange
strain referred to the

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.140
configuration at time zero.

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:23.240
The principle of virtual work
once again, originally in this

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:29.215
form, is now written
in this form.

00:09:29.215 --> 00:09:32.700
We have had that already before
on viewgraphs, and I

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.990
don't think I need to go through
those details again.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.280
But the important point is
that this is the starting

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.730
point of the total Lagrangian
formulation.

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.880
The formulation proceeds
as follows.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:51.130
We know the solution at time t,
therefore this stress, this

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.090
displacement derivative, all
the static and kinematic

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:58.180
variables in fact, are known
corresponding to the

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.180
configuration at time t.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:04.210
And we can now decompose the
stress corresponding to time t

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:10.420
plus delta t into one known
value and one unknown value.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.190
Similarly we proceed with
the strain measures.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:16.110
The strain measures, the
Green-Lagrange strain at time

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:19.460
t plus delta t is decomposed
into one value that we know

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.620
already, and an increment.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:25.805
And, of course, remember these
two increments are unknown.

00:10:25.805 --> 00:10:29.740
They are unknown, whereas these
are known because we

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.880
have calculated already
the configuration

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.150
corresponding to time t.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:39.720
In terms of displacements, we
can directly develop that the

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:45.350
Green-Lagrange strain at time
t is written as shown here.

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:49.120
We went over these different
components already earlier.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.990
Notice once again that we have
a product of displacement

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:55.132
derivatives here,
that this is, of

00:10:55.132 --> 00:10:57.310
course, a nonlinear term.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:00.160
And once again, as I pointed out
in an earlier lecture, we

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.130
have nothing neglected here.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.070
You see only quadratic terms.

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:06.590
There are no cubic terms
or higher-order terms.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:07.590
We have nothing neglected.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:11.030
This is a strain measure that
holds for any amount of

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.250
deformation, any amount
of strain.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:17.870
Then we can also write this same
strain, Green-Lagrange

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:21.560
strain, corresponding to time t
plus delta t, and this would

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.290
be the result.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:27.880
Notice whatever we had here as t
superscript has now become a

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.470
t plus delta t superscript.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.510
That's in fact the
only difference.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:37.410
If you subtract from this
strain, that strain, we get

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.900
the increment, and
that increment is

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.880
written out right here.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.590
Now, there are some interesting
points regarding

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.710
this incremental strain.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:52.420
This here is an increment in the
strain that is linear in

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.700
the displacement components.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:56.140
Similarly this one.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:01.010
Notice this one here, is, of
course a product, product and

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:04.010
may look, at first sight,
as a nonlinear term.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:07.100
When you see products of
displacements, you think of a

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:07.840
nonlinearity.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.710
However, if you look closer,
you find that

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.250
there is a t here.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.790
Therefore, this part is known.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:19.150
Since this part is known, and
this part is unknown, this

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:23.100
total term is really linear in
the incremental displacement.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.390
In fact, the incremental
displacements don't even go in

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.790
here, because we're
differentiating here the

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:31.220
displacements at time t with
respect to the original

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:32.930
coordinates.

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:36.320
Therefore, this total
term here is really

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.300
still linear in ui.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.210
Linear in the incremental
displacements.

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:44.680
We call this part here, as
given here, the initial

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:45.900
displacement effect.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.360
The initial displacement effect
because the initial

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:52.490
displacements go into these
derivatives here.

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:55.390
We are differentiating the
displacement at time t with

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:59.060
respect to the original
coordinates.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:02.440
This term, on the other hand
here, is nonlinear in ui.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.130
It is nonlinear because here
we're taking one term that

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.880
depends on ui, and we multiply
it by another term that

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.140
depends on ui.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:16.850
Notice this a differentiation
of uk, the incremental

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:20.230
displacement, into the k
direction with respect to the

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:23.320
original coordinates.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.120
Coordinate axis xj
here particular.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.590
So this is here, clearly
a nonlinear term in ui.

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.190
A quadratic term, as
a matter of fact.

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:38.490
We will look at this strain,
of course, a little

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.080
bit more just now.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:44.360
But keep in mind that there is
one linear term that contains

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.110
an initial displacement effect
and a nonlinear term.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:49.960
I might add here that, of
course, this initial

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.560
displacement effect is
zero if the initial

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.580
displacements are zero.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.010
In other words, in our
incremental solution, for

00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:00.870
example, if we are just starting
the solution process,

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.280
then the initial displacements
are still zero.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.530
This term drops out.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:10.620
We note now regarding the
formulation that the variation

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:14.100
on the total Green-Lagrange
strain tensor corresponding to

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:18.080
time t plus delta t, is really
equal to the variation in the

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.020
increment of the Green-Lagrange
strain tensor,

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:24.170
from time t to time
t plus delta t.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:28.200
In this picture we show
what we mean by that.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.520
Here on the left hand side in
black, you have the body in

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.300
its original configuration.

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.820
It moves to a configuration
at time t.

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:41.040
And then to a configuration,
here shown in green, that

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.490
corresponds to time
t plus delta t.

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:47.920
Notice here we have the
displacement corresponding to

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:51.590
time t, and then the
displacement corresponding

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.230
from time t to time
t plus delta t.

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.630
The total displacement,
of course, here is the

00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:00.680
displacement from time zero
to time t plus delta t.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.230
What we are doing, of course
in the principle of virtual

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:09.350
work, is to impose a variation
in displacements about the

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:11.700
configuration at time
t plus delta t.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:17.490
And that variation is here
indicated by the blue line.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:22.230
And if we impose this variation
here, since the

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:27.370
displacements at time t are
constant, surely whatever

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:30.610
these displacements were
should not matter.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:33.810
And that is, in fact,
expressed by this

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:35.450
relationship here.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:39.270
If we vary here, since the
displacements to ui are

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:43.110
constant, they do not affect the
variation on the strains.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:50.660
And therefore, we can simply
vary the incremental strain,

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.910
and we find that variation is
indeed equal to the variation

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:56.530
of the total strain.

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:59.260
Of course, you can also
prove that to yourself

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.080
mathematically by just going
through the arithmetic.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.200
In other words, applying the
variation to this quantity,

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.230
and then applying the variation
to that quantity,

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:11.560
which I've given you on the
previous viewgraph, and you

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.980
would find that indeed you
get identically the same

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.230
expressions.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:24.850
We can define a linear strain
term, linear strain increment,

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:32.290
as 0 eij, and the nonlinear
strain increment as 0 eta ij.

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:35.990
Notice that once again, here we
have the quadratic terms.

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:38.770
And, of course, when we add
these two terms together, we

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:42.820
get back our total strain
increment from time t to time

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:44.660
t plus delta t.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.820
If we take a variation on that
increment, that is equivalent

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:51.130
to taking a variation on
the linear term and

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.870
the nonlinear term.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.240
Notice that so far we
have only talked

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.550
about continuum mechanics.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:02.220
Of course we want to use the
continuum mechanics principles

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.720
that we discussed so far
in the finite element

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.810
discretization.

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:10.200
But notice that these strain
terms here that we talked

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.109
about, are really continuum
mechanics variables.

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:15.589
There is an interesting
observation.

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:21.800
Namely, if we talk about this
strain measure and that strain

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:28.950
measure, rather the linear
incremental strains and the

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:34.360
nonlinear incremental strains,
linear and nonlinear in ui,

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:39.470
then if we apply these in finite
element analysis, we

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:43.470
have to remember that the
displacements are interpolated

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:45.910
in terms of nodal
point variables.

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:48.250
And what we're really looking
for in finite element analysis

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:51.630
are the nodal points
variables.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:58.170
In isoparametric finite element
analysis, which is the

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:02.100
final element procedure that we
will be using extensively,

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:07.300
we interpolate the internal
element displacements, tui, in

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.460
terms of the nodal point
displacements.

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:13.120
Let me define a little bit
more what this is here.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.940
This is, of course, the
displacement from time zero to

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:20.520
time t into the i's direction.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.370
We are summing here over all
the finite element nodal

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:27.310
points, the N nodal points.

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:30.670
We have interpolation functions,
hk, that we will

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.700
talk more about later on.

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:38.430
And we have here the nodal point
displacement at time t

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:41.780
into the i direction of
the nodal point k.

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.560
This k goes with that k.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.430
And we're summing over
all the nodal points.

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:51.150
Now notice that this is the
linear relationship in

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:53.380
isoparametric finite
element analysis of

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.930
solids, I should say.

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:58.760
This is a linear relationship.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:03.610
And therefore, our linear strain
terms that we talked

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:06.670
earlier about, being linear in
the incremental continuum

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:12.210
mechanics displacements, are
also linear in the incremental

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:13.440
nodal point displacements.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:19.520
Similarly, this term here, which
was nonlinear in the

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.810
increments of displacements
within the domain, from a

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:26.800
continuum mechanics point of
view, will also be nonlinear

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.540
in the nodal point displacement
increments.

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:33.690
However, in the formulation of
structural elements, with the

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:36.230
incremental displacements,
in fact also the total

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:39.230
displacements, I interpolated
using nodal point

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:43.100
displacements and nodal
point rotations.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.860
In other words, we also deal
with nodal point rotations in

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:50.640
order to calculate the total
displacements of the element.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:55.710
And in that case, we have to
recognize that the exact

00:19:55.710 --> 00:20:00.580
linear strain increment, the way
we have defined it earlier

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:06.200
linear in the incremental
displacements, is still

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.980
properly given as a linear
strain increment in the nodal

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.270
point variables.

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:17.270
However, the term that we
defined earlier as a nonlinear

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:21.980
strain increment, this one, is
not the full story of all the

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.620
nonlinear strain increments.

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:28.750
Because the rotations will put
additional nonlinear strain

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:31.420
increments into this
term here.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:35.950
The reason being, that for large
rotations, of course, we

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:42.580
have cosine sine terms in these
rotations and when we

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:45.790
evaluate the total nonlinear
strain term, we find that

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:47.750
there are additional terms
coming up here.

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:50.840
Well, what is the effect of
these two statements?

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:56.900
It means that the right hand
side force vector, or rather

00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:01.450
the vector t 0 f, the vector
of nodal point forces

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:06.920
corresponding to the internal
elements stresses, is always

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.420
correctly calculated.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:16.410
However, the stiffness matrix,
t 0 k, for the formulation is

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:20.000
only approximated because some
of the nonlinear terms here

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.400
have been dropped in the case
of structural elements.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.390
Of course, you can also include
the nonlinear terms.

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:31.220
Then you would have to add these
terms to this expression

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:36.980
here, and then you would get a
true tangent stiffness matrix.

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:41.560
This means, of course, for an
actual analysis, that when you

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:47.500
form the equations, we have on
the left hand side-- let me

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.100
just put all of it in here--

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:57.720
for the first iteration, we
talked about the fact that we

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.810
have a stiffness matrix times an
increment in displacements.

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:03.480
I already put a 1 there because
it will be only an

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.540
approximation to the
total incremental

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.590
displacement vector.

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:13.460
Well, we notice then that this
matrix here is approximated if

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:16.020
you were to drop these
additional terms.

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:20.950
But the right hand side vector f
here is properly calculated.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:25.220
Therefore if you iterate, you
always get the exact solution,

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.350
the correct solution.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:30.530
But the convergence in the
iteration might be a bit

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:34.080
slower than what you could
have obtained if you had

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.510
included these additional terms
here that I referred to.

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:40.450
Let us now continue with
the continuum mechanics

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:41.900
formulation.

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.630
The equation of the principle of
virtual work becomes, if we

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:49.810
substitute the quantities that
I defined earlier, directly

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:51.120
this equation.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:55.270
Notice here we have now the
increment in stress times the

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:59.280
variation of the incremental
Green-Lagrange strain, from

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.710
time t to t plus delta t.

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:05.510
Of course, it's integrated over
the original volume plus

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:06.900
this integral here.

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:12.190
Here we have the total stress,
second Piola-Kirchhoff stress,

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:16.690
corresponding to time t
operating on the nonlinear

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:20.430
strain increment of the total

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:21.710
Green-Lagrange strain increment.

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:24.600
And once again, we are
integrating over the total

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.220
volume corresponding
to time zero.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.750
And on the right hand side, we
have the external virtual work

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:36.880
minus the stress at time t,
operating on the linear strain

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.880
increment corresponding
to the total

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.010
Green-Lagrange strain increment.

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:47.290
We have so far made no
approximations, and this is a

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:52.140
relationship that has to hold
for any arbitrary variation in

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:56.950
displacements which go in here,
or any arbitrary virtual

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:59.140
displacement that go in here.

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:03.040
And of course, corresponding
strains that appear here.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:11.040
In essence, what we have been
doing is that we have

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:17.170
established a variation on
the configuration at time

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:19.790
t plus delta t.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:22.310
We have looked at the principle
of virtual work

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:25.400
corresponding to time t plus
delta t, but we have

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:29.210
introduced this increment
in displacement.

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:32.210
Notice that this increment in
displacement is measured from

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:33.760
the displacement at time t.

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:40.200
All we have done therefore, is
to rewrite the principle of

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:45.010
virtual work in terms of tu and
u instead of dealing with

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:46.870
t plus delta tu.

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.700
No approximation being
done yet so far.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.760
Of course, we really haven't
been talking about finite

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.510
elements either yet, when we
just look at this basic

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:58.540
equation of principle
of virtual work.

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:02.210
It is this principle or the
equation that we are dealing

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:05.700
with, is in general, a very
complicated function of the

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:08.610
unknown displacement
increment.

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:12.490
We obtain an approximate
relationship in finite element

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:16.816
analysis, by linearizing the
governing equation, and, of

00:25:16.816 --> 00:25:20.800
course, then in the finite
element sense cast it into

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.280
this set of linear equations.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:29.725
The process of linearizing is
a very important process,

00:25:29.725 --> 00:25:31.880
interesting process for us
to study, and that's what

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.680
I want to do now.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:38.900
We begin to look, in this
linearization at all the

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:42.150
individual terms that appear
in the integral.

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:45.720
And let us look first
at this term here.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:50.160
This term is actually already
linear in ui.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.910
So there is nothing
much to linearize.

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:56.090
t 0 sij does not contain ui.

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:57.460
It's a known quantity.

00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:59.290
It's a known stress value.

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:02.560
And notice that when we take
the variation on this

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.670
nonlinear strain increment, we
directly get this expression,

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:12.640
where this part here is
a variation on the

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.350
displacement increment.

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:15.990
Similarly here.

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:19.090
And of course, these are
going to be constants.

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:22.310
Therefore, this term here is
linear in the incremental

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:23.640
displacements.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.740
Linear in ui.

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.920
So nothing to linearize there.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:32.950
The term on this viewgraph here,
contains an incremental

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:36.430
stress and an incremental
strain.

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:39.170
Notice this incremental strain
contains the linear and the

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:40.940
nonlinear term.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:46.285
And this, of course, this
product is a linear functional

00:26:46.285 --> 00:26:49.280
off ui, sorry it contains
linear terms,

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.330
nonlinear terms as well.

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:56.530
This stress here is, in general,
a nonlinear function

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:58.950
of 0 epsilon ij.

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:02.295
The variation that we are
taking here means we are

00:27:02.295 --> 00:27:04.420
taking a variation on
the linear part and

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.080
the nonlinear part.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.660
We will see actually that this
one here is constant.

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:13.550
But this one carries also terms
of ui, so this total

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:16.090
expression is linear in ui.

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:20.750
And if we multiply these terms
here, we want to end up in

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:24.360
just one expression that has
neglected all higher-order

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:28.040
terms in ui, but just
contains ui.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.350
Well, let us do so.

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:36.820
The objective is expressed
once more here, and we

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:41.440
recognize that, of course, the
variation on 0 epsilon ij

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:44.680
contains only constant and
linear terms in ui, the way I

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:45.930
just expressed it.

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:54.530
0 sij can be written as a Taylor
series expansion in 0

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:56.510
epsilon ij.

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:58.490
This is the general
expression.

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:02.400
Here we take the partial of
the stress at time t, with

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:06.220
respect to the Green-Lagrange
strain at time t, here we are

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.790
having this bar with the t
that denotes that we are

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:12.370
actually doing this evaluation
at time t.

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:16.020
And here we have an increment in
this strain, and of course,

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:17.610
there are higher-order terms.

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:20.930
These higher-order terms we will
neglect, and therefore we

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:25.260
get directly for this stress
here, this expression.

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:29.190
Notice we already have
substituted for 0 epsilon rs,

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:31.880
these two quantities.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:36.810
This one here is quadratic in
ui, this one is linear in ui.

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:44.490
And if we linearize this term,
we get directly this one here.

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:48.360
Notice that this is the
appropriate stress-strain law

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.230
that has to be used
corresponding

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:51.790
to this stress measure.

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.900
And we will later on talk more
about how we evaluate this

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.340
stress-strain law.

00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:01.600
As an example, we may look
here at this schematic

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.630
solution, computed solution,
over a number of time steps.

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:12.210
We're going time 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, up to t minus delta

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:15.040
t and then to t.

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:21.550
The stress-strain law relates
basically the stress increment

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:23.970
here to the strain increment.

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:28.230
And notice it represents a
tangent to this this curve.

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:32.860
This green line here is a
tangent to the red or the blue

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:36.730
curve, the blue one now
overlapping the red curve

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:39.060
right there.

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:43.310
So we have here the tangent, or
the slope of this tangent

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:47.460
is giving us the material
tensor 0c.

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.690
Of course, here we're talking
just about one element.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:53.370
In general we have many elements
corresponding to the

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:57.560
strain and stress measures
that we are dealing with.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:02.080
If we now substitute the result
that we just looked at

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.790
into the general equation--

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:06.130
sorry to take this one down--

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:10.460
into the general equation here,
we see directly that

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:15.370
this part here, of course,
is the stress.

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:20.290
And this part here gives
us that part.

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:24.710
We simply multiply out and look
at the individual terms.

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:28.530
We notice that this one
does not contain ui.

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:31.530
We notice that this one
is linear in ui.

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:35.130
So since this one is already
linear in ui, this term will

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:36.700
be quadratic in ui.

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.220
We will have to drop it.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:44.260
This term here is linear in ui,
but this one is constant,

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:47.940
so this total term
is linear in ui.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:51.820
And this is the one we keep,
and which is then the

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.260
linearized result.

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:58.240
In other words, in summary once
more, this total term

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:04.490
here linearized is obtained
via this expression here.

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:11.200
The final linearized equation
that we are then dealing with,

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:14.330
now that we're substituting
all these results into the

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:19.880
original equation that we have
developed, is as follows.

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:23.800
Here we have one term that comes
from the incremental

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:29.550
stress times the variation
on the total incremental

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:30.650
Green-Lagrange strain.

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:34.140
That all has reduced
to this term.

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.670
Here we did not have to
linearize at all.

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:40.620
We kept what we already had.

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:46.520
And on the right hand side,
did not linearize either,

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:49.280
because this was a term that we
had already there, and of

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.430
course this is the external
virtual work.

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:57.660
Now it's interesting to note
that these two terms here

00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:00.350
result into this expression,
where this is the tangent

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:01.660
stiffness matrix.

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:05.420
Notice that tangent stiffness
matrix contains the material

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.945
tensor, as well as the
current stresses.

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:16.510
This incremental displacement
here, vector, comes from this

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:22.090
strain part and that
strain part.

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:26.400
Notice that this virtual
displacement vector here comes

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:31.246
from that strain part and
also from that one here.

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:38.270
Below here we have, of course,
that the external virtual work

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:44.410
results into a vector of nodal
point forces times these

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:46.190
virtual displacements.

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:52.150
And this one here results into
the force vector corresponding

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:54.850
to the internal element
stresses.

00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:59.130
And this is, of course, a very
important quantity that we

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:02.070
have to calculate accurately,
as I pointed out earlier.

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:07.040
Because we want ultimately in
the iteration that this vector

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:10.250
is equilibriating that vector,
and if we do make a mistake in

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:13.710
calculating this vector, then
we might have converged, but

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:15.280
we have converged to
the wrong solution.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:18.150
So it's very important to
recognize that this vector

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:21.590
must be accurately calculated,
by all means.

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:26.740
However, the k matrix here, if
we go back once more to the

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:30.400
discussion of this matrix, the
k matrix here is a tangent

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.980
stiffness matrix.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:37.370
And this tangent stiffness
matrix is selected such as to

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:40.680
obtain, of course, in the
incremental solution, an

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:43.670
appropriate incremental
displacement.

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:47.640
We will see later on
that this matrix is

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:50.170
updated in the iteration.

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:53.530
It depends on what kind of
intuitive scheme we are using,

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:55.960
depending on that scheme we
are updating this matrix

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.750
differently.

00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:01.680
In any case, it's a matrix that
we will in quotes, "play

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:05.550
around with", in order to
accelerate the convergence.

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:09.570
Therefore there is no unique
matrix that can be used here,

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:11.940
that should be used here.

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:14.540
There are different
possibilities that we will

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:16.170
discuss in later lectures.

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:20.159
But on the right hand side once
again, this F vector is

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:24.800
the F vector obtained from the
current stresses, and that one

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:28.880
has to be calculated uniquely
in the correct way.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:34.100
Well, an important point is that
this relationship here on

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:37.969
the left hand side, is equal to
the relationship given here

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:39.429
on the right hand side.

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:42.620
And this holds because
this term here is

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:45.030
equal to that term.

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:48.830
We interpret, in fact, this
right hand side as an out of

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:51.440
balance virtual work term.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:54.619
Let's look once why this holds,
because this might be a

00:34:54.619 --> 00:34:55.770
bit of a surprise.

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:59.740
The mathematical explanation
is given on this viewgraph.

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:02.510
We had earlier already that
the variation on the total

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:04.840
Green-Lagrange strain is
nothing else than the

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:09.930
variation on the incremental
total Green-Lagrange strain.

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:15.610
Now if we look down here, we
recognize that this variation

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:20.940
here at ui equal to 0, is
nothing else than the

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:23.430
variation on the Green-Lagrange

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:26.630
strain at time t.

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:30.930
If ui is zero, then this term
here is nothing else than the

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:32.640
Green-Lagrange strain
at time t.

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:35.410
So we're looking here at
the variation of the

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:40.420
Green-Lagrange at time, t
if I put ui equal to 0.

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.190
Now let's look at these
expressions here.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:50.840
If I evaluate this term here, at
ui equal to 0, we find that

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:55.010
this term here, being a
constant, is recovered.

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:58.540
But notice that this term here,
with ui equal to 0,

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:00.560
simply turns out to be 0.

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:06.440
Therefore, this term is
equal to that term.

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:10.660
And this means, therefore, that
the variation on t zero

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:15.940
epsilon ij is equal to the
variation on 0 eij, which we

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:17.950
wanted to prove, of course.

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:24.190
So this is the reason why this
term here is equal to that

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:28.700
term, as we have used it on
the previous viewgraph.

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:33.190
This result also makes physical
sense, because if we

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:38.350
look at the governing equation,
we find that this

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:42.140
term here, replaced, is
nothing else than tr.

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:44.090
Should be tr.

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:46.820
And of course, the script
r the external virtual

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:49.030
work at time t.

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:52.280
And this, of course, is here the
out of balance load term.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:57.930
Now if, for example, the
material is elastic, and the

00:36:57.930 --> 00:37:02.610
external virtual work has not
changed, then clearly the

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:04.830
displacements would
not change.

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:09.830
In other words, t plus delta tui
would be equal to tui, and

00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:12.190
the incremental displacements
would be 0.

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:14.660
Therefore, equilibrium
would be satisfied.

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:18.820
Hence, this term, which we have
here, must actually be

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:25.160
equal to t 0 sij times variation
t 0 epsilon ij, the

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:28.570
way we discussed it just now.

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:32.240
We may rewrite the linearized
governing equation as given on

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:33.520
this viewgraph.

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.650
And I am rewriting it in this
form because we anticipate

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:38.990
that we need an iteration.

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:43.140
We simply introduce here, an
iteration counter 1, with the

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:48.680
delta in front of the
incremental strain value.

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:52.520
And similarly we introduce a
delta here, and an iteration

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.520
counter 1 there.

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:57.880
And on the right hand side, we
introduce also an iteration

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.090
counter, but one lower.

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:03.510
In other words, 0 here, whereas
we have a 1 there.

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:05.610
Notice 0 here, a 1 here.

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:09.900
And notice furthermore, that
this term is nothing else than

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:13.550
that term, and this term here
is nothing else than the

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:17.450
variation on t 0 epsilon ij.

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:20.840
This would be the equation
that we have developed

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.820
already, just having introduced
now a different

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:27.920
notation which leads us towards
what we want to deal

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:31.450
with in the iteration.

00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:35.860
The governing equations from a
finite element point of view,

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:38.300
then would be as shown here.

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:42.880
Notice tangent stiffness matrix,
del u1, iteration

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:46.810
counter, the external loads,
which we still assume to be

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:48.440
constant, by the way.

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.680
We still assume deformation
independent loading if we have

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.170
deformation dependent loading,
these would also

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:56.440
change in the iteration.

00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:01.140
And here we have the vector
corresponding to the internal

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:03.540
element stresses at time t.

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:08.260
We write that vector as t
plus delta t 0, 0 there.

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:11.280
And that means that we are
really talking, at this point,

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.590
about this vector.

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:16.510
We calculate this incremental
displacement vector and add it

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:19.430
to the previous displacements,
which, of course, in this

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:22.760
particular instance, in the
first iteration, are nothing

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:23.690
else than tu.

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:29.750
We add those, and obtain
our first estimates of

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:32.650
displacements, namely the
estimate at the end of

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:35.050
iteration 1.

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:39.170
Having obtained now this
estimate on displacements, we

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:41.890
can repeat the process.

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:45.860
And that is shown here on
the next viewgraph.

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:50.470
Notice that now I am talking
about the right hand side,

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:53.790
about the Green-Lagrange strains
corresponding to time

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:57.920
t plus delta t, and the
first iteration.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.150
In other words, these are the
Green-Lagrange strains

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:02.990
corresponding to the end
of the first iteration.

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:05.740
They include now the incremental
displacements that

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:07.780
we just calculated.

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:10.500
Similarly, these are the
stresses corresponding to the

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:13.680
end of the first iteration.

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:18.610
And this is an out of balance
virtual work term.

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:23.130
If that is non-zero, we will
have further increment in

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:23.880
displacements.

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:27.080
And that increment results,
of course, into an

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:29.590
increment of strains.

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:31.230
Namely, the second increment.

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:34.380
Here is the 2 that denotes
the increment.

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:38.080
Here is the 2 that denotes
the increment.

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:41.950
The finite element equations
then would look as shown here.

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:44.510
Same equation as before,
but now with a 1

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:47.100
here and a 2 there.

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:50.510
We calculate the incremental
displacements, we add them to

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:53.630
what we had already and get a
better approximation to the

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:58.150
displacements corresponding
to time t plus delta t.

00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:01.980
This process, of course, can now
be repeated, and on this

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:05.120
viewgraph we show how
it's being done for

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:06.840
every iteration k.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:10.120
In a particular iteration, we
have now on the right hand

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:13.440
side the external virtual work
corresponding to time t plus

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:17.740
delta t, the stresses
corresponding to time t plus

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:20.580
delta t and iteration
k minus 1.

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:23.770
At the end of iteration
k minus 1, the strains

00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:27.200
corresponding to time t plus
delta t, and at the end of

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.590
iteration k minus 1.

00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:32.680
This is the out of balance
virtual work term, and on the

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:35.900
left hand side we have the same
quantities as before, but

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.310
now with the iteration
counter k.

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:43.160
When discretized, we obtain
these equations here.

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:49.690
Delta uk, the increment in the
iteration k of displacements,

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:53.420
r minus f, computed, of course,
from the current

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:54.630
displacements.

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:58.450
From the current displacements
we calculate that vector here.

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:04.170
Notice this vector is obtained
from this integral here.

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:09.880
We repeat this process for
iteration k 1, 2, 3 et cetera

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:10.870
until convergence.

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:12.740
We will have to talk about
how we measure

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:14.360
convergence and so on.

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:17.210
But in this iteration we're
adding up the total

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:21.330
incremental displacements to
obtain always a better

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:25.170
estimate for the displacements
corresponding to time t plus

00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:28.790
delta t, and here, of
course, iteration k.

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:32.780
Notice that the counter here
goes from j equals 1 to k,

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:36.820
that is this j and this k, of
course, is nothing else than

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:40.260
the k that we have on the
left hand side here.

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:44.890
Notice once again that the first
iteration, when k is

00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:48.140
equal to 1, it amounts to
nothing else than what we

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:51.740
discussed already at the very
beginning a little earlier in

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.290
the lecture.

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:58.520
We simply generalized that
discussion now to an equation

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:02.460
in which we iterate and always
try to calculate another

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:04.850
increment in displacements
until the right

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:05.950
hand side is 0.

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:09.490
Notice when the right hand
side is 0, the external

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:15.440
virtual work is equilibrated by
the internal virtual work,

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.510
and of course, that is what
we want to reach.

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:21.730
That is what our criterion
is for the analysis.

00:43:21.730 --> 00:43:24.660
The external virtual work must
be equilibrated by the

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:25.910
internal virtual work.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:30.780
In the finite element
discretization, the whole

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:34.900
process is as summarized
on this viewgraph.

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:40.470
Initially, we are given
tu, the displacements

00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:44.270
corresponding to time t, and the
externally applied loads

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:46.380
corresponding to time
t plus delta t.

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:50.440
We compute the stiffness matrix,
the tangent stiffness

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.440
matrix corresponding
to time t.

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:56.450
We calculate this vector,
the nodal point forces

00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:59.990
corresponding to the
stresses at time t.

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:03.010
Notice this 0 here refers always
to the total Lagrangian

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:05.310
formulation.

00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:09.400
Notice that this vector here
is really the initial

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:12.140
condition for the iteration.

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:16.170
Similar, the displacements
at time t are the initial

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:18.900
conditions for the iteration
for the displacements.

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:19.960
Zero here.

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.440
Zero there, meaning the initial

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:22.930
conditions for our iteration.

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:26.840
We set the iteration counter,
k equal to 1, and we now go

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:28.800
into the following loop.

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:32.640
Notice on the right hand side,
an out of balance load vector

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.190
is calculated.

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:37.360
And that out of balance load
vector gives us an incremental

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:39.630
displacement vector.

00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:41.680
Of course, the tangent stiffness
matrix is involved

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.600
in that calculation.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:48.100
Notice that this incremental
displacement vector is added

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:51.720
to the displacements that we had
previously calculated, to

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:54.570
obtain a new estimate on
the displacements.

00:44:54.570 --> 00:45:01.100
And like that, we have now
obtained a displacement vector

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:05.350
that, of course, hopefully is
closer to satisfying certain

00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:06.770
convergence criteria.

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:08.860
We will have to talk about
these convergence

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:10.150
criteria later on.

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:13.370
Basically, we check whether
equilibrium is satisfied

00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:15.480
within a certain tolerance.

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:19.190
If the equilibrium is not
satisfied, we go here.

00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:22.810
We use these displacements that
we just have calculated

00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:27.960
to compute a new vector
of nodal point forces

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:30.450
corresponding to the
element stresses.

00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:36.070
Notice this vector now contains
the information that

00:45:36.070 --> 00:45:40.930
we have just calculated in
solving this equation here.

00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:43.370
This was information
that we obtained.

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:47.980
And that information is
contained in this vector, and

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:51.645
that vector is used right here
to calculate this nodal point

00:45:51.645 --> 00:45:54.190
force vector.

00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:57.005
Having calculated that, we
increase our iteration

00:45:57.005 --> 00:46:00.910
counter, come back here and
like that we continue the

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:04.930
iteration, looping around
through here

00:46:04.930 --> 00:46:07.000
as I have just described.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.830
Notice at convergence once
again, we want, of course,

00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:16.150
that r is equal to f, meaning
that the external loads are

00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:19.230
equilibrated by the nodal point
forces corresponding to

00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:21.530
the internal element stresses.

00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:26.200
Well, this brings us to the
end of this lecture.

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:30.140
You might recognize that this
last viewgraph really contains

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:34.440
a lot of information that, of
course, we discussed in this

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:38.960
lecture, but that also I
referred to already in the

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:40.200
first lecture.

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:44.880
At that time, I tried to
introduce you to this

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:49.680
iteration process using rather
physical concepts, not going

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:52.480
through a lengthy mathematical
derivation.

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:55.470
We did not talk about continuum
mechanics variables.

00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:58.790
We did not talk about total
Lagrangian formulation, second

00:46:58.790 --> 00:47:00.430
Piola-Kirchhoff stresses,
Green-Lagrange

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:01.990
strains and so on.

00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:05.020
I hoped at that time to give
you just a physical feel of

00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:06.680
how we are iterating.

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:10.610
The same kind of equations, the
same equations we looked

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:14.290
at at that time, now I hope
with this lecture, I have

00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:19.140
given you the mathematical
basis of these equations.

00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:23.140
I hope you have learned how to
derive these equations, how to

00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:25.370
work with these equations
a little bit.

00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:29.130
And in some of the next
lectures, we will look at how

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:32.110
actually we do construct
this k matrix

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:33.930
for different elements.

00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:37.430
That is, of course, a very
important consideration.

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:43.130
How do we calculate this
k matrix for 1D, 2D, 3D

00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:45.890
elements, shell elements,
beam elements?

00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:48.120
How do we calculate this
force vector for

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:49.400
these different elements?

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.510
We will have to discuss
that as well.

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:55.310
Notice that in this k matrix
goes the material law.

00:47:55.310 --> 00:47:58.560
Whether we are dealing with an
elasto-plastic material,

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:02.220
rubber type material, all that
will affect the actual

00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:03.950
ingredients, the
actual elements

00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:05.690
here in that k matrix.

00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:11.820
We we also have to discuss how
we can possibly make this

00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:14.340
convergence that I'm
talking about fast.

00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:16.570
In other words, how can we
accelerate the convergence of

00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:17.910
these iterations?

00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:22.690
So in essence, I like to just
convey to you that what you

00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:26.160
see here you will see a
number of times again.

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:29.630
We will talk about the different
parts that you have

00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:33.130
been looking at here already
briefly once again in the

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:34.260
upcoming lectures.

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:35.820
Thank you very much for
your attention.
