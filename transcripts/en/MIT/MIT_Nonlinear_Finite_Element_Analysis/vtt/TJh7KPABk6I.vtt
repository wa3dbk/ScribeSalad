00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.940
PROFESSOR: Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to this

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.617
course on nonlinear finite
element analysis of solids and

00:00:30.617 --> 00:00:31.870
structures.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.600
A few years ago, we produced at
MIT a course on the linear

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.450
analysis of solids
and structures.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.320
That course was quite
well-received.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.590
And we obtained a number of
requests to also produce a

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.290
course on the nonlinear
analysis of solids and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.330
structures.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.740
The present course is the answer
to those requests.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.810
In this course, we will be using
my book as a textbook.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.950
You might be already a bit
familiar with this book.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.740
We will be referring to
some of the sections

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.830
in quite some detail.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.870
In addition, of course, you
also have the study guide.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.630
Let me now share with you,
briefly, some thoughts that I

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.090
had while designing
this course.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.070
The field of nonlinear, finite
element analysis is a very

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.780
large field.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.430
And, in fact, four large fields
come to mind as feeding

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.260
into nonlinear, finite element
methods, continuum mechanics,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.540
finite element discretizations,
numerical

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.270
algorithms, software
considerations.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.110
Because the field of nonlinear,
finite element

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.690
analysis is such a large field,
I had to select certain

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.140
topics as the topics of this
finite series of lectures.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.880
I believe that the lectures
provide a good introduction

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.240
and foundation to a nonlinear,
finite element analysis.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.890
Of course, the lectures cannot
answer all the questions that

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.250
you might have regarding
nonlinear,

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.910
finite element analysis.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.060
I believe, though, that they
will be answering some of the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.510
questions and, hopefully,
stimulate discussions that you

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.400
might have while watching
these lectures with your

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.580
colleagues.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.220
We, at MIT, continue to
work in nonlinear,

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.610
finite element analysis.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.300
And we also offer, from time
to time, short courses.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.050
It would be very nice to meet
you at one of these short

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.950
courses and to discuss any
questions that you might have

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.850
regarding these lectures, once
you have seen them, and

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.770
regarding your work on
nonlinear, finite element

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.420
analysis in general.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.570
Let me now return to
what I like to talk

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.040
about in this course.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.170
In this course, we want to
concentrate on methods that

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.710
are generally applicable,
modern techniques and

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.010
practical procedures.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.110
I believe it is important that
we discuss in this course

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.670
practical and effective
procedures.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.070
In particular, methods that
are or are now becoming an

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.780
integral part of computer-aided
design,

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.180
computer-aided engineering
software.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.090
In this course, I would like to
discuss with you geometric

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.980
and material nonlinear analysis,
static and dynamic

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.100
solutions, basic principles and
their use, and share with

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.950
you example solutions.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.280
I believe that the course will
be of interest in many

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.720
branches of engineering
throughout the world.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.700
And in this spirit,
we have designed a

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.460
logo for this course.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.050
The logo is shown here.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.780
It shows the whole world as an

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.480
assemblage off finite elements.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.380
If you're watching me from
Chicago, you're watching me

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.960
from about here.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.700
If you're watching from
Munich, you're

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.560
watching about there.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.920
And if you are in Tokyo,
you're watching

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.270
me from about there.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.940
Welcome to this course.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.750
I'd like to now start with the
first lecture, which has the

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.020
title Introduction to
Nonlinear Analysis.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.100
And let me take off my jacket,
because we have a lot of work

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.200
ahead, and summarize to you what
I would like to present

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.490
to you in this first lecture.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.250
We discuss, first, some
introductory view graphs and

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.600
show some short movies.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.670
We then classify nonlinear
analyses.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.295
We then discuss the
basic approach of

00:04:04.295 --> 00:04:05.990
an incremental solution.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.620
And we share some example
solutions.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.810
Let me walk over to my view
graphs which I've prepared for

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.339
this lecture so that we can
start with a discussion of

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.370
this material.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.279
Finite element nonlinear
analysis in engineering

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:26.730
mechanics can be an art, but it
can also be a frustration.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.670
For those of you who have been
doing some nonlinear analysis

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.740
already, I think you will value
that it can be an art

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.280
and it can be a frustration
because it can be a very

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.700
difficult matter.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.070
But it's always provides
a great challenge.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.170
And that, of course, is the
exciting part of working in

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.690
nonlinear, finite element
analysis.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.930
Some important engineering
phenomena can only be assessed

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.920
using nonlinear analysis
techniques.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.050
For example, the collapse or
buckling of structures due to

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.430
sudden overloads--

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.340
I'm thinking here, typically
of shell structures, say--

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.010
the progressive damage behavior
due to long-lasting

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.400
severe loads such as, for
example, high-temperature

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.170
loads in nuclear reactor
components and, for certain

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.140
structures such as cables and
transmission towers, nonlinear

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.140
phenomena need be included in
the analysis, even for service

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.950
load calculations.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.970
The need for nonlinear analysis
has certainly

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.530
increased in recent years due
to the need for the use of

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.450
optimized structures, the use
of new materials that are

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.380
being introduced or have been
introduced over the recent

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.750
years, the addressing of
safety-related issues of

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.020
structures.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.270
There's more rigorous attention
being given to such

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.960
safety-related issues now and
certain the corresponding

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.660
benefits can be most
important.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.380
Problems that are addressed by
nonlinear, finite element

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.000
analysis can be found in many
branches of engineering.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.780
And I've listed here some such
branches, nuclear engineering,

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.290
earthquake engineering, the
automobile industries, defense

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.090
industries, in aeronautical
engineering, mining

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.560
industries, offshore engineering
and so on.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.090
I'd like to now show you some
movies that we have assembled

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.810
regarding some finite element
analysis in certain fields.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.580
And let us start with a movie
related to the defense

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:30.840
industries, then go on to a
movie related to some work in

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.530
the automobile industries, and
then look at a movie related

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.820
to some work in earthquake
engineering.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.690
And finally, I'd like to also
show you an interesting movie

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.310
regarding a structural
engineering problem.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.540
So let me now introduce you to
the first movie, which is a

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.220
movie in which a tank is modeled
using a geometric

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.480
model first and then setting
up a finite element mesh.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.290
Here we see a tank
in a maneuver.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.510
You surely have seen such
structure before.

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.900
And here you see, in the top
part of the picture, the

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.980
geometric model of a tank and,
in the bottom part of the

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.850
picture, a finite element
discretization.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.380
The top model was generated
using a geometric modeler.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.700
And the bottom model was
obtained using a finite

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.900
element mesh generator.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.660
These models were constructed
by Structural Dynamics

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.910
Research Corporation.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.230
The second movie relates to a
problem that has obtained much

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:35.970
attention in the automobile
industry, namely the problem

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.130
of what happens when a motor
car crashes against

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.130
another motor car.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.090
And tests have been performed of
motor cars crashing against

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:45.170
rigid walls.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.490
Test results have
been assembled.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.740
And finite element methods may
well be used in the analysis

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.950
of such types of problems.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:56.520
Here we see a test performed by
the Ford Motor Company of a

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.250
car crashing against
a rigid wall.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.260
And here, a close-up of what
happens to the passengers not

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:08.690
wearing seat belts, and
another such test.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.660
Here now, in more detail,
what happens to the

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.570
front part of the car.

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.140
There is since some time much
interest in modeling these

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.930
phenomena on the computer.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:21.480
And finite element methods can
be applied and are very

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.730
valuable here.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.250
This certain movie relates to
the use of finite element

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:28.950
methods in earthquake
engineering.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:32.120
Here we look at the finite
element model of a tank and

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.870
the dynamic motions
of that model.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.960
We are surely all aware that
earthquake motions can cause

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.940
severe structural vibrations
and possibly collapse of

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.570
structures.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:47.730
Here we see a transformer and
the tank to be modeled on it.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:50.940
Here a close-up view
of the tank.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.640
The finite element model of the
tank was constructed by

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.930
Asea, a Swedish company.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.620
And here we see some vibratory
motions of the model.

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:05.870
The fourth movie shows the
dynamic response and collapse

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:10.580
of the Tacoma Narrows
bridge in 1940.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.690
The Tacoma Narrows bridge
collapsed on November 7, 1940,

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:18.530
about four months after its
opening in winds of 40 to 45

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.640
miles per hour.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.090
Here you see the dynamic motions
of the bridge prior to

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:26.680
its collapse, a side view,
and now a view

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.050
along its center line.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:32.610
Notice the high torsion of
vibrations of the bridge.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.130
The bridge went through large
dynamic motions for hours

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.100
until its collapse.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.870
We only show a very small
segment of that time.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.565
And here you see how the
bridge collapsed.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.140
Of course, these movies only
indicate, to some extent,

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.260
where finite element methods
might be applied in

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.520
engineering practice, but I
thought you might like, you

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.700
might enjoy, seeing
the movies.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.150
Let me now continue with the
material that I have

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.930
documented on the view graphs.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:13.760
For an effective nonlinear
analysis, a good physical and

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.840
theoretical understanding
is most important.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.140
You want to have some good
physical insight in the

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:23.260
problem, setup, and mathematical
formulation of

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.360
finite element model.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.950
Solve that model, and
that will enrich

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:28.090
your physical insight.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:31.880
It is this interaction and
mutual enrichment between the

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.710
physical insight and
mathematical formulation that

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.010
can be most valuable.

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.630
The best approach for a
nonlinear finite element

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:42.870
analysis is to use reliable
and generally applicable

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.150
finite elements.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.950
With such methods, we can
establish models that we can

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:51.570
understand, that we have
confidence in.

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:54.140
We start with simple
models of nature.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.620
And we find these
as need arises.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.880
In fact, I like to think of an
engineer as developing a first

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.490
model on the back of an envelope
using, of course,

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:04.840
simple equations.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.570
And these equations will give
some insight into the

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.230
structural response.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.890
If necessary, then the finite
element model is set up.

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:13.610
The first finite element
model is set up.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.280
And this finite element
model is then

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.440
refined as need arises.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.630
To perform a nonlinear
analysis, we want to,

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:24.900
altogether, stay then with
simple, relatively small and

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.160
reliable models.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.070
We always want to perform
a linear analysis first.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:33.440
I will show examples in this
course particular related to

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.620
this item here.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.282
It is very important, in my
view, to first do a linear

00:11:38.282 --> 00:11:41.740
analysis and then only go on
to a nonlinear analysis.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.030
As I mentioned already, we want
to refine the model by

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:48.900
introducing nonlinearities as
desired and, once again, use

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.950
reliable and well-understood
models, obtain accurate

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:54.200
solutions of the models.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.410
This is very important for
possible proper interpretation

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:59.150
of the results.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.440
Here we show schematically
the finite

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.060
element modeling process.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.670
We have a problem in nature.

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:08.420
We model that problem, the
kinematic conditions, the

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.200
constitutive relations, the
boundary conditions, the

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.040
loads, and so on, using
finite elements.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.290
We solve the model and interpret
the results.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.170
Now this model surely can
only approximate the

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.840
actual problem in nature.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.490
And on interpretation of the
results, we may find that we

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.310
really should refine
our model.

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:31.340
And we do so, set up a new
model, solve again.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.790
And like this, we may cycle
a number of times

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:35.930
through this process.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:39.250
Of course, traditionally, test
results have been sought for

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:42.200
very complex problems,
laboratory test results have

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:42.960
been sought.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.170
And this may still
be necessary now.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:49.300
However, the finite element
modeling process will

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.060
certainly compliment these
laboratory test results.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.570
Let's look at a typical
nonlinear problem.

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:57.410
Here we have a bracket
of mild steel

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:59.810
subjected to the load shown.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:02.670
And the possible questions that
we might ask are, what is

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.700
the yield load of
this bracket?

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:08.310
In other words, at what load
do we see first plastic

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:09.580
deformations?

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.590
What is the limit load?

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:13.270
What is the maximum load that
this bracket can take?

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.830
What are the plastic zones?

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:19.310
What are the residual stresses
when the load is removed?

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:22.190
Is there adhering where
the loads are applied

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.890
right around here?

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.440
What is the creep response of
the bracket when the bracket

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.270
is subjected to high temperature
conditions and

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:30.300
these loads?

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.310
And what are the permanent
deflections of

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:34.670
the bracket, et cetera.

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.370
There are many more questions
that could be asked.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:42.280
And certainly, these questions
here can only be answered by a

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.840
nonlinear analysis.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.110
Possible analyses that we might

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:48.740
consider are the following.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.890
First we, of course, would
always perform, as I mentioned

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:54.690
earlier, a linear elastic
analysis.

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.480
The linear elastic analysis
would determine the total

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.800
stiffness and the yield
load of the bracket.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.420
Notice here we show the
displacements in red.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:07.130
Actually, these displacements
would be very small.

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:10.890
And they are magnified
in this view graph.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:14.710
Another analysis now would be to
perform a plastic analysis,

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.830
but assuming still small
deformations.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:20.870
This analysis would determine
sizes and shapes of the

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.190
plastic zones.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.510
The displacements here
are still small.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:27.140
We have not shown them
at all actually here.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.170
They are very small, however.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.230
Then we might want to
go on to a large

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:33.380
deformation plastic analysis.

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:36.985
This analysis would determine
the ultimate load capacity of

00:14:36.985 --> 00:14:37.890
the bracket.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.060
And notice the displacements
are now large, they are

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:42.160
actually large.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.960
Here, we have had small
displacement assumptions.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:49.530
Here, we have included the large
deformation effects as

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:52.850
also shown on the view graph.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:58.890
For analysis, it is very good
to actually classify all the

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:02.580
types of analysis that one
might want to perform.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:06.450
And the first category of
nonlinear analysis is the one

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:08.570
that we call
Materially-nonlinear-only

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.440
analysis, MNO analysis.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.950
In this analysis, we assume
that the displacements are

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:17.800
infinitesimal, the strains
are infinitesimal.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.530
In other words, both
of these quantities

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:21.120
are very, very small.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.730
And the stress-strain
relationship is nonlinear.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:27.680
So all nonlinearities lie,
really, in here, in the

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.040
stress-strain relationship.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.690
Here, I'm showing a
schematic example.

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.470
You're looking at a four-node
element that is subjected to

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:37.840
the loads shown, and delta
is the displacement.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.540
Notice that delta/l
is very small.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:44.080
In fact, even this four is
already relatively large.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.500
We should really have here,
possibly, a two.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.060
So nonlinearity lies in the
material description.

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.400
The material is an
elasto-plastic material,

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.140
Young's modulus, E, yield
stress, sigma y and

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:58.060
strain-hardening modulus, Et.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:03.460
As long as the stresses do not
exceed sigma y, we really have

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:04.700
a linear analysis.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.650
So if you use a computer
program with an MNO

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:13.480
formulation and you subject your
model to forces such that

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:17.790
the stresses are below sigma
yield everywhere in the model,

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:22.990
then you should really obtain
the linear analysis results.

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.020
The next category of problems
is the one of large

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:30.670
displacements, large rotations,
but small strains.

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:33.610
Here, in other words, we still
keep the assumption of small

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:36.220
strain, but we allow large

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.680
displacements and large rotations.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.760
The stress-strain relations can
be linear or nonlinear.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:46.690
Schematically here, once again,
our four-node element.

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.830
This four-node element now would
move, as shown, going

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.690
through large displacements
and large rotations.

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:56.640
But the strains in the element,
expressed by delta

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.080
prime over l are still small.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.230
Once again, you may actually
want to make this 0.02.

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:08.400
As long as the displacements are
very small, we have now,

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.220
really, an MNO analysis.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.599
The third category of problems
is the one of large

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:17.450
displacements, large rotations
and large strains.

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:22.869
Here we have included all
kinematic nonlinearities.

00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:26.030
And the stress-strain relation
is probably also nonlinear

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:30.050
because we are dealing
with large strains.

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:34.580
As an example, we have, again,
our four-node element here

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:35.950
moving as shown.

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:40.890
Notice material fibers here,
displaced by a large amount,

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:45.010
rotate and are also stretched
by a large amount.

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:46.330
This, of course, is
the most general

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.580
formulation of a problem.

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:52.020
However, still not considering
any nonlinearities in the

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.220
boundary conditions,
nonlinearities in the boundary

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.300
conditions provide
contact problems.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.930
And here, we look schematically
at a simple

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:01.140
contact problem.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.370
The four-node element, once
again, subjected to loads,

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:07.500
there's a gap here between this
element and the spring.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.720
And as soon as this gap is
closed, the spring, of course,

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:16.300
provides stiffness into the
system, the system being now

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.200
the four-node element.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:22.280
And, well, that difference has
to be taken into account in

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.460
the analysis.

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:28.350
And there are procedures to
solve contact problems.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:31.050
This is, of course, a very
simple contact problem.

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:33.970
But there are procedures to
solve contact problems.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:37.530
Contact problems are very
difficult problems to handle,

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.230
particularly if you're dealing
with frictional effects.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:43.350
We will, in this course, in this
set of lectures, really

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:47.520
not address contact problems,
except that, in the last

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.390
lecture, we actually
look at one

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:50.690
particular contact problem.

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:54.480
We use a computer program for
the analysis of a contact

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.950
problem there.

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:59.920
Let's turn to an example
analysis.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.260
And I'd like to consider
with you, briefly, the

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.860
analysis of a bracket.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.800
Here is a bracket of
the kind that we

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.060
looked earlier at already.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.380
Notice the dimensions
are as shown.

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:14.170
The thickness of the bracket
is one inch.

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:20.900
And this bracket is going to
be loaded to large loads.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:25.070
We make a material assumption,
namely the one of an

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:28.480
elasto-plastic material
with isotopic

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.430
hardening as shown here.

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:33.610
The yield stress
is 26,000 psi.

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:35.660
Here you have the
Young's modulus.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.960
And here you have the
strain-hardening modulus.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.500
We use symmetry conditions to
analyze the bracket the same

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.520
way as we would do it, of
course, in a linear analysis.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.680
And with the symmetry
conditions, we consider on

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.040
this view graph just the lower
part of the bracket.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.400
You see a pin here,
rollers there.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.410
And we're using eight-node,
isopolymetric elements to

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:02.770
model this part of
the bracket.

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:05.600
We apply the load
as shown here.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.570
Notice no special considerations
to the hole

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:10.200
which the load is applied.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.230
Our interest really lies in
predicting the stresses and

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:17.100
strains in this region and to
also predict the overall

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.950
collapse of the bracket.

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:23.990
We will use three kinematic
formulations for the analysis.

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:26.620
First of all, we use the
Material-nonlinear-only

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:28.780
analysis assumption.

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:31.980
In other words, small
displacements, small rotations

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.340
and small strains are
assumed in the

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.300
analysis of this bracket.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.860
Then we will perform an analysis
using the total

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.290
Lagrangian formulation.

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:44.120
We will discuss this formulation
quite extensively

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.850
in later lectures
of the course.

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:50.930
This formulation assumes large
displacements, large rotations

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:53.590
and large strains
kinematically.

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:55.690
Kinematically, these are
the assumptions.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:21:01.510
However, we will point out that
the material law that we

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:04.930
are using, or the material law
description that we are using,

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:09.540
is only applicable with this
formulation to small strains.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.750
So the overall analysis, using
this total Lagrangian

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:16.310
formulation, is then only
applicable to model large

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.190
displacements, large rotations,

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:20.240
but only small strains.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.000
I get back to that just now.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.200
We will also use an updated
Lagrangian formulation which

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.600
kinetically includes large
displacements, large rotations

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.070
and large strains.

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:33.700
And on the material model level,
we also include there

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.520
large strain effects.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.960
So once again here, as
summarized on this view graph,

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.600
the material used in conjunction
with the total

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.410
Lagrangian formulation is
actually not applicable to

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:49.200
large-strain situations, but
only to large displacements,

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.660
rotation in small-strain
conditions.

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:57.970
So once again, our total
analysis is only applicable to

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:00.780
this kind of situation.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.750
Whereas, the updated Lagrangian
formulation does

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:07.730
model, kinematically and on the
stress-strain level, large

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:11.910
displacements, large rotations
and large strains.

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:18.100
The analysis results obtained
are shown here.

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:22.770
Notice we are plotting here
the force applied and the

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:27.320
total deflection between points
of load application.

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:32.840
The three analyses give us three
distinct curves at large

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.170
displacements.

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:36.730
But for small displacements,
of course, these curves are

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.780
indistinguishable.

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:42.520
Notice here we have about 10%
strain at point A. I will show

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.630
you just now where point A is.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.810
The important point to notice
is that these are three

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:48.880
distinct curves.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.380
They are distinct because
we have made different

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:54.490
assumptions, kinematically
and on the

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:56.690
stress-strain load level.

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:58.700
We will talk about such
assumptions in the later

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.760
lectures of this course.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.350
On this view graph, now you
see this point A, which I

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:04.660
mentioned earlier.

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:08.410
And you see also the original
mesh shown in dashed, black

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:13.240
lines, and the deformed mesh,
shown in red, corresponding to

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.730
a level of load of
12,000 pounds.

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:21.250
I'd like to now look with you
at two animations regarding

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:26.030
problems that show
nonlinearities typical of the

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:28.730
nonlinearities that we are
talking about in this course.

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:33.540
The first animation shows a
plate with a hole that is

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:36.290
subjected to high
tensile forces.

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:38.690
The plate undergoes plastic
deformations.

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:40.930
And, in fact, the load becomes
so large that the plate

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:42.800
basically ruptures.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:46.600
Let's look at this
animation now.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.080
Here we see one quarter
of the plate.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.800
The plate is subjected to a
uniformly distributed tensile

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.130
load along its upper edge.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:56.680
For the quarter model of the
plate, symmetry boundary

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:59.440
conditions are imposed along
the left vertical and lower

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.400
horizontal edges.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.500
The time code given above
the plate gives the

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.380
time of the load step.

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:08.990
Also given is the load
applied at that time.

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:12.140
However, note that we perform
a static analysis.

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.600
Therefore, the time code merely
denotes a load level,

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.970
as we will discuss
later in detail.

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:19.970
Each time increment of one milli
corresponds to a load

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:23.390
increment of 12.5 megapascal.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:25.610
We will increase the
load monotonically.

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:27.870
The plate will become
plastic at the hole.

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:30.740
And this plasticity will then
spread until, in essence, the

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.590
plate ruptures.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:35.870
We used 288 eight-node plane
stress finite elements for the

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:37.440
quarter of the plate.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.810
And we show to spread of
plasticity in the plate by

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:43.510
darkening the areas
that are plastic.

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:46.740
Here now you see the time
and load increasing.

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:50.120
In the first load steps, the
plate remains elastic and the

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.740
deformations are small.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.400
Now you see the first
plasticity

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.660
developing near the hole.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.410
The plastic zone increases
rapidly as the higher load

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:03.220
levels are reached until a large
portion of the plate is

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:07.500
plastic and, in essence, the
maximum load-carrying capacity

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.170
has been reached.

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:13.090
We will consider the analysis
of this plate in more detail

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:14.340
later in the course.

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:19.810
The second animation shows a
frame that is subjected to

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:23.400
forces such that the frame
undergoes very large

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.650
displacements.

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:29.560
Here we see the frame model,
using beam elements that we

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.020
discuss later in the course.

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:35.120
The frame is loaded, as shown,
by the force arrows.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.130
There are pin connections
at the points of load

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:39.350
application.

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:42.370
The frame is assumed to be of an
elastic material, hence, no

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:45.190
plasticity is assumed to develop
or that the frame will

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:48.890
be subjected to very large
displacements.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:51.860
The indicated loads will push
the top of the frame down and

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.820
the bottom up to such an extent
that the points of load

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.730
application cross over.

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.630
You see above the frame
a time and a

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:01.530
corresponding load level.

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:03.680
This is, again, a
static analysis.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.740
And each time increment of one
corresponds merely to a load

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:10.630
increment of 250 pounds.

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:12.300
Here now, you see the
deformations of the frame

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:16.060
develop as the load
is increased.

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:17.770
The displacements are
very large at

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:19.910
the higher load levels.

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:22.580
Of course, this is only a
numerical experiment at the

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.820
high load levels, but an
interesting one that indicates

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:28.100
in a simple manner what
can all be done in

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.130
finite element analysis.

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:32.730
We will consider this problem
solution also in more detail

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:33.980
later in the course.

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:39.195
Let us now look at the
basic approach of

00:26:39.195 --> 00:26:41.020
an incremental solution.

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:44.440
We consider a body, a structure
or solid subjected

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.710
to force and displacement
boundary conditions that are

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:50.170
changing, and we describe the
externally applied forces and

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:51.840
the displacement boundary
conditions as

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.610
a function of time.

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:59.240
Schematically, here we show a
body, of course, supported as

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:03.890
shown and subjected to a force
varying as a function of time

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:07.860
and a prescribed displacement
varying as a function of time.

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:11.360
The time variation of the force
is shown down here.

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.660
And the time variation of the
prescribed displacement is

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.250
shown here.

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:20.370
Notice that here we have a
particular time point, T. And

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:23.880
here we have a time point
T plus delta t.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.700
Here we have, similarly, the
time point T and here, also,

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:30.800
the time point T plus delta t.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.950
Since we anticipate
nonlinearities, we use an

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:37.380
incremental approach measured
in load steps or time steps.

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:40.530
And this means that the loads,
the prescribed loads, the

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:44.430
imposed loads and the prescribed
displacements, are

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:47.470
discretized as a function
of time, as shown

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:48.290
on this view graph.

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:54.620
Notice here we have, at time
T, the impulse load TRI.

00:27:54.620 --> 00:28:01.450
This upper, superscript T means
at time T then delta t,

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:04.830
in advance, time
T plus delta t.

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:08.580
We would have, in other words,
T plus delta t ri.

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:12.270
In other words this T would
now be replaced by T plus

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:13.920
delta t and so on.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:18.100
This is how we are inputting
or prescribing the impulse

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:22.190
loads and also the prescribed
displacements.

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:26.480
When they apply forces and
displacements very slowly,

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.170
meaning that the frequencies of
the loads are much smaller

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:31.740
than the natural frequencies
of the structure, we have a

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:32.980
static analysis.

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:37.580
This, of course, means that the
periods of the loads are

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:41.320
very long when measured
on the natural

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.410
periods of the structure.

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:45.250
In other words, you have a
spring and you apply a load

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:49.150
that varies very slowly.

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:52.400
And this means we have
a static analysis.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.840
If the load's very fast, and
by that we mean that the

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.100
frequencies of the loads are
in the range of the natural

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:00.140
frequency of the structure,
then we

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:03.350
have a dynamic analysis.

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:05.040
Let us look a bit closer at the

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.960
meaning of the time variable.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.630
Time is a pseudo-variable, only
denoting the load level

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:14.080
in nonlinear static analysis
with time-independent material

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:16.870
properties.

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:18.610
As an example.

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:23.590
here we have a cantilever
subjected to a load, R, a tip

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:27.880
load, R. And if we were to
perform a run, 1, in which we

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.450
prescribe the loads
as shown here--

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:34.240
and notice, at time 1, a
load of 100, at time

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.380
2, a load of 200--

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:39.010
delta t is equal to 1.

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:42.700
If we were to perform this
analysis and, in addition,

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:47.200
this analysis where delta t is
equal to 2 and the load at

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:51.030
time 2 is equal to 100, the
load at time 4 is equal to

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:55.850
200, then we would obtain
identically the same results

00:29:55.850 --> 00:30:01.590
in run 1 and run 2 because it's
a static analysis and the

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:05.150
material properties are
time-independent.

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:07.840
So in this particular case,
certainly, time is a

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:08.710
pseudo-variable.

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:13.810
And we can design
a time-stepping.

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:17.450
We can design many different
time-stepping schemes using

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:19.850
different time steps and
always obtain the same

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:24.020
results, provided, at the end
of the first time step, we

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:27.520
have the load 100 and at the end
of the second time step we

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:30.020
have the load 200.

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:34.680
However, time is an actual
variable in dynamic analysis

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:37.980
and in nonlinear static analysis
with time-dependent

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:41.420
material properties, for
example, when the material

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:44.330
contains grid conditions.

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:49.360
Now delta t must be chosen very
carefully with respect to

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:52.200
the physics of the problem, with
respect to the numerical

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.750
techniques used and the
costs involved.

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:58.700
If delta t is not chosen
appropriately, you may have a

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:01.790
very high cost for
the analysis.

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:05.580
And on the other hand, you may,
with improper choice of

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:08.870
delta t, also obtain
very bad results.

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:13.330
So it is very important to
choose delta t judiciously for

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:17.690
an accurate and cost-effective
analysis.

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:21.820
At the end of each load or time
step, we need to satisfy

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:25.820
the three basic requirements
of mechanics, equilibrium,

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.570
compatibility and the
stress-strain law.

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:31.920
These are the three fundamental
requirements to be

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.930
satisfied in mechanics.

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:36.680
This is achieved in finite
element analysis in an

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:40.420
approximate manner using
finite elements by the

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:43.080
application of the principle
of virtual work.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.420
Now there is a lot
of information

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.800
on this view graph.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:50.420
And we don't have time in this
lecture to go into any depth.

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:53.230
There is, of course, quite a bit
of mathematics that has to

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:57.190
be introduced for the discussion
of all of what we

00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:58.440
see here on the view graph.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.700
And that's what we do in
the later lectures.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:04.210
I do not have time now to go
into these mathematics, but

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:06.740
let us just very briefly
look at the basic

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:09.690
procedure that we using.

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:15.990
We are saying that, at any time
step, T plus delta t, the

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:19.940
externally applied loads, the
vector of externally applied

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:25.250
loads and this vector, includes
pressure loads.

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:29.210
Concentrated loads and, in the
dynamic analysis also inertial

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:34.890
forces, this vector must at any
time T plus delta t equal

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:40.930
to the vector F at time T plus
delta t where this vector F

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:45.540
corresponds to the internal
element stresses at time T

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:46.930
plus delta t.

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:49.200
We will talk in the later
lectures about how we

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.470
calculate this vector
T plus delta tF.

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:55.580
Of course, there are some very
important considerations in

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:59.490
the proper calculation
of this vector F.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:03.080
Let us now assume that the
solution at time T is known.

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:07.440
Hence, the stresses, at
time T, are known.

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:11.480
The volume surface area and so
on, all of the information

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:14.910
corresponding to the body
at time T is known.

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:18.380
And we now want to obtain the
solution corresponding to time

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:22.300
T plus delta t, that is for the
loads applied at time T

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:23.360
plus delta t.

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.910
Of course, this is
a typical step of

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:27.540
the incremental solution.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:31.600
Once we have the solution for
time T plus delta t, we can

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.770
use the same scheme to calculate
the solution for

00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:38.540
time T plus 2 delta
t and so on.

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:40.850
For this purpose, we
solve, in static

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:43.420
analysis, this set of equations.

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:47.130
TK is a tangent stiffness
matrix of the system.

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:50.810
Delta u is a vector of
increments in the nodal point

00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:52.210
displacements.

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:54.580
On the right-hand side, we have
the externally applied

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:59.590
loads corresponding to time T
plus delta t in this R vector.

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:05.580
And here, TF corresponds to or
is the vector of nodal point

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:09.250
forces that correspond to the
internal element stresses at

00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:10.770
time T.

00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:14.880
Notice this is an out-of-balance
load vector.

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:17.980
And this out-of-balance load
vector gives us an increment

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:19.699
in displacements.

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:22.679
This increment in displacements
is added to the

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:27.530
displacements at time T. And
that gives us a displacement

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:30.210
vector corresponding to
time T plus delta t.

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:33.350
Notice I have an approximation
sign there.

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:36.580
This approximation sign is a
result of the fact that we

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:41.110
obtained this set of equations
by linearization.

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:47.280
We will talk about how these
equations are obtained in the

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.230
later lectures.

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:53.290
We will start from the basic
principle of virtual work and

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:57.210
use continuum mechanics
considerations to derive, in a

00:34:57.210 --> 00:35:02.560
very consistent manner,
this set of equations.

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:05.050
Of course, there are many
details involved.

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:07.480
We will talk about the total
Lagrangian formulations, the

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.710
updated Lagrangian
formulation, the

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:13.720
Material-nonlinear-only
analysis, the details that go

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.160
into these formulations
in terms of kinematic

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:20.520
approximations, kinematic
approximations related to

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:24.800
large displacements, large
rotations, large strains.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.590
We also will talk about the
constitutive relations that

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:30.340
enter in this tangent stiffness
matrix and in this

00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:34.000
force vector and so on.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.420
Anyway, this set of equations
gives us an approximation to

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:41.870
the displacements at time T plus
delta t because of the

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:47.300
linearization process used to
arrive at these equations.

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:50.890
And, more generally, we want
to solve this set of

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:54.320
equations, tangent stiffness
matrix, still on the left-hand

00:35:54.320 --> 00:36:00.200
side, times a displacement
increment corresponding to the

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:05.080
iteration, I. And on the
right-hand side, we have the

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:08.060
load vector corresponding to the
loads at time T plus delta

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:12.960
t and the nodal point force
vector corresponding to the

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:16.970
internal element stresses at
time T plus delta t and at the

00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:19.590
end of iteration I minus 1.

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:22.560
This is here the out-of-balance
load vector

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:28.050
corresponding to the start
of iteration I. This

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:30.950
out-of-balance load vector,
and with that tangent

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:34.920
stiffness matrix, gives us an
increment in the nodal point

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:39.160
displacement vector
corresponding to iteration I.

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:43.730
We take this one, add it to
the previous displacements

00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:46.640
that we had already, namely
those corresponding to time T

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:51.070
plus delta t at the end of
iteration I minus 1, and we

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:55.640
obtain a better approximation to
the displacements at time T

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.130
plus delta t.

00:36:57.130 --> 00:37:01.010
Notice, in this iteration, we
have initial conditions that

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:06.060
I've given down here in
iteration I equal to 1.

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:09.830
On the right-hand side we need,
of this equation here,

00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:11.650
we need this vector.

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:16.570
And that vector is given by the
vector TF, the nodal point

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:18.900
force vector corresponding to
the internal element stresses

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:22.210
at time T. We also need initial
conditions on the

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:27.510
displacement vector, and those
are given right here.

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:30.610
Notice that, when I is equal
to 1, this set of equations

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:32.490
reduces to the equations
that we had on the

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:34.240
previous view graph.

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:39.040
Once again, we will derive these
equations from basic

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:42.190
continuum mechanics principles
in the later lectures.

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:46.050
And we will also talk about
iterative schemes to

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:47.930
accelerate the convergence
in the

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:52.040
solution of these equations.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.650
This then brings me to the end
of what I wanted to discuss

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:58.050
this you on the view graphs.

00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:01.810
I'd like to now turn to an
example solution, an

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:03.130
interesting example solution.

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:07.620
But, moreover, it displays the
kinds of nonlinearalities that

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:12.270
we will be talking about in
this set of lectures.

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:16.150
This example solution is
documented on slides.

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:21.070
So let me walk over here and
put on the first slide.

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:24.590
Here we show the structure
that we want to consider.

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:28.820
It's a spherical shell subjected
to pressure loading.

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:33.650
The material data for the
shell are given here.

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:37.260
Notice we also include the mass
density because we will

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:40.095
be talking about dynamic
analysis of

00:38:40.095 --> 00:38:42.220
this shell as well.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:46.100
We will also introduce an
imperfection of the shell.

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:48.850
And that imperfection
is given down here.

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:53.340
Notice it is given as a function
of the angle phi,

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:58.580
which you see up here, as well
as a thickness, H, of the

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:06.340
shell, the Legendre polynomial
given here and parameter data

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.260
that we will be varying.

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.920
First, we will consider a static
analysis of the shell

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.310
and then the dynamic analysis
of the shell.

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:17.720
On the next slide, now you see
the model that was used for

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:21.890
the analysis of the shell,
twenty 8-node elements,

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:25.030
axisymmetric elements subjected
to the pressure

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:30.040
loading, and, we are modeling,
the pressure loading in

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:33.260
deformation-dependent loading.

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:37.020
That means that, as the shell
deforms, the pressure will

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:40.900
remain perpendicular to
the shell surface

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.730
to which it is applied.

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:47.170
On the next slide now, we show
the first analysis results.

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:51.460
On this axis, we plot P/PCR
where PCR is the buckling

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:54.050
pressure of the shell, assuming
elastic conditions,

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:57.570
and calculated using analytical
solution.

00:39:57.570 --> 00:40:00.410
On this axis, we plot the rate
of displacement of the shell

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:03.020
at phi equal to zero.

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:08.030
The dotted line here shows the
linear elastic solution to the

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:09.130
shell problem.

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:11.340
Notice that these dots,
of course, could

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:13.520
be continued here.

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:16.610
The total Lagrangian
formulation, which includes

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:19.640
large displacement and large
rotation effects, gives us a

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:23.150
buckling pressure of 0.98 PRC.

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:26.800
A Material-nonlinear-only
analysis, including the

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:29.970
elasto-plastic material
conditions, but not including,

00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:32.220
in other words, large
displacement, large rotation

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:37.760
effects, gives us this
solution here.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:41.650
Notice that, of course, this MNO
analysis does not give us

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:45.160
a proper bucking prediction
for the shell.

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:49.290
To obtain the elastic-plastic
buckling load of the shell, we

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:50.770
have to perform a total

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:52.790
Lagrangian formulation solution.

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:58.280
And we obtain this load level
here as the bucking pressure.

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:01.380
This analysis was performed
with no

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:03.260
imperfections on the shell.

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:06.440
The next slide now shows
the results of the

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.100
same kind of analyses.

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:13.280
But at an imperfection of delta
0.1, notice here the

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:17.590
linear analysis, denoted as E,
the Material-nonlinear-only

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:22.770
analysis results, denoted as
EP, the large displacement,

00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:25.300
large rotation analysis
results.

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.810
But assuming an elastic
condition for the shell,

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:32.970
denoted as E, TL, TL standing
for total Lagrangian

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:36.500
formulation and the
elasto-plastic large

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:41.500
displacement solution given
here, the results given here

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:43.730
and denoted as EP, TL.

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:50.190
Notice that, because of the
imperfection, the load, the

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:54.310
maximum load-carrying capacity
of the shell, is decreased.

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:59.340
On the next slide now we show
the maximum load-carrying

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:03.410
capacities for delta equal to
zero, delta equal to 0.1,

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:06.550
delta equal to 0.2, delta
equal to 0.4.

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:10.090
In each case, we have used the
total Lagrangian formulation

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:12.150
including elasto-plastic
conditions.

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:15.800
In other words, of course, we
had to include the large

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.330
displacement effects in order to
pick up the proper buckling

00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:25.070
load or load-carrying capacity
of the shell, so these are the

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:27.490
load-carrying capacities of
the shell for different

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:29.660
imperfection levels.

00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:33.590
The next slide now shows the
results obtained using a

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:35.630
dynamic analysis.

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:40.400
At this time, we apply the
pressure instantaneously as a

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.410
step load, constant in time.

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:46.450
Notice we are plotting here now
mean displacement data of

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:49.840
the shell and time
along this axis.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:53.480
The Etl solution results
are very close to

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:54.790
the E solution results.

00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:57.910
I think you know now what
I mean by E and Etl.

00:42:57.910 --> 00:43:01.130
The E Ptl solution results
are quite close to

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:03.170
the EP solution results.

00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:07.320
This means that the shell is
stable under this load

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:09.250
application.

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:12.790
In other words, there is no
buckling, no increase in

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:17.000
deformations as time
progresses.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:22.910
The next slide now shows, as we
increase the imperfection

00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:29.990
level from delta equal to zero
to delta equal to 0.1, the

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:35.150
displacements of the shell using
the E Ptl solution or

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:37.870
formulation increase
with time.

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:42.790
Therefore, the shell is unstable
under this pressure

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:43.520
application.

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:47.310
Of course, dynamic pressure
application, no.

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:51.430
Notice the other solution
results are given here.

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:55.140
Therefore, we now can play with
the imperfection level

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:58.960
and with the load level in
order to estimate the

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:02.400
load-carrying capacity of the
shell for each of these cases.

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:08.210
And on this slide, you're
seeing for a constant

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:11.840
imperfection level, we
increase the load

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:13.370
applied to the shell.

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:16.930
And you can see that,
at 0.4 PCR, the

00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:18.250
shell is still stable.

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:21.950
At 0.5 PCR, the shell
is unstable.

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:24.720
On the final slide now, we show
all the information that

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.230
we have obtained in
the analysis.

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:29.310
On this axis, we are plotting
the buckling load, on this

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:31.460
axis, the amplitude
of imperfection.

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:33.470
This curve here corresponds
to the static

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:34.780
backing of the shell.

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:36.840
And this curve corresponds
to the dynamic

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:39.100
buckling of the shell.

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:41.230
Of course, we could not discuss
all the details

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:43.610
regarding these analyses
in this short time.

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:46.460
Please refer to the study guide
in which you'll find a

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:49.300
reference to the paper in which
we have discussed the

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:52.750
details of these analyses.

00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:55.940
This then brings me to the
end of this lecture.

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:57.800
And I hope you enjoy
the course.
