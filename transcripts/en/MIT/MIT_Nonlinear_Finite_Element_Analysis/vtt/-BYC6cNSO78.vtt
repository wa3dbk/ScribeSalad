00:00:21.862 --> 00:00:23.990
PROFESSOR: Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to this

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.720
lecture on nonlinear finite
element analysis of solids and

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.130
structures.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.590
In this lecture I'd like
to discuss with

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.350
you structural elements.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.340
Structural elements are, of
course, employed to model

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.940
beam, plate and shell structures
and are most

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.910
important elements.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.430
Because of their importance in
engineering practice much

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.400
research and development effort
has been focused on the

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.220
development of efficient
structural elements.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.170
In this and the next lecture I'd
like to discuss with you

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.190
some modern effective
elements.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.200
We will first discuss shell
elements and then beam

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.930
elements and then we go back to
use the shell elements, a

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.400
concept that we discussed in
some actual applications.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.490
When we do structural analysis
we should keep one method in

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.460
mind, namely that in a
geometrically nonlinear

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:21.140
analysis, a flat shell, referred
to as a plate, goes

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.280
very rapidly over into the
behavior of a shell because of

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.660
the curvature that develops
as the plate deforms.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.710
Therefore, to analyze
geometrically nonlinear plates

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.110
we really are quite well off
using general shell elements.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.480
And I'd like to now focus our
attention on the development

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.840
of general shell elements that
we actually then employ to

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.010
analyze plates as well
as general shells.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.810
There are various solution
approaches that one can follow

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.610
for the development of
efficient elements.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.120
And one such approach is
the use of general

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.180
beam and shell theories.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.020
I'm thinking of beams as well
as shells although I want to

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.220
focus our attention on shells,
really, in this first lecture.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:15.070
One starts with beam or shell
theory as general as possible

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.790
and develops the governing
differential equations.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.150
From the governing differential
equation one

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.120
develops variational
formulations and one

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.780
discretizes those variation
formulations using finite

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.080
element interpolations.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.130
This is the approach
that is taken.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.640
The disadvantage of that
approach is, in general, lack

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.200
of generality of the approach.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.670
You're starting off with
a particular shell

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.160
theory, beam theory.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.880
You of course would like to
have that shell theory as

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.020
general as possible but you
will find that really, the

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.760
shell theory that you're
starting of will mostly only

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.380
be applicable to a certain
class of shells.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.000
Therefore your finite elements
that you're developing would

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.680
also be only applicable to that
same class of shells.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.010
And that means in engineering
practice, in actual usage, the

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.270
user has to be very familiar
for which the particular

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.480
element developed,
as shown here.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.400
I'll discuss now for what
kinds of shells this

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.190
particular shell element
is really applicable.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.500
We would rather like to have
shell elements that are

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.130
applicable to any shell.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.460
Of course this is a
very big aim, very

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.500
difficult to achieve.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.580
But this is what we would
like to have ideally

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.570
in engineering practice.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:44.320
The other difficulty with this
approach is that frequently a

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.120
large number of nodal degrees of
freedom have to be carried

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.250
along in the development
of the shell elements.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.860
And what I'm thinking of there
is that you don't just have

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.790
translations and rotations at
the nodal points, which has

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.560
engineering degrees of freedom
that we would like to have and

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.360
see in for the element, but
you also have to have

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.010
additional degrees of freedoms
relating to the curvatures in

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.790
the elements.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:10.370
And so on.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:17.160
So this of course would mean, or
does mean, difficult use of

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.560
such elements and these reasons,
these two reasons

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.740
here have really driven the
research and development

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.780
efforts in different
directions.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.600
Another approach is to
use simple elements.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.660
Simple elements, but a large
number of elements, then to

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.770
model very complex beam
and shell structures.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.360
As an example I'd like to just
refer you to a 3-node

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.580
triangle, a flat element in
which the plate-bending

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.620
behavior is modeled in a
particular way and the plane

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.380
stress behavior is modeled as
a constant strain, constant

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.560
stress element.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.010
These two are superimposed,
these two behaviors are

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.850
superimposed and you have a very
simple shell element that

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.760
in certain analyses can
be quite effective.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.720
Of course we have to recognize
in this approach that the

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.560
coupling between the membrane
and bending action is only

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.750
introduced at the
element nodes.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.020
That is a major disadvantage.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.080
And that is the reason why you
need so many elements to model

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.610
a shell and that if we use a
triangular 3-noded element

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.080
with just a constant strain,
constant stress element to

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.500
model the membrane behavior, the
membrane action, of course

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.980
the membrane action is quite
poorly approximated.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.590
And that is another reason why
we need so many elements to

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.940
model a complex shell
behavior.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.490
Here on this viewgraph I'm
showing a picture of the

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.530
element that I just
referred to.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.790
Here you have a triangular
element in the three

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.000
dimensional space.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.565
Notice we introduce a local
coordinate system, x bar 2, x

00:06:11.565 --> 00:06:16.070
bar 3, x bar 1.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.130
Local coordinate system, and
in this local coordinate

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:25.260
system we measure the
displacements and rotations.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.290
And we superimpose for this
element the bending behavior,

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.060
the bending behavior
corresponding to this degree

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.480
of freedom, that degree of
freedom and this degree of

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.940
freedom at every node,
of course.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.150
We add, or superimpose onto
this bending behavior the

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.500
membrane behavior which
corresponds to these two

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.140
degrees of freedom.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.080
And we immediately notice that
corresponding to this degree

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.480
of freedom we don't have a real
physical stiffness and we

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:04.360
introduce a little artificial
stiffness as shown down here.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:11.930
Now this artificial stiffness
has to be selected and you

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.560
want to select it such as to
take out the singularity out

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:21.650
of the system but yet make the
stiffness not too big so as to

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.020
destroy the behavior
of the element.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.190
Because it's an artificial
stiffness you really want to

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.140
make it as small as possible
just to take out the

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.020
singularity out of this element
when you apply this

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.940
element in the modeling of
general shell structures.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.480
This artificial stiffness
actually is quite bothersome

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.520
in nonlinear analysis.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.610
It can provide problems and
we really don't like it.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:52.750
But if we use this approach we
have to introduce it and well,

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:57.250
we have to, so to say, live with
it, with the difficulties

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:58.100
that we encounter.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:02.140
But the other approach that
I want to discuss with you

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.520
really quite extensively in
these two lectures, namely

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.510
using the isoparametric
elements, having curved

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.340
elements there as well, we
don't introduce this

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.880
artificial stiffness anymore
because our experiences of

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:21.295
introducing it in nonlinear
analysis show us that there

00:08:21.295 --> 00:08:24.850
are many difficulties that
come into the analysis

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.820
procedure if you have this
artificial stiffness.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.590
So we got rid of it.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:33.179
We don't need to use it any
longer for the more modern

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:37.240
elements that I will be talking
about just now.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:42.549
The approach for these modern
elements is to use

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:47.660
isoparametric interpolations
and we talk then about the

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.330
isoparametric (degenerate)
beams and shell elements.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:54.750
"Degenerate" because we
degenerate these elements, or

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:58.140
we obtain these elements I
should say, by degeneration

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.980
from three dimensional
behavior.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:03.020
We will talk much more
about it just now.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:07.970
But in essence we are saying
we take the 3-D continuum

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:12.490
equations and we degenerate
those equations to the

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:16.150
particular shell behavior and
beam behavior for beams that

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.950
we would like to capture.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:23.000
The resulting elements can be
used to model quite general

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.470
beam and shell structures.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:28.570
And that is, of course, a very
large advantage in engineering

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:32.290
practice if you can use the
same elements to model a

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:36.140
variety of structures.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:43.160
The basic approach of this
isoparametric interpolation is

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.450
to use the total and updated
Lagrangian formulations that

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:48.480
we developed earlier.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.740
We talked in the earlier
lectures quite extensively

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.810
about the total updated
Lagrangian formulation, the

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:58.840
continuum mechanics equations,
as well as the finite element

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.850
discretization of the continuum
mechanics equations.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:06.000
But we applied the final
discretization only to 2-D and

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.330
3-D solid elements.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:11.150
Now we want to do the same
for shell elements.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:16.670
We recall that in the T.L.
formulation the governing

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:21.640
equation is this one here, which
is nothing else than the

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.020
principal of virtual work
operating on the second

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.520
Piola-Kirchhoff stress and
the variation on the

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.600
Green-Lagrange strain.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.510
This integral has taken over
the original volume of the

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:34.720
structure, of the
element, when we

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.420
develop a finite element.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:40.050
And this of course, the internal
virtual work, and

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.770
here we have the external
virtual work.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:47.200
Notice the linearization of
this left integral here

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.360
resulted into these
three integrals.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.540
We went through that
linearization in quite some

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:56.150
detail and we talked about
the individual terms.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.670
I don't think it's now necessity
to review that

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.640
material anymore.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.070
Please refer to the
earlier lectures.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.930
The same approach of course
we used also for the U.L.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:07.350
formulation.

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:10.800
Here is the general starting
point, the principle of

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.130
virtual work now, using second
Piola-Kirchhoff stresses refer

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.600
to the configuration
at time t.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.620
Variations in the Green-Lagrange
strains refer

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.250
to the time configuration
at time t.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.930
This gives the internal virtual
work corresponding to

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:30.200
time t plus delta t,
t plus delta t.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.020
And this is the external virtual
work, same external

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.730
virtual work of course that
we are having in the total

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:37.080
Lagrangian formulation.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.100
The linearization of the left
hand side integral here

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.200
results into these
three integrals.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.700
Once again we talked about
the linearization quiet

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:50.940
extensively and if you refer to
the earlier lectures surely

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.070
you recognize individual terms
that you're seeing here now.

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.500
We use these governing equations
for the total

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.580
Lagrangian and updated
Lagrangian formulation to

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.472
develop the general
shell elements.

00:12:03.472 --> 00:12:06.580
And what we have to do now is
to impose on these equations

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.290
the basic assumptions of
beam and shell action.

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:13.630
And let us go now through these
basic assumptions one by

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.180
one carefully.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.890
The first assumption is that
the material particles

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:21.225
originally on a straight line
normal to the mid-surface of

00:12:21.225 --> 00:12:24.810
the beam or the shell remain
on that straight line

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.470
throughout the response
history.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:30.050
This is one most important
assumption.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:33.160
You must have encountered this
assumption or at least some

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:38.000
form of it already earlier in
your discussion of beam

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.940
theories and possibly
shell theories.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.360
Let's look at this assumption
more closely, so.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.890
For beams we would say plane
sections initially normal to

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:50.600
the mid-surface remain
plane sections during

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.460
the response history.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.690
This is basically saying
the same thing

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.200
what I just said earlier.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.440
And if you look at this closely
you recognize that we

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.430
do not say that the plane
sections initially normal to

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:10.810
the mid-surface remain plane
sections during the response

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:14.600
history and remain normal
to the mid-surface.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.680
We don't say that.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.410
That's of course being
said when you use the

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:22.430
Euler-Bernoulli beam theory.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:27.840
We don't say this, that the
plane sections remain normal

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.190
to the mid-surface throughout
the response history.

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:34.710
We don't say that and because we
don't say that we in effect

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:38.600
include in an approximate
way shear deformations.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:42.530
In other words, we look here
at the effect of transverse

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:46.570
shear deformations is included,
and hence the lines

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:49.160
initially normal to the
mid-surface do not remain

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.810
normal to the mid-surface
during the deformations.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:56.440
Let's look at what this
means pictorially.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:04.750
Here we have a section of a beam
at time 0 and we draw a

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:09.900
line normal, that is, at 90
degrees to the mid-surface,

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.950
shown as a dashed line.

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:15.570
And we identify particles
on that line.

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:17.730
Here we have four
such [? rad ?]

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.620
material particles.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:23.770
Now the beam will move, deform,
go through large

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:27.260
displacements, large
rotations.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:31.350
But actually we assume
small strains.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:34.770
And we see that these material
particles which were

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:38.230
originally up here are
now down here.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:42.630
We identify that these material
particles are still

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.790
on a straight line.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:49.360
But this straight line is not
anymore normal, that it is at

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.980
90 degrees to the mid-surface.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.600
And because it is not any more
normal to the mid-surface we

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.360
do include shear deformations
approximately because we

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.350
assume that the shear
deformations are constant

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.450
throughout the thickness
of the beam.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:09.390
This is a most important
assumption.

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:14.210
We're looking here what looks
like a beam but actually, if

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:18.010
you think of another dimension
here, you can directly see

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:21.330
that the same picture is
also applicable to

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.770
the motion of a shell.

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:27.910
The second important assumption
is that the stress

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:31.560
in the direction normal to the
beam or shell mid-surface is

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:35.750
zero throughout the
response history.

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:40.050
In other words, there is no
stress developed normal to the

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:40.920
mid-surface.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.230
But notice that here is a stress
along the material

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:46.680
fiber that is initially normal
to the mid-surface is

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:47.780
considered.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:52.190
Now this material fiber which
is initially normal to the

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:55.235
mid-surface will not remain
normal to the

00:15:55.235 --> 00:15:57.700
mid-surface as I just said.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:02.760
And in the motion we will
consider always this stress in

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:07.080
the direction of that material
fiber which was originally

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.830
normal to the mid-surface.

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:12.320
So after motion has taken
place we are not really

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.770
talking anymore exactly--

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.710
you want to look in great detail
at what's happening--

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:21.010
we don't talk anymore exactly
about the stress, that is

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.530
normal to the current
mid-surface.

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:28.420
But we always talk about the
stress in the direction of the

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.630
fiber that was initially normal
to the mid-surface.

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:33.880
That's being said here.

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:41.230
And the third assumption, also
most important assumption, is

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.420
that the thickness of the beam
or shell remains constant.

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:48.540
Here then we clearly identify
that we are using really a

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.690
small-- we are assuming small
strain conditions, but we

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:54.285
allow for very large
displacements and rotations.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.280
Well, with these three
kinematic and static

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.829
assumptions clearly identified
we are now ready to actually

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:08.010
develop the shell element
interpolations.

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:10.960
And let's go at that.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.500
The first point is that we
incorporate the geometric

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.810
assumptions.

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:20.660
Straight lines normal to the
mid-surface remain straight,

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:24.230
put here in quotes, that
geometric assumption and the

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:26.750
geometric assumption that the
shell thickness remains

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:29.730
constant throughout
the whole motion.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:32.320
These were two assumptions
that we just discussed.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:36.640
We incorporate that into our
shell element formulation by

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.580
using the appropriate geometric
and displacement

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.320
interpolations.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:46.800
We incorporate the condition of
zero stress normal to the

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.030
mid-surface, I put it in quotes
here, because remember,

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:52.690
we are talking about the stress
in the direction of the

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:56.370
fiber that was originally normal
to the mid-surface.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:00.240
We incorporate this condition
by using the appropriate

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.230
stress-strain law.

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:06.980
Let's talk first about this
assumption and then about this

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:10.250
assumption, how we're using
these to actually develop our

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.810
shell elements.

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:17.740
To focus our attention
I'd like to talk

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:20.570
about a 9-node element.

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:21.600
However.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:26.030
we will later on see that in
practice actually we don't use

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:27.680
the 9-node element very much.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.760
We actually recommend the use
of a 16-node element and a

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:36.190
4-node element but this
9-node element in some

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:38.220
analysis is also used.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:43.560
And it certainly is an element
with which I can discuss with

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.810
you, share with you all the
experiences regarding the

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:49.860
formulation of the elements
because what we're talking

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:53.640
about now really is applicable
to any of the elements.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.970
In fact, we're talking about
variable number nodes

00:18:55.970 --> 00:19:01.020
elements, where the number of
nodes can be selected by the

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:05.110
analyst and the geometric
assumptions that we're now

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.660
talking about are the same for
any one of these elements.

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.610
How do we go about
the formulation?

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:16.380
Well, one important point is
that we introduce at each node

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:21.260
lying on the mid-surface, and
here we see such 9-nodes, a

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:29.180
director vector, a director
vector t v n k, t referring

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.740
already to the geometry
at time t.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:38.130
Of course this director vector
is actually input by the

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:42.810
analyst for time 0 and then
it evolves with the

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:45.130
motion of the shell.

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:48.670
Also we're introducing for the
analysis, and that's being

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:51.420
done automatically in the
computer program, these two

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:57.990
vectors here, t v 1 k and t v
2 k, which are normal to the

00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:59.240
director vector.

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:03.510
These vectors are calculated
automatically in

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:04.430
the computer program.

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:06.450
We talk more about it
a little later.

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:11.780
Notice that the thickness here
at this node is a k, and

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:16.720
notice that v n k at node
k-- k of course

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.950
stands for that node--

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:21.050
acts into the direction off
the thickness here.

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:23.990
Notice that such [? triad ?]

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:27.940
of vectors is of course
being worked with at

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:29.590
each of these nodes.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:34.940
And notice that the thickness
at the nodes can change.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:39.390
The element is defined
as follows.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:44.060
As far as the analyst is
concerned the initial nodal

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:48.390
point coordinates of all
the nodal points on the

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:51.600
mid-surface must be input.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:56.080
Also the initial director vector
must be input, here now

00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:00.750
you see the zero, and the
thickness at every

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:02.800
node must be input.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.950
Notice if these director vectors
at all of the nodes

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:08.790
are known, with the thicknesses
at the nodes of

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:13.630
course, then we can interpolate
the thickness at

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:18.120
any point of the mid-surface
of the shell and we can

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:23.240
interpolate the director vector
corresponding to any

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.900
point on the mid-surface.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.640
Here such point on the
mid-surface we get the

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.910
thickness at that point, from
the thicknesses that we have

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:34.170
here, and from the
director vectors.

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:36.470
And of course we are also
getting the director vector at

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:38.615
this point from these
director vectors.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:46.680
So the analyst must put in the
nodal point coordinates of the

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.200
mid-surface nodes and the
direction cosines of these

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.340
director vectors.

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:53.330
Much of it of course
can be generated

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:56.190
in a practical analysis.

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:59.090
We use an isoparametric
coordinate system with

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:01.490
coordinates r, s, and t.

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:06.360
The coordinates r and s
correspond to a measure in the

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:07.610
mid-surface.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:14.700
The coordinate t is measured
in the direction of the

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:15.950
director vectors.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:25.570
The geometry at time 0 is
interpolated as shown here in

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:27.130
this equation.

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:32.750
0 x i gives us the coordinates,
three, i goes

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:38.310
from one to three, of any
material particle in the

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:39.680
stationary coordinate frame.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.500
I should point out once more
very strongly that we use a

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:48.210
stationary Cartesian coordinate
frame, x1, x2, x3,

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:51.820
to describe the geometry of the
element and to work with

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:53.490
our element.

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:57.410
This coordinate frame, x1,
x2, x3, is stationary.

00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:00.230
In that stationary coordinate
frame of course we are

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:03.780
measuring the coordinates
of any material particle

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:06.070
corresponding to time
0, corresponding

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:07.790
to time t, et cetera.

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:10.790
The same way as we discussed it
in earlier lectures when we

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:14.870
talked about the analysis of
solids, 2-D and 3-D solids,

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.960
and when we talked about the
continuum mechanics equations.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:25.030
So here these coordinates of the
material particles, as the

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.860
material particles are moving
through the stationary

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:31.460
coordinate frame, are given
by the right hand side.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.020
And what do we see here?

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:36.150
k is 1 to n, n is the number of
nodes for the element that

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:39.910
I've shown you and
would be nine.

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:44.910
h k are the interpolation
functions corresponding to the

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:50.160
two-dimensional surface
of the element.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.220
In other words, these h
k's are really the 2-D

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:58.060
interpolation functions as we
are used to see them for plane

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.970
stress, plane strain, and
axisymmetric analysis.

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:03.390
Same interpolation functions.

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:09.790
These are the nodal point
coordinates at time 0.

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:13.150
Here we have t, that is the
third isoparametric

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:14.320
coordinate.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.390
We talked about it just now.

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:18.380
k, going from 1 to n again.

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:20.980
a k are the thicknesses
at the nodal points.

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:25.870
h k here is exactly the same
h k that you see here.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:28.460
And these are the direction
cosines of

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:30.460
the director vectors.

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:37.090
Director vector n means director
vector k, or normal.

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:39.470
n really stands for normal, but
it's really the director

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:42.030
vector referring to the
director vector k,

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:43.300
of course, a node.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:47.580
0 means time 0 and i means
the components, the three

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:49.790
components of the
director vector.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:51.360
That's what we're
looking at here.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:58.130
Now if you leave this term out
then you would have simply the

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:02.570
interpolation of the mid-surface
as for a membrane

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:07.310
element, of course curved
mid-surface.

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:12.500
This term here is added in to
take into account the effect

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:13.750
of the shell thickness.

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:22.100
Similarly at time t we have,
applying the same

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:27.040
interpolation t,
x, i here now.

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:31.590
Here we have t, x, i, k, same
h k that we talked about

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:35.610
earlier, same summing that
we talked about just now.

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:40.790
Here now t, v, n, i, k, the
direction cosines, also

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:43.350
director vectors.

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:48.610
Director vector k
at time t now.

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:54.410
Notice that all we have done in
this term and in that term

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:58.030
is to substitute for the 0 that
we had here and that we

00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:00.550
had there, the t now.

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:04.520
Of course this t means
time t, this t here

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.710
means coordinate t.

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:10.080
That's why we put a circle
around it and wrote it out

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:10.760
there once more.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.070
This is the coordinate, the
isoparametric coordinate t.

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:19.260
r s coordinates go in here, t
coordinate goes in there.

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:23.800
What has happened here is that
originally our director vector

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.520
might look like shown in
this picture here.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:35.880
The node coordinates are given
here, 0 x i k, and in the time

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:41.800
from time 0 to time t this
director vector moves to look

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.200
as shown now here.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:48.850
And of course the nodal point
itself has moved as well.

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:53.770
So it's these quantities here,
these [? rad ?] quantities

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:56.380
that we're using here, which
carries a curve.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:02.870
Well, to obtain the displacement
of any material

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:06.220
particle within the shell we
proceed now exactly the same

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.610
way as we have proceeded
in the development

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:10.150
of 3-D solid elements.

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:14.600
We take the interpolation for
the geometry at time t,

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.810
subtract the interpolation for
the geometry at time 0 and we

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:20.240
get the displacements
corresponding to time t.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.310
The result is this
equation here.

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:25.470
Here we have the displacements
of any material

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:26.970
particle in the shell.

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:30.230
Here we have the nodal point
displacements from

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:32.810
time 0 to time t.

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:38.490
Here we have the director
vectors at time t, so to say,

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.980
minus the director vectors
at time 0.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:45.520
Really these are the direction
cosines corresponding to the

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.082
director vector at time t, minus
the direction cosines of

00:27:49.082 --> 00:27:54.370
the director vector
corresponding at time 0.

00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:58.340
Of course this quantity here is
obtained by this equation

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:02.950
and that quantity here is simply
obtained by subtracting

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:07.340
the right hand sides
corresponding to t x i and 0 x

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:11.950
i the way you just have seen
them on the previous

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:14.870
viewgraphs.

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:18.150
The incremental displacement
from time t to time t plus

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:23.960
delta t is similarly obtained
from this relationship here.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:28.290
And the result is shown here
where now we have here the

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:32.350
increments in the nodal
point displacements.

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:35.760
And here we have the increments
in the direction

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:41.250
cosines of the director vectors
from time t to time t

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:43.900
plus delta t.

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:45.900
The equation is given
right there.

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.550
Well, with the equations that
we have developed so far we

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:55.090
are almost ready to establish
the strain displacement

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:59.630
matrices for the T.L. and U.L.
formulations of the element.

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:02.150
We have the coordinate
interpolations for the

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:03.320
material particles.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.460
We discussed those.

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:10.540
And we have at the moment also
the interpolation of the

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:13.640
incremental displacements of the
material particles in the

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.750
shell element in terms of
nodal point incremental

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:21.050
displacements and the increments
of the direction

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:24.210
cosines of the director vectors
at the nodal points.

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:28.520
What we, however, want is
to have the incremental

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:33.370
displacements in terms of the
nodal point displacements and

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:36.170
nodal point rotations.

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:39.210
The nodal point rotations
because the incremental nodal

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:42.040
point displacements and nodal
point rotations are the

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:47.090
engineering type quantities that
we can nicely deal with

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:51.280
in a computer program when we
analyze shell structures.

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:56.420
So what we want is to express v
n i k, the increments in the

00:29:56.420 --> 00:30:01.170
direction cosines of the
director vectors, from time t

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:03.370
to time t plus delta
t in terms of

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:04.930
the nodal point rotations.

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:08.710
And that is achieved
as follows.

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:16.302
Here we have the stationary
coordinate frame x1, x2, x3.

00:30:16.302 --> 00:30:21.510
e 1 is a vector into the x1
direction, e 2 the vector into

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:25.500
the x2 direction, e 3 the vector
into the x3 direction.

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:30.090
Here we show v n k for
nodal point k.

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:32.910
In other words, a director
vector, at time 0.

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:37.730
This one is input
by the analyst.

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:42.430
These two are calculated
in the program.

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:47.890
And of course there are such two
for every nodal point k.

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:51.950
For every nodal point k we also
put in a director vector.

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:56.080
Now the convention that is used,
that can be used for the

00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:01.670
v 1 and v 2 calculations, that
convention is given down here.

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:09.690
Notice that if v n points into
the e 3 direction then v 1

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:12.910
points into the 1 direction
and v 2

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:14.760
points into the 2 direction.

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:19.620
By that I mean into the e 1 and
into the e 2 directions.

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:25.900
Notice, this is a detail, that
when v n points into the e 2

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:29.740
direction this formula breaks
down and you need to use some

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:30.670
other convention.

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:31.940
But that is a detail.

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:34.800
We don't really need
to discuss that

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.470
very much here now.

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:42.610
Anyways, let us say then at
every nodal point k, v n has

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:46.240
been input by the user, v
1, v 2, calculated by

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.610
the computer program.

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:49.630
We notice that these
two are once again

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:51.950
perpendicular to v n.

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:58.860
Then we can directly say that
the increment in the direction

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:07.740
cosines of the vector, the
director vector, is given via

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.550
this relationship here.

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:13.000
Now I've written this down
already for time t.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.480
Of course it also holds for
time 0, all you do is

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.690
substitute for t, 0.

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:23.390
It holds in fact for any time
of the motion that we are

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:25.040
considering.

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.100
Let's see why this holds.

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:31.790
Well, this picture here shows
what's happening.

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:37.360
Here we have v n, here we have
v 2, here we have v 1.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:42.600
Notice alpha is the rotation
about v 1, beta is the

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.860
rotation about v 2.

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:52.870
Notice that with the rotation
beta about v 2 here, we of

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:59.130
course have an increment in
this vector shown by this

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:06.210
component because this here is
now v n at time t plus delta t

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:08.650
when alpha k is 0.

00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:09.860
When alpha k is 0.

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:12.710
Now of course you would also
have the alpha k component

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:16.930
coming in and that means you
have to add also this term.

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:21.860
Notice that once you have
obtained this vector you want

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:24.250
to normalize its
lengths again.

00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:29.240
But this picture here shows
why this term is a correct

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:32.910
term to use in this formula
and you can extend this

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:37.140
picture to also include
this term.

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:42.440
With this relationship we can
substitute for v n and that's

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:45.580
now done in this equation.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:51.430
We have substituted for v n and
have now our increments in

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:55.400
the displacements for the
material particle within the

00:33:55.400 --> 00:34:02.940
shell in terms of nodal point
incremental displacements and

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:09.139
rotations about these v 1 and
v 2 axes that we defined.

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:18.290
Well, having established this
interpolation for the

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:22.340
incremental displacements and,
of course, the interpolations

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:26.760
for the geometries of the
element at time 0, at time t,

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:30.210
we can directly establish the
strain displacement matrices.

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:32.940
And we will see we can then
set up the k matrix, the f

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:37.699
vector, the elements that go
into the equilibrium equations

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:41.230
the way that we discussed it
in the earlier lectures.

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:47.100
And from the solution of k u
equals r or k delta u equals

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:50.719
delta r in nonlinear analysis,
we of course get our nodal

00:34:50.719 --> 00:34:54.500
point rotations, alpha
k and beta k.

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:58.230
And once we have calculated
these nodal point rotations we

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:03.110
obtain by this relationship
here the v n at time

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:04.220
t plus delta t.

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:08.330
In other words, what we're
doing really here is we

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:13.620
integrate over all of the angle,
alpha k and beta k, to

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:17.600
get a more accurate
approximation for the nodal

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:21.780
point vector, of the director
vector, I should say, at time

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:23.050
t plus delta t.

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:27.810
Notice that if you do this
integration in one step with

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:31.270
the Euler forward method, you
get back the equation that we

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:33.010
had earlier on the viewgraph.

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:39.250
And which I tried to explain or
discuss with you using this

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:41.900
picture that you saw.

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:44.250
And I mentioned also that after
this integration of

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:47.210
course we want to normalize the
lengths of this vector to

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:51.430
make it always a unit
length vector.

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:55.630
We recognize that with this
approach we have only five

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:57.260
degrees of freedom per node.

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:59.780
Three translations in the
Cartesian coordinate

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:04.050
directions which are stationary,
and two rotations

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:09.350
refer to the local nodal point
vectors v 1 and v 2 at time t.

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:12.850
Now notice in geometric
nonlinear analysis, of course,

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:18.620
this vector and that vector,
t v 1 and t v 2, change

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:24.370
direction so our alpha k and
beta k are rotations that are

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:26.285
measured about changing
directions.

00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:31.420
That is an important
point to recognize.

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:35.860
Let's look at one pictorial

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:38.060
representation of what's happening.

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:39.930
Here we have node k.

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:44.650
We have a smooth shell, say,
that is discretized using four

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:45.370
shell elements.

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:48.320
I've taken one shell element
away as shown here so that we

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:51.190
can look into the shell.

00:36:51.190 --> 00:37:02.870
And at that node we have, as
shown now, v 1 and v 2 at time

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:08.160
t and the director vector
corresponding to a time t.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:13.730
We measure at that time
alpha k and beta k

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:17.980
about v 1 and v 2.

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:25.170
And we also measure the
displacements of the node, u

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:28.760
1, u 2, u 3.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:34.380
So notice that this node
moves as shown.

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:36.200
These are the three
translational degrees of

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:41.930
freedom and this director vector
here moves to a new

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:46.580
position and also changes
direction.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:49.420
And that new director
vector of course is

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:52.780
given here in red.

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:55.270
Notice that there is no
physical stiffness

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:59.740
corresponding to the rotation
about the director vector.

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:00.980
No physical stiffness.

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:04.590
The five degrees of freedom
that the element very

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:14.150
naturally carries, u 1, u
2, u 3, alpha k, beta k.

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:16.900
Alpha, beta at every node k.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:25.840
If only shell elements connect
to node k and the node k is

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:29.510
not subjected to
boundary-prescribed rotations

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:33.830
then we only need to assign
these five degrees of freedom

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:37.050
to the node and only work with
these five degrees of freedom

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:38.230
at that node.

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:42.020
However if we deal with a node
to which also beam element is

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:45.720
connected, which of course in
general has three rotational

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:50.140
degrees of freedom, or a node
on which a boundary rotation

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:55.760
other than alpha k or beta k is
imposed then we transform

00:38:55.760 --> 00:39:00.580
the two nodal rotations, alpha
k and beta k, to the three

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:02.310
Cartesian axes.

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:07.610
Because this way we can directly
deal then with the

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:09.880
connection here and
the imposition of

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.210
the boundary rotation.

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:17.280
We can do so directly using
these three rotations now

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:21.700
measured in the Cartesian
axis directions.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:28.740
I mentioned already that the
above interpolations for 0 x

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:32.580
i, t x i and u i, in other
words, for the original

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:35.040
geometry, the current geometry,
and the incremental

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:39.460
displacements the way we have
developed them, they can

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:42.420
directly be used to obtain
the strain displacement

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:43.960
transformation matrices.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:48.630
And we really do so in the same
way as for the 3-D solid

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:53.610
elements which we discussed
in an earlier lecture.

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:57.450
However, there's one method to
recognize, and I briefly

00:39:57.450 --> 00:40:01.440
pointed it out also already in
the earlier lecture, that

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.830
using this expression here--

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:08.840
and I now must refer to the
earlier material that we

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.850
discussed--

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:15.900
using this expression to obtain
the strain displacement

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:19.700
matrix, we realize that we
obtain the exact linear strain

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:22.300
displacement matrix.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:27.330
However, using this expression
here to develop the nonlinear

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:32.510
strain displacement matrix, t 0
b n l, for the shell element

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:35.590
only in approximation to the
exact second-order strain

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:39.610
displacement rotation expression
is obtained because

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:42.900
the internal element
displacements depend

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:45.120
nonlinearly on the nodal
point rotations.

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.600
I pointed that out earlier.

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:52.810
Please refer back to that
discussion to obtain a deeper

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:55.790
understanding of what
I mean here.

00:40:55.790 --> 00:41:00.010
The important point, of course,
is that we do obtain

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:04.010
the exact linear strain
displacement matrix, so at

00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:12.220
convergence in an iteration, k
delta u equals delta r, when

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:17.480
we have converged we actually
have the exact solution to the

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:20.340
model that we're using,
of course.

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:24.240
So this is important that we
obtain the appropriate and

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.640
exact t 0 b l matrix.

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:33.120
The effect of what we are
neglecting here was earlier

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:37.800
mentioned and please refer
back to that lecture.

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:41.160
We finally need to still impose
the condition that the

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:43.710
stress in the direction
normal to the shell

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:44.450
mid-surface is zero.

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:47.770
Remember this was one further
assumption that we discussed

00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:49.670
at the beginning of
this lecture.

00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:51.800
We use a direction
of the director

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.155
vector as a normal direction.

00:41:55.670 --> 00:42:02.530
This means that at each Gauss
integration point within the

00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:05.180
element, and which we want to
evaluate the stress-strain

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:11.355
law, we first of all set up a
system of vectors, e bar r, e

00:42:11.355 --> 00:42:16.450
bar s, e t, that are mutually
perpendicular.

00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:20.260
Now let's look here into the
picture above and we see here

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:23.950
at a particular Gauss point,
schematically shown, the

00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:30.000
vector e r and e s which are
vectors corresponding to the r

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.260
and s axes.

00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:37.890
e t is a vector corresponding
to the direction of the

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:41.730
director vector at that point.

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:46.590
e t we accept as the normal
direction, that's for the

00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:53.830
shell at that point, and we
construct e bar s and e bar r

00:42:53.830 --> 00:43:00.640
to be vectors perpendicular
to e t and to themselves.

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:05.070
And that is achieved by this
relationship here.

00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:13.440
Having now established e t, e
bar r and e bar s, we use this

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:16.420
stress-strain law.

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:19.280
And by this I mean let's
look first what's

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.870
in these round brackets.

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:25.080
We use this stress-strain law
corresponding to these

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:27.200
directions.

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:32.090
In other words, the directions e
bar r, e bar s and e t where

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:35.490
this is the normal direction,
this corresponds to the normal

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:36.780
direction e t.

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:41.790
Notice by putting zeroes here
we impose the fact that into

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:45.220
the direction e t we
have zero stress.

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:47.280
Of course this matrix
is symmetric.

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:51.620
Notice we have k here which is
a shear correction factor

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:56.610
applied to the transfer shear
stresses in the shell.

00:43:56.610 --> 00:43:59.130
New of course is Poisson's
ratio and

00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:00.390
e is Young's modulus.

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:04.497
Now this is the material law
corresponding to e t, e

00:44:04.497 --> 00:44:07.050
bar r, e bar s.

00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:10.950
And what we now have to do is
transform this material law at

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:15.870
every integration point to
the global directions.

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:19.370
Global directions because for
the global x1, x2, x3

00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:22.680
directions we have established
the b, the strain

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:25.160
displacement matrices.

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:28.830
And that gives us this material,
or c, shell.

00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:35.230
This q s h t, q s h is, I
think, quite well known.

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:38.590
Let me show you the form
of it briefly.

00:44:38.590 --> 00:44:42.100
It's a transformation matrix
where we show some of the

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:44.520
terms here, as you can see.

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:53.820
And these terms, l 1, m
1, n 1, et cetera, are

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:56.240
defined down here.

00:44:56.240 --> 00:45:02.580
And l 1, for example, is nothing
else but the cosine of

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:07.210
the angle between
e 1 and e bar r.

00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:09.600
In other words, it's a
transformation matrix that you

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:13.080
are probably quite familiar
with in linear analysis.

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:17.100
It's the matrix that transforms
the stress and

00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:20.900
strain components from one
coordinate system to the other

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:22.050
coordinate system.

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:24.170
And of course the coordinate
systems that we are

00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:30.290
transforming, that we're using
here, are the bar, e bar, r, e

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:35.840
bar s, e t coordinate system on
the one side and e 1, e 2,

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.860
e 3 on the other side.

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:44.530
Well, using this matrix we
assure that the columns and

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:50.970
rows 1 to 3 in c s h reflect
that the stress normal to the

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:53.610
shell mid-surface is zero.

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:59.270
This holds true because,
remember if we go back once

00:45:59.270 --> 00:46:04.230
more to the viewgraph, we
have set this column and

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:07.860
corresponding row to
zero elements.

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:11.390
And of course this means that
the stress normal to the shell

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:12.940
surface is zero.

00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:15.790
I should also briefly point
out that we have a plane

00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:20.410
stress condition corresponding
to the other direction of

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:24.360
stresses, in other words,
the e bar r and e

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.240
bar s direction stresses.

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:30.390
We have a plane stress condition
as you can see here.

00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:33.390
And of course this term would
go with it as well.

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:36.820
This term and these terms here
reflect the plane stress

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:40.700
situation in the plane
of the shell, zero

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:42.230
stress through the thickness.

00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:45.480
And all that we are transforming
to the global

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:46.820
system now here--

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:48.980
that fact, that physical
fact--

00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:52.900
of course must still be
reflected in c s h.

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:58.670
And that's what's being said
here at that point.

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:03.970
If you want to do plastic
analysis, creep analysis, you

00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:06.580
proceed in the same way.

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:09.370
But you calculate then once
again the stress-strain

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:12.850
metrics as in the analysis
of 3-D solids.

00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:17.340
And having got that
stress-strain matrix, six by

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:21.950
six matrix, you impose the
condition that the stress

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:25.040
normal to the mid-surface is
zero in much the same way as

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:31.240
what we have done here for the
elastic material condition.

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:34.770
Finally, regarding the kinematic
descriptions that we

00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:38.260
talked about for the shell
elements, it is interesting to

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:41.940
note that also transition
elements can be developed.

00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:47.560
These can be quite useful in
practical analysis because

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:52.060
they are elements with some
mid-surface nodes that carry,

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:55.110
in other words, associate
director vectors and five

00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:58.760
degrees of freedom per node
and some top and bottom

00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:01.900
surface nodes with three
translational degrees of

00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:03.780
freedom per node.

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:06.570
These elements would be used,
for example, to model

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:10.640
shell-to-solid transitions or to
model shell intersections.

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:14.400
And here you see one such
typical element just

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.220
schematically shown.

00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:19.210
Here we have a mid-surface
node, three translational

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:21.920
degrees of freedom corresponding
to the

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:25.350
stationary coordinate frame,
two rotational degrees of

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:30.900
freedom the way we talked about
it just now, mid-surface

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:34.420
node here and top and bottom
nodes here with three

00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:36.560
translational degrees
of freedom for

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:38.200
each of these nodes.

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:45.180
Notice we can directly couple
3-D solids to this phase here

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:49.110
and shell elements to
this phase here.

00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:51.560
We haven't shown mid-surface
nodes here, but you would,

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:54.860
say, have all the mid-surface
nodes here and then surely

00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:58.540
shell element can directly be
coupled into here in such

00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:02.840
situation as schematically shown
right down here on this

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:08.190
viewgraph where we have solid
elements on this side and

00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:11.180
transition element right
there and shell

00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:13.590
elements on that side.

00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:16.200
Because here you would continue
with shell elements,

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:17.920
you would continue with
solid elements here.

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:20.600
And once again three
translational degrees of

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:24.900
freedom for these top and bottom
surface nodes and five

00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:30.350
degrees of freedom at shell
mid-surface nodes as shown for

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:31.760
that node right here.

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.950
Notice we can also use these
transition elements to model

00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:40.665
shell intersections very nicely
as exemplified up here.

00:49:40.665 --> 00:49:42.860
Well, this brings me to the
end of what I wanted to

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:44.890
discuss with you in
this lecture.

00:49:44.890 --> 00:49:47.360
Of course what we have not done
yet is to look at example

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:50.640
solutions and what I'd like to
do in the next lecture is

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:56.020
first of all talk with you
about beam elements, the

00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:58.050
isoparametric beam element,
which is formulated much in

00:49:58.050 --> 00:49:59.950
the same way as the
shell elements

00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:01.670
that we just discussed.

00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:04.870
And then I'd like to show you
applications of the beam

00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:07.800
elements as well as the
shell elements.

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:10.720
So please, if you are interested
in this subject

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:16.580
matter, continue looking at the
second tape, part two of

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:17.620
this set of lectures.

00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:19.390
Thank you very much for
your attention.
