00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.610
PROFESSOR: Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to this

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.730
lecture on non-linear finite
element analysis.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.050
The title of this lecture is
"Basic Considerations in

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.690
Non-Linear Analysis." In this
lecture I would like to

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.790
discuss with you first the
application of the principle

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.190
of virtual work.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.955
We will spend quite a bit of
time on the basic principle of

00:00:45.955 --> 00:00:49.770
virtual work, because it's such
an important ingredient

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.510
for non-linear finite
element analysis.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.670
In fact, the displacement-based
finite

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.900
element method, which is widely
used for non-linear

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.890
analysis, is based on an
application of the principle

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.060
of virtual work.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.500
I also would like to discuss
with you and particularly

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.760
emphasize some basic
requirements of mechanics.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.540
There are a few very important
requirements of mechanics that

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.470
it is important to always keep
in mind, and I'd like to share

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.080
some experiences with you
regarding these requirements.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.240
And finally, to emphasize all
the points that I have tried

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.780
to make in the lecture, I like
to present and share with you

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.340
some experiences regarding
some actual analyses.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.930
And I've chosen two analyses.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.590
First we will look at the
analysis of a plate with a

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.860
hole, and then we will look
at the analysis of a

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.952
plate with a crack.

00:01:51.952 --> 00:01:56.470
Let me now go over to my view
graph and start with a

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.270
discussion of the principle
of virtual work.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.040
The principle of virtual work,
in essence, says that this

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.759
integral here on the left-hand
side is equal to what is on

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.419
the right-hand side.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:13.420
And we should, of course,
discuss now in detail what we

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.110
have on the left- and on
the right-hand side.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.260
On the right-hand side,
we have this tR--

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.540
this is a script R, an unusual
symbol, but some time ago,

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.360
some long time ago, I decided
to select this

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.970
symbol for this quantity.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.340
This script t, superscript t
R, contains two integrals.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.250
The first integral is an
integral over the volume tv.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:49.970
Notice it's the current volume
of the body of tfiB, the body

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.880
forces at time t multiplied
by the virtual

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.100
displacement, del ui.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.210
This product here is
integrated over the

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.750
volume at time t.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.630
We add to this integral another
integral, which is an

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.690
integral over the surface
area of the body.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:20.420
And here we have surface forces
tfiS per unit area, and

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.710
these are virtual displacements,
delta uiS.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:31.320
We integrate this product over
the total area of the body.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.970
So this defines the
right-hand side.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.510
On the left-hand side, we have
one quantity here, which is t

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.390
tau ij, t once again referring,
of course, to time.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.590
tau is a stress, and ij being
the components of the stress.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.780
This stress is called
the Cauchy stress.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.030
It's a force per unit
area at time t.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.740
And on the left-hand side, we
have also a quantity which is

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.760
a virtual strain.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.610
Delta here meaning virtual,
teij meaning the strain.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.459
And it's defined
as shown here.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.880
Now let us look briefly at what
these quantities are.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.710
We have a partial of del ui with
respect to the current

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.700
coordinate txj, and we have a
partial of del uj with respect

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.330
to the current coordinate txi.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.830
Here I have prepared a view
graph which separates out,

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.310
once more, these important
quantities.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.690
And on the top here in red, we
see the virtual displacement

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.460
and the virtual strain.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.380
Notice that the virtual strain
here carries a subscript t, a

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.210
left subscript t.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.900
This left subscript t means that
it's a strain referred to

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.720
the current configuration.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.580
del always meaning virtual,
of course.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.450
And it's important to recognize
the following.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.830
It's important to recognize
that these are the virtual

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.350
strains corresponding to these
virtual displacements.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.180
That's the most important
point to recognize.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.650
In green here, we have some
other quantities--

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.070
the current volume, the current

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.500
surface area of the body.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.720
Current meaning always
at time t.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:39.780
And here in blue, we see the
externally applied forces.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.730
tfiB being the body forces, the
volume forces, and tfiS

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:50.420
being the surface forces per
unit volume, per unit surface.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.060
These are externally
applied forces.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.360
So we have here quite different
quantities--

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.860
namely, virtual quantities
and real quantities.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.510
So let me go back to this view
graph to discuss with you in

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.320
more detail what the principle
really tells us.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.890
It tells that the internal
virtual work consisting of the

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.320
product of the actual
stresses--

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.670
t tau ij, which in
general analysis

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.950
are, of course, unknown--

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:28.920
times the virtual strains, which
we impose, this internal

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.300
virtual work--

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.580
there's an integration over
the whole volume--

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.290
must be equal to the external
virtual work.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.200
And the external virtual work,
once again, is given here.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.020
This equation must hold--

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.750
and this is an important
point--

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:50.580
for arbitrary variations in
displacement, or arbitrary

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.550
virtual displacements that
satisfy the geometric boundary

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.890
conditions, that satisfy the
essential boundary conditions,

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.690
or you might say, the
displacement boundary

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:01.870
conditions.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.760
In other words, this is an
equation that must hold for

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:11.120
any virtual displacements and
corresponding virtual strains.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.020
Remember, I just said that for
virtual displacement, we

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.770
always have corresponding
virtual strains.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.220
This equation must always
hold, provided the

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.250
displacements satisfy the
displacement boundary

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.000
conditions.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.790
Here we have, once again, the
unknown forces, or stresses, I

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.940
should say, forces
per unit area.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.650
Notice these are Cauchy
stresses.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.190
Here we have the word Cauchy.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:42.460
In an infinitesimal displacement
analysis, we

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.610
really only talk about
one kind of stress--

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.520
the engineering stress.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.230
In large displacement analysis,
large strain

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:54.440
analysis, we have different
kind of stress measures.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.880
And the stress that I now talk
about here is the Cauchy

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:03.070
stress, which is the force per
unit area at time t, which is,

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:05.570
in other words, an actual
physical stress.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:09.870
Later on, we will introduce
another kind of stress, a very

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.620
important stress measure,
which, however,

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.570
is not quite physical.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.510
This one here is a physical
stress, the

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.240
force per unit area.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.450
And that is the stress that
you, for example, in a

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.860
computer program, would like
to get printed out.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.690
This is the force per unit area
that you would design

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.260
your structure with.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:32.400
This here is, once again,
the virtual strain.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:38.400
And notice that this strain
is referred to the current

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.789
geometry, the coordinate
at time t.

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:46.580
Therefore, stress at time t
times virtual strain at time

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:51.200
t-- that's what we're looking at
here, and that gives us the

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.710
total internal virtual
work when we

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.340
integrate over the original--

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.730
over the current volume,
current, I should say, very

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:00.570
important--

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.720
the current volume
of the body.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.990
So if we have a body that
moves through space and

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.110
undergoes large displacements,
large rotations, large

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:14.630
strains, then this here is the
quantity of the internal

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:19.880
virtual work with the current
stresses at time t in the

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.600
configuration at time t.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.180
Let us look at a schematic
example, because there are so

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.956
many important considerations.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.380
Here we have, in a
three-dimensional Cartesian

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:40.190
coordinate frame, denoted with
x1, x2, x3 as coordinate axes,

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:44.520
a body in which we are showing
two material particles.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.950
Notice one of them in the body
itself, in the volume of the

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.690
body, rather, and one
on the surface.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:55.670
The body is here supported,
and this is the

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.590
configuration at time 0.

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:04.680
Now this body moves through
a certain amount.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.680
It undergoes large
displacements, large

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.470
rotations, large strains,
and takes on the red

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.830
configuration here.

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:17.640
Notice that in that red
configuration, we have certain

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.570
body forces, which we already
talked about earlier, and

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.910
surface forces, that we also
talked about earlier.

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:28.750
Notice that the particles
have now moved to new

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:31.550
configurations, of course,
to new positions.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:36.320
The surface particle has moved
there, and the particle within

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.360
the volume has moved there.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:46.970
We denote this as tui, the
displacement at time t, or the

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.930
displacement from configuration
02,

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:53.540
configuration t, for this
particular particle.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:59.950
Similarly, here we denote this
displacement as tuiS.

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:04.590
Now the principle of virtual
work says that we will be

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:06.940
imposing on to this red
configuration the

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.270
configuration at time t, a
variation in displacement,

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.520
which is the virtual
displacement.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:17.740
And here we see now one such
virtual displacement.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:23.110
Notice that it is shown by the
blue line for the whole body,

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.870
and it's a virtual displacement
from the

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.950
configuration at time t.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:33.010
Notice that the particle, which
was originally here, or

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:37.020
which was at time t here, I
should more precisely say, has

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:42.010
moved to this point in the
virtual displacement.

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:47.110
And similarly, the particle that
was here at time t has

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:50.880
moved to this configuration,
to this point here.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.260
Now, this is one variation.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.310
However, the principle of
virtual work, of course,

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.920
states that the left-hand side
must be equal to the

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.230
right-hand side--

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:00.890
I think you know now what
I mean by left-

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:02.800
and right-hand sides--

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.120
for any variation.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:09.150
So we have here another
variation.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:13.180
All such variations, however,
must satisfy the displacement

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.860
boundary conditions, and those
displacement boundary

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:19.360
conditions are given
right down here.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.070
Now notice that the particle,
which I looked at earlier

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:27.090
already, has now moved to this
configuration, or in this

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:28.900
variation of displacement.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.640
Similarly, this particle
has moved here.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.710
Now the principle of virtual
work states once again that

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:41.130
for any variation that is
satisfying the displacement

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:45.130
boundary conditions, the
left-hand side, the internal

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:48.230
virtual work, must be equal to
the right-hand side, the

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.250
external virtual work.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:54.090
And these are two variations
that we looked at.

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:58.080
Of course, there are
many, many more.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.250
In fact, we could think of
millions, billions such

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:02.410
variations.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:07.670
And we will, in finite element
analysis, however, discretize

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:11.160
the whole structure using finite
elements, and then only

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.430
allow certain sets
of variations.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:17.010
Namely, those contained in the
interpolation functions of the

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.390
finite elements.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:23.680
Well, let us now look at
one important point.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.340
Namely that if we were to
integrate the principle of

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:31.570
virtual work by parts, we would
obtain the governing

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:35.920
differential equations of
motion plus the force or

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.030
natural boundary conditions,
just like an infinitesimal

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:41.250
displacement analysis.

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.780
However, the difference, of
course, is that we have

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:49.250
referred all our static and
kinematic variables now to

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:53.150
time t, to the current
configuration of the body.

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:55.400
Let's look now at an example.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.350
It's a simple example, in
some sense, but it still

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:03.380
illustrates many of the basic
points that I just mentioned.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.940
The example is a truss
stretching

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.160
under its own weight.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.590
Here we have the truss
in its original

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:14.880
configuration shown in black.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:19.010
It has an original length L0.

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:22.640
It's subjected, of course,
to gravity, g.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:27.950
A typical cross-sectional
area is given here, 0A.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:33.070
Notice that this bar, under its
own weight, moves down to

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:36.090
the configuration
at time t here.

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:40.180
tA is this cross-sectional
area now.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.350
In other words, this area has
now moved to that area.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:47.140
The length of the truss, of
course, has changed, and in

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:50.500
fact has changed to tL.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.000
In order to analyze this
problem, we have to make

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.800
certain assumptions.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.640
The first assumption is, plane
cross-sections remain plane.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.600
Second assumption--

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.550
constant uni-axial stress
on each cross-section.

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:06.710
And then if we make these two
assumptions, then we have a

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:10.000
one-dimensional analysis.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.800
Using these assumptions, we then
obtain directly, from the

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.280
general principle of virtual
work, the following.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.400
Here we have, on the left-hand
side, the general left-hand

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:26.060
side of the principle of virtual
work, Cauchy stress,

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:30.000
the virtual strains, integrated
over the current

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.660
volume at time t, which then
becomes, on the right-hand

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.430
side here, the one stress only,
because we have only one

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:43.670
stress in this bar, the vertical
stress, times the

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:47.120
virtual strain corresponding
to that motion of the bar,

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.380
namely, vertically downwards.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:53.620
And this product is integrated
over the current area at time

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:59.430
t, and of course, the
longitudinal coordinate tdx.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:03.090
Notice that here we are
integrating over the current

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:08.310
volume, because we have
a tA and a tL here.

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:12.130
The right-hand side becomes,
in this particular case, an

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:16.310
integration over the current
length of the gravity force,

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:20.590
which involves the mass density
at time t, in other

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:22.580
words, the current
mass density.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.100
Notice the mass density,
of course,

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.890
changes as the bar extends.

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:29.550
g is the gravity constant.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:35.190
And here we have the virtual
displacement, area at time t,

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:39.990
and of course the differential
increment tdx.

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:43.220
Once again, we here also
integrate over the

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.000
length Lt at time t.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.640
Hence, if we now equate these
two quantities, we directly

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.730
obtain what's shown here.

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:58.390
Now it's important to recognize
that in this

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:03.940
equation, these here are the
virtual strains corresponding

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.890
to these virtual
displacements.

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:10.336
And once again, we apply
the principle of

00:17:10.336 --> 00:17:13.520
course, at time t.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:18.890
So stresses at time t, meaning
forces per unit area at time

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:22.520
t, area at time t, and so on.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:28.790
This virtual strain, also used
to describe this quantity, is

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.720
given right here.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.560
Notice that here we have
the partial of del u

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.125
with respect to tx.

00:17:37.125 --> 00:17:40.050
tx, the coordinate at time t.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:46.410
And this del u is exactly the
del u that we see right there.

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:50.780
Now this principle must hold for
any arbitrary variation in

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:55.990
displacement, any arbitrary
virtual displacement, that

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:58.900
satisfy the displacement
boundary conditions.

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.980
And the displacement boundary
condition here, of course, is

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.930
simply that the displacement
is 0 at the top of the bar.

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:09.700
If we use, now, integration by
parts on this equation that I

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:14.380
just discussed with you, we
obtain this equation here.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:17.860
And that equation contains
really two terms,

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:19.440
two parts to it.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:24.460
First, an integral that is taken
over the length L of the

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:31.910
bar, and then a quantity that
corresponds to the length of

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:37.720
the position 0 and L, tL.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.890
And all of the sum of these
two must be equal to 0.

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:45.660
Since the variation del u is
arbitrary, except, as I

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:49.440
mentioned, right at the top of
the bar, we directly obtain

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.110
that this equation must hold,
which is really extracting

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:56.240
this term here from
the integral.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.720
And this, of course,
is the governing

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.010
differential equation.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:05.630
And also, we must have that at
the lower part of the bar,

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:10.120
this force or natural boundary
condition must be satisfied.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.630
Therefore, this is an example
which shows, really, how the

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:16.930
principle of virtual work
contains the basic

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:18.740
differential equations
of equilibrium.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:22.240
Here it is just one, because we
have only one direction for

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.260
the motion.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:27.110
And also the stress boundary
conditions, the natural or

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:30.880
force stress boundary
conditions.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.890
The finite element application
of the principle of virtual

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:36.580
work proceeds as follows.

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:43.780
Here, once again, virtual
strains, virtual displacements

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:47.950
in the volume of the body and
on the surface of the body.

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:50.670
These are the virtual
quantities.

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:55.170
The actual applied forces,
externally applied forces, are

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:58.300
these blue quantities.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.390
We deliberately chose a
different color to emphasize

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:05.290
that these are real forces,
blue, applied to the body, and

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:08.660
these are virtual

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:11.430
displacements and virtual strains.

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:14.700
The stresses here at time t,
of course, are unknown, and

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.790
those we want to calculate.

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:22.710
In the finite element method,
what's shown in this big box,

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:27.680
we interpolate displacements,
virtual displacements.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.950
We calculate from those
interpolations, strains, real

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:35.830
strains, virtual strains.

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:39.950
Via the stress-strain law, we
got stresses, and we will see

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:44.130
in the later lectures that in
fact, what we are arriving at

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:50.460
is a force vector tF and an
external load vector.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:57.130
Now, this tF here, shown in
green, is a result of this

00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:00.200
stress t tau ij.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:06.500
And it's really the nodal
point force vector that

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:13.070
corresponds to these internal
element stresses, t tau ij.

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:18.100
This R here is a nodal point
force vector that corresponds

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.140
to these externally
applied forces.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:30.210
This del UT, on left-hand side
and on the right-hand side, is

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:34.980
a vector of virtual
displacements, nodal point

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:39.190
displacements, and which, in the
finite element analysis,

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:43.730
we then set equal to the
identity matrix, invoking the

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:46.490
principle of virtual work in
turn for each degree of

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:50.290
freedom, just like we do in
linear elastic analysis.

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:52.770
This becomes the identity
matrix, that becomes the

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:56.160
identity matrix, and the result
is, of course, simply

00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:01.310
that tF must be equal to tR.

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:05.390
The procedure that we are
following in this box, of

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:07.800
course, is of much interest
in non-linear analysis.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:11.080
And what's happening in this box
here, we will be talking

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:17.690
about in some considerable
detail in the later lectures.

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:20.900
But for the moment, let's now
assume that the solution at

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:22.750
time t is known.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:26.880
Hence the stress at time t,
the volume at time t, et

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:31.130
cetera, are known, and we want
to obtain the solution at time

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:33.180
t plus delta t.

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:36.850
In other words, we want to move
ahead 1 increment in time

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:40.720
delta t and establish the
solution at that time.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.770
The principle of virtual work
applied now at time t plus

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:48.170
delta t in exactly the same way
as we just applied it at

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:53.210
time t results in this
set of equations.

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:56.520
A vector of nodal point forces
that is equivalent to the

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.200
current internal element
stresses at time t

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.970
plus delta t now.

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:04.580
And these are the nodal point
externally applied forces at

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.280
time t plus delta t.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:11.580
Well, of course, we don't know
t plus delta tF, and for the

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:16.740
solution, we now say that t plus
delta tF is equal to tF,

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:20.980
which we do know, plus
a matrix tK--

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:25.040
we call this as tangent
stiffness matrix--

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:32.620
times del U. If we set this
left-hand side equal to t plus

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:36.890
delta tR, the externally applied
loads, we directly

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:38.950
obtain this equation.

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:42.060
We are putting the unknowns on
the left-hand side, and the

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:45.550
unknowns, of course, are the
incremental displacements.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:47.845
The tangent stiffness
matrix is known.

00:23:47.845 --> 00:23:49.930
It's the matrix corresponding
to the

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:52.892
configuration at time t.

00:23:52.892 --> 00:23:57.980
The load vector is known, and
tF is assumed to be known.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:01.110
Now, this is here an
out-of-balance load vector,

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:05.430
and this set of equations then
result into the solution of an

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:09.380
increment in nodal point
displacements delta U. This

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.290
increment in nodal point
displacement is added to the

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.640
displacement at time t to obtain
the displacement at

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.100
time t plus delta t.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.050
But--

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:20.390
and here is the big but--

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:23.030
by writing this equation
up here, we had to

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:24.940
linearize the problem.

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:28.480
You see, we are dealing with a
large amount of non-linearity

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:33.890
that can come from the
kinematics, from the material

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:35.620
relationships and so on.

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.020
And we had to linearize.

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:41.410
We linearized here about the
configuration at time t to

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:45.850
obtain this term, and this means
that down here in this

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:49.930
equation, we only can have
an approximation sign.

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:52.680
In other words, what we have
calculated are not the exact

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.100
increments in nodal point
displacement, but an

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.690
approximation to it.

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:59.930
More generally, then, we
repeat that process.

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:05.260
We apply the same process in an
iterative way to obtain a

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:06.630
very accurate solution.

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:09.030
And this is done in
the following way.

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:12.730
On the right-hand side now, we
have a load vector, the one

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:16.810
that we discussed already
before, minus the nodal point

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:21.170
forces corresponding to
time t plus delta t in

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:23.300
iteration i minus 1.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.810
I should say at the beginning
of iteration i, or end of

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:29.050
iteration i minus 1.

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:31.335
This gives us an out-of-balance
load vector.

00:25:31.335 --> 00:25:35.790
We're calculating an increment
in displacements, delta Ui.

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:39.140
And that increment in
displacement is added to the

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.450
displacements which were
known already.

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:44.580
At the end of iteration i minus
1 corresponding to time

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:47.370
t plus delta t, we knew
these displacements.

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:50.590
We add the increment that we
calculated, and we obtain a

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:55.420
better guess, so to say, for
the current displacement at

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.610
time t plus delta t.

00:25:57.610 --> 00:26:00.400
Now of course in this iteration
here, we need some

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.670
initial conditions, and
the initial conditions

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:04.340
are given down here.

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:08.540
The t plus delta t F 0, in other
words, when i is equal

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:14.730
to 1, then we need t plus delta
t F 0 is given by tF.

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:20.490
The displacement t plus delta t
U0, when i is equal to 1, is

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:22.370
given by tU.

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:26.020
These initial conditions are
used in the iteration here,

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:29.390
and we notice that this set
of equations in the first

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:33.200
iteration, when i is equal to
1, reduces to the equations

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:36.300
that I already discussed
with you with the

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:38.270
previous view graph.

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:42.610
Well, if we look at this
set of equations, we

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:44.230
recognize the following.

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:47.970
Nodal point equilibrium is
satisfied when the equation t

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:51.170
plus delta tR minus t plus
delta tF, i minus

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:53.080
1, is equal to 0.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:57.910
When the externally applied
loads are equal to the nodal

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:02.160
point forces corresponding to
the stresses at time t plus

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:08.860
delta t, when these two vectors
are equal, or rather,

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:13.520
when R minus F is equal to 0,
then of course we have nodal

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.250
point equilibrium.

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:18.400
Compatibility is satisfied
provided a compatible element

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.360
mesh is used.

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:23.700
The stress-strain law enters
in the calculation of the

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:27.450
tangent stiffness matrix and the
nodal point force vector

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:31.790
F, which corresponds to the
current stresses at time t

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:35.300
plus delta t, iteration
i minus 1.

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:40.890
Well, we will get back to these
considerations just now.

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:46.630
But most important is to
recognize that we have to

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:52.940
calculate F t plus delta ti
minus 1 very accurately from

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:56.190
the displacements t plus
delta t Ui minus 1.

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:59.340
The general procedure is
depicted on this view graph.

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:03.670
Here we have the displacement
at time t plus delta t ui

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:07.180
minus 1, which give
us strains.

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:10.120
We can directly, via
differentiations of the

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:15.350
displacements, get strains,
which gives us stresses if we

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:16.970
enter here with the appropriate

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:18.560
constitutive relation.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.760
Of course, we have to use the
constitutive relation

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.910
corresponding to the problem
that we want to solve.

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:28.670
We get stresses, and the
stresses, then, give us this

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:31.600
nodal point force vector
that I talked about.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:37.200
Notice that in this relationship
here, we have to

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.050
perform an integration, and that
integration is expressed

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:43.140
here, where we obtain the
stresses at time t plus delta

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:49.600
t in iteration i minus 1 by
taking the stresses at time t

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:53.670
and integrating the
stress-strain law times the

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:59.330
incremental strains from time
t to time t plus delta t,

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:03.570
where we use, of course, the
strains at time t, and the

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:06.010
strains at time t plus delta t

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:08.680
corresponding to that iteration.

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:13.410
This step is most important,
because you have to calculate

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:21.580
the F vector correctly so that
when you say that this

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:28.220
equation is satisfied, that
indeed you have obtained the

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:31.590
right configuration for the
finite element mesh that

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:32.510
you're considering.

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:35.870
So it is most important to
calculate the F correctly.

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:38.060
Of course, the tangent stiffness
matrix should also

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:42.000
be calculated appropriately, and
we will talk about that as

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.250
well later on.

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:49.420
In all this discussion, I should
point out we assumed

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:52.470
that the nodal point loads are
independent of the structural

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:53.680
deformations.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.150
In other words, they vary only
as a function of time.

00:29:57.150 --> 00:29:59.600
Here's a small problem
that schematically

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.510
shows what we mean.

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:07.500
The load R is always acting
vertically, never mind how

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.070
much this beam has displaced.

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:13.790
And that load variation is shown
here on the graph as a

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:15.040
function of time.

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:22.860
We satisfy the basic
requirements of mechanics if

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:26.730
we perform this finite element
analysis appropriately.

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:30.570
We satisfy the stress-strain law
because we are evaluating

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:34.350
the stresses correctly
corresponding

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:36.080
from the given strains.

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.490
We also satisfy the
compatibility requirements

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:43.110
provided we use compatible
elements, and of course we

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:47.130
satisfy the displacement
boundary conditions.

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:50.840
Equilibrium we also satisfy
corresponding to the finite

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.190
element nodal point degrees
of freedom.

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:57.040
But there is one important
point.

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.920
This means that we only
satisfy global

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.970
equilibrium in general.

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:07.870
We satisfy equilibrium locally
only if we use a fine enough

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:09.840
finite element mesh.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.870
In other words, I'd like to
distinguish now between

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:16.060
satisfying global equilibrium
and local equilibrium.

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:21.930
Local equilibrium means that
we want to satisfy the

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:25.740
differential equations of
equilibrium at every

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:27.390
point in the mesh.

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:31.360
And that is only achieved if we
have a large enough finite

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.540
elements for the
given problem--

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:37.120
in other words, if our
discretization is fine enough.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:41.540
A check on whether we are
satisfying local equilibrium

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:47.280
well enough is to look at the
stresses along the boundary

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.350
and see whether the
stress boundary

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:51.900
conditions are satisfied.

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:52.670
That is one check.

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:58.850
Another check is to test whether
along boundaries of

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:03.910
the elements, there are small
stress jumps only.

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:08.310
In other words, whether the
stresses from one element to

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:11.110
another element do not
jump too much.

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:16.510
We call that the stress jumping
because as we will

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:20.300
just talk further, when we
calculate the stress at a node

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:23.100
for an element, we get,
of course, one value.

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:26.510
And if at that same node, the
stresses are calculated using

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:28.130
another element, you
would get, in

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:29.520
general, another value.

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:35.020
This stress difference should
not be very large, and of

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.780
course, if we have a homogeneous
material, if we

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:40.320
have other conditions satisfied
as well, in other

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:44.370
words, if typically the exact
solution would have a

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:48.070
continuous stress variation,
then the stress jump should be

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:51.400
very small for an accurate
solution.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.220
And this is a good check, an
indication of whether we

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:58.050
indeed have obtained
a valid solution.

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:02.810
Well, I like to now demonstrate
to you some of

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:06.800
these considerations by showing
you the results of two

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.370
example analyses.

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:12.740
But it is best if we show these
examples on a different

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:15.390
reel, on a second reel
of this lecture.

00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:16.640
Thank you very much.

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:23.590
We just discussed some issues
regarding how equilibrium is

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:25.560
satisfied in a
displacement-based finite

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.270
element analysis.

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:30.890
We discussed briefly that global
equilibrium is always

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:32.650
satisfied for any finite
element mesh

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:33.980
that you have selected.

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:38.340
By global equilibrium, we mean
equilibrium at the nodal

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.000
points of the finite
element mesh.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.972
However, locally, equilibrium is
only satisfied if the mesh

00:33:46.972 --> 00:33:48.330
is fine enough.

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:52.860
And an indication to see whether
a mesh is fine enough

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:55.750
is given, for example, by
whether these stressed

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:59.520
boundary conditions are well
satisfied, and whether there

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:02.760
are no stress jumps
between elements.

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:06.520
I would like now to share with
you experiences relating to

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:07.550
two problems.

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:11.080
These are actually linear
elastic analysis problems that

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:16.360
exemplify how we are looking
at stress jumps in order to

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:21.100
choose an appropriate
finite element mesh.

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:26.520
The first problem is
the analysis of a

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.550
plate with a whole.

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:33.130
The plate has certain geometric
dimensions, of

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:35.980
course, and it has also
material data.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:38.710
The material data are
given right there.

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:41.790
Notice that we also give
material data for an

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:43.750
elastoplastic analysis.

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:46.710
We will not perform now the
elastoplastic analysis.

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:48.719
We will consider it later.

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:52.560
For the moment, we just need
these two material data.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:56.150
The| geometric data for the
plate are given here.

00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:59.540
Now, this plate with
a hole has a

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:01.880
doubly symmetric structure.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:04.680
In other words, there are two
symmetry lines, as shown here.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:08.590
So we only need to look at 1/4
of the plate in the analysis.

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:11.780
Notice that the plate is
subjected to a pulling force

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:16.360
up here and similarly
down here.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:19.480
The purpose of the analysis is
to accurately determine the

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:24.390
stresses in the plate, and of
course, once again, assuming

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:27.180
that the loads are small enough
to warrant a linear

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:29.350
elastic analysis.

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:33.140
The considerations that are
valid in linear elastic

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:36.510
analysis regarding the choice
of a mesh are of course also

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:40.490
valid in a non-linear analysis,
and we more easily

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:43.400
can discuss them now, just
using a linear elastic

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:47.100
analysis as an example.

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:50.760
Using symmetry, as I pointed out
already, we can just focus

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.640
our attention on 1/4
of the plate.

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.590
Here is that quarter
of the plate.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:57.190
Here is the hole.

00:35:57.190 --> 00:36:00.040
Notice we have roller boundary
conditions here, roller

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:03.233
boundary conditions there, and
the load is applied up there.

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:11.410
Accuracy considerations in
displacement-based finite

00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:14.900
element analysis are that
first of all, of course,

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:16.840
compatibility must
be satisfied.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.520
And that is achieved by
using a compatible

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.220
finite element mesh.

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:24.640
The material law must also
be satisfied, and that is

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:28.910
achieved by just using the
appropriate material data.

00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:32.760
Of course, in non-linear
analysis, this item needs a

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.030
lot more attention, but we are
performing now a linear

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:40.510
elastic analysis, so this is a
very simple condition, and

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:44.100
it's satisfied by simply
selecting the proper Young's

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:47.370
modulus, Poisson's ratio
for the model.

00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:52.280
Equilibrium, once again, is
locally only satisfied if we

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.060
choose a fine enough mesh.

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:57.850
Otherwise we only approximate
equilibrium locally.

00:36:57.850 --> 00:37:01.110
And as I pointed out earlier, we
can observe the equilibrium

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:04.840
error by plotting stress
discontinuities.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:12.200
Here we have the results
of a two-element

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:13.960
mesh for this problem.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:18.330
Notice this quarter of the
plate, idealized using just

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:20.330
two 8-node elements.

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:24.570
This is the line z equal to 0,
and we will later on look at

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:26.480
stresses along this line.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:29.260
This is a line y equal to z.

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:31.980
We will also look at stresses
along this line.

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:35.750
But we will plot the stresses
along this line here as a

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:38.490
function of y.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:40.290
You should keep that in mind.

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:42.470
In other words, the first stress
quality that we will

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:46.690
see will actually start
somewhere here, because we are

00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:51.130
plotting this stress
as a function of y.

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:55.810
The displacements, somewhat
amplified after load

00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:58.910
application, are shown here.

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:02.140
Notice the maximum displacement
here, uz, is

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:05.980
0.0285 millimeters.

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:11.010
The maximum stress is at this
point here, 281 MPa,

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:12.290
megapascal.

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:18.090
Well, if we plot the stresses
along the line z equal to 0,

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:20.640
and we're evaluating the
stresses, I should also say,

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:24.830
at the nodal points of the
elements, then we obtain these

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:26.310
values here.

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:29.740
One value there, one value
there, one value there.

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:36.220
And once again, we are plotting
the stresses along

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:41.920
the y-axis, measured along here,
distance, and the stress

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:45.210
magnitude is measured
along here.

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:46.720
Tau zz.

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.180
These are nodal point
stresses.

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:51.060
And we simply have drawn a
smooth curve through these

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.390
nodal point stresses.

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:56.310
The applied stress, far away
from the hole, is 100 MPa.

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:04.660
If we plot the stresses along
the line y equals z, along

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:11.910
this line here, we notice that
we have a choice of choosing

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:13.850
either the nodal point stresses
from the element

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:17.460
below it or from the
element above it.

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:20.940
Well, the nodal point stresses
from the element below it are

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:24.600
given by the crosses here.

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:28.770
The nodal point stresses from
the element above it--

00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:31.820
and notice, these are the nodal
point stresses at these

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:35.700
nodes here are given
by this point.

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:38.420
I should say, actually, that
we are plotting here the

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:41.040
principal stress, the maximum
principal stress.

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:42.550
We only look at one stress.

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:45.840
Of course, you could plot such
curves for all three stress

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:49.550
components, but here we're
looking just at sigma 1 being

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:52.560
the maximum principal stress.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.820
Now there we can see the
stress discontinuity.

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:59.110
We see a stress discontinuity
right at that point.

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:03.570
Let's see once, what does this
stress continuity result from?

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:06.480
Notice that there
is a node here--

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:09.920
and I just like to put
it in one color--

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.900
there's a node here coming
from this element.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:17.890
And there's another node coming
in from that element.

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:22.680
Of course, this red point
corresponds to this mark here.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:28.190
So this node here gives us a
stress in the stress graph

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:30.180
given by that symbol.

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:37.880
This blue point there is a
node corresponding to the

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:40.600
element with the cross, and
there we get also a stress

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:44.420
value, and that stress value
corresponds to the cross mark

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:45.020
on the graph.

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:47.340
So let's go back to the
graph once more.

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:52.120
Once again, same location,
because this blue node lies

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:55.760
really on top of the red node.

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:58.930
They are put together.

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:02.120
And yet although we're looking
at the same material particle,

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:04.700
we have this stress
discontinuity.

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:07.720
And this stress discontinuity
tells us that the mesh is

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.420
really not fine enough.

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:14.010
So we go to a finer mesh.

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:18.330
And here now we have selected
a 64-element mesh.

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:22.520
Once again, 8-node elements,
as shown here, for that

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:25.180
quarter of the plate
with the hole.

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:27.250
Here is the typical
8-node element.

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:31.280
This is the undeformed mesh, and
when we apply the loads,

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:34.660
we obtain this deformed shape.

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:41.850
The maximum stress is now 345
MPa, and the displacement

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:48.770
right at that point here
is 0.0296 millimeter.

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:51.170
Well, we can now once
again plot stresses.

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:54.240
We can plot stresses
along this line--

00:41:54.240 --> 00:42:00.240
or I should rather show it here,
along this line, and

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:04.610
along that line, same way
as we have done before.

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:08.790
And let's look at the stresses
along the line z equal to 0.

00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:15.830
Of course, y is the coordinate
along which we are plotting

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:20.340
the stresses, and you can see
now here a stress jump, a

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:21.950
stress discontinuity.

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:27.760
This is where two elements
adjoin each other at one node.

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.090
Otherwise, we see very little
stress discontinuity.

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:34.300
In fact, too small to
be visible by eye.

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:38.760
If we plot stresses along
the line y equal to z--

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.930
and here I should be
more specific.

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:43.570
In fact, we only plot,
once again, the

00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:46.390
maximum principal stress.

00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:50.750
We find that we get
these curves here.

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:54.880
Now notice that at that
location, we get four distinct

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.260
stress values.

00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:01.940
The reason being that at this
node, four elements couple

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:05.980
into that node, and that
gives us four stress

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:09.140
values at that node.

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:12.730
If you go further away, we find
that there are very few

00:43:12.730 --> 00:43:14.535
or very small stress
discontinuities.

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:21.170
So however, since we have still
one stress discontinuity

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:27.890
there at that one location that
I pointed out, we went

00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:33.400
ahead and analyzed an even finer
mesh, 288-element mesh.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:38.620
This mesh is shown now here,
8-node elements, once again,

00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:43.030
in the undeformed shape, and
here in the deformed shape.

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:47.700
Notice that the maximum stress
is now 337 megapascals and the

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:53.530
maximum displacement here
is 0.0296 millimeters.

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:59.040
We can again plot stresses along
this line and along that

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:02.470
diagonal line as a
function of y.

00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:08.900
And if we do so, we find that
along the line z equal to 0,

00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:13.600
we find for tau zz virtually no
more stress discontinuity.

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:17.080
A nice, smooth stress curve.

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:21.660
And along the line y equal to
z, for the maximum principal

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:25.240
stress, also almost
no discontinuity.

00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:33.560
You can see here a slight
discontinuity, but that is

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:37.320
really a very small one that
in engineering analysis, we

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:40.410
generally can live with.

00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:44.900
Of course, these stress jump
plots are very useful and very

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:47.410
helpful in identifying
whether a mesh is

00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:49.480
actually a good mesh.

00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:53.180
However, we should realize
that in order to identify

00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:57.580
whether a mesh is really good,
we would have to plot stress

00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:02.820
jumps along many lines in the
mesh, and that can, of course,

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:05.490
provide quite some cost.

00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:09.680
It also means that we have to
interpret a lot of data.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:14.570
And one perhaps more convenient
way to look at

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:19.400
whether a mesh is a good mesh
is to plot pressure bands.

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:24.700
We have been lately using this
procedure to identify whether

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:29.610
meshes are good, and I'd like
to just share that latest

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:31.140
experience with you.

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:34.650
You plot bands of constant
pressure, where the pressure

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:39.960
is defined by taking the mean
of the stresses tau xx, tau

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:41.500
yy, and tau zz.

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:45.920
Of course, pressure meaning a
negative sign in front here.

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:51.170
The two-element mesh gives us
this pressure band plot.

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:55.470
Notice that these are bands
of 5 MPa difference.

00:45:55.470 --> 00:46:00.130
In other words, here you have a
jump from this point to that

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:03.870
point of 5 MPa, and
once again, from

00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:05.390
here to there again.

00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:07.610
5 MPa.

00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:10.860
These are the pressure
band plots for

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:12.750
the two-element mesh.

00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:16.060
Here we have it as the same
kind of plot for the

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:17.910
64-element mesh.

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:20.710
Let's look at this pressure
band plot a

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:22.970
little bit more carefully.

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:27.645
Here we have, as you can see,
again, differences of 5 MPa.

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:36.330
This is a non-dark area,
unshaded area,

00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:38.260
provides a band of 5 MPa.

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:41.820
That shaded area provides
a band of 5 MPa.

00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:45.370
Now, if we have a good mesh,
then the pressure band should

00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:47.500
be continuous.

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:51.470
In other words, this band here
should be continuous, and

00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:57.390
there should be no pressure
band break.

00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:59.480
Let's look at this one here.

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:02.500
It's nice and continuous,
however, there's a break.

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:06.980
And so there is no continuity
in stresses here, which is

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:11.220
quite simply displayed
by the pressure band

00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:12.930
picture shown here.

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:17.850
For a continuous stress field,
we would have no breaks in the

00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:19.230
pressure bands.

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:21.310
We have selected here 5 MPa.

00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:25.230
Of course, you could also select
1 MPa, and that would

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:27.280
be then a much tighter
criteria.

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:30.410
You could also select 10 MPa.

00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:34.810
Of course, then that would be a
very loose criterion, and 5

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:37.310
MPa for this particular problem,
since you can see,

00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:40.030
we're getting quite a number
of bands along here, is a

00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:42.730
reasonable way to proceed.

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:46.560
If you go to the 288-element
mesh, the pressure band plots

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:47.670
look like this.

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:49.345
Beautifully smooth.

00:47:49.345 --> 00:47:52.150
You can see here the smoothness
in the pressure

00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:56.910
bands, no discontinuity
at all.

00:47:56.910 --> 00:48:02.670
And this shows really that this
mesh certainly satisfies

00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:06.920
the criterion of smooth
pressure bands, smooth

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:09.510
pressure variations, over
the whole mesh.

00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:12.660
And that is a strong indication
that the stresses

00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:16.360
are smooth, and therefore that
the mesh is really an

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:17.610
acceptable mesh.

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:22.620
We see, therefore, that stress
discontinuities are

00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:25.400
represented by breaks in
the pressure bands.

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:28.380
As the mesh is refined, of
course, these breaks in the

00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:32.220
pressure bands disappear, or
certainly become smoother

00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:34.450
until finally they disappear.

00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:38.040
The stress state everywhere in
the mesh is represented by one

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:40.220
picture, and that is, of course,
the beauty of this

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:41.530
whole procedure.

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:47.100
If you plot stress jumps, stress
component jumps, then

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:54.490
you have to plot for each
component along all the lines

00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:57.010
where elements join
each other, these

00:48:57.010 --> 00:48:58.120
components of stresses.

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:00.980
And there is a voluminous amount
of information that is

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:02.000
being generated.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.720
Here we have just one picture
that basically gives us a lot

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:10.220
of information about
the smoothness

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:12.400
of the stress situation.

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:15.170
Of course, the pressure band is
plotted, maybe plotted by a

00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:17.610
computer program.

00:49:17.610 --> 00:49:21.470
Actual magnitudes of pressure
are not given, but we are not

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:25.040
really interested in seeing
those from these pictures.

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:28.090
What we would like to see are
simply whether the pressure

00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:30.070
bands are smooth, and whether,
therefore, the mesh is an

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:32.040
acceptable mesh.

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.570
Let's summarize the results.

00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:41.190
Here we now performed three
analyses of this plate.

00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:45.410
One two-element mesh was used,
a 64-element mesh was used,

00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:48.200
and a 288-element
mesh was used.

00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:51.330
The number of degrees of
freedom are given here.

00:49:51.330 --> 00:49:54.400
Notice that the number of
degrees of freedom goes up

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:57.930
very rapidly as the number
of elements goes up.

00:49:57.930 --> 00:50:01.380
The relative cost is given in
this column, and you can see

00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:05.350
here that we have normalized
the cost to the cost of the

00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:10.220
analysis using the
64-element mesh.

00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:14.330
So the two-element mesh is very
cheap, 8% of the cost,

00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:18.910
and the 288-element mesh
solution is quite expensive.

00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:24.060
The displacement at the top of
the plate is given in this

00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:28.530
column, and we notice that with
a 64-element mesh, we

00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:31.590
really obtain a very good
displacement prediction.

00:50:31.590 --> 00:50:33.810
In fact, there is no
change going to a

00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:36.210
larger number of elements.

00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:40.970
And the stress concentration
factor, interestingly enough,

00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:45.270
increases first and then
slightly decreases.

00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:47.620
Notice this is not an
infinite plate--

00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:52.150
it's a finite plate, and
therefore you do not get the

00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:54.860
value of three, for example,
that you would see in an

00:50:54.860 --> 00:51:01.500
infinite plate, for a hole
in an infinite plate.

00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:09.390
So the two-element mesh cannot
be used for stress predictions

00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:11.020
is certainly a conclusion.

00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:12.520
It's not accurate enough.

00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:18.020
The 64-element mesh gives
reasonable results for

00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:21.210
stresses, and certainly very
accurate results for the

00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:22.620
displacements.

00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:27.270
The 288-element mesh is probably
overrefined for

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:29.000
linear elastic stress
analysis.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:34.640
However, for other types of
analysis, for example, an

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:37.560
elastoplastic analysis, if you
want to have very accurate

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:40.120
results, we might want
to use, actually,

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:42.570
this fineness of mesh.

00:51:42.570 --> 00:51:45.430
One question that one, of course
might have is, why did

00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:47.860
he not use 9-node elements?

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:49.880
We used 8-node elements.

00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:52.660
Here we show now a mesh
of 9-node elements.

00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:56.520
Notice each of these elements
now is a 9-node element.

00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:59.690
Would the solution significantly
improve if we

00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:02.310
had used 9-node elements?

00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:06.070
In other words, one 9-node
element for each 8-node

00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:08.420
element that was used before?

00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:10.560
Well, the answer is no.

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:13.310
The solution does not
improve very much.

00:52:13.310 --> 00:52:17.270
If you look at this column here,
let's look at the 64

00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:23.300
8-node elements solution, in
which case we had 416 degrees

00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:24.670
of freedom.

00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:29.500
With a 9-node element, we will
have 544 degrees of freedom.

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:33.420
The displacements at the top
are unchanged between the

00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:37.110
8-node and 9-node
element results.

00:52:37.110 --> 00:52:40.000
The stress concentration
factor is very

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.290
little effected here.

00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:46.750
Only in the fourth digit,
as a matter of fact.

00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:49.320
And the stress jump and pressure
band plot do not

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:50.872
change significantly, either.

00:52:53.590 --> 00:52:56.710
Well, the second example that
I'd then like to discuss with

00:52:56.710 --> 00:53:01.740
you is the analysis of
a plate with a crack.

00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:06.030
We will once again look at
different meshes for this

00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:10.890
problem, and we will
also discuss

00:53:10.890 --> 00:53:12.230
one additional aspect--

00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:16.830
namely that for certain types of
answers that you're looking

00:53:16.830 --> 00:53:21.520
for, you actually can use
sometimes very coarse meshes.

00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:25.480
Whereas if you're looking for
the answer of a much more

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:29.440
difficult question, of course
you will have to use a much

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:30.580
finer mesh.

00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:33.370
Here we have a plate
with a crack.

00:53:33.370 --> 00:53:38.330
Notice the plate is subjected
to a pull of 100 MPa right,

00:53:38.330 --> 00:53:41.130
and at the left-hand
side, same pull.

00:53:41.130 --> 00:53:44.270
The crack is lying
right there.

00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:47.370
Notice it's not a a
symmetric crack.

00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:54.960
This is a crack tip A, that's
the crack tip B. To model this

00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:57.980
plate, we have to really
model half of it.

00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:00.890
We have to model half of it,
because the crack is not a

00:54:00.890 --> 00:54:02.620
symmetric crack.

00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:05.370
The material data for this
problem are given down here.

00:54:05.370 --> 00:54:11.060
E, Young's modulus, nu,
Poisson's ratio, Kc is the

00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:13.410
fracture toughness.

00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:18.880
And here we have the fact that
the thickness of the plate

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.920
shall be just 1 centimeter.

00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:23.280
It's a plane stress condition
that we're looking at.

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:26.440
And the question that we want
to address here is, will the

00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:27.690
crack propagate?

00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:34.040
Well, let us look at some
background information.

00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:38.240
Since we want to perform a
linear elastic analysis and we

00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:44.520
want to apply linear elastic
fracture mechanic theory when

00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:50.720
considering whether the crack
will propagate in the plate,

00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:54.610
we calculate a stress intensity
factor, and we have

00:54:54.610 --> 00:55:00.130
a mode 1 stress condition,
so we calculate K1.

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:03.760
K1 determines the strength of
the 1 over square root r

00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:06.720
stress singularity at the crack
tip, r of course being

00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.690
the radius from the crack tip.

00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:11.540
And as very well established
in linear elastic fracture

00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:18.070
mechanics, when K1 is
greater than Kc,

00:55:18.070 --> 00:55:19.870
the crack will propagate.

00:55:19.870 --> 00:55:22.910
Kc is a property of
the material.

00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:29.800
The computation of K1 is
performed by this here.

00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:36.560
It's equal to the square root
out of E times G. G is

00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:40.510
obtained as the partial
differentiation of pi with

00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:45.640
respect to a, where pi is a
total potential energy of the

00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:49.290
structure, and a is the area
of the crack surface.

00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:53.150
G is known as the energy release
rate for the crack.

00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:56.210
This is quite well established,
and what we want

00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:59.900
to do, of course, in the finite
element analysis, is to

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:02.780
calculate this G value.

00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:05.180
The question is, how
do we do that?

00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:09.460
Well, in this finite element
analysis, each crack is

00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:12.320
represented by a node.

00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:17.140
And if you look at a cut through
the plate where this

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:21.600
is here the crack, we have
this here as the node

00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:23.890
at the crack tip.

00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:27.410
This node in the finite element
analysis is, so to

00:56:27.410 --> 00:56:32.500
say, moved forward a
differential amount, so that

00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:36.750
the change in crack
area is given via

00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:39.060
this little bit here.

00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:42.310
Now that the original crack tip
location is here, the new

00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:45.260
crack tip location
is right there.

00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:51.480
Then we can, in this process,
evaluate del pi over del a as

00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:55.930
del pi del l times
1/t, where t is a

00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:59.020
thickness of that plate.

00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:02.230
Of course, this here is only
conceptually being done, that

00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:04.500
we're actually moving
the crack.

00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:07.880
What we're really doing is the
differentiation of del pi with

00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:12.910
respect to l, where l is the
length of the crack and del l

00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:22.050
is the differentiation of l
into this direction here.

00:57:22.050 --> 00:57:26.170
The quantities del pi del l may
be efficiently calculated

00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:32.310
by an algorithm that we have
just recently been publishing.

00:57:32.310 --> 00:57:36.320
Of course, there are different
algorithms available as well,

00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:40.000
but we would like to use this
procedure to calculate

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.550
data pi over l.

00:57:41.550 --> 00:57:43.950
And you can look up how
it's being done in

00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:46.640
this particular paper.

00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:48.040
Let's look at the results.

00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:53.140
Finite element analyses have
been performed using a

00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:56.830
17-element mesh, and this
is the mesh here.

00:57:56.830 --> 00:57:59.410
We call this a coarse mesh.

00:57:59.410 --> 00:58:01.490
Notice the crack
is right there.

00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:09.840
Notice that we have only two
elements above the crack, to

00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:14.050
the boundary of the plate, and
we have here once again also

00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:16.850
only two elements below it.

00:58:16.850 --> 00:58:21.710
Notice that these nodes around
the crack tip B have been

00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:25.160
moved to the quarter point.

00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:28.020
And similarly, they've been
moved here to the quarter

00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:35.040
point, meaning that this node is
not at the midpoint of this

00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:37.445
element side, but at the
quarter point of

00:58:37.445 --> 00:58:38.500
that element side.

00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:43.220
And similarly for the other
nodes around the crack tips.

00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:50.510
If we look at the results, the
stress results, maybe plus the

00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:57.400
stresses on the line of
symmetry, we find that tau yy

00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:04.550
varies as shown here, then of
course increases very rapidly

00:59:04.550 --> 00:59:05.440
near the crack.

00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:06.690
This is where the crack is.

00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:15.680
Increases very rapidly, then
drops down to very close to 0.

00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:19.030
Of course, it should
be 0 right in here.

00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:24.320
And here we have, coming from
the other side to crack tip A,

00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:26.380
this very rapid variation
in stresses.

00:59:29.290 --> 00:59:31.490
These are the stresses tau yy.

00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:34.740
If you look at the pressure
band plot--

00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:37.400
I introduced you to those
kinds of plots

00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:39.200
in the earlier example--

00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:41.370
we find that the pressure
jumps are really

00:59:41.370 --> 00:59:43.640
larger than five MPa.

00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:46.300
For example, you can see it
right here, you can see it

00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:49.550
right there, you can
see it right there.

00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:52.830
So it's a coarse mesh, and
certainly the stresses are not

00:59:52.830 --> 00:59:55.420
very well represented,
not very well picked

00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:57.360
up with this mesh.

00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:01.910
However, if we look at the
stress intensity factors that

01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:04.430
we wanted to estimate in this
analysis, because they will

01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:09.020
tell us whether the crack will
propagate or not, we find that

01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:13.500
for the stress intensity
factors, for example, KA, we

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:16.810
get an excellent solution.

01:00:16.810 --> 01:00:21.080
For KB, the solution is not
as good, but perhaps still

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:22.330
acceptable.

01:00:25.810 --> 01:00:29.490
We now go to a finer mesh,
a much finer mesh.

01:00:29.490 --> 01:00:33.360
128 elements are used
in this mesh.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:37.050
And we can see once again
here, 1/2 the plate.

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:42.080
Here is point A, crack tip A.
Here is point B, crack tip B.

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:46.190
Notice the crack lies
in between.

01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:48.920
And we will be plotting stresses
along this line.

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:55.580
This is a line of symmetry here,
and we will plot tau yy,

01:00:55.580 --> 01:01:02.710
which is the stress across
here, as a function of z.

01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:05.570
But let's first look a little
bit closer at the mesh.

01:01:05.570 --> 01:01:10.190
If we look at one detail closer
to the crack tip A, we

01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:14.910
see this is the mesh that we
use, and we can go still

01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:22.710
further and show the elements
just around the crack tip,

01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:26.880
right A. Here is A. Notice
that we use triangular

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:30.160
elements, these are
isoparametric degenerate

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:34.250
elements, and that we have
moved, once again, the nodal

01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:37.960
points from the midpoint
to the quarter point.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:42.620
Because we know that if we do
so, we are generating in the

01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:46.740
finite element the 1 over square
root r singularity that

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:50.610
we would like to have in the
analysis, because we know that

01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:53.420
the stresses vary as
a function of 1

01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:54.450
over square root r.

01:01:54.450 --> 01:01:57.480
So it's of benefit to shift
the nodes to the quarter

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:01.870
points, as was done
in this example.

01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:04.120
Now we look here at
the stresses.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:08.370
Stresses tau yy, as I pointed
out, is a function of z.

01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:16.440
And you can see here a stress
that very rapidly grows, then

01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:20.980
on the other side comes down
to practically 0 in the

01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:27.190
cracked area, and on the other
side, coming again now from

01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:31.120
the right here, a stress that
varies very rapidly up close

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.750
to tip A.

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:35.070
We also can see here that
the stress variations

01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:37.140
are nice and smooth.

01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:39.350
Of course, that indicates to us
that the mesh is really a

01:02:39.350 --> 01:02:41.650
good mesh, but we can
also look at our

01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:43.440
pressure bands again.

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:51.610
We find that the pressure jumps
are quite small if we go

01:02:51.610 --> 01:02:53.750
not too close to
the crack tip.

01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:58.110
In other words, here we have
some pressure band variation,

01:02:58.110 --> 01:03:04.200
some pressure band breaks, but
we have still quite smooth

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:08.840
bands that tell us that the
mesh is quite fine.

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:16.580
If we go very close to the crack
tip A, then we find that

01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:21.330
the pressure jumps are, of
course, large right here.

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:24.310
You can see here breaks
in the pressure bend.

01:03:24.310 --> 01:03:27.390
Right here, for example, a
typical example, if you look

01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:30.890
very closely here, there's
a black band coming

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:32.150
into a white band.

01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:36.540
So there's clearly a break
in the pressure band.

01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:41.510
So here, then, in this area,
the stresses are not

01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:45.730
continuous, and would also not
be very accurately predicted.

01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:49.530
However, we know that our scheme
of calculating the

01:03:49.530 --> 01:03:54.690
stress intensity factor works
for even a coarser mesh, and

01:03:54.690 --> 01:03:58.640
for this fine mesh, we've got
indeed excellent results, as

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:04.930
you can see for KA and for KB.

01:04:04.930 --> 01:04:08.020
Both are very well predicted.

01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:11.780
The point of this analysis is
really that the degree off

01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:16.290
refinement needed in a mesh
depends on what kind of

01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:20.080
question you have, what kind of
problem you're solving, and

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:23.980
what kind of question
you're asking.

01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:27.930
If you're only interested in
predicting displacements

01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:30.510
accurately, a coarse
mesh may do.

01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:34.085
If you want to calculate stress
intensity factors, also

01:04:34.085 --> 01:04:36.500
a coarse mesh may do.

01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:39.540
If you want to calculate lowest
natural frequencies,

01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:43.220
associate mode shapes in a
dynamic analysis, once again,

01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:45.620
a coarse mesh might
very well do.

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:47.860
However, if you want to
calculate stresses very

01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:51.000
accurately, then you may
need a fine mesh.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.390
And in general non-linear
analysis, we need accurate

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:58.975
stresses, because the stresses
influence the material

01:04:58.975 --> 01:05:02.250
relationship that has to be
used as we go through the

01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:03.650
incremental solution.

01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:07.740
And therefore, frequently we
need, in non-linear analysis,

01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:12.540
a finer mesh than what would do
well in a linear analysis.

01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:19.040
So we should keep that in mind,
that in fact what might

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:22.800
be a sufficiently fine mesh in
linear elastic analysis may

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:28.160
not be sufficiently fine in
a non-linear elastoplastic

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:29.740
geometrically non-linear
analysis.

01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:33.650
Of course, how fine the mesh
has to be in a general

01:05:33.650 --> 01:05:37.770
non-linear analysis depends very
much on many criteria,

01:05:37.770 --> 01:05:41.760
criteria that we will still
discuss in the next lectures

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:43.460
of this course.

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:47.530
But I hope this gave you a bit
of an overview of what are

01:05:47.530 --> 01:05:51.220
some important considerations
in linear as well as

01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:52.890
non-linear analysis.

01:05:52.890 --> 01:05:54.140
Thank you for your attention.
