00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.780
PROFESSOR: Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to this

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.600
lecture on nonlinear finite
element analysis of solids and

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.530
structures.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.360
In this lecture I would like
to discuss with you the

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.240
updated Lagrangian formulation
for general incremental

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.980
nonlinear analysis.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.820
However, before doing so, I
thought it would be good to

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.100
take a bit of time and review
some of the material that we

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.110
have been discussing already.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.500
We have been encountering
a large number of quite

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.860
complicated equations, some very
important basic concepts,

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.480
and some subtleties.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.480
And to really understand all
of this material, it is

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.680
necessary to study it, of
course, a lot more than the

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.670
time that we have allocated
so far.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.629
But it might help you to just
review now some of that

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.460
material once more.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.420
I've prepared here on the marker
board the material that

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.370
relates to the total Lagrangian
formulation, in

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.350
which really you have been
seeing some of the very

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.200
important equations.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.010
And here we have the basic
equation that is used, of

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.430
course, in finite element
analysis.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.030
This basic equation states, of
course, it is the equation of

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.610
the principle of virtual work,
states that an internal

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.800
virtual work, or the internal
virtual work, must be equal to

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.230
external virtual work.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.210
You remember that we talked
about the Cauchy stress, the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.030
stress which is actually
force per unit area.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.490
And that's the engineering
stress, that's the stress that

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.440
we want to solve for.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.460
That we talked about
a virtual strain.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.960
A virtual strain that
is referred to time

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.840
t plus delta t.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.530
And that is why we have
this subscript here,

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.220
t plus delta t.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.220
And we integrate this product
here over the volume at time t

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.810
plus delta t.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.600
Notice that I'm using here a
green color for the real

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.710
stress that we want to solve
for, and a red color for the

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.390
virtual quantity that we're
using basically as a mechanism

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.720
to solve for this stress.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.440
Of course, on the right-hand
side, we identified we have

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.260
the external virtual work.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.110
And in here, this script R here,
denotes contributions

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.790
from the surface forces, body
forces that are being applied

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.710
externally to the body.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.500
This is really the basic
equation that we want to

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.210
operate on, and that we want to
work with to solve for the

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.660
unknown Cauchy stresses at
time t plus delta t.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.450
Now we recall, of course, that
we are here integrating over a

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.050
volume at time t plus delta t,
and that volume is unknown.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.450
Because it is unknown, we cannot
very easily deal with

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.300
this stress measure, and we
have, therefore, introduced a

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.610
new stress measure.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.740
A stress measure that we call
the second Piola-Kirchhoff

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.710
stress tensor.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.670
We introduce this one here.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.320
Notice this is a stress at time
t plus delta t, referred

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.660
to the original configuration,
0, of the body.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.150
The capital S, and we have ij
as the components of that

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.520
stress tensor.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.670
Now, this is a new stress tensor
that we know we can

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.210
deal very well with.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.600
And we have to also introduce
a new strain tensor.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.390
Why do we have to do so?

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.120
Well because using this stress
tensor, we have to use an

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.470
energy conjugate
strain measure.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.650
And this Green-Lagrange strain
tensor, the Green-Lagrange

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.190
strain tensor is energy
conjugate to the second

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.650
Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.030
Having introduced these two
quantities, and we looked at

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.470
the components, how they're
constructed, how they're

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.740
related, for example, in this
case, how this one is related

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.410
to the Cauchy stress.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.000
Having now introduced these
two quantities, we can

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.450
directly work basically with
this equation here.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.280
Well to do so, we have
decomposed the stress tensor

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.540
into a part that we know, and
into an unknown part.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.950
And that's an important point.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.280
We can decompose this stress
tensor into a stress that we

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.580
know, and that we don't know,
by simple addition

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.250
here on this side.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.880
Notice we simply add here
because we had a quantity that

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:53.040
is referred to the volume at
time 0, to another quantity

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.520
that is referred to the
volume at time 0.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.930
In other words, the reference
configurations for both of

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.470
these are the same, and that's
why we can have a simple

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.120
addition sign here.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.930
Please keep in mind that this
quantity is known in our

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.550
incremental solution.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.280
Because we, of course, assume
that we have solved for the

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.630
configuration of the body
up to a time t.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.810
This one is unknown, and this is
the reason why I used here

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.550
black color to show that this
is an unknown quantity and

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.210
distinguish it from the
one that is known.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.950
We proceed in the same
way with the

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.700
Green-Lagrange strain tensor.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.010
Here we have the equations.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.320
The Green-Lagrange strain tensor
at time t plus delta t

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.170
is decomposed into a quantity
that we know,

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.680
plus an unknown quantity.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.760
Once again, in black.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.110
So these are the two quantities
that we really want

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.960
to solve for, the increment in
the second Piola-Kirchhoff

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.750
stress, and the increment in
the Green-Lagrange strain.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.260
Now we also discussed that
the increment in the

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.050
Green-Lagrange strain can
actually be decomposed into

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.000
two quantities.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.300
One that is linear in the
particle incremental

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.620
displacements ui, and one that
is nonlinear in the particle

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.770
incremental displacements ui.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.230
Please read it as follows.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.600
Linear in ui, nonlinear in ui.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.180
Of course, remember that we have
so far only spoken about

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.970
the continuum mechanics.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.570
In other words, we have not
really, at this point, said

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.380
anything about the finite
element discretization.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.100
We also referred, however, in an
earlier lecture to the fact

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.800
that if we do interpolate in
finite element analysis, then

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.230
using continuum elements for
the analysis of solids and

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:47.650
structures, the incremental
nodal point variables are

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.710
linearly related to these
incremental particle

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:51.760
displacements.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.440
And for that reason, this is a
true linear strain increment,

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.910
and that is a true nonlinear
strain increment.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.110
On the other hand, if we use
structural elements that also

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:08.920
include or use nodal point
rotations, then the particle

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:14.360
displacements, these ui's, are
linearly related to the

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.520
incremental nodal point
displacements, but nonlinearly

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.670
related to the incremental
nodal point rotations.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:24.820
And in that case, this is here
still the true linear

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.260
increment of the Green-Lagrange

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.790
strain for the particle.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.750
But this one here is not
containing all the nonlinear

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:37.480
strain incremental parts
for the particle.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.910
There has to be a little bit--

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:42.520
there has to be some amendment
here, some addition here.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.260
And we briefly talked about the
effect of neglecting this

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.870
addition as well.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.940
Well the point now is that we
want to use, of course, these

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:57.110
two quantities to substitute
these into the equation of the

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.900
principle of virtual work, and
we then arrive directly at

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.250
this relationship here.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:04.480
Now what do we see here?

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.290
We see an integral over the
original volume of the second

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.290
Piola-Kirchhoff stress referred
to the original

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:15.740
configuration, and it's a real
stress, the one that we want

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:20.420
to solve for, and that's why I
use the color green again.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:25.440
This here is a virtual strain,
Green-Lagrange strain.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.230
It's a variation on this
Green-Lagrange strain here.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:33.770
And this product is integrated
over the original volume,

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.049
which is, of course, the
volume that we know.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:38.190
And this is the reason
why we can so well

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:41.330
deal with this integral.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.280
On the right-hand side, we have
made no modification.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.840
We still have simply the
external virtual work.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:53.950
Now, please realize that this
equation here is totally

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.720
equivalent to the equation that
we discussed earlier.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.180
This equation here.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.150
Here we are talking about
Cauchy stresses, an

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:06.190
infinitesimal virtual strain
integrated over a volume of

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:09.520
time t plus delta t
that is unknown.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:14.550
This equation has simply been
re-cast into a new form using

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.190
continuum mechanics.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:20.350
No finite elements really, just
continuum mechanics, into

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:23.000
this form here.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.640
And now we have a form that we
can work very well with.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.070
We substitute into this equation
and we linearize, and

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.510
we did that in the
earlier lecture.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.950
The result of that substitution
and linearization

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.120
is given right here.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.800
Now notice that in each of these
integrals, of course, we

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.160
are integrating over a
volume that is known,

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.160
the original volume.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.700
Notice that in the first
integral here, we involve,

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.550
well a material tensor.

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.750
That has to be defined, it
depends on the material that

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:59.460
you're looking at, that
you want to analyze.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.890
This is here the increment in
the Green-Lagrange strain, the

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:04.550
linear part only.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:10.760
Here is a variation on this
linear increment in green--

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.400
sorry, it's in red, of course.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.420
This one was green.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:14.680
This one is in red.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.690
And this is, of course,
a virtual quantity.

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:18.540
This is the virtual quantity.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.870
Notice that here we are
talking about a

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.380
stress that we know.

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.640
We're incrementally
decomposing.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.130
Remember?

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:30.260
We're adding to the quantities
at time t, the increment.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.160
The quantities at time
t are known.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.630
So this one is known.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:39.880
This one here is a variation on
the nonlinear increment of

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.050
the Green-Lagrange strain,
total increment.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.260
Well, in red again.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.890
And on the right-hand side we
have the external virtual

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:51.410
work, which of course, is
assumed to be given.

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.690
Do you still remember that we
are talking about deformation

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:56.020
independent loading.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:59.850
So we can calculate this
piece here directly.

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:05.330
And here we have also the stress
that is known, the

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:11.100
stress at time t, and the
virtual strain, linear strain.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:16.270
This is what we arrived at
in our earlier lecture.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:19.210
Of course, there was a
linearization involved, and we

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:21.200
know there would be errors
if we simply

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.880
operate on this equation.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.270
We don't want to have these
errors in the actual finite

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:26.510
element solution.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:29.520
And we realize that it
is good to iterate.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.720
So we also looked in the earlier
lecture how we would

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.290
iterate typically.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.400
And we developed an equation
where there was something on

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.690
the left-hand side, which I
simply denote here by dots.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:46.120
There were quite some
complicated expressions.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.150
You may want to look
them up again.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:51.150
But I just denote them by dots
because what is really

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.340
important, and that I pointed
out also earlier, is what is

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.630
on the right-hand side.

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:57.490
And what do we see on
the right-hand side?

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:02.200
On the right-hand side we see
the external virtual work, and

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.860
we are subtracting from
it this integral.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.920
Let's look at this integral
once more.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.250
We have here the second
Piola-Kirchhoff stress at time

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:12.650
t plus delta t.

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:16.060
Of course, always refer to the
original configuration.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:20.530
Corresponding to iteration
k minus 1.

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.810
The iteration here
written in black.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:27.840
We are operating on the
Green-Lagrange strain at time

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.710
t plus delta t.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.230
Refer to the original
configuration in

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:34.190
iteration k minus 1.

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:38.910
Actually, calculated at the end
of iteration k minus 1 is

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.160
better to say.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.850
And this product here is
integrated over the original

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:44.920
volume once more.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.870
k runs from 1, 2, 3, onwards.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:52.510
Well notice that when k is equal
to 1 we have a 0 here,

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:57.050
and we have to ask ourselves
what is this quantity then?

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:00.170
Well if there's a 0 right here,
then we're looking here

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.400
at t 0 Sij.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.640
The stress, the second
Piola-Kirchhoff stress

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.290
corresponding to the
configuration at time t.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:12.160
And if we put a 0 here, we
would have also here, the

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.870
initial condition being the
Green-Lagrange strain at time

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:19.370
t, of course, referred
to configuration 0.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:22.120
So we have the write initial
conditions here, and therefore

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.500
we can proceed with
the iteration.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.520
We discussed that in the
earlier lecture.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:30.680
The important point now is
that once this iteration

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:35.170
converges, we have to use, of
course, schemes, solution

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.920
procedures that makes the
iteration converge.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.920
We will talk about that
in later lecture.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.490
But once we have obtained
convergence, and let's assume

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:48.020
we have converged, then this R,
the script R, the external

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:51.670
virtual work, is equal
to this integral.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:53.450
That's how we define
convergence.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:57.720
And this means then that the
external virtual work is now

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.420
equal to the internal
virtual work.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:01.560
What does this mean?

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:07.460
It means in essence, that this
right-hand side is 0, which

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:11.310
means-- and now I like to go
back to our earlier equation--

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:15.650
that this equation here is
satisfied because notice that

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:18.980
if you look at this equation
and you take this left-hand

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:21.560
side and bring it to the
right-hand side with a minus

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.190
in front, then you have
exactly what we

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:26.450
just looked at earlier.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:30.640
In other words, our iteration
is performed really on an

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:35.060
expression that is nothing else
than this R, this script

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:40.230
R, minus this one on the
right-hand side.

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:42.840
There's a minus sign here and
you take this and bring it

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.060
right there.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.040
That's what we just looked at.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.430
Of course, we also remember now
that this expression now

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:53.570
is really totally equivalent
to what we started with.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:57.170
Namely, this expression
right here.

00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.860
And this is, of course, what
we really want a solve.

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.170
We mentioned earlier that
we introduced the second

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.830
Piola-Kirchhoff stress, and that
we would like to get a

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:08.210
physical understanding possibly
of that stress.

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:11.930
And I mentioned that that is
very difficult to obtain.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.640
In the computer program, we
just work with that stress

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:19.260
measure in order to be able to
solve the equation, to operate

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.350
well on the principle
of virtual work.

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:24.730
What we really want to do, of
course, is to solve this

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.050
equation right here.

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:28.240
This is the equation.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:32.050
That is the physical stress
that we want to solve for.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:35.860
Well since this equation is
totally equivalent to that

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:41.810
equation, and looking at this
equation, if we take this

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:45.010
left-hand side, bring it to
the right-hand side--

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:46.950
of course, there's a minus
appearing there--

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:53.870
we do obtain what we see right
here at convergence of course.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:58.630
We operate properly on the
principle of virtual work.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:02.380
So this really closes, so to
say, the loop, and I hope it

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.730
helps you to have this overview
in understanding of

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:07.560
what I discussed earlier
with you.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.850
But let's go one step further.

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:15.610
In the finite element
discretization, we obtain from

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:17.880
this equation here--

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.910
I haven't listed what is on the
left-hand side, you can

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:22.770
look it up--

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:27.330
we obtain directly this
equation here.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:30.860
Of course, there's quite a
number of steps that we still

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:31.850
have to discuss.

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:35.570
How we obtain this matrix,
we call this the tangent

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.430
stiffness matrix.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:41.130
We have to discuss how we
calculate this vector here,

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.480
this vector here.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:46.200
In fact, the way we actually
introduced it, since it's a

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.800
total Lagrangian formulation, I
should really put here a 0.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.330
We have to discuss how we can
calculate this vector for

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.165
different elements, et cetera,
and there is a

00:17:01.165 --> 00:17:02.490
lot still to be learned.

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:07.400
But remember that up to here, we
only talked about continuum

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:11.020
mechanics, and this is where
the finite element

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.400
discretization starts.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.400
And these are then the basic
equations that are being

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.170
arrived at.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:21.819
At convergence, once again, here
we iterate, of course.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:24.520
Notice that I'm using now
the superscript i.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.250
Of course, this superscript is
a dummy, it could be k, it

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:29.340
could be j, it doesn't matter.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:32.220
We frequently use i.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:36.140
I didn't want to use up here i
because we have an i already

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:39.990
as a subscript, that's
why I'm using k here.

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:45.980
But at convergence in this
iteration where we calculate

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:51.120
always new displacements, add
them to the previously

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.850
calculated displacements, at
convergence the right-hand

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:59.320
side will be 0, or close
to 0, of course.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:04.830
Well this means that we arrive
at this equation right here.

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:08.690
Because when the right-hand side
is 0, we satisfy that t

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:12.550
plus delta t R is equal to t
plus delta t F And if you

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:18.180
like, here also, we may want
to introduce this little 0,

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.890
signifying that we have used
the total Lagrangian

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:25.530
formulation to calculate
that F.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:30.140
Now it is important to realize
what we have achieved in the

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.590
finite element solution.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:37.700
We satisfy compatibility in the
finite element solution if

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.850
we use compatible
finite elements.

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:43.690
That is buried in here.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:47.330
We use compatible finite
elements to calculate this F,

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:50.260
therefore we satisfy
compatibility.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:54.610
We satisfy the stress strain law
properly if we calculate

00:18:54.610 --> 00:19:01.810
this F here accurately and
properly through the stress

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:02.850
strain law.

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:05.290
Of course, there is much
to be discussed still.

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:09.390
But let's assume we do that
properly and then we satisfy

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:11.040
the stress strain law.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:16.430
Equilibrium we also satisfy,
but at the nodal points.

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:20.180
We talked about the fact, in an
earlier lecture, that in a

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.910
finite element analysis,
displacement based finite

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:26.040
element analysis, we always
satisfy equilibrium at the

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:26.940
nodal point.

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.140
Of course, assuming that the
elements have been properly

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.400
formulated.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:35.650
We would only satisfy local
equilibrium if the mesh is

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:36.440
fine enough.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.940
And we talked earlier, in an
earlier lecture, about how we

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.460
can measure whether local
equilibrium is well enough

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:46.980
satisfied using stress jumps,
using pressure band plots.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:50.660
We talked about that and I
gave you some examples.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.920
The important point though is to
recognize that if we use a

00:19:53.920 --> 00:20:02.190
fine enough mesh, then
equilibrium is satisfied, and

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.660
the stress strain law would be
satisfied if we calculated

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.090
stresses properly from
the given strains.

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:11.070
And compatibility is satisfied
if we use a compatible finite

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:11.830
element mesh.

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:14.870
In other words, the three basic
important requirements

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:19.640
of mechanics are fulfilled when
we are satisfying this

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.410
relationship right here.

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:25.750
This basically then rounds
up what we have been

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.770
discussing so far.

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:32.870
And we use the total Lagrangian
formulation in this

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:34.800
discussion.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.050
I now like to go over to discuss
this, use the updated

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.100
Lagrangian formulation.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:45.480
The interesting point here is
that we use a stress measure

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.885
that is referred to the original
configuration, and so

00:20:48.885 --> 00:20:51.930
a strain measure that is
referred to the original

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:53.180
configuration.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:58.730
I mentioned earlier already that
we want to deal with a

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:00.750
certain configuration
that is known.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:04.030
The reason, of course, being
that we want to incrementally

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:10.980
decompose this stress into a
quantity that we know, plus a

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.930
quantity that we don't know.

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:17.070
And that incremental
decomposition should involve

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:21.010
stress measures that are
referred to a configuration

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:22.250
that is known.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.210
The same for the strains.

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:28.320
Well since we have calculated
all the configurations from

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:33.830
time 0 to time t already, a
natural question to ask is why

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:38.010
don't you use a configuration
other than 0, say, the

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:42.740
configuration at time delta
t to delta t, or t.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:47.240
well in the updated Lagrangian
formulation, we, indeed, use

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:51.320
the configuration at time t as
a reference configuration.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:55.670
And so we deal then with the
second Piola-Kirchhoff stress

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:58.140
referred to the configuration
at time t.

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:09.170
This is the stress that
we're dealing with.

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:13.430
Notice t plus delta t here,
still the stress at time t

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:17.030
plus delta t, but now the stress
is referred to the

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:19.260
configuration at time t.

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.910
Similarly, we also deal
with a strain.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:32.940
The Green-Lagrange strain at
time t plus delta t, but

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:37.760
referred to configuration
at time t.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.900
We could, of course,
ask, well why use a

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.310
configuration at time t?

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:44.825
Why not use some configuration
in between?

00:22:44.825 --> 00:22:47.340
The answer is, and I gave it to
you already in an earlier

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:51.710
lecture, the answer is that
you are losing all of the

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:56.750
advantages of the total
Lagrangian formulation, and

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.490
you're losing the advantages
of the updated Lagrangian

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:00.680
formulation.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.500
You are left only with
the disadvantages.

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:06.930
So there's very little point
really in trying to solve the

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:10.752
principle of virtual work using
another configuration

00:23:10.752 --> 00:23:14.950
other than 0 or t.

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:17.680
Let us now look at the details
of the updated Lagrangian

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:18.430
formulation.

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:23.470
And here I have now prepared
some view graphs that show all

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:26.450
the equations that we're
operating on.

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:30.660
The principle of virtual work,
once again, is given right on

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:31.980
this first view graph.

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:36.480
We always start with the basic
principle of virtual work, and

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.050
that is written here.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:41.873
This is, once again, the Cauchy
stress, the stress that

00:23:41.873 --> 00:23:45.110
we are actually interested
in solving for.

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:49.010
This is the infinitesimal
virtual strain.

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:52.790
Internal virtual work is equal
to external virtual work.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:57.460
Now, with the stress measure
that I just mentioned to you,

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:02.370
and the corresponding strain
measure, substituted for these

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:06.490
stress and strain measures, we
obtain directly this equation.

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:09.260
Notice that here on the
left-hand side, we have an

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:14.240
integral that is exactly equal
to this integral here.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.010
And that we are not
talking here about

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:17.780
finite elements yet.

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:21.660
It's all continuum mechanics
at this point.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:25.680
The second Piola-Kirchhoff
stress here refer to time t

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.775
is, of course, defined as the
same way as the second

00:24:28.775 --> 00:24:32.560
Piola-Kirchhoff stress
as before when it was

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:33.900
referred to time 0.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:38.610
But what we have to do now is
introduce this t whenever we

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:44.360
use the 0 before in the equation
linking up the Cauchy

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.880
stress with the second
Piola-Kirchhoff stress.

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:52.610
We already then know the
solution at time t.

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:56.380
So we know basically these
quantities here.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.910
And we can, therefore, now
decompose directly the

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:06.130
stresses into a stress that
we know, and an increment.

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:09.350
Similarly, we do for
the strains.

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:14.580
It's now interesting to observe
that this stress here

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:17.150
is nothing else than
the Cauchy stress.

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:19.730
If you were to plug in to the
formula that I gave you

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:24.280
earlier, which once again,
expresses the second

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:27.080
Piola-Kirchhoff stress in terms
of the Cauchy stress,

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:30.555
you would simply see that this
quantity is nothing else than

00:25:30.555 --> 00:25:31.730
the Cauchy stress.

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:34.270
And therefore, we have
that now here.

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:39.130
And of course, we carry this
part in that equation here.

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:45.840
The Green-Lagrange strain, if
written out, one directly

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:50.120
identifies that this part here
is 0, because we are using

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:53.690
only the increments in
displacements from time t to

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:56.310
time t plus delta t.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:26:02.020
And we are left with this part
here, which is unknown.

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.310
Let's look at the Green-Lagrange
strain here.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:07.830
Notice t plus delta
t, t epsilon ij is

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:09.910
written as shown here.

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:16.600
Where I should point out that
we are looking here at the

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:21.250
displacements from time t
to time t plus delta t.

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:26.180
In other words, if I want to
write this out here, I'm doing

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.750
it as follows.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:32.140
I'm saying that it's a partial
of the displacements, t plus

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:42.720
delta t, ui minus tui
with respect to txj.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.680
Notice that here, we are
subtracting from the

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.090
displacement at time
t plus delta t, the

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:51.440
displacements tui.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.490
So it's the incremental
displacements that we're

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:55.460
dealing with.

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:58.420
And we're differentiating with
respect to the coordinate at

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:02.760
the time t.

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:07.700
Similarly, of course, we define
these expressions here,

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:11.930
and those expressions, and
those expressions.

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:16.470
Notice, just to emphasize this
point, that this here is

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:20.600
nothing else than ui.

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:25.010
And if we now substitute from
here into there, we directly

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:29.650
recognize that this term is, in
fact, the same as that one,

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:33.090
which I expressed already on
the earlier view graph.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:37.570
Notice, linear part here,
nonlinear part there.

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:44.140
This part here, of course,
I like to just write out

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:44.950
for you once more.

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:49.590
It's nothing else than partial
ui with respect to txj.

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:57.540
Notice, here we have a product
incremental displacement, and

00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:00.260
that's why it is, of
course, nonlinear.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:02.980
It is interesting to compare
this expression for the

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.400
Green-Lagrange strain, for the
incremental Green-Lagrange

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.060
strain, to the incremental
Green-Lagrange strain of the

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.250
total Lagrangian formulation.

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:14.600
And if you do so, you'll find
that the major difference is

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.100
that in the total Lagrangian
formulation you have an

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.050
initial displacement effect.

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:22.720
Here, we do not have an initial
displacement effect.

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:26.640
And in fact, that is one of the
advantages of the updated

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.890
Lagrangian formulation.

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:35.230
We can now define, just as
in the total Lagrangian

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:38.660
formulation, a linear strain
increment, and a nonlinear

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:39.410
strain increment.

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:43.380
Of course, linear in the
incremental displacement of

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:44.420
the particles.

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:48.280
Nonlinear in the incremental
displacement of the particles.

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:50.580
And this means that
directly we obtain

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.180
this expression here.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:56.260
And the variation on here,
of course, on this total

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:58.660
Green-Lagrange strain increment
is simply given by

00:28:58.660 --> 00:28:59.910
these two additions.

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:07.270
The equation of the principle
of virtual work now becomes

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:13.180
substituting from what I just
discussed with you, directly

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:14.540
this equation.

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:18.220
Notice we have here now, the
external virtual work, just as

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:23.490
before, and we have here the
internal virtual work

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:27.640
corresponding to the
stresses at time t.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.950
And these are actually
the Cauchy

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:31.520
stresses, the real stresses.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.540
This is here again our
out of balance

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:36.380
virtual work, so to say.

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:41.980
On the left-hand side, we have
one part that includes an

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.490
increment in the stress.

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:47.870
Refer to time t now, because
the t configuration is our

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:50.890
reference configuration.

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:55.600
And we are multiplying it by
the variation on the total

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.200
Green-Lagrange strain
increment--

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.340
that's one integral--

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:01.280
over the volume at time t.

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:06.290
And here we have the Cauchy
stress times the variation on

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:08.140
the nonlinear part of the

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:09.390
Green-Lagrange strain increment.

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:15.490
Given a variation in
displacement data ui, of

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:19.750
course, we can calculate
the right-hand side.

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:23.560
But we recognize that on the
left-hand side, we have

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.420
unknown displacement increments
and there would be

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:30.390
nonlinearities occurring
on the left-hand side.

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:34.430
Remember, that so far no
approximations have been made.

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:37.290
This is a statement that is
valid for any amount of

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:40.160
deformation, any amount
of displacements,

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.410
rotations, and strains.

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:49.110
Just as in the total Lagrangian
formulation, the

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:51.790
equation of the principle of
virtual work in the updated

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:54.240
Lagrangian formulation is, of
course, a very complicated

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:57.280
equation and highly nonlinear
in the incremental

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.340
displacement.

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:01.770
And we somehow have
to linearize.

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:05.790
Because we want to obtain a
finite element solution, we

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:10.090
linearize first the principle of
virtual work equation, and

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:14.580
then we are ready to obtain an
equation as shown here, which

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:18.530
is very much like the equation
which we are operating on

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:20.550
using the total Lagrangian
formulation.

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:23.960
Notice, because we're dealing
with the updated Lagrangian

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:30.410
formulation, we now have a t
here, and we have a t there,

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:33.400
meaning the reference
configuration is the time t

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:38.010
configuration, and
here as well.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:42.290
We begin to linearize the terms
just as we have done it

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:44.940
earlier in the total Lagrangian
formulation.

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:48.060
And we recognize that
this term here is

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:50.970
already linear in ui.

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:54.140
That is quite simply seen
because the stress does not

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:57.886
contain ui, it's a
known quantity.

00:31:57.886 --> 00:32:04.480
The variation on this part here
gives us this expression.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:09.200
And we recognize that this is
linear in ui because here we

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.290
have the unknown ui appearing.

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:14.790
This is going to be a constant
for a given variation in

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:15.860
displacement.

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:18.260
And this is here also
linear and ui.

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.810
This is going to be a constant
for a given variation in

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:21.770
displacement.

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:25.460
And so we have a linear
part here in ui.

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:27.900
No linearization
required here.

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.440
Let us now look at
the next term.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.910
Here we have the increment in
the second Piola-Kirchhoff

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:35.680
stress times the variation
on the increment in the

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.160
Green-Lagrange strain
integrated over the

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.000
volume at time t.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.930
We recognize that tSij is a
nonlinear function in general

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:47.110
of the increment in the
Green-Lagrange strain.

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:49.000
If we take the variation
on that increment and

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.440
Green-Lagrange strain, we obtain
these two terms, and we

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:57.140
recognize that this is also
a linear function of ui.

00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:00.350
Therefore, in this product, we
have to neglect now all higher

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:02.830
order terms in ui.

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:06.690
First we recognize now that
tSij can be written as a

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:10.660
Taylor series expansion,
as shown here.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:14.610
Notice that tSij is equal to
one first term plus higher

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:15.610
order terms.

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:17.980
These higher order
terms we neglect.

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:21.340
If you look at this term here,
we recognize that we can

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:26.440
substitute for this term,
as shown here.

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.830
And this one here is, of course,
the constitutive

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:31.320
relation, the tangent
constitutive

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.580
relation for the material.

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:37.550
Recognizing that this one here
is quadratic in ui, we drop

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:40.760
that term and we get this
linearized result.

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:44.260
Notice that here we have a
constitutive tensor referred

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:46.240
to the configuration
at time t.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:49.490
In the total Lagrangian
formulation we had here a 0

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:51.240
instead of a t.

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:55.820
Well if we now look at the
product that we wanted to

00:33:55.820 --> 00:34:00.380
linearize again, we have this
product on the left-hand side,

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:03.780
which is now approximately
equal to this term here.

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:08.310
This already we derived as a
linearization to that term.

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:12.500
Here we are substituting
for that term here.

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:17.199
Notice that if we multiply out,
we directly obtain this

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:18.960
relationship here.

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:22.210
This one here does not
contain ui of course.

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:25.199
And this one here
is linear in ui.

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:29.020
This means that since this one
also is linear in ui, that we

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:31.600
have here a quadratic
term in ui.

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:35.280
Notice this term now, totally
linear, this one quadratic, we

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:39.870
drop that one, and we are left
with the linearized result,

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:43.050
the result that we
wanted to obtain.

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:46.260
The final linearized equation
is then given

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:47.420
on this view graph.

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:50.210
Notice we have here the
constitutive relation times

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:53.830
the linear strain increment in
the total Green-Lagrange

00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:57.360
strain increment, the
variation on it.

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.370
And of course, this one again
integrated over the

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:01.520
volume at time t.

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.530
Here we have a term
where there was no

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:07.450
linearization necessary.

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:09.830
And here we have a term
also there was no

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:11.210
linearization necessary.

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:15.870
These two terms were obtained
already earlier.

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:20.430
These here, this term be
obtained by linearization.

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:24.330
Notice that when we now use
finite element interpolations,

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:30.020
we will express this total term
here via this term here

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:37.330
where we now have a tangent
finite element matrix, which

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:42.870
is denoted by the t up there
at time t referred to the

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:45.180
configuration at time t.

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:48.820
This t here refers to the
configuration at time t.

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:51.460
There's an increment in the
displacement that we want to

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:54.000
solve for, the real displacement
increment.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.140
And this is here, the virtual
displacement vector.

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:02.580
The right-hand side gives us a
virtual displacement vector,

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:06.830
of course, transposed times this
vector, and here we have

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:09.670
the externally applied loads
coming from the external

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:14.940
virtual work minus the nodal
point force vector

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:19.060
corresponding to the internal
element stresses.

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:23.180
That is this term here results
into this nodal point force

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:26.820
vector corresponding to the
internal element stresses.

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:31.890
So here we have the continuum
mechanics relation in black,

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:36.400
linearized from the general
principle of virtual work, and

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:40.130
here we have the finite element
expression of that.

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:42.590
Of course, the actual finite
element solution is then

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:46.990
obtained by actually setting
this vector here equal to the

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:51.830
identity matrix so that we are
left with K times delta U is

00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:54.470
equal to t plus delta
tR minus tF.

00:36:57.930 --> 00:37:01.540
An important point in this
development is to recognize

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:05.400
that this term here is, of
course, the virtual work due

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.980
to the element internal
stresses at time t.

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:13.460
And we interpret this part here
as the out of balance

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:16.560
virtual work just in the same
way as we have been doing it

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:17.825
in the total Lagrangian
formulation.

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:24.440
Let's look now at the total
solution using the updated

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:26.800
Lagrangian formulation.

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:30.000
The displacement iteration is
much the same way as in the

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.970
total Lagrangian formulation.

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:37.530
We take the old value
corresponding to k minus 1

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:40.490
iteration, and add an increment
that we are solving

00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:44.650
for to obtain a new estimate
on the displacements.

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:46.930
k being the iteration counter.

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:49.640
Notice, of course, in this
iteration, we have to have

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:52.330
initial conditions, and these
initial conditions are given

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:53.060
right here.

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:57.800
In other words, when k is equal
to 1, we would have here

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:03.690
t plus delta t ui 0, and
therefore we need this value,

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:08.110
and that value is given right
here as t plus delta tui, 0

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:10.360
equal to tui.

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.970
In other words, the displacement
at the

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:15.460
configuration t.

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:19.020
If you look now at the total
continuum mechanics equations

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:24.120
that we are operating on, I
should say one continuum

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.770
mechanics equation really,
which, of course, gives us

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:29.870
then in the finite element
discretization, the set of

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:34.770
simultaneous equations that
we will be working with.

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:38.120
This continuum mechanics
equation looks as follows.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:41.550
On the left-hand side we have
the tangent constitutive

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:47.770
relationship times an increment
in real strains that

00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:50.990
we want to solve for
in iteration k.

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:54.030
These are the virtual strains.

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:57.650
We integrate that product over
the volume at time t.

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:00.590
That, of course, holds for any
one of these integrals.

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:03.500
And here we have now the actual
stresses, the real

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:06.880
stresses that we know already,
which correspond to the

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:10.020
configuration at time t.

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:15.150
Then a variation on the
incremental Green-Lagrange

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:19.610
strain, but I should add its
only the nonlinear increment

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:24.750
in the Green-Lagrange strain
corresponding to iteration k.

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:29.290
Once again, integrated over
the volume at time t.

00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:33.520
And on the right-hand side, we
have the external virtual work

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.290
and this expression.

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:37.770
Let's look at this expression
carefully.

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:41.845
Here we have an integral over
the volume at time t plus

00:39:41.845 --> 00:39:44.930
delta t in the iteration
k minus 1.

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:48.490
Therefore, we are updating that
volume as we go along in

00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:50.120
the iteration.

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.730
Notice that here we have the
stresses corresponding to

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:55.500
iteration k minus 1.

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:58.040
We are updating these stresses,
of course, also in

00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.280
the iteration.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:02.580
Here we have the virtual strains
corresponding to

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:07.870
iteration at the end of
iteration k minus 1.

00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:09.600
We are updating this as well.

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:13.350
And this product here, once
again, is integrated over the

00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:17.510
volume at time t plus delta t
corresponding to the end of

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:22.060
iteration k minus 1 or the
beginning of iteration k.

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:27.290
Well it's important to realize
that when this right-hand side

00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:34.140
is 0, we have fulfilled, or we
have basically solved, the

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:37.070
equation of the principle of
virtual work, because the

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:42.530
external virtual work is equal
to the internal virtual work.

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:44.790
And then, of course, we have
obtained the solution.

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:49.290
So we iterate with k equals 1,
2, 3, and so on, until the

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:54.370
right-hand side is 0, and then
we are satisfying that the

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:59.880
external virtual work is equal
to the internal virtual work.

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:05.180
When we discretize this
continuum mechanics equation

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:10.410
via finite elements, we obtain
this equation here.

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:14.590
ttK, once again, the tangent
stiffness matrix.

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:17.590
Here, the increment in the
nodal point displacements

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:19.420
corresponding to iteration k.

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:21.930
On the right-hand side
the R vector of

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:23.730
externally applied loads.

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:27.370
And here, the nodal point force
vector corresponding to

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:31.510
the internal element stresses
at time t plus delta t in

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:34.050
iteration k minus 1.

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:36.080
At the end of iteration
k minus 1 is

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.670
more precisely said.

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:40.810
Notice that we are having a t
plus delta t down here because

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:42.440
we are always updating
the actual

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.920
configuration of reference.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.160
Here we are updating the
configuration of reference

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:51.470
because we are working with the
Cauchy stresses at time t

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:55.390
plus delta t, and in iteration
at the end of

00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:57.540
iteration k minus 1.

00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:01.010
Of course, this vector is
calculated from the

00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:06.080
displacement at time
t plus delta t, and

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:07.540
iteration k minus 1.

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:10.160
These, of course, are known.

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:14.710
This is a known quantity,
whereas the unknown quantity

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:16.840
are the increments in
the displacements.

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.020
These we want to calculate.

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:23.560
We iterate until, with k equals
1, 2, 3, and so on,

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:26.130
until the right-hand
side is 0.

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:30.380
Of course, this is nothing else
than an expression of, in

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:33.960
finite element analysis, of the
principle of virtual work

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.540
where we had also the right-hand
side, this was the

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:39.620
external virtual work, and this
was the internal virtual

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:44.850
work corresponding to the
current element stresses.

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:50.738
Notice that the displacements
that we are talking about here

00:42:50.738 --> 00:42:56.500
are obtained by adding all the
incremental displacement that

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.815
we're dealing with here.

00:42:58.815 --> 00:43:02.840
We are taking these and add them
all up as expressed in

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:08.660
this summation sign here. j goes
from 1 to k to get, and

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:11.800
we take that sum, of course,
and add it to tU, the

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:15.820
displacement corresponding to
configuration time t, to get

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:17.310
the displacements

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:21.750
corresponding to the last iteration.

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:24.878
The total iterative process is
summarized on this view graph.

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:31.060
We start with a given tU, the
displacement at time t are

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:35.340
given, and the external loads
are also given corresponding

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:37.260
to time t plus delta t.

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:41.470
We compute the tangent stiffness
matrix corresponding

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:45.770
to time t, and the nodal point
force vector corresponding to

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:50.640
the internal element
stresses at time t.

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:54.440
This nodal point force vector
provides initial conditions

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:57.510
for this vector, because that is
the vector which will enter

00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:59.550
actually into the iteration.

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:01.600
This displacement vector
provides the initial

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.890
conditions for that vector.

00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:07.900
We set the iteration counter
k equal to 1.

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:13.690
We go in here, and notice now we
are solving this equation,

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:16.680
which we just discussed.

00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:20.410
When k is equal to 1, of course,
we have here F0, and

00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:24.520
that F0 is nothing else
than that vector here.

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:28.340
Because that's how we
initialized it.

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:30.030
So we can calculate
this incremental

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:31.880
displacement vector.

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.580
We add that increment and
displacement vector to the

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:36.270
displacement which
we had already.

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:40.160
When k is equal to 1, of course,
this vector here is

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:45.525
nothing else than that vector,
which we are given already.

00:44:45.525 --> 00:44:48.130
We add on and get a new
estimate for the

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:49.650
displacements.

00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:51.670
We then check for convergence.

00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:54.330
This means we are checking
whether equilibrium is

00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:57.280
satisfied sufficiently, meaning
whether the right-hand

00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:04.080
side is 0 with this new
displacement estimate.

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:10.010
If we have not converged, we go
into the next calculation

00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:14.150
of the force vector, the nodal
point force vector

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:17.440
corresponding to the current
internal element stresses.

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:25.060
And notice that, of course, now
this force vector, these

00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:29.520
elements stresses that go in
here, are computed based on

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:33.560
the displacement at time t plus
delta t at the end of

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:35.400
iteration k.

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:38.700
In other words, these are the
displacements that we have

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:42.380
just been calculating
right there.

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:45.355
We increase the iteration
counter, and keep

00:45:45.355 --> 00:45:47.420
on looping as before.

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:52.750
So this is the loop that we go
through in the iteration until

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:56.760
we converge, until
we converge.

00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:02.370
If you compare this view graph
with the view graph that we

00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:05.220
discussed in the total
Lagrangian formulation, you

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:07.350
will find a great similarity.

00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:13.260
You will find that basically all
of these quantities have

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:15.760
already been discussed in the
total Lagrangian formulation,

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:18.440
except that in the total
Lagrangian formulation we

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:25.350
always carry it down here and
down there as 0 instead of t,

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:28.280
t plus delta t here.

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:29.830
We carry it as 0.

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:33.510
Well because the reference
configuration was the 0

00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:34.690
configuration.

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:36.370
Now the reference configuration
for the

00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:39.770
stiffness matrix is the
t configuration.

00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:43.010
The reference configuration for
the F vector is the t plus

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:48.700
delta t configuration after
iteration k minus 1.

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:52.970
So there's a great similarity
in the iteration process, in

00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:56.260
the finite element matrices
that we are setting up.

00:46:56.260 --> 00:47:01.345
And of course, we have to ask
ourselves what comparison is

00:47:01.345 --> 00:47:03.650
there between the T.L.
and U.L. formulation?

00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:06.960
Why would one want to use the
U.L. formulation if we have

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:09.680
the T.L. formulation,
for example.

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:14.130
Well in the T.L. formulation,
all the derivatives are

00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:17.710
defined with respect to the
original configuration.

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:22.000
In the U.L. formulation, they
are defined with respect to

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.030
the current configuration.

00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:27.330
And that will provide
differences, that does provide

00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:28.180
differences.

00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:32.510
For example, in the U.L.
formulation, we will have to

00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:37.280
calculate the derivatives
newly in each iteration,

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:41.040
because the configuration
is continuously updated.

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:43.940
We don't need to do it, of
course, for the k matrix if we

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:46.860
keep the k matrix constant
on the left-hand side.

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:49.660
But for the F vector on the
right-hand side, we will have

00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:53.795
to always calculate new
derivatives because the F

00:47:53.795 --> 00:47:57.200
vector involves the Cauchy
stresses times the

00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:01.620
infinitesimal virtual strains
referred to the current

00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:07.320
configuration, t plus delta t,
iteration k minus 1, which is

00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:08.180
being updated.

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:11.240
And so we would always calculate
new derivatives

00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:13.370
right there.

00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:15.270
There, of course, is an
expense involved.

00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:18.790
On the other hand, the U.L.
formulation does not have this

00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:21.600
initial displacement effect that
I mentioned earlier, so

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.460
there's an advantage.

00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:25.630
In the U.L. formulation,
we also directly

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:27.440
deal with Cauchy stresses.

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:29.430
These are, of course, the
physical stresses that we are

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:32.080
actually interested in, and that
we want to get printed

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.880
out from the computer program.

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:37.810
Hence, there's no transformation
necessary from

00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:39.700
some stress measure, and I'm
thinking of the second

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:41.690
Piola-Kirchhoff stress that we
use in the total Lagrangian

00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:44.850
formulation, to the Cauchy
stresses that we actually want

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:47.400
to obtain in the computer
program, and that we as

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:50.750
engineers want to get, of
course, printed out.

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:55.420
Well if we now look at one other
important point, one

00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:59.990
important point, regarding the
T.L. and U.L. formulation, we

00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:02.490
recognize that if we make
the assumption, the same

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:05.020
assumptions, in both of these
two formulations in the

00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:08.520
linearization, as we, of course,
have done, really, the

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:10.160
way I've presented it.

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:15.210
Then the U.L. and T.L.
formulation, provided the

00:49:15.210 --> 00:49:18.960
appropriate transformations
are made, certain

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:22.610
transformation rules are
followed for the stresses, the

00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:24.040
strains, and so on.

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:26.740
Those rules we will be talking
about further later on in

00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:27.830
later lectures.

00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:33.130
Then, indeed, exactly the same
stiffness matrix and force

00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:37.580
vector, F vector, vectors I
should say, are calculated.

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:42.040
In other words, provided we
follow certain transformation

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:48.000
rules, indeed, the same
stiffness matrices and force

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:53.340
vectors are calculated in both
of these formulations.

00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:56.230
Of course, the actual numerical
arithmetic required

00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:58.730
to obtain those matrices
and vectors

00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:00.020
are, of course, different.

00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:03.090
But the final result
is the same.

00:50:03.090 --> 00:50:05.900
We can demonstrate that in the
general case, as I will do

00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:09.720
later on in a lecture, and we
can also demonstrate that on

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:11.410
simple examples.

00:50:11.410 --> 00:50:14.020
In fact, we will look in one
lecture at the truss element

00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:17.850
where we can directly show
that the T.L. and U.L.

00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:21.020
formulation really give exactly
the same result for

00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:23.120
the k matrix, as well
as the F vector.

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:25.890
So there we have an example,
but as I mentioned, we can

00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:28.380
also show it in the general
case, and that we do

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:30.480
as well later on.

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:32.180
Thank you very much for
your attention.
