00:00:25.695 --> 00:00:26.570
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.995
Good afternoon, everyone, again.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.690
Today, our session is going
to be on motion perception

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.420
and pursuit eye movements.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.930
Now, I want to remind you that
to our next class next Monday

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.580
is going to be a
whirlwind review.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.560
And then the next
Wednesday we are

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.020
going to have the
midterm exam on what

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.270
we have covered so
far in the course.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.320
And as I've mentioned already
to you a couple of times,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.209
that is going to consist of
a series of multiple choice

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.130
questions in which
you have to circle

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.950
the appropriate choice
for each question.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.400
Then the following week, which
is going to be November 28,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.206
is when Chris--

00:01:18.206 --> 00:01:18.956
AUDIENCE: October.

00:01:18.956 --> 00:01:19.412
PROFESSOR: Huh?

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:19.870
AUDIENCE: October 28.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.190
PROFESSOR: Sorry, October what?

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.180
AUDIENCE: 28th.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.310
PROFESSOR: October 28.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.060
Yeah, October 28--
that's when Chris Brown

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.475
is going to start the second
half of the course on audition.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.270
So that is the general
plan at this point.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.980
And again, I'm going to send
around an attendance sheet.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.080
So just put your name on it and
send it around, please, for me.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.650
Thank you.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.400
All right, so I
think you're going

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.821
to find talking about motion
perception a lot of fun.

00:01:51.821 --> 00:01:53.070
I have several demonstrations.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.450
And it is certainly have
a very interesting topic.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.490
And I'm going to highlight that
by first of all telling you

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.960
what we are going to cover.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.860
And then we are going to talk
about the basic mechanisms

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.240
of direction selectivity
in the visual cortex.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.370
So first of all,
as I've said, we're

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.795
going to talk about the neurons
in the brain that code motion.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.710
I'm going to talk about it
mostly for in the cortex.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.310
But I would also say a few words
about direction selective cells

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.320
that you find in the retina
that we had mentioned before.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.920
All right, so we are going
to then discuss briefly

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.360
the possible
mechanisms that make

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.370
it feasible to process motion.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.570
And then we are
going to look at what

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.650
happens when you make various
brain lesions in determining

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.300
how well you can process depth.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.190
Then we're going to talk about
a very interesting topic, which

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.260
is structure for motion.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.740
And then further
pursuing that, we're

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.340
going to talk about
apparent motion.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.630
And then we are going to talk
about an interesting temporal

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.130
effect which is
called metacontrast.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.950
And then we are going to talk
about optokynetic nystagmus,

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.430
where we link the visual input
to the generation of pursuit

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.810
eye movements.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.360
Then that is accomplished by
the so-called accessory optic

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.240
system that I will
describe to you.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.350
And that is also the topic
that, if you remember,

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.300
you will be writing a paper on.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.400
Lastly then, we are
going to have a summary.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.620
OK, so let's look first
at the neural responses

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.955
to motion in the cortex.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.080
Now, one of the most
remarkable features

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.560
of the visual cortex and
extra cortical areas,

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.200
as I had already mentioned,
is that the majority

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.530
of cells in these areas
are direction selective,

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.830
meaning that they respond to one
particular direction of motion,

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.220
but not to the
opposite direction.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.890
Now, this is extremely evident
in the visual cortex, where

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.470
the so-called simple cells,
virtually all of them

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.070
are direction selective.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.940
So that's one of the
major transforms,

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.850
if you remember, of
the input that you

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.780
have from the lateral
geniculate nucleus that

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.560
goes to the cortex.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.470
That input is just from single
cells, on and off single cells,

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.330
midget and parasol cells that
have circular receptive fields

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.410
that centers around antagonism.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.630
And when they get
up to the cortex,

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.110
a transformation
takes place by virtue

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.900
of intracortical circuits
that turns these cells

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.060
into direction specific
ones and cells that

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.230
are orientation specific.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:08.990
So let's look at this first
by starting with a method

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.160
so that you'll understand
exactly how this is done.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.040
In this case, what
we are going to do

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.041
is we are going to
have a photo cell.

00:05:16.041 --> 00:05:17.540
Let's just look at
the top one here,

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.900
A. You're going to have a
photo cell that responds both

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.900
to a light edge and a dark edge.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.070
And so when this bar moves
across this photo cell,

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.236
it will activate it.

00:05:29.236 --> 00:05:30.610
And what they're
going to do-- we

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.486
are going to move it
across in one direction.

00:05:32.486 --> 00:05:34.318
And then we are going
to move it back across

00:05:34.318 --> 00:05:35.520
in the other direction.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.700
And this is shown here.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.570
This is a time scale.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.530
And it shows that when
this edge goes across,

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.530
it activates the photo
cell, gives it the beep.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.460
And then when the
trailing edge goes across,

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.360
it also does the same thing.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.120
So this is the
light edge response.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.790
This is the dark edge response.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.030
Now, when you're going
back the other way,

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.320
you're going to have,
again, the same arrangement.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.280
In the opposite direction,
the light edge responds first.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.630
And the dark edge
responds second.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.620
Now we are going to make
a change so that it mimics

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.885
the organization of simple
cells in the visual cortex.

00:06:09.885 --> 00:06:13.600
We're going to put
two photo cells, one

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.770
which responds to the light
edge and a dark one which

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.700
responds to the dark edge.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:26.840
So now when this bar goes across
and activates these two photo

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.640
cells, what happens is, because
they are not all centered

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.460
exactly in the middle,
it takes a longer time

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.840
to activate the two successive
[INAUDIBLE] when the bar goes

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.560
across this way and
a short time when

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.810
it goes across the other way.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.180
Now, the opposite happens
when you have a dark bar,

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.500
because then the dark
bar doesn't activate

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.920
the light sensitive photo cell.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.400
It activities the dark one.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.300
So it takes a little
longer to start that.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.570
So that then shows you
the temporal arrangements

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:07.320
of these responses if
when the photo cells

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.530
are arranged in this fashion.

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.360
Everybody understand that?

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.420
OK, so now we are going
to do this for the real.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:17.100
We are going to look
at a cortical cell.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.150
And there are several different
subclasses of simple cells.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.470
And the first
subclass we can refer

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.670
to as an S1, S for simple, OK?

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.490
So the simple cell
there is an example,

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.200
very similar arrangement.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.170
Here's the receptive field
of the cell, undefined.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.510
And you either put a light
edge across back and forth

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.210
or a dark edge back and forth.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:40.590
This is the light edge response.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.550
This is the dark edge response.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.390
Now, you can readily
see what happens

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.470
here, which is quite remarkable.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:52.440
The cell responds only
when the bar moves upward

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.860
across the receptive
field and does not

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.810
respond when it moves downward.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.310
So this cell is over
100% direction selective.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:01.410
Got it?

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:02.160
All right.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.050
Now, the same thing happens
to the dark edge, all right?

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:12.120
And so this cell is one that
responds only to the dark edge,

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:12.750
OK?

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.420
In this case, it's
the trailing edge.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.670
In this case, it's
the leading edge.

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:20.940
Now, at the bottom
here, you draw out

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.790
what the receptive
field looks like.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.610
This is in 10th of degrees.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.750
And so this is pretty much
just the spatial response

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:31.700
of the cell.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.970
And it only responds
in this direction.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:35.990
There's nothing drawn
in the other way.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.970
Now I'm going to show
you another cell, which

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:42.315
is going to be a
so-called S2 cell.

00:08:42.315 --> 00:08:45.335
Now, this cell is different
in that it responds

00:08:45.335 --> 00:08:48.060
both to the light
and the dark edges.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.190
And the fact that they're--
in this case, a light bar,

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:54.860
in this case, a dark bar, the
fact that they're-- displaced

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.250
temporally mean that they're
side by side for the light

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:01.110
and dark responses
rather than overlapping.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.620
And that, of course, is the
definition of a simple cell.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.070
And so if you draw out the
receptive field of this cell,

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:13.400
once again, the cell is almost
100% direction selective.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.685
And this is what its
response looks like in space.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:20.710
Now we are going to
look at yet another one.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.800
And this is going
to be a surprise.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.280
It was certainly a surprise
when this was discovered,

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.780
because it's still
not understood

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.910
why we have these
kinds of cells.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.570
Here is one-- you
can look at that--

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:36.140
that responds to a light edge in
this direction and a dark edge

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.260
in this direction, OK?

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.990
So both subfields are
direction selective.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:45.070
But they're direction selective
in opposite directions,

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.000
as depicted here.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.430
Now why on earth would you have
cells in the visual cortex that

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:55.220
respond selectively to
light and dark edges

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.924
in opposite directions?

00:09:56.924 --> 00:09:58.465
That's something
you can contemplate.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.190
There is no definitive
answer to that,

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:05.720
and so I'm not going to
belabor it any further?

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.600
Now what I can do is I can
provide you with a summary.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.790
I showed you this one,
this one, and this one.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.650
Now, you don't have
to worry about those.

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.700
But I would like you to
look at this last one, which

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.650
is a complex cell.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.510
In a complex cell, the light
and dark edge responses

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:25.360
are in the same location,
space-wise, as shown here.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.430
And this particular complex
cell that's a real cell

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.730
is 100% direction selective.

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:36.310
Now, it's true not
for all complex cells,

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:39.130
but the majority of
them that they too

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:40.515
are direction selective.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:45.150
So I can safely
tell you that one

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:49.920
of the major transforms that
happens in the brain in vision

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:54.490
is to convert the signals
form the retina into direction

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:55.885
selective cells.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.530
And therefore, we
can only surmise

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:02.490
that to have direction
selective cells is extremely

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:06.020
important for us to
be able to process

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.820
motion information in the world.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.110
So now we are going
to move on and look

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.900
at extrastriate cortex.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.170
And we already talked
briefly about MT and MST.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:24.260
In these two areas, we have
even an stronger disposition

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.560
for cells to be
direction selective.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.500
And here's an example
of a cell in MT--

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.380
in this direction of
motion, a vigorous response.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:33.830
This is a cumulative response.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.400
In the opposite direction, it
actually has some inhibition,

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.940
as you can see here and here.

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:43.290
Then if you recall from MST,
which is an area yet further

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:50.050
removed from area V1-- it's the
middle superior temporal area--

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:53.140
what you find is, again,
very strongly direction

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.430
selective cells.

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.970
Most of them-- maybe
not all of them,

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:00.650
but the overwhelming majority of
them-- are direction selective.

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.640
But they have much, much
larger receptive fields

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.370
than cells do in MT.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.590
And as I've mentioned to you
before, one of the basic rules

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:19.310
is that as you
progress from the V1

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:22.520
to higher cortical
areas, the receptive

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:25.380
fields in these progressively
higher areas become

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:30.030
bigger and bigger and cover more
and more of the visual space.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.880
So here you can
see this is shown

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.250
in terms of the
visual field here.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:37.650
This is way out.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.820
This is 20 degrees
just from here to here.

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:43.375
The receptive is
gigantic, actually.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.260
And there's a beautiful,
very lawful arrangement

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:52.900
and even though many, many cells
feed into this particular cell

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:58.760
from earlier portions
of the visual cortex,

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:04.220
they maintain or get a specific
input from all of the cells

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.880
that have this
direction selectivity.

00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:11.410
Now, whether this direction
selectivity is a product

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:13.860
of the input from the cells,
which have the same kind

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.480
of directions, like many,
many of these cells--

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.880
maybe 20 or 30 or 40
or 50 of them, OK?--

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.520
which have the same
orientation and direction,

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.510
or whether orientation and
direction selectivity are

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:31.805
created anew in MST is
something that can be debated.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.400
It is still not 100% certain.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.220
So the only thing we have
to worry about this time is

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.680
to realize-- maybe
not even worry.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.590
That's too strong a
term-- is to be aware

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:48.280
that there is
prevalence of direction

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:51.750
selectivity in both MT and MST.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:54.540
It's very beautiful and
very, very specific,

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.530
as you can see it
here, even when

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.320
you have a huge receptive field.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.460
So that is the basic story then.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.720
And now we can ask the
question, how on earth

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.900
is direction
selectivity created?

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.880
Now, there are several models
that have been proposed.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:16.290
And most of these models-- I'll
show you a simple one just so

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:20.260
that you have a sense for it--
most of these models assume,

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.790
I believe correctly,
that you need

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:30.410
to have inhibitory circuits
that are selective for direction

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:36.390
to produce this specific
response in these cells.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.170
Now, the amazing
thing about all this

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.750
is that already
in the retina you

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:44.360
have some cells that
are direction selective.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.630
And these cells I'll
talk about a bit more

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:51.410
when we talk about the
accessory optic system.

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:55.410
These cells in the retina
are not very numerous.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:59.690
In the rabbit that has
approximately 350,000 cells

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.360
in each retina-- can you
imagine a little rabbit?

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.850
And it has 350,000 cells.

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:07.380
We have a little
over a million, OK?

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:14.620
And among those 350,000
cells, about 7,000

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.550
are the so-called
cells of Dogiel.

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:19.640
And actually, I'll
come back to that.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.430
And those are direction
selective cells.

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:29.360
So a very clever experimentalist
examined these direction

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.910
selective cells in the retina,
a fellow called Nigel Daw.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:36.340
And he asked the
question, what can I

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:39.570
do to determine what
the mechanism is

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:41.420
of direction selectivity?

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:44.690
So he did an experiment
that sounds simple.

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:48.040
But let me tell you, it's a
very difficult experiment.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.020
When you put your
electrode into the retina,

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:52.630
you can't see direction
selective cells.

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:54.990
So you're on a
hunting expedition.

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:58.090
So you keep recording from
cell after cell after cell.

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:02.830
And if indeed only
7,000 among the 350,000

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:05.200
are direction selective, it
will take you quite a while

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.770
before you manage to record
from a direction selective cell.

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:11.360
So it's a lot of very hard work.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.790
So anyway, if you do that
when your hypothesis is

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:22.260
that some sort of inhibitory
mechanism is involved, then

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.170
you can do an
experiment and say,

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.880
well if it's inhibitory
mechanisms, probably

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.250
some sort of
GABAergic system, we

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:39.240
need to put some agent into the
retina that blocks inhibition.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.820
We talked about that before,
that that can happen.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.540
And so in this case,
what they did-- let

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.470
me come to that first.

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:47.500
Let me see.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.794
Here we are.

00:16:48.794 --> 00:16:50.710
I'll come back to the
others in just a minute.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.780
What we have here is
one of these cells.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:58.650
And we move in
this direction here

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:00.230
and in this direction for this.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:03.090
And you can see that this cell
is very strongly direction

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:07.099
selective, maybe 100%,
but maybe 80% or 90%.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:13.369
Then he injected picrotoxin
into the eye that blocks GABA.

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:15.059
And lo and behold,
direction selectivity

00:17:15.059 --> 00:17:16.059
is virtually eliminated.

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:20.420
And then when picrotoxin
got washed out,

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.310
there was recovery, all right?

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:27.069
So now, on the basis
of this finding--

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:33.590
it's a beautiful finding-- it
was established that indeed,

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:37.510
inhibitory circuits play a
central role in giving rise

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:39.870
to direction selectivity.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:42.110
And you can imagine that
in the course of evolution,

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:45.290
the pressures had to
be tremendous to create

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:49.592
these direction selective
cells, because the circuitry is

00:17:49.592 --> 00:17:50.300
very complicated.

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:54.090
You have to create these
inhibitory neurons which

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.425
inhibit in a particular
direction rather than just

00:17:56.425 --> 00:17:56.925
randomly.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:59.570
So that's what was done.

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:04.660
And so I'll show you one
model that describes this.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.680
You have a bunch of--
this is for the retina.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.820
You have a bunch
of receptors here.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.580
And they activate a
retinal ganglion cell here.

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:16.750
But they also connect with
an inhibitory interneuron

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:19.050
in one direction,
in that direction.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:23.790
So now if you move a bar in
this direction, as shown here,

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:25.160
you get no response.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.380
But if you move a bar
across the other way,

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.710
you get a vigorous response,
as shown by the action

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.330
potentials here.

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:38.650
So this is a fairly simple
model of creating direction

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:43.216
selectivity by virtue of
inhibitory interneurons.

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:47.810
So that then was also
examined in the cortex.

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:51.760
it was found that there
too inhibitory interneurons

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:57.660
play a central role when
direction specificity is

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:01.750
created in a cortical cell.

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:06.000
So that now makes me come
back to a further analysis

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:13.720
of the basic nature of motion.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:18.490
Can we logically divide motion
into several types, or what?

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:24.750
And so it was proposed by a
wonderful scientist called

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:31.050
Wurtz at the National Institutes
of Health that he could--

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:32.920
he decided that
you can distinguish

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:36.790
between planar motion, circular
motion, and radial motion.

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:39.070
Planar motion is when
something moves straight.

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:41.849
That's what we've talked
about so far only.

00:19:41.849 --> 00:19:43.140
And of course, you can do that.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:47.602
In this case, he shows
four different directions.

00:19:47.602 --> 00:19:49.060
But of course,
there'd be all kinds

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:53.010
of directions that are
not vertical or horizontal

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.374
but are diagonal.

00:19:54.374 --> 00:19:56.040
And there are many,
many cortical cells.

00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:00.220
Some of those actually I
showed you had orientation cell

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.690
activity that was at an angle.

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:06.150
So you have a huge number
of different angles.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:09.850
And these cells
hypothetically then

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:13.340
would respond to planar motion.

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.569
Then you have another
type of motion,

00:20:15.569 --> 00:20:16.610
which is called circular.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:22.980
And let me tell you, when you
see circular motion, obviously,

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.360
if you were to be spun around
or something, you'd see it.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:30.620
But it's not uncommon
to see something rotate.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:35.935
So if you have a spinning wheel
or if you watch a tire rotating

00:20:35.935 --> 00:20:38.820
in motion, that's
circular motion.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:42.120
And so the hypothesis
is that there

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:47.210
should be cells in the brain
that selectively respond

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:51.120
to circular motion, either
clockwise or counterclockwise.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:55.770
And lastly, of course, the
so-called radial motion--

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:58.140
and you encounter that
just about every day.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.980
Whenever you drive,
you see trees.

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:05.330
Or if you're driving
out in the country,

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:09.020
you see trees going past you, so
to speak, as you drive forward.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:14.485
And that would be motion
which would be outward.

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:18.040
Or if you were to
back up like this,

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.040
then you would get
this kind of motion

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.810
where things would
come together, OK?

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:27.510
So that kind of motion
is certainly one

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:29.600
that you need to somehow code.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.060
And so another question
came up once he came up

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:36.490
with this hypothesis that these
different kinds of motion--

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:42.280
the question is, are there cells
in various parts of the brain,

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.490
especially in higher
areas like MST,

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:49.865
that are selective for these
three basic types of motion?

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:53.450
And so they began
to do an experiment.

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:56.340
And I'll show you some
summary data here.

00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:01.200
Here is a cell when you
study planar motion.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.580
And these are the eight
directions of motion

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:06.330
that were studied--
sorry, four directions

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:09.490
of motion on the top-- then the
circular one on the next two,

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:12.690
and the in and out
motion at the bottom.

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:16.820
This particular cell seems to
be specific for planar motion

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.180
from right to left.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:23.290
Now here is a cell that is
selective to circular motion,

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:24.110
OK?

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:26.170
And lastly, here
is a cell that's

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:27.940
elective to radial motion.

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:32.780
So if you only had
recorded in your life

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:37.550
from three cells in
MST, and it happened

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:39.630
to be these three
cells, you would say,

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:42.540
ah, my hypothesis is right.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.020
There are three
kinds of cells in MST

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:49.190
that respond selectively to
these three classes of motion.

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:52.240
So everything is incredibly
beautiful and logical.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.060
But of course, that's not how
you do your experiment, is it?

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.330
The way you do
your experiment is

00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:59.630
you record from
MST in this case,

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:02.180
and you record from
many, many, many cells.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:05.170
And you test them
just like this, OK?

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:08.810
And if you do that, you
realize that this is just

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:10.930
an example of three
cells that were specific.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.790
It was found that
40% of the cells

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:17.830
responded to all
three kinds of motion.

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:20.660
305 responded to
two types of motion.

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:23.880
And only 20% of
the cells responded

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.550
to one type of motion.

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:30.710
So therefore, these
cells, as is so often

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:36.700
the case in the visual cortex,
are not unique and specific

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:39.260
to analysis of one thing.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:42.820
These cells can tell you
about all three of those.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:47.350
And what happens in reality then
is that when something moves,

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:51.100
you activate thousands
of cells in MT, MST,

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.740
and visual cortex,
maybe tens of thousands.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:59.640
And it's some sort of
complex relative activity

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.960
that then eventually gives
rise to the fact that you say,

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.370
oh, yeah I see planar motion.

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:06.390
Oh, yeah, I see a
circular motion,

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:09.530
or I see in and outward motion.

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:12.990
So it's not a
specific single cell

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:15.400
that tells you or gives
you that impression,

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:19.260
but it's the concerted
activity of thousands

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:22.990
of cells even for the
simplest of cases.

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:24.960
So that's the way it works.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.270
It's a complex business.

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:32.190
And the idea that was
popular at one time,

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:37.670
namely that you have feature
detectors in the brain,

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:40.780
has become downgraded
progressively

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:44.040
with increasing research.

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:46.860
As I mentioned to
you before, when

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.740
we talked about to
extrastriate cortex,

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:53.950
the initial idea was when the
various extrastriate areas

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:58.670
had been discovered, that
each area specializes

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:00.480
in one particular thing.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:04.880
And then it turned out
that that is not the case.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:10.750
There may be shifts or
trends, but in each area,

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:12.810
many different
things are analyzed

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:15.260
and thousands and
thousands of cells

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:22.480
are active whose relative
activity is somehow

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:26.310
what gives rise to the
percept that you have.

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:29.310
All right, so that
then is the essence

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:33.760
of the layout of the
responses and the models

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:38.660
that this model that
[INAUDIBLE] told you about,

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.450
or something similar to this.

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:42.430
It may be a bit
more complicated.

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:44.250
And some people
have hypothesized

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:47.900
that there are temporal
delays necessary to produce

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:48.400
this thing.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.130
Yes?

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:49.796
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:53.728
There was a 10% missing
in the breakdown.

00:25:54.762 --> 00:25:55.470
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:58.970
Are you talking about this?

00:25:58.970 --> 00:25:59.960
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:04.540
PROFESSOR: Well, that's-- 10%
of the cells were unclassified

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:07.370
or we're not
direction selective.

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:14.330
These they could with certainty
say what the situation was.

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:15.970
And maybe some of
those cells they

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:18.110
lost while that
we're recording from

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:20.341
or they didn't have any
particular direction

00:26:20.341 --> 00:26:20.840
selectivity.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:25.170
And because of that,
they couldn't come up

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:27.145
with 100%, of course, yeah?

00:26:27.145 --> 00:26:28.145
Yes, you had a question.

00:26:28.145 --> 00:26:29.770
AUDIENCE: It was
the same question.

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:30.140
PROFESSOR: What?

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:30.934
AUDIENCE: It was
the same question.

00:26:30.934 --> 00:26:32.142
PROFESSOR: Same question, OK.

00:26:32.142 --> 00:26:34.390
Very observant-- good for you.

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:40.580
All right, so now we are
going to move forward

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:44.200
and we're going to look
at the effects of lesions

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.273
on motion perception.

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:54.600
One of the ready ways you
can assess to what extent

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.900
various higher
cortical areas play

00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:04.320
a role in various
neural mechanisms

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.100
is to either reversibly
inactivate them

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:15.810
or to remove them by making
lesions and then determining

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:16.540
what happens.

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:19.110
And if you remember, I
talked about this a bit.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.450
I told you, for example,
that the hypothesis that

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:28.780
was made initially about area
V4 is that it's a color area.

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:32.050
That was a single
function hypothesis.

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:38.440
And then it turned out that
when area V4 was removed,

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:43.330
it was found that there was
only a moderate to mild deficit

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:44.560
in color vision.

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.590
But there were all
kinds of other deficits

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:50.780
that we had discussed
in previous sessions.

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.430
So now we come to
the question about,

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:55.530
what about motion perception?

00:27:55.530 --> 00:28:00.250
When we talk about emotion
perception, we of course

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:03.010
are dealing with
temporal things,

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:08.490
because motion involves
successive activation of cells.

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:11.470
And because of that,
it's also very important

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:19.240
to study how well we can process
rapid successive presentations

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.010
as, for example, in flicker.

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:25.160
And that brings me, of
course, to the story--

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.240
and we will talk about
that in a minute--

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:37.150
that in the olden days, when
movies were first invented,

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:40.670
the rate at which successive
frames were presented

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:48.860
was 16 Hertz, which was
fairly close to having

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:51.790
a sensational of
flicker, all right?

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.070
And because of
that, what happened

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:57.265
when a guy asked a
girl to go the movies?

00:28:57.265 --> 00:28:59.390
How did the guy ask the
person to go to the movies?

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:00.660
Can anybody remember that?

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:01.840
That's an olden thing.

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.870
The guy would say,
hey, how would you

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:09.385
like to go to the
flicks tonight?

00:29:09.385 --> 00:29:11.510
OK, you've heard that
expression, go to the flicks,

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:12.009
right?

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:18.080
Well, nowadays we are not
aware of flicks anymore.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.540
And there are two
reasons for that.

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.081
Anybody know what
the two reasons are

00:29:21.081 --> 00:29:23.630
why no one can see
clicks in the movies

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:25.621
and you no longer go
to the flicks anymore

00:29:25.621 --> 00:29:26.995
but you go to the
movies instead?

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.269
Yeah?

00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:30.310
What are the two reasons?

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:31.940
Anybody know?

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.350
OK, well, let me tell you.

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:40.600
The first is that the rate of
the number of frames per second

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:45.310
had been increased
to about 24, OK?

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:50.551
But that's still slightly
below the effusion.

00:29:50.551 --> 00:29:51.050
OK?

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:52.800
You can still see some flicker.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.516
So how do you get rid of it?

00:29:54.516 --> 00:29:56.990
Well, let me tell you, some
incredibly clever guy--

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:59.510
some things are
really, really clever.

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:01.930
I'll tell you what this
person came up with.

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:03.690
He said, all right,
what we'll do

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:08.390
is we're going to create
a shutter which is round.

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:10.420
And it's going to
have one opening here.

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:13.947
And then we're going to
have a second opening here.

00:30:13.947 --> 00:30:16.030
And then we're going to
have a third opening here.

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:17.640
So this goes around.

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:23.210
And each frame you're
going to show three times.

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:28.110
And then as this goes around,
you go to the next frame,

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:29.950
and you show it three times.

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:35.590
So actually, if seeing frames
24 hertz, you see it 3 times 24,

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:36.170
OK?

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:38.800
But each frame is
shown three times.

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.230
Now, to be even more clever,
the way they did this,

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:46.940
they took two of these
circular shutters.

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.370
And one of them moved in
this direction and the other

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:50.720
in that direction.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:54.150
They sort of equalized
from the center

00:30:54.150 --> 00:31:04.390
out as the light was
expose from the projector.

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:07.870
So that then reduced
the rate of flicker.

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:14.170
So therefore, we can
next ask the question,

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:19.240
what is the flicker rate
at which you no longer can

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:19.885
see anything?

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.950
I mean, do you want
to see flicker.

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:25.820
Or do you not want to
see flicker, and so on?

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.620
And so experiments
were done, hundreds

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:33.640
of experiments in which
a psychologist studied

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:37.640
flicker rate, varying
contrast, varying color, doing

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:42.000
this, doing that, and then
varying the spatial frequency

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.590
and generating curves to
see what they look like.

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:47.160
So that's the process.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:52.450
And so what we can do
next is to examine this.

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:55.020
And one way to do
this, for example,

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:56.660
just to give you
a sense, you can

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:58.850
have, for example, a
bunch of random dots,

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:02.120
just like we had for the
[INAUDIBLE] stereogram.

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:06.790
And this would be done
with a monkey, for example.

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:08.210
The monkey fixates.

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:12.470
And then you start something
in motion-- ready?-- like that.

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:16.240
And the monkey sees this and
has to make a saccade to it.

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:19.800
And when he does so, he gets a
drop of apple juice for reward.

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.910
And then what you can
very are two things.

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:23.330
You can vary the frequency.

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:25.335
I'm showing another one,
much higher frequency.

00:32:26.632 --> 00:32:28.590
Bang-- the monkey goes
there and gets rewarded.

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:33.590
Or you can-- and/or,
actually-- you

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:37.790
can vary the contrast
of the display, OK?

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:43.000
So once you have a sense of when
you get fairly close to sort

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.340
of the edge of things, then
you can also vary the contrast.

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:48.840
So now let's ask
the question, what

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:57.830
happens when you remove area
MT and when you remove V4, OK?

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:59.960
So think about
that for a second.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:04.200
And then I will show you
the actual data, all right?

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:09.780
OK, here we go.

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:10.880
Here is an example.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.550
This is motion detection.

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:15.870
And here we vary percent
luminance contrast

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:17.650
at a fixed frequency.

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:19.384
You get the same
effect the other way.

00:33:19.384 --> 00:33:20.550
I'll just show you this one.

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:23.920
And you can see very readily
that the V4 lesion caused

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:28.310
no deficit at all, but the MT
lesion produced a huge deficit,

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:29.690
OK?

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:32.940
So clearly this
establishes the fact

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:37.060
that area MT plays
a central role

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:41.310
in the processing of
flicker information

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:45.590
in being able to analyze
rapid temporal events.

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:47.895
And now we can ask
the next question.

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:53.220
What happens when you actually
do just stationary flicker,

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:54.010
all right?

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:56.150
So when you do
stationary flicker,

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:58.150
you can do that in two ways.

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:01.700
You can do an on
off flicker, or you

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:07.650
can do a flicker between two
colors, for example, all right?

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:09.960
And you can see why that
would be interesting.

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.460
Because if you do flicker
between two colors,

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:17.610
like red and green,
if area V4 were

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:21.600
important for color processing,
then a lesion in that area

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.690
should mess up that
kind of flicker.

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:25.130
So that's the way to do it.

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:28.790
So let me show you first of
all how you do this experiment.

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:29.860
Here we have it.

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:31.679
You have a bunch of LED's.

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:33.880
Why does one have LED's
instead of just doing

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.760
this on a monitor?

00:34:36.234 --> 00:34:36.775
Any thoughts?

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:39.989
Yes.

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:42.120
AUDIENCE: The frequency at
which those [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:42.995
PROFESSOR: Very good.

00:34:42.995 --> 00:34:49.100
The reason you do it is because
your typical frequency rate

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:54.120
is the alternating current
rate, meaning 60 Hertz.

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:58.180
Now, nowadays you
can of course buy

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:02.580
devices that can double
it or even quadruple it.

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:07.070
But back then it was
easier to do it this way.

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:10.270
And it still is, because
you can vary these flicker

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:11.870
rates in small amounts.

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:16.690
Now, each of these
LED's, actually,

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:18.910
for this particular
set of experiments,

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:25.170
is one that has both
red and green in it, OK?

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:29.510
So you can flicker between on
and off, let's say for green.

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:33.410
Or you can flicker between
red and green, all right?

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:35.890
So that's what we are
going to find out.

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:39.010
What happens when you do these
kinds of flickers, red green

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:42.600
as well as on and off?

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.570
And ask the question,
what happens

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:49.360
when you make, again a V4
lesion or an MT lesion, OK?

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:53.110
Now think about it
for a minute, as

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:55.320
to what you would
expect in terms

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:59.470
of the differences between on
and off and red green flicker

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:02.890
and possible differences
in the lesions

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:06.900
that cause a
deficit in this, OK?

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:10.570
All right, ready?

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:11.286
Here we go.

00:36:11.286 --> 00:36:12.160
There is the flicker.

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:13.010
You can see that.

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:15.950
Now, the way that really works
is that the overall flicker--

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:20.570
I'll show it to you again--
is done in such a fashion that

00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:26.920
the mean illumination level
is the same so that you cannot

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:32.830
tell the location of the
flickering LED on the basis

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:33.775
of a lumen exchange.

00:36:33.775 --> 00:36:37.480
You can only tell on the basis
of the fact that it flickers

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.910
or it doesn't flicker, OK?

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:42.600
All right, so we are now
ready for the experiment.

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:43.960
And here it is.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:47.880
On the right, I'm showing you
a green on and off flicker.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:51.050
And you can see that there's
no deficit at the V4 lesion,

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:57.710
but a gigantic, absolutely
gigantic deficit at the MT

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:59.450
lesion site.

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:04.290
And then very surprisingly-- to
some people at least who were

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:07.430
convinced that V4
is a color area--

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:12.150
when you do that for a red
green flicker, first of all,

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:16.730
notice that the flicker rate
that you can detect is much

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:22.520
lower-- OK, this is the ratio of
the flicker, much lower, OK?--

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:26.660
than it is for the
on off flicker.

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:30.790
And secondly, again, there's
no significant deficit

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:32.830
with the V4 lesion.

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:35.325
But there's again a major
deficit with MT lesion.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:41.610
So area MT is
essential for being

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:47.000
able to process both red and
green flicker as well as on

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.710
and off flicker, all right?

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:55.330
So bear that in mind as we
are going to now progress

00:37:55.330 --> 00:38:01.400
to the next stage of the
experiment-- set of experiments

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.300
I should say.

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:04.380
And the next step I'm
going to talk about

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:05.630
is structure from motion.

00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:13.680
And that one is a very important
attribute that we have.

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:19.580
We can reconstruct structure
by see nothing but motion.

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:21.930
And I'm going to show
you an example of that.

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:26.770
OK, let me tell you,
this here actually

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:33.510
is a scene, a made-up
scene, that's outside.

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:38.615
And somewhere in here
we have ladybug hiding.

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:41.770
But the ladybug
is not in motion.

00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:47.210
And you know, ladybugs have
these spots on their back.

00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:49.910
And there's a ladybug here.

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:52.780
And I'm going to tell you that
there's a monkey watching this,

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:56.510
hoping that he could catch
the ladybug to have it,

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:57.900
because he loves
to eat ladybugs.

00:38:59.456 --> 00:39:00.580
Are you ready to catch her?

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:02.700
OK, here we go.

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:03.600
Ready?

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:07.310
The ladybug after a while got
tired of just sitting there

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:09.510
and began to move.

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:12.040
And that's a dead
giveaway, because you

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.100
have all these
cells in your brain

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:17.450
that selectivity see
motion and flicker.

00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:18.590
Are you ready?

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:19.200
Here we go.

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:22.040
There's the ladybug.

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:22.540
See her?

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:31.330
OK, so the monkey is happily
eating away the ladybug,

00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:32.360
all right?

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:39.730
So here is a good example
of how incredibly useful

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:42.800
motion information
is that you have

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.330
in these visual cortical areas.

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:52.209
Now, I would bet that if this
monkey had had his MT removed,

00:39:52.209 --> 00:39:54.250
he wouldn't have been able
to catch that ladybug.

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:57.670
Now, another set of
experiments carried out,

00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:00.450
beautiful experiments,
were carried out

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:04.300
by a fellow called
Johanson-- I think

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:09.660
that was in Sweden-- who did a
very clever set of experiments.

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:14.970
He wanted to analyze how well we
can process motion information

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:17.060
and derive structure from it.

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:21.510
And what he did was that he
put little teeny little light

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:31.986
bulbs on about 13 points
in the human's body.

00:40:31.986 --> 00:40:35.020
He put some here on the
elbows, put some at the hand,

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:39.090
put some at the head, and
so on down, 13 of them.

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:41.100
And then he turned
off all the lights,

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:43.920
so the only light was that
little spot of light that

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:48.770
was on these 13 spots of
light that were on the person.

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:53.300
And then he took a
movie to see what

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:56.260
happened when this
person started to walk.

00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:58.370
And he discovered
something amazing,

00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:03.690
that we are incredibly capable
of reconstructing shape

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:07.180
from minimal motion information.

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:08.040
So are you ready?

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:10.020
OK, here we go.

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:11.970
So there it is.

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:17.210
There are your 13
little spots of light.

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:19.030
And now I'm going
to set it in motion.

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.530
Ready?

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:25.550
So what do you see?

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:30.060
You see a person walking on
this very minimal information.

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:34.140
And you can even tell--
who would say it's a male

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:35.730
and who would say it's a female?

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:37.890
Those of you who say it's
a male, raise your hands.

00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:41.510
OK, it's virtually everybody.

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:43.950
Right, very good.

00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:47.320
Now, so what he did which
I don't have a movie of,

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:50.220
which is quite
remarkable, is that he

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:53.140
took a couple, a
male and a female

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:56.580
and had them arranged in
exactly the same way-- each

00:41:56.580 --> 00:42:02.685
had 13 of those bulbs--
and had them dance.

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:06.990
And when you looked at
that, you had no trouble

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:09.770
telling which was the male
and which was the female.

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:10.730
Amazing.

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:16.840
So we are able to reconstruct
a tremendous amount of form

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:20.520
detail on the basis of
extremely limited information

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:21.250
about motion.

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:28.620
All right, so that
then ends that session.

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:32.690
And we're going to go next to
what is called apparent motion,

00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:34.060
all right?

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:36.934
So you're going to have various
forms of apparent motion

00:42:36.934 --> 00:42:38.100
I'm going to tell you about.

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:42.970
And the first one is that if you
show these two dots, if I flick

00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:45.740
them back and forth, you
have a very strong sense

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:47.880
that the thing is going
back and forth, right?

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:51.990
You don't see one, two,
going on and one going off,

00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:55.990
because of the right
temporal succession.

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:59.590
But you see them as just
jumping back and forth.

00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:02.340
So now what we can do--
we can enlarge on that

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:06.220
and carry out a series of
experiments on the bases

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:14.015
which can make some inferences
as to whether areas V4

00:43:14.015 --> 00:43:16.750
or MT are contributing to this.

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:18.590
So this is going be fun for you.

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:20.180
And I want you to
pay close attention.

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:23.820
Now, in this kind of
experiment when it was done,

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:26.350
first, this stayed
on all the time.

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:28.480
And these two dots
came on first.

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.750
And then these two
dots came on second.

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:37.060
Now, if you do that, you can see
either of two types of motion.

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:40.940
You can either see what
we call zigzag or seesaw.

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:43.540
Seesaw is going to look
like that, obviously,

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:45.830
and zigzag like this, OK?

00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:47.840
So that's what I'm
going to show you.

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:52.320
And once I set
this in motion, you

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:54.630
will see it one
way or the other.

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:57.930
Then if you see
it's, say, seesawing,

00:43:57.930 --> 00:44:00.480
you can take your finger
and move it horizontally

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:02.859
back and forth on top, say.

00:44:02.859 --> 00:44:05.150
And then in short order you're
going to be seeing this.

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:08.280
You can reverse the sense
of motion, all right?

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:09.700
So are you ready for that?

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.250
OK, so here we go.

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:20.270
If you see it one
way or the other,

00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:23.830
try to move your finger back and
forth to change it to see it.

00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:27.520
If you see it horizontally
moving, move it vertically.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.710
If you see it vertically,
move it horizontally.

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:31.400
And then you can see it shift.

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:36.190
Everybody able to reverse it?

00:44:37.546 --> 00:44:38.990
Well, keep doing it.

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:41.466
And you should have no
trouble reversing it

00:44:41.466 --> 00:44:43.090
if you move your
finger back and forth.

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:50.310
This is a bistable situation.

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:53.320
And people can readily
see the switch.

00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:58.325
OK, most of you
seeing it switching?

00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:00.350
All right.

00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:02.795
So now we can ask a
whole bunch of questions.

00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:07.200
And the way to put this
question in general

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:13.140
is we can ask, is first of
all, is this something that

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:16.390
happens locally, or does
it happen everywhere

00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:17.630
when you're looking?

00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:19.210
So how can you do that?

00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:20.310
So let me show you.

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:24.010
What they we do here instead is
we can put up a bunch of them,

00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:24.510
OK?

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:26.662
And they're quite far
apart from each other.

00:45:26.662 --> 00:45:28.120
And depending on
how close you are,

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:30.110
they may be as far
as a centimeter

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:33.840
apart in the visual
cortex for the activation.

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.760
So now what we're
going to do is we're

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:39.119
going to move them back and
forth just like I did before.

00:45:39.119 --> 00:45:40.660
And the question
that you want to ask

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:43.150
yourself-- am I going
to see these all

00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:46.260
move the same way vertically,
say, or see all of them

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:47.950
move horizontally, OK?

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:49.957
So here we go.

00:45:49.957 --> 00:45:50.540
Are you ready?

00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:59.170
Basically, the rule is that
they all move the same way.

00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:00.360
And then they shift.

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.710
Again, you can use your
thumb or your forefinger.

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:05.980
And if you manage
to make it switch,

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:07.710
they all will switch
at the same time.

00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:13.450
OK, everybody manage that?

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:27.200
All right, so now the rule is
that even though the activation

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:32.150
is very far apart in
V1 from here to here,

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:35.020
there's some organizing
principle that

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:39.150
makes you see everything
a particular given way.

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:40.220
And they shift.

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:41.870
They all shift.

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:45.590
Now, that's a very
interesting arrangement.

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:48.690
And you can wonder,
what is there

00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:52.760
that can tell the visual
cortex how to see it and insist

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:54.260
that you got to see
it the same way?

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:57.120
Now we can move on.

00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:59.230
And you can ask the
question-- so far,

00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:04.830
what I've shown you is
they're all the same-- sorry.

00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:05.700
That's my fault.

00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:14.960
They are all the same size.

00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:19.130
And they are geometrically
arranged, OK?

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:23.310
So now what happens if
instead, we do it differently

00:47:23.310 --> 00:47:27.300
and we make them different
sizes and random locations?

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:29.380
What happens under
these conditions?

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:30.769
Now think about it for a minute.

00:47:30.769 --> 00:47:32.310
And then I'm going
to show it to you.

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.970
And once again, even though
they're different sizes,

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:39.880
different locations,
they all go the same way.

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:43.380
And when they shift--
again, use your forefinger

00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:45.010
to try to make it shift.

00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:49.245
And when they shift, they all
shift at the same time, OK?

00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:57.120
All right, so now we
can move on and ask

00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:59.830
some interesting
additional questions.

00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:02.370
We can ask the
question, how important

00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:07.450
is color information for you to
see it go one way or the other?

00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:08.160
All right?

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:13.350
OK, so to do that, here we have
the top two are colored red

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:15.430
and the bottom two
are colored green.

00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:17.460
Now we're going to move
these back and forth.

00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:22.940
And the question is, will you
see them move horizontally

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:25.600
because of the color
information or what?

00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:28.370
So the question
is, again, are you

00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:31.200
going to see zigzag or seesaw?

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.050
OK, are you ready?

00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:38.920
And you can readily see if,
again, you can readily shift it

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:44.210
again with your forefinger,
that color doesn't seem

00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:50.740
to be an important determinant
of the direction in which

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:54.330
the apparent motion
will take place.

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:56.140
Everybody follow that?

00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:58.310
Well, now think about that.

00:48:58.310 --> 00:49:02.120
How can we do this
experiment to be

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:04.870
more convinced that
color for some reason

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:08.410
doesn't seem to be important
in how we see apparent motion?

00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:10.280
Well, let me tell
you how you do it.

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:11.090
Here is an example.

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:18.940
Here we have again four rows
and four columns, all right?

00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:23.020
And the first, one A and C,
the colors are horizontal.

00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:26.160
And in the second one, B
and D, they are vertical.

00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:29.330
So if color plays
a role, we should

00:49:29.330 --> 00:49:32.200
be able to see these, the
first and the third rows

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:34.180
go in one direction
and the second

00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:36.055
and the fourth row go
in the other direction.

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:38.990
So let's examine that.

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:41.540
Ready?

00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:44.940
And you can see that they're
all going the same direction

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:45.440
anyway.

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:48.410
When they switch, they
switch in the same direction,

00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:52.460
meaning that indeed you pay no
attention to the color itself,

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:53.130
OK?

00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:55.580
Some mechanism is
involved in which

00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:58.670
the apparent motion
you see does not

00:49:58.670 --> 00:50:00.880
play a significant
role in color.

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:05.000
Now we can do another
experiment and see

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.710
what happens when
instead of colors, we

00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:11.050
use small shapes,
X's and O's which

00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:13.270
are horizontal in the
first and the third row

00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:16.940
and vertical in the
second and the fourth row.

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:23.460
Will this succeed in breaking
up the unity of apparent motion?

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:24.180
So here we go.

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:25.500
Ready?

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:28.680
And you still see
them all the same way,

00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:30.180
meaning that you
don't pay attention

00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:32.295
to the small
differences in shape.

00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:38.510
OK, so now what I
have shown you so far,

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:43.220
remember, has something to do
with the midget and the parasol

00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:45.130
systems for the test.

00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:48.140
The midget system can
process fine detail.

00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:50.720
And the midget system
can process color.

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:54.000
The parasol system does
not process fine detail

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.540
and does not separately
process color.

00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:59.590
So we'll come to
that in a minute.

00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:01.030
Now let's ask the next question.

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:03.750
What happens if
you vary the size?

00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:06.880
OK, again, the first and
third row, the size difference

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:08.010
is horizontal.

00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:10.590
And the second and fourth
row, it's vertical.

00:51:10.590 --> 00:51:12.540
OK, so let's see what happens.

00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:15.280
Here it's a bit unclear, OK?

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:17.344
So as you see, some
of them go one way.

00:51:17.344 --> 00:51:18.260
Some go the other way.

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:20.220
And some of you may see
it all go the same way,

00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:22.090
depending on how far you are.

00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:25.340
So let's change the ratio
so it's much, much bigger.

00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:28.600
And if you do it now,
what you see is dramatic.

00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:31.460
You see horizontal motion
in the first and third rows

00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:34.950
and vertical motion in the
second and fourth rows.

00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:35.830
Everybody see that?

00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:40.380
OK, so we can enhance
on this maybe a little

00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:46.520
bit by adding these together,
adding size and color

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:52.505
and shape, quite large
differences in size and shape

00:51:52.505 --> 00:51:53.430
and color.

00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:55.760
Then if you do this,
you will indeed

00:51:55.760 --> 00:52:01.020
have fully succeeded in
breaking up the unity of motion,

00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:03.411
with the first and third
rows going horizontally

00:52:03.411 --> 00:52:05.410
and the second and fourth
rows going vertically.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.680
Now then there's one
other important factor

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:11.740
that we need to
consider about this.

00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:13.436
And that has to
do with proximity.

00:52:14.830 --> 00:52:16.900
So in this case, what
we're doing now--

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:18.930
in the first and
the third rows, we

00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:22.540
have the horizontal dots
closer to each other.

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:26.200
he second and fourth rows, we
have the vertical dots closer

00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:27.550
to each other.

00:52:27.550 --> 00:52:30.050
So if you do that, you're
going to ask the question,

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:31.780
how important is proximity?

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:35.490
And if you do that, you
don't see much so far.

00:52:35.490 --> 00:52:37.660
But now what I'm
going to do is I'm

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:40.340
going to make the
difference even greater, OK?

00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:43.890
The first and third are
very close horizontally.

00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:47.190
And the second and fourth
are very close vertically.

00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:49.740
If you do that,
you readily can see

00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:53.840
that indeed the first and
third rows move horizontally

00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:57.870
and the second and fourth
rows move vertically.

00:52:57.870 --> 00:53:00.860
So proximity is a
very important factor.

00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:06.190
And so that then brings me
to an interesting question

00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:09.610
that probably none of you
have given much thought.

00:53:10.746 --> 00:53:13.610
But I will make you
more aware of it.

00:53:15.090 --> 00:53:19.435
The fact is that
when you see movies,

00:53:19.435 --> 00:53:28.267
you very often see a car or
a chariot or something move

00:53:28.267 --> 00:53:30.100
forward, but the wheels
are going backwards.

00:53:32.290 --> 00:53:34.640
And you certainly
do that when you

00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:38.970
watch those endless ads
on television about cars.

00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:41.770
And you see the wheels going
backwards most of the time.

00:53:41.770 --> 00:53:43.490
And the car is going forward.

00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:45.670
And some of you say,
well, why would I

00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:47.570
buy a car whose wheels
are going backwards?

00:53:49.070 --> 00:53:53.200
So at any rate, let's
examine that question.

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:54.590
And what I'm going
to do first is

00:53:54.590 --> 00:53:55.890
I'm going to show you a movie.

00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:56.700
Ready?

00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:58.290
This a famous movie, Ben-Hur.

00:53:58.290 --> 00:53:59.690
You've probably seen it.

00:53:59.690 --> 00:54:01.270
Look at the wheels
going backwards.

00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:02.133
Can you see that?

00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:08.210
Now, of course since I have
given this a lot of thought,

00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:11.600
it drives me nuts when I see
wheels going backwards when

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:13.780
the chariot or the
car goes forward.

00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:15.610
All right, so now
the question is,

00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:19.760
why do we see wheels going
backwards in the movies

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:26.620
or on the ads on television,
whereas when you see it

00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:29.240
in the real, you never
see them going backwards?

00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:42.330
Well, remember that when you
look at a movie or television,

00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:44.640
you always see apparent motion.

00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:47.730
You never see real
motion on television,

00:54:47.730 --> 00:54:50.320
never see real
motion in the movies.

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.352
You're not aware of
it, but you don't.

00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:57.490
You only see apparent
motion because you

00:54:57.490 --> 00:54:59.940
have successive frames
in each of which there

00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:03.890
is a specific, say, if
it's wheels, rotation, OK?

00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:07.000
So let's look at
that analyze this.

00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:14.040
So I'm going to show you a
wheel that is rotating slowly.

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:15.000
Are you ready?

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:15.950
it's a very brief.

00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:21.260
OK, you can see that wheel
is going forward, right?

00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:24.340
Now I'm going to show you
the same and arrangement.

00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:27.480
But I'm going to
have it move fast.

00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:27.980
Ready?

00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:31.030
Ready, go.

00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:34.520
That time you saw it
go backwards, right?

00:55:35.610 --> 00:55:37.670
OK, so let's analyze this.

00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:39.800
What happens when
you have slow motion?

00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:43.760
Let's imagine that
the red line is

00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:47.075
designating one of the spokes.

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:51.270
Then if it moves
slowly, the next frame

00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:55.380
is going to show that displaced
only a little bit from the red,

00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:56.290
and so on.

00:55:56.290 --> 00:55:59.550
And because of that, you're
going to see forward motion.

00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:03.390
But now if what you do instead
is moving fast, what happens

00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:08.190
is that this spoke here
is going to be closer

00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:09.970
to this one in the next frame.

00:56:09.970 --> 00:56:11.595
And because of that--
of course, that's

00:56:11.595 --> 00:56:13.100
all of them all the
way around-- you

00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:16.350
will see them go backwards,
because of the principle

00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:21.210
of proximity that I showed
you with the apparent motion

00:56:21.210 --> 00:56:25.840
of the four moving dots.

00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:35.390
OK, so that then explains to
you why you see wheels rotating

00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:38.015
backwards in the movies
and on television.

00:56:39.210 --> 00:56:43.540
And it's due to a
fact of the proximity

00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:45.930
of successive
elements, in this case,

00:56:45.930 --> 00:56:53.710
spokes that are rotating as the
picture is taken with a camera.

00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:55.970
All right.

00:56:55.970 --> 00:56:59.830
So now I'm going to come
up and tell you briefly

00:56:59.830 --> 00:57:02.870
about another very
interesting phenomenon that

00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:06.570
is closely related to motion.

00:57:06.570 --> 00:57:13.990
When two successive
stimuli are presented,

00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:17.390
there can be an interaction
between them, all right?

00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:24.040
And in a famous series of
experiments back in the 1930s,

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.555
they did what is called a
metacontrast experiment.

00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:31.030
First, a disc was
presented like this.

00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:32.950
And then it was
followed by a ring.

00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:36.180
And they shared the
same contour, OK?

00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:38.050
This is it, OK?

00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:39.550
So now what you
could do-- you could

00:57:39.550 --> 00:57:42.850
vary the temporal
interval between them.

00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:44.756
So if you present these
two simultaneously,

00:57:44.756 --> 00:57:47.620
since they have
overlapping contours,

00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:49.450
that's all you would see.

00:57:49.450 --> 00:57:52.720
But then if you present
them sequentially-- ready?

00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:55.340
Like that, then the
question is, to what degree

00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:57.780
did you see that first one?

00:57:57.780 --> 00:57:59.160
So let's look at that.

00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:01.970
And I want you to
pay close attention

00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:04.685
to when I present
this to you, OK?

00:58:04.685 --> 00:58:05.814
Are you ready?

00:58:05.814 --> 00:58:07.730
You're going to do it
now so that they're only

00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:10.650
60 milliseconds apart, OK?

00:58:12.450 --> 00:58:13.010
Here we go.

00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:18.010
You barely see the
first one, right?

00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:19.540
You could just
barely make it out.

00:58:20.570 --> 00:58:22.090
But it's not gone.

00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:25.090
Some people thought it
would cause it to be gone.

00:58:25.090 --> 00:58:26.830
But that's not the case.

00:58:26.830 --> 00:58:29.060
So what you do then
is the following.

00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:33.050
If you fixate on
the red cross, I'm

00:58:33.050 --> 00:58:35.230
going to present the stimuli.

00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:39.200
And I want you to tell me
which of the two stimuli

00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:41.920
I present is
preceded by the disc.

00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:42.420
Ready?

00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:44.310
Could you tell?

00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:47.120
Which one, left or right?

00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:49.540
Left, good.

00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:51.204
Again, repeat.

00:58:51.204 --> 00:58:52.626
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:58:52.626 --> 00:58:54.050
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:58:54.050 --> 00:58:55.330
Ready?

00:58:55.330 --> 00:58:55.954
AUDIENCE: Left.

00:58:58.762 --> 00:59:00.170
Left.

00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:01.580
PROFESSOR: OK, very good.

00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:05.840
So the fact is that when you
present two side by side where

00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:07.840
one of them is
preceded by the disk,

00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:09.740
you can tell which
one came first.

00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:12.680
So somehow this didn't
obliterate your ability

00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:13.880
to see it.

00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:15.850
Now, the other
interesting fact is

00:59:15.850 --> 00:59:20.260
that if now you flicker
back and forth between them,

00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:23.630
at equal rates, you
see both equally.

00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:31.570
So therefore, what happened
is you did not truly

00:59:31.570 --> 00:59:32.910
obliterate the percept.

00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:35.280
You just somehow weren't
too much aware of it

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:39.270
because of the
temporal offset between

00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:40.970
the successive presentations.

00:59:40.970 --> 00:59:43.360
Now, you can do this
slightly differently.

00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:49.960
Instead of having two stimuli
that do not overlap but have

00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:52.600
adjacent contours,
we can overlap them.

00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:54.790
So here I'm going to show
you something and ask you

00:59:54.790 --> 00:59:55.610
what you see.

00:59:55.610 --> 00:59:57.010
Ready?

00:59:57.010 --> 00:59:58.390
What do you see?

00:59:58.390 --> 00:59:59.371
A big disk?

00:59:59.371 --> 00:59:59.870
OK?

01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:02.140
There it is.

01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:06.750
Now I show it to you.

01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:09.220
As to what I really
showed you, was first

01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:14.660
I presented a dim small disc
followed by a brighter higher

01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:17.820
contrast bigger disc.

01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:21.970
And that obliterated the
perception of the first one.

01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:24.570
And that is truly obliterated.

01:00:24.570 --> 01:00:27.830
And the interesting experiment
you can do in this regard--

01:00:27.830 --> 01:00:29.130
you can do this interocularly.

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:35.080
In other words, you can
present one of the stimuli

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.740
to the left eye and the
other to the right eye.

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:41.040
If you do that, you don't
get a masking effect.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:45.130
But if you go back and
do the metacontrast,

01:00:45.130 --> 01:00:49.030
you still get the
same pseudo blockage

01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:51.130
without actually
eliminating it, but sort

01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:54.570
of making you less aware
of the first stimulus.

01:00:54.570 --> 01:00:58.360
OK, so now if one
examines this, the way

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.620
to do the experiment
right is you

01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:05.300
vary the temporal offset
between the two stimuli.

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:07.840
And when this was
done systematically

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:11.580
with the brightness masking
that I showed you later,

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:15.790
secondly, what happens is that
the effect rapidly declines.

01:01:15.790 --> 01:01:17.920
It's the biggest
when the two are just

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:19.380
right next to each other.

01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:22.450
By contrast, when you
do the metacontrast,

01:01:22.450 --> 01:01:27.030
the biggest effect is when
they're about 62 to 100

01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:29.790
milliseconds separated,
because that's

01:01:29.790 --> 01:01:33.350
when apparent motion
is most effective.

01:01:33.350 --> 01:01:39.430
And then if you do an experiment
to see where this happens

01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:43.280
for the brightness
masking, here's

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:46.920
what happens in the retina
recording from a cell.

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:49.800
This is a dim stimulus,
a smaller response,

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:51.520
and with a longer latency.

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:54.180
And the mask alone will
get a much shorter response

01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:55.780
and a much more vigorous one.

01:01:55.780 --> 01:02:02.130
And then when you systematically
vary the temporal interval

01:02:02.130 --> 01:02:03.940
between the two of
them, you can see

01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:05.380
when the interval becomes short.

01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:08.890
The second stimulus
obliterates the first one

01:02:08.890 --> 01:02:11.960
because it's faster and
it has a bigger response.

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.370
So this explains what
happens, because it happens

01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:17.220
in the retina by
virtue of transmission.

01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:20.150
And the rule of the fact that
the rate at which information

01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:24.390
is transmitted from
the four receptors

01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:28.635
to the retinal ganglion
cells is contrast dependent.

01:02:28.635 --> 01:02:32.140
The higher the contrast,
the faster the response.

01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:35.780
All right, so now
does anybody have

01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:39.720
any questions about the
masking or the metacontrast

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:41.130
that we talked about so far?

01:02:42.850 --> 01:02:44.980
All right, in that
case, we are now

01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:51.960
going to move on and talk
about another important motion

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:56.720
perception effect which links
one to eye movement generation.

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.460
And that falls into
the category of

01:02:58.460 --> 01:02:59.880
so-called optokinetic nystagmus.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:04.050
So how do you study
optokinetic nystagmus

01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:05.420
at the very basic level?

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:10.350
Well, the way you study it is,
for example, in the olden days,

01:03:10.350 --> 01:03:14.590
you could take a large
lamp shade like that

01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:16.930
and put vertical bars
on int on the inside,

01:03:16.930 --> 01:03:19.040
have a person have
his head inside.

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:23.050
And then you rotate
the lamp shape

01:03:23.050 --> 01:03:25.450
so that the bars go
across like that.

01:03:25.450 --> 01:03:27.250
Or you can do that
more simply nowadays.

01:03:27.250 --> 01:03:32.200
You just go put a bunch of
vertical bars on a monitor

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:33.250
and have them drift.

01:03:33.250 --> 01:03:35.750
And the person is
asked to look at it.

01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:38.710
So when the person
does that, what you get

01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:41.480
is the so-called
optokinetic nystagmus.

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:43.000
It has two phases.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.220
It has a fast and a slow phase.

01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:49.400
The fast phase is a saccade, a
resetting saccade, if you will.

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:50.710
So you watch an edge.

01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:52.370
You follow it.

01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:54.360
And then once it gets
to the periphery,

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:57.100
you make a saccade back
and you watch the next one.

01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:58.580
And you keep doing it.

01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:00.600
And this shows you the
three different rates.

01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:03.590
Now, this is quite an
interesting mechanism.

01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:11.150
And it was determined that
an important contribution

01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:15.040
to executing these kinds
of eye movements, which

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:17.660
is very important, because
when you track anything, if you

01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:21.210
track a bird of something,
you keep your eye on it.

01:04:21.210 --> 01:04:24.230
And then once it gets past
you, make this a saccade back

01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:26.670
and take the next
bird and track it.

01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:28.300
So that's the mechanism.

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:31.840
And it's been shown that
several neural mechanisms play

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:32.700
a role in it.

01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:41.520
And one of those belongs to
the so-called accessory optic

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:46.180
system, which has
those cells of Dogiel

01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:48.869
in the retina that
connect to it.

01:04:48.869 --> 01:04:50.160
So we're going to look at that.

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:53.000
Some beautiful work has
been done about that.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.790
But before I do
that, let me show you

01:04:55.790 --> 01:04:56.880
a very interesting factor.

01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:03.440
Here is a typical
optokinetic nystagmus

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:07.850
induced by a drifting vertical
set of bars at various rates,

01:05:07.850 --> 01:05:09.370
as you can see here.

01:05:09.370 --> 01:05:11.190
And this is a rabbit.

01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:15.860
And in the rabbit, what you have
is a left eye and a right eye.

01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:20.690
And you can activate them
separately, as shown here.

01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:25.570
Now, a remarkable
discovery that was made

01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:29.680
is that the accessory
optic system-- that there's

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:34.460
a primary role in
generating this optokinetic

01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:39.360
nystagmus that is
found initially

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:43.450
in among the cells of Dogiel,
of which in the rabbit, as I've

01:05:43.450 --> 01:05:48.760
said, there are about 7,000
out of 350,000 in the eye.

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:55.280
And it was found-- which
was incredibly surprising--

01:05:55.280 --> 01:06:01.550
that this system originating
with the cells of Dogiel,

01:06:01.550 --> 01:06:08.470
the cells of Dogiel themselves
get input only from ON bipolar

01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:10.780
cells, OK?

01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:17.410
So what can we do to prove
that this system here indeed

01:06:17.410 --> 01:06:21.620
is one that is activated
by the cells of Dogiel,

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:24.730
since the cells of
Dogiel in the rabbit

01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:30.102
get input only from
the ON bipolar cells?

01:06:30.102 --> 01:06:31.560
Anybody can think
of an experiment?

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:37.150
What did I tell you about
the on and off systems

01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:39.240
and how they can be manipulated?

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:39.965
Anybody remember?

01:06:41.762 --> 01:06:43.345
Now, see you've got
to remember facts.

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:48.090
And one of the facts was I told
you about what happens when you

01:06:48.090 --> 01:06:53.080
use 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric
acid, APB.

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:54.210
Anybody remember that?

01:06:55.695 --> 01:06:58.143
If not, you'd better
study it, because there

01:06:58.143 --> 01:07:00.880
are going to be questions on
that on the exam, of course.

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:03.300
OK, so if you put
APB into the eye,

01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:08.230
you block the ON bipolar cells.

01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:11.890
And therefore, if
only ON bipolar cells

01:07:11.890 --> 01:07:14.480
feed into the cells
of Dogiel, you

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:17.470
would expect that if you
block those bipolar cells,

01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:24.000
you should eliminate the
optokinetic nystagmus

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.960
in the eye that had been
injected, if it's indeed true

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:34.090
that the cells of
Dogiel are involved, OK?

01:07:34.090 --> 01:07:35.850
So that's a
beautiful experiment,

01:07:35.850 --> 01:07:39.320
because it's a definite one
if indeed the data come out

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:40.740
the way one had hoped.

01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:42.310
And guess what happens?

01:07:42.310 --> 01:07:43.500
Here are the data.

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:49.080
The red ones are
from the eye that

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:50.970
had been injected with APB.

01:07:50.970 --> 01:07:54.130
You know, you
blocked the ON cells.

01:07:54.130 --> 01:07:57.080
And hence, you
blocked the responses

01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:02.330
of the cells of
Dogiel, all right?

01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:13.593
So this is a rather nice,
luckily definitive, experiment.

01:08:13.593 --> 01:08:17.370
Now, the curious thing is, if
you did the same experiment

01:08:17.370 --> 01:08:21.602
in a monkey, you
would get nothing.

01:08:21.602 --> 01:08:24.460
Here you do the same
experiment in a monkey.

01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:26.270
Here is your OKN.

01:08:26.270 --> 01:08:28.359
And here is when you put in APB.

01:08:28.359 --> 01:08:31.250
And still after putting
in APB, the monkey

01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:33.620
still does
optokinetic nystagmus.

01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:41.600
That's because the rabbit
is a very unusual species.

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.870
And god only knows
why it happened

01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:47.939
that only On bipolar cells
fed into the cells of Dogiel.

01:08:47.939 --> 01:08:52.800
In the monkey, you get
both ON and OFF cells

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:54.479
feeding into the
cells of Dogiel.

01:08:56.340 --> 01:09:00.625
All right, so now another
interesting factor

01:09:00.625 --> 01:09:03.069
that I want to
mention just briefly

01:09:03.069 --> 01:09:08.520
is that it's indeed is true
that the feedback mechanism is

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:12.430
essential for you to do
optokinetic nystagmus right.

01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:16.020
Here is a monkey in which
one eye has been immobilized

01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:17.290
and the other eye is normal.

01:09:17.290 --> 01:09:21.189
So if you look at the
normal eye and you

01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:25.680
move a set of vertical
bars very slowly,

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:28.770
this is what your
optokinetic nystagmus

01:09:28.770 --> 01:09:32.370
looks like-- just a
very slow tracking.

01:09:33.390 --> 01:09:37.649
But then if you do the same
thing in the mobilized eye,

01:09:37.649 --> 01:09:42.010
and you, of course, record the
eye movement of the other eye

01:09:42.010 --> 01:09:45.439
which is blocked, what you
get is a tremendously rapid

01:09:45.439 --> 01:09:48.799
increase in the
pursuit movement.

01:09:50.670 --> 01:09:53.050
This can be called open loop.

01:09:53.050 --> 01:09:55.640
And this can be
called closed loop.

01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:57.870
Now, the mechanism
involved here is

01:09:57.870 --> 01:10:00.880
that your intent is to track.

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:03.850
But when you realize--
or not you realize,

01:10:03.850 --> 01:10:05.180
but the brain realizes.

01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:08.820
You're not even aware
of it-- that you are not

01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:11.800
following fast enough to
keep up with the motion

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:15.530
of the vertical bar,
you order the eyes

01:10:15.530 --> 01:10:17.580
to move faster,
faster, and faster,

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:19.610
and faster and faster,
and it practically

01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:21.337
runs away like crazy.

01:10:21.337 --> 01:10:23.170
And it still-- of course,
because the eye is

01:10:23.170 --> 01:10:28.470
immobilized-- hasn't been able
to catch up to the moving bar.

01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:33.340
So this further highlights the
importance of this mechanism.

01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:36.740
And it has to be a closed
loop system, obviously,

01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:38.130
for it to work properly.

01:10:38.130 --> 01:10:40.090
So there's a
feedback telling you

01:10:40.090 --> 01:10:42.370
whether you had correctly
tracked something.

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:48.880
OK, so now I come to
the last point today,

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:54.450
which is now the mechanism
that is involved in the motion

01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:56.500
analysis of accessory
optic system.

01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:58.380
I'll talk about
this only briefly,

01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:02.950
because this is going to
be part of your paper.

01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:05.570
All right, now, they
remarkable discovery

01:11:05.570 --> 01:11:07.950
that was made--
amazing discovery--

01:11:07.950 --> 01:11:12.750
was that when people recorded
from the cells of Dogiel,

01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:21.270
they found that these cells
come in three different types

01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:25.550
with three different axes of
orientation, these three axes.

01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:27.900
And when that was
first found, people

01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:29.540
said, what on earth is going on?

01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:32.100
Why would we have
three like that?

01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:34.040
I would have thought
we'd have four,

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:36.470
vertical and horizontal
at least, or something.

01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:38.130
So this was really puzzling.

01:11:38.130 --> 01:11:40.710
But then they began to
do some more experiments.

01:11:40.710 --> 01:11:43.080
And they made a truly
remarkable discovery.

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:45.530
And their discovery
is shown here

01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:49.600
in a summary diagram of
the accessory optic system.

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:53.010
OK, here are these
cells of Dogiel

01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:55.890
with the three axes of
direction selectivity.

01:11:55.890 --> 01:12:01.105
They respond to rather
slow motion velocities.

01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:04.012
So what happens
here-- I'm not going

01:12:04.012 --> 01:12:06.220
to go into detail, because
you're going to, as I say,

01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:07.390
report on this.

01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:10.320
But let me tell you
about the essence of it.

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:16.320
The cells of Dogiel project into
the so-called terminal nuclei.

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:19.030
And then they project
up to the cerebellum.

01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:21.414
And from the cerebellum,
there's a projection down

01:12:21.414 --> 01:12:22.455
to the vestibular nuclei.

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:27.710
And then it was found,
as it was known already,

01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:30.690
that the semicircular
canals come

01:12:30.690 --> 01:12:34.610
in three orientations
which are the same as those

01:12:34.610 --> 01:12:39.630
of the orientations of
the cells of Dogiel.

01:12:39.630 --> 01:12:45.822
And so then they feed into
the ocular motor system

01:12:45.822 --> 01:12:53.850
to move the eyes so as to
keep the eyes in accurate

01:12:53.850 --> 01:12:58.530
contact with whatever
you're intending to look at.

01:12:58.530 --> 01:13:02.960
So that is the very essence
of the accessory optic system.

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:04.850
And I just thought
this will help you

01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:08.090
in putting your paper together.

01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:10.990
All right, so now I am
ready to summarize for you.

01:13:10.990 --> 01:13:14.760
First of all, motion
has been classified

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:20.655
into several different types
that include planar, circular,

01:13:20.655 --> 01:13:21.155
and radial.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.310
And one thing we talked about
earlier that I mentioned here,

01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:28.640
but I didn't mention
in this presentation--

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:30.470
when we talked about
depth perception,

01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:32.460
we talked about motion parallax.

01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:35.005
That's a very important
aspect of motion analysis.

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:39.160
Then secondly, the
majority of cells in V1

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:43.650
and most cells in MT are
directionally selective, OK?

01:13:43.650 --> 01:13:46.440
And an addition which
I mentioned earlier

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:49.410
is that they also show
velocity selectivity.

01:13:51.050 --> 01:13:54.180
Some V1 cells respond
to different directions

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:57.020
of movement for light and dark
edges, like the S2 type cell

01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:57.870
I showed you.

01:13:57.870 --> 01:14:01.270
And some cells are sensitive
to differential velocities

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:03.570
of movement, which
I didn't show.

01:14:03.570 --> 01:14:06.190
Then the accessory
optic system that

01:14:06.190 --> 01:14:11.200
begins with the retinal ganglion
cells of the cells of Dogiel

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:15.370
form three axes of
direction selectivity

01:14:15.370 --> 01:14:17.120
that correspond
to the three axes

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:19.000
of the semicircular canals.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.090
And they are involved in
generating pursuit eye

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:24.180
movements for image
stabilization.

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:28.770
Then one of the most important
tasks of motion analysis

01:14:28.770 --> 01:14:31.470
is motion parallax,
as it provides

01:14:31.470 --> 01:14:32.620
information about depth.

01:14:33.630 --> 01:14:36.005
Motion cues can provide
important information

01:14:36.005 --> 01:14:38.820
for object recognition,
often referred

01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:41.470
to as structure for motion.

01:14:41.470 --> 01:14:43.800
And stationary
stimuli that flicker

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:47.440
with various temporary signals
induce apparent motion,

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:49.580
of which I showed you
a lot of examples.

01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:52.750
And then we talked about
metacontrast masking,

01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:54.970
which is a phenomenon
that occurs

01:14:54.970 --> 01:14:59.280
when two stimuli share contours.

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:03.300
And when they're presented with
an interval which corresponds

01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:06.550
to apparent motion, you tend
not to see the first one.

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:11.540
Lastly, brightness masking
arises with overlapping stimuli

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:13.340
appearing in rapid succession.

01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:17.020
And this does not occur with
interocular presentation,

01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:19.830
proving that it's a
record of phenomenon.

01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:24.840
And it has to do with the fact
that the velocity with which

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:31.950
a stimulus activates the retinal
ganglion cells and hence,

01:15:31.950 --> 01:15:35.980
of course, the cortex, is much
much slower with dim stimuli

01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:37.160
then with bright ones.

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:39.610
And so bright
stimulus, in a sense

01:15:39.610 --> 01:15:44.270
overtakes the responses
to a dim and weak stimulus

01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:47.900
when the two successive
presentations are very rapid.

01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:50.600
OK, so that's the
end of it here, OK?

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:53.009
And I'll show you one
more motion effect.

01:15:53.009 --> 01:15:53.508
Ready?

01:15:56.690 --> 01:16:00.310
All right, so that is
the story for today.

01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:03.260
And next time,
you're going to have,

01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:07.040
as I said, a rapid
summary of what

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:10.360
we have covered in the
first half of this course.

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:14.590
And then the following
Wednesday, we

01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:18.495
are going to have the multiple
choice exam for the midterms.

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:24.540
OK, thank you kindly.
