00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.840
PROFESSOR: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:32.425 --> 00:00:34.810
Let us get started.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.860
The first thing we're
going to do today

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.920
is I'm going to finish up
what I didn't get a chance

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.270
to finish the last time, because
we ran over a little bit.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.960
And what we are going
to cover to begin with

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.180
is the lateral geniculate
nucleus of the thalamus.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.560
This is a structure
in the thalamus that

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.010
receives an extensive
input from the retina

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.250
from retinal ganglion cells.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.580
And it is a beautiful structure
that has several layers to it.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.570
And here is a picture
of one from a monkey.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.740
And this is a coronal section.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.260
I think you all
know a little bit

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.240
about the anatomy of the brain.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.910
If you cut slices this
way, it's coronal cuts.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.521
If you cut it this way,
it's sagittal cuts.

00:01:22.521 --> 00:01:23.020
OK?

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.780
So this is a coronal cut.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.090
A thin slice.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.740
And it shows what the
lateral geniculate nucleus

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.450
looks like when it's
cut about in its middle.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.390
And what you can say is
a bunch of layers here.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.460
There's six layers
as labeled here.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:47.570
And the top four layers are
called the parvocellular

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.440
layers.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.680
And the bottom two are called
the magnocellular layers.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.310
And the reason they
have these names

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.940
is because the cells--
this was stained.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.720
You can't see it that clearly.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.650
But the cells are much bigger
in the bottom two layers

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.317
than in the top four layers.

00:02:02.317 --> 00:02:03.900
And that's why these
are called parvo,

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.850
and these are called magno.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.310
Now, one of the important
discoveries that had been made,

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.150
and I'll belabor
that in a minute,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.550
is that these top
four layers get input

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.420
from the midget
cells of the retina,

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.680
and the bottom two get input
from the parasol cells.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.010
And we'll be talking about that
a great deal in the next few

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.930
lectures.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.740
Now, each of these layers
gets input from one eye.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.960
And there's an alternation.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.040
If you go from
layer six, this is

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.570
input for a contralateral line.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.480
Ipsilateral.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.440
Contralateral.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.190
Ipsilateral.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.230
Then there is a reversal.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.627
And this layer is
again ipsilateral.

00:02:39.627 --> 00:02:40.960
And this layer is contralateral.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.370
So that is the basic layout.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.900
And I might as well
anticipate to tell you

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.780
that if you study
the receptive field

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.460
organization of these cells,
they are very similar to those

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.130
that you see in the retina.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.160
You have midget cells.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.995
Parasol cells.

00:02:58.995 --> 00:03:00.710
You have center-surround
antagonism.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.010
So that there is not
much of a transform

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.640
at this level in the brain,
as the inputs progress

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.800
from the retina to the
lateral geniculate nucleus.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.530
But once we get
up to the cortex,

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.690
we will see many
major transforms

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.630
that I will come to shortly.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.110
Now, the layout of the
lateral geniculate nucleus

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.520
varies quite a bit from
species to species.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.070
In the market we have
this kind of arrangement.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.550
And this is very similar
to the kind of arrangement

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.490
we have in our own heads.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.370
But then if you look at-- well,
let me make one more point here

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.100
about this.

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:46.690
There's a beautiful
experiment that's

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.030
been done to confirm that
indeed the inputs to the parvo

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.410
and magnocellular
layers are coming

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.240
from different
cells in the retina.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.660
And so an experiment was done
in which a labeling material was

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.250
put into either
the parvocellular

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.420
layers or the
magnocellular layers,

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.290
as you can see here
on the right side.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:13.610
Then those labeling substances
were transported back

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:14.630
to the retina.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.190
And they labeled the cells
that project to the axons

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.640
into these two regions.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.810
And what you can see
here is that these

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.390
are smaller cells that project
to the parvocellular layers,

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.590
and much bigger cells that
project to the magnocellular

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:30.800
layers.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.980
And these correspond,
as other studies

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.670
have shown in more detail,
to the parasol cells.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.820
And these correspond
to the midget cells.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.490
So that's an important
distinction here of the inputs.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.895
And the other thing that's
important to realize here

00:04:48.895 --> 00:04:53.390
is that we talked about
how the eye is organizing,

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.810
and the way it projects
to the nasal and temple

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:56.660
parts of the retina.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.340
The left lateral
geniculate nucleus

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.890
sees the right half
of the visual field,

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.250
and right geniculate sees the
left half of the visual field.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.150
Now, let me say just a
few words about the fact

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.710
that there are different
kinds of geniculates.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.750
But they're not that different.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.050
So here's an example
of a tree shrew

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.520
lateral geniculate nucleus.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.380
It's shaped differently,
but it still

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.210
has these nice six layers.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.590
And the bottom two layers
again are magnocellular,

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.880
and the top four layers are
essentially parvocellular.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.820
But then when
recordings were made,

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.610
an interesting
specialization was

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.050
seen in this animal, which was
not that obvious in others.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.340
If you look at this here,
examine the question

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.400
to what degree are the cells
in these top four layers

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.220
on or off cells.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.210
And what you see here, that
when you look at layers three,

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.600
four, five, and six, there's
a huge distinction here.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.740
Virtually all the cells in
three and four are off cells,

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.730
and all the cells in five
and six are on cells.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.330
So there's a specialization
in the layers

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.300
as to whether the input is
from the on cells or off cells.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.330
And yet another animal has a
different kind of arrangement.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.740
I'm not going to go into
more details about this,

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.280
but again there's
six layers here.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.610
But here they don't seem to
have a distinction between magno

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.020
and parvocellular layers.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.560
Instead we have two
layers, five and four,

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.440
where the cells are very small.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.855
And the rest of the
layers are quite large.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.380
This is the galago.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.390
All right?

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:37.050
Now most thoroughly studied had
been the cat, and the monkey.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.700
And that's the kind
of stuff we are

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.490
going to talk about more as
we progress in the course.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:42.990
All right.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.380
So that in a very summary
form is the essence

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.460
of what that lateral
geniculate nucleus is like.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.060
Now, what I want
to do is I'm going

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.310
to have a quick
summary of what I've

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.060
covered in the first session.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.330
And here, first of all
again, is a drawing

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:05.150
of what the cells look
like in the retina.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.470
These are the photoreceptors.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.220
Remember the light is coming
in from the bottom up.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:09.890
OK?

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.960
And so if you look
at that, we find

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.230
that all the photoreceptors
hyperpolarize the light,

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.680
and they produce only
graded potentials.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.490
My last important fact
is that all these cells

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.880
use glutamate as the
neurotransmitter that

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.910
is released at the bottom here
of these cells, which then

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.530
innervates the
subsequent elements

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:36.110
in this retinal
picture here, which

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.150
are the horizontal cells
and the bipolar cells.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.330
So if you look at those,
the horizontal cells

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.623
are all hyperpolarized to light
just to the photoreceptors.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.710
And they also only
produce graded potentials.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.660
But then when we proceed, and
look at the bipolar cells,

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:55.270
there are two major
classes of bipolar cells

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:57.870
that I want to deal
with, and more.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.340
These are the important
ones from our point of view.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.930
The so-called on
and off bipolars.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.210
And that arises,
because the on bipolars

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:09.240
have signed inverting
synapses with which they

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.990
connect to the photoreceptors.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:17.170
Whereas the off bipolars have
signed conserving synapses.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.910
So the way to think of
this, if the photoreceptor

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:24.660
hyperpolarizes and depolarizes,
going up and down as the light

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.220
goes in and out,
an off cell will

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.000
mimic this, and go like this.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.330
But the on cell will
do the opposite.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:32.380
OK?

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.864
So we have created in the
retina, I shouldn't say we,

00:08:35.864 --> 00:08:39.669
but evolution has, from
a single-ended system

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:42.390
since they were hyperpolarized,
a double-ended system

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.480
at the level of
the bipolar cell.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.090
And that's what then creates
these famous on and off cells

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:50.010
that we are going to
talk about in a lot

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:52.620
more detail the next
time to try to figure out

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.935
why do we have these cells.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:55.430
All right.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:59.320
So that then is a summary
of the upper layers.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:05.040
And then when they come
down to the amacrine cells,

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.540
some of these amacrine cells
produce action potentials.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.000
Some don't.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.600
There are many different kinds,
as I mentioned the last time.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.510
There are more than
20 different kinds.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:15.210
Some are on.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:16.010
Some are off.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:17.240
Some are on-off.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:21.100
And some don't even give
you action potentials.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.860
Then finally when you come
down to the ganglion cells,

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.930
they all give you
action potentials.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.617
And the major two
classes that we

00:09:28.617 --> 00:09:30.950
are going to deal with a lot,
even though there are many

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.550
more, we'll talk about
some of them later,

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:37.190
are the midget cells
and the parasol cells.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.690
OK.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:41.470
So then to have an overall
summary of what we covered

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.540
the last time, first of
all, we had the right brain

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.200
receives input from the
left visual hemifield,

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.790
and the left from
the right hemifield.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.295
That, you understood
when I explained to you

00:09:52.295 --> 00:09:55.810
what the wiring is
like in the retina.

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.290
And then I pointed
out, just seeing

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:01.660
that, we have these five major
classes of retinal cells.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.570
We have the
photoreceptors themselves,

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.200
which are the rods
and the cords.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.790
And then we have the horizontal
cells, the bipolar cells,

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:12.080
the amacrine cells, and
the retinal ganglion cells.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.780
Hopefully, by
repeating this stuff,

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:17.001
eventually this will
stick into your brain.

00:10:17.001 --> 00:10:17.500
All right.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:22.300
So then the receptive fields,
or the retinal ganglion

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.690
cells, sometimes
referred to as RGCs,

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:27.800
have antagonistic centers
around organization.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.280
And then when we look at
the question of adaptation,

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.890
you can explain why on
earth did this evolve.

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:35.470
This complex arrangement.

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:39.040
Then there are several classes
of retinal ganglion cells.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.380
We have talked about the on and
off, the midget and parasol,

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.530
and we will later on talk
about several other classes.

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.220
Now, all photoreceptors
and horizontal cells

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.820
hyperpolarize the light.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.100
At that level you have
a single-ended system.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:56.210
But then when you come to
the bipolar cells, about half

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:59.380
of them are hyperpolarizing, and
half of them are depolarizing.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:06.740
And the opposition arises,
because the on bipolar cells

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.120
have an inverting
synapse, which is

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.180
due to their
intersynaptic junction

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:17.430
where their receptors
are made of molecules,

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:18.610
which is called the mGluR6.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.242
And we'll talk about that
in more detail next time.

00:11:22.242 --> 00:11:23.700
The action potentials
in the retina

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.960
are generated by only amacrine
cells and retinal ganglion

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:27.960
cells.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.900
The lateral geniculate nucleus
that we have talked about

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.530
is a laminated structure,
but desegregating lamina

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:37.800
varies with species just
as I pointed out to you.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.950
The parvocellular layers receive
input from the midget cells,

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.600
and the magnocellular layers
from the parasol cells

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.280
in the monkey, and in the human.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.380
OK?

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.859
The inputs in the left and right
are segregated into lamina,

00:11:50.859 --> 00:11:52.400
as I have already
pointed out to you.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.720
Lastly, the receptive
few properties

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.960
of lateral geniculate
cells are similar to those

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.000
that you see in the
retina ganglion cells.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.020
You don't have any
major transforms.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:03.520
OK.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.556
So that's then what we have an
initial understanding of when

00:12:07.556 --> 00:12:10.770
it comes to the retina, and
the lateral geniculate nucleus.

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:15.570
We are now going to proceed,
hang on for a minute,

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:22.020
to the visual cortex.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:22.540
All right.

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:26.445
So we are going to talk
about the visual cortex.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:34.380
OK.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.200
So the first thing we are going
to talk about that pertains

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:41.490
to the visual cortex is
V1, this initial area

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:43.850
that gets most of
the input directly

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:46.860
from the lateral
geniculate nucleus.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.440
And we're going to
look at this first

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.740
from an anatomical
point of view.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.560
And then we're going to look
at it progressively more

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.430
from a functional point of view.

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.970
OK.

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:58.410
So here once again
is a monkey brain.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.830
You're going to see this monkey
brain over and over again,

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.490
and gradually will
become familiar with it.

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:07.430
I want to point out to you that
this here is a central sulcus.

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:09.670
Just like we have a central
sulcus, so do monkeys.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.961
And then this area here is
called the lunate sulcus.

00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:15.460
And then in front
here, we are going

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.590
to talk about this region.

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:18.410
It's called the
frontal eye fields.

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:19.420
There are two.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.550
The soft side, the
principalis, and the arcuate.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.560
So you're going to see
this over and over again.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.580
There's not too many
things to remember here.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.590
But it will grow,
because I will have

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:30.190
to talk about more
and more areas

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.030
as we progress in the course.

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:34.670
Now, here is area V1.

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:36.950
And as I pointed
out to you before,

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:40.990
this region is in the
monkey lissencephalic,

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.270
meaning it's mostly flat.

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:45.770
And because of that,
its spatial layout

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.970
is fairly easy to understand.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.530
So the first thing
you want to do

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:53.680
is to understand this spatial
layout of the structure.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.270
And to do that people have
done all sorts of experiments.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:01.400
Here is one that has
done the spatial layout.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.520
Initially, the way
this was done was

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.700
kind of a difficult undertaking.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.560
They used single
microelectrodes,

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.020
and they would systematically
move the microelectrodes here,

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.170
and all across.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:15.750
And then they would map out
where the receptive field was.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:16.730
OK?

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.630
So if they did that, they
found that in this region

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:24.480
here the fovea is represented.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:31.430
And then as you progress towards
the center of the brain, what

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:35.290
you find is the center of the
hemisphere I should really say.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:39.600
You progress to
about 80 degrees out.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.630
And this is the
horizontal meridian.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:43.950
And this below
here, and above it,

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:46.660
is the vertical meridian
that goes around.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:47.250
OK?

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:50.750
So what is represented,
as you had already seen,

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:54.160
you're representing
each hemisphere,

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.780
half the visual field.

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:57.790
So what you have is this.

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:58.680
OK?

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.540
This is the horizontal meridian.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.880
This is the upper part.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.560
This is the lower part.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:04.370
OK?

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:07.560
But that is inverted
on the retina,

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.630
as well is inverted
on the visual cortex.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:12.820
All right.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.030
So that's the basic layout.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:19.450
But now what happened, as it
always happens in science,

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:21.690
new methods were
developed to study

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:24.970
this in more detail,
and more reliably.

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.150
And one of the methods
that was developed

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:33.120
is to do a combined action,
and then chemical experiment,

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.510
in which the eyes
were stimulated.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:40.555
Then they were fixed, and one
of the neurons were active.

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:43.800
Took up the substance
that was injected

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:50.010
into the bloodstream, which then
could be labeled subsequently.

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:52.330
So I'm going to show you
what this arrangement is.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.700
This is what the
monkey is looking at.

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.550
This is the half of
the visual field that

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:59.710
is being studied,
because you're looking

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.750
at the contralateral hemisphere.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.915
And then what is being
done in these experiments

00:16:04.915 --> 00:16:07.570
is that you alternate the
black and white stripes

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:08.205
back and forth.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.840
So you can see if that's
sort of a flicker.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.300
And you keep doing this
for an hour or two.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.960
And as a result
of this, the cells

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:22.070
that are activated
by this take up

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:24.120
this substance
that is being used,

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.170
which is called
2DG, 2-Deoxyglucose.

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:30.074
And then subsequently
you can label that.

00:16:30.074 --> 00:16:31.490
So now what we are
going to do, we

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:34.350
can look at what the
label looks like.

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:38.065
And here is this beautiful
example of this work.

00:16:38.065 --> 00:16:40.140
Here is a foveal area.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.340
This is about 7
or 8 degrees out.

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:42.950
OK?

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:45.631
So if you go back-- oops.

00:16:45.631 --> 00:16:46.130
Sorry.

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:56.280
This outermost half disk
is one that you see here.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.350
OK?

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:00.280
So now we have a very
clear understanding,

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:04.670
which we can do quantitatively,
of what the spatial layout is

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:07.310
of the visual field on
the retinal surface.

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:12.656
And one important point that
I want you to remember today,

00:17:12.656 --> 00:17:14.030
and we will discuss
it again when

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:19.020
we talk about visual prosthesis,
is that much more brain area

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:23.530
is devoted to central vision,
because of course the many more

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:26.589
cells in the fovea
than in the periphery.

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:29.710
And the cortex itself is
of constant thickness.

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:32.820
It's about roughly 2
millimeters in thickness.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:34.950
And so you need to
give it more space

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:37.280
in this lissencephalic
brain to accept

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.850
all that input from
the foveal region.

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:44.060
And so much more area is
devoted to foveal vision

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.570
than to peripheral vision.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:47.620
All right.

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.710
So that then is
the spatial layout.

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:53.010
And then if we look
at a cross section

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:57.010
of the visual
cortical regions here,

00:17:57.010 --> 00:18:01.280
this includes several cortical
areas, this one right here,

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.710
and this region here
is so-called area V1.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.620
Now, an interesting
discovery was

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:10.490
made by a person
called Gennari, who

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.420
discovered when he used
this kind of Nissl stain

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.100
that when you look at V1,
there seems to be almost

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:21.130
what looks like an extra
stripe, which gets labeled.

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:24.000
And as soon as we get here,
as you can see, this point,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.450
it stops here.

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:29.720
And that defines, this extra
layer, this stria of Gennari

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.220
defines area 17 anatomically.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:35.970
If you get here, you
suddenly get to area V2,

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:37.680
so V2 starts here.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.570
So even with a simple
anatomical technique,

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:44.990
you can tell what is area
V1, and area V2, and so on.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.490
OK.

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:50.930
So now, if we take a cross
section of the visual cortex,

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:55.530
which I've said is about 2
millimeters in thickness, OK?

00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:03.450
People have divided this region,
this so-called gray matter.

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:04.730
Why is it called gray matter?

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:07.470
It's called gray matter,
because most of the cells

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:12.150
there are not coded.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:17.070
Whereas if you go below, you
have all the coded fibers

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.200
that are coming in.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.550
So this gray matter
then has been

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:24.010
divided into six subdivisions.

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:25.900
Layers one through six.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:27.800
In this case from the
top down instead of

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.550
in the genicular point,
so from the bottom up.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:33.080
And these layers,
subsequently, were

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.280
realized they're more
than six layers, really.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.100
And that's why it became
4A, 4B, 4CF, or 4C-beta.

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:44.960
Now the 4C-alpha and beta is a
region that gets a lot of input

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.350
directly from the lateral
geniculate nucleus.

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:49.060
And what the nature
of that input is,

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.730
I'm going to show you here.

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:53.050
Once again, here's the
lateral geniculate nucleus.

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:54.170
The six layers.

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:57.200
The four parvocellular, and
two magnocellular layers.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.510
And then what we can do, is
we can trace how that connect.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:02.660
This has been done both
physiologically and

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:03.790
anatomically.

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:08.030
And it shows that the
four top layers terminate

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:10.970
for the most part, almost
exclusive, but not 100%,

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:14.310
but pretty closely into
layers of so-called 4C-alpha.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:20.030
Whereas when you come to
the two bottom layers, OK?

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:22.360
The so-called
magnocellular layers,

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.920
they terminate in 4C-beta.

00:20:24.844 --> 00:20:26.260
So some of these
things are almost

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.510
like an inversion
from here to there.

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:29.760
OK?

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.270
And then another
thing we haven't

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:34.420
talked about before is that also
some cells, even though they're

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:39.220
not numerous, that reside
in between the layers

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.690
of the lateral
geniculate nucleus,

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:43.345
are called the
koniocellular cells.

00:20:44.719 --> 00:20:46.510
But you don't have to
worry about that now.

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:48.670
You don't have to remember
that at this point.

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:50.960
But we'll talk about it later.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.145
But when you do look
at them, what you find

00:20:53.145 --> 00:20:56.160
is that they project
into the upper part

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:00.950
of the visual cortex, both from
the parvocellular interlaminar

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:03.880
layers, and the magnocellular
interlaminar layers.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.380
So as you might
expect, things are

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.470
complicated when it
comes to the brain.

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:10.347
And there are just all
kinds of connections,

00:21:10.347 --> 00:21:11.930
and you're trying
to make sense of it,

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:15.470
and understand the reasons as to
why we have these connections,

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:16.670
and what the functions are.

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:24.770
All right.

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:29.610
So now, we are going to take
a big step forward, and begin

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:35.030
to look at the functional
aspects of area V1.

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:35.590
OK?

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.730
Oops.

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:36.230
Sorry.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:38.800
Hang on.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:39.459
Here we are.

00:21:39.459 --> 00:21:41.250
We are going to look
at the receptive field

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:42.690
organization of cells.

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:44.020
So how do you do that?

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:47.580
What you do is you can stick
either a single electrode,

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:50.560
or multiple electrodes
into the visual cortex.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.330
And then you can map
out the receptive fields

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:55.220
to see how they respond.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:56.250
OK?

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:58.640
Now, this was an
interesting story

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.360
in the beginning when
this kind of search

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:04.640
went on, because there were two
major groups that were trying

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.300
to understand what the
visual responses are

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:08.510
like in the visual cortex.

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:11.130
And this was not
even that long ago.

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:16.480
This was in the
1930s, '40s, and '50s.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:21.050
So what was done in
two areas, and one

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:24.600
was in Germany,
what they did there,

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:30.120
they kind of followed in the
spirit of Keffer Hartline.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.650
And they shone light into
the eye, diffused light.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:38.230
And they recorded from V1, and
they couldn't derive any cells

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:41.260
to the extent that
some people said,

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.670
I think people have
made a major mistake.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:47.330
That stuff back here,
that's not a visual area.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:48.900
It's something else.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:54.660
But then, pretty much at the
same time, another group,

00:22:54.660 --> 00:23:01.860
initially at Johns Hopkins,
and subsequently at Harvard,

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.830
did similar experiments.

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:06.650
But what happened was, it's
almost an amusing story.

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:09.910
The people who did that
were Hubel and Wiesel.

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:13.160
And when they first
went to Johns Hopkins,

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.760
they worked with a
person's name I've

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.830
mentioned before,
I think, Kuffler,

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:19.450
who discovered
center-surround antagonism.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:22.840
And Kuffler did experiments
similar in technique,

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:27.280
in terms of activating
the eye, that

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.590
had been done by Keffer
Hartline, which shine light

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:31.080
into the eye.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.390
Not necessarily diffused
light, but spots of light

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:37.570
that he would move around
on the retinal surface.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:40.270
This was a very complicated
piece of equipment.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:46.590
And so when Hubel and Wiesel
went to become postdocs

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:50.470
with Kuffler, they said,
my god, what is this?

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:52.860
We don't know how
to work this stuff.

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:56.050
Let's do something different,
so we can handle it.

00:23:56.050 --> 00:24:01.700
And so what they decided to
do, and this may sound crazy--

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.430
Let me explain one more thing.

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:06.530
When these experiments were
done in the cat, with the way

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:08.430
the experiment was
done, that the cat was

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:11.540
put upside down on
a table like this.

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:12.410
Like that.

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:13.878
And the light was shone into it.

00:24:13.878 --> 00:24:14.378
OK?

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:17.850
With a piece of
equipment from above,

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:21.340
and you could even look
at it through a microscope

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:24.294
to see how that light
was shone into the eye.

00:24:25.656 --> 00:24:29.020
So Hubel and Wiesel said,
you can't handle this.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.810
But I tell you what
we'll do instead.

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:35.120
You'll take a bed sheet, and
put it up on the ceiling.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.400
And then we'll take a projector,
and move the light around

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.600
like this.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.100
OK?

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.710
Now, the projector they used was
like an old fashioned camera.

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:45.430
And you could put
a slide in there,

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:47.170
and move the slide in and out.

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:48.160
OK?

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.070
And so they would,
first of all, just

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:51.777
had the whole lights come on.

00:24:51.777 --> 00:24:54.110
And they kept recording, and
they wouldn't get anything.

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:55.270
They said, oh my god.

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:58.922
Those people in
Germany are right.

00:24:58.922 --> 00:25:00.740
These cells don't
respond to light.

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.220
What's going on?

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:07.410
And then one day, as they were
fiddling around with this,

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:11.030
Torsten Wiesel
pulled out a slide

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:12.610
to put a different slide in.

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:15.580
And when he pulled
that slide out,

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:19.090
they displayed the sound
of the action potentials.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.380
Like that.

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.210
What on earth was that?

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:24.620
And so they did it repeated.

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:28.390
[HIGH-PITCHED BEEPING SOUND]
Like that.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:30.950
And guess what that resulted in?

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:35.000
That finding [INAUDIBLE] logic
that resulted in the Nobel

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.760
Prize he and Hubel got,
because they discovered

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:45.455
that cells' individual cortex
are orientation selective.

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:47.590
OK?

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:51.980
Meaning that each cell responds
to a particular orientation

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.350
of an edge.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:55.710
And this was an
incredible transformation,

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:57.470
which we saw in the
retina, and what

00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:01.060
you had seen in the
lateral geniculate nucleus.

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:05.360
So what they then did, they
became systematic about it,

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:09.560
and mapped out the receptive
field organization of cells.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.920
And they discovered two
majors classes of cells,

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.990
they called the simple
cells, and the complex cells.

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:19.170
The simple cells were
distinctive in the sense,

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:21.470
first of all, all
these types of cells

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:23.230
were orientation specific.

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:25.220
I want to find the
appropriate orientation

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:29.830
by moving the edge around until
you get the best response.

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:31.460
Then you could do
the very small spot.

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:35.290
You could activate
the cell, but not as

00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:38.390
effectively as with the ball
moving, of course, but still

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:39.270
quite well.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:40.980
And they found that
there was a center

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:45.970
region in this kind of simple
cell that gave an on response,

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:48.830
and a surround region
that gave an off response.

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:51.570
And then they
found another class

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:56.940
of simple cells, in which the
left half in this case was on,

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:58.980
and the right half was off.

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.010
And there were
variations of this,

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:05.010
I'll mention those in a
bit more detail later,

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:09.990
indicating that the input
from the on and off systems

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:13.160
may be separate, or they
[? sub ?] some interaction

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.800
that makes for their
specificity for orientation.

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:22.500
Now then, they also discovered
another class of cells called

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.640
complex that on the
whole tended to have

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:27.500
a bit larger receptive fields.

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.270
And in these cells, even
when you use small spots,

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:32.780
no matter where
you stimulate it,

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.430
you got both on and off
responses intermingled.

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:40.770
So you did not have
a spatial separation

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:42.615
of the on and the off responses.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.640
Now what exactly we mean
by on and off responses

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:50.690
we will discuss for the
whole session next time.

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:51.190
OK.

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:55.190
So now, let me explain to you
how you do these experiments.

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:58.680
Once you get a little bit more
sophisticated, and instead

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.510
of just using a projector
that you reflect the light

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:04.590
with by hand, you can
do this on a computer.

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:05.230
OK?

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:08.320
And that indeed was
a big step forward.

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:15.620
I would say in the early 1960s,
maybe late '50s or early '60s,

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:20.340
people became computerized as
we had especially here at MIT.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:24.710
And the first set of computers
that were used to enable us

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:29.031
to quantitatively measure these
attributes in the visual cortex

00:28:29.031 --> 00:28:30.280
were the so-called PDP-11/10s.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.600
Subsequently, PDP-11/20s.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.225
Subsequently then PDP-11/34s.

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:42.650
Some of you may have heard about
these ancient old computers

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:44.820
that practically
nobody uses anymore,

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:46.800
because of all the
advances that have

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.130
been made in
computer technology.

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:52.020
So what you did then
using a variety of means,

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:54.330
I don't have to describe
that in detail, is

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:58.160
to move a bar of light
across the receptive

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.180
field in different orientations.

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:01.740
So here's an example here.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.030
You first use very
small spots, and you

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:06.160
find the receptive field.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.030
And then after,
because the cells

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:10.120
do respond to very
small spots of light.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.940
But they don't respond
at all to larger spots.

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:15.320
And once you've found
the receptive field, what

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.240
you can do is you
can take a bar,

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.940
and move it across it in
different orientations,

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:20.830
like this.

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:22.565
So here's a direct example.

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:25.690
Like that.

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:26.300
OK?

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.150
So as soon as it's
been across the field,

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:29.445
the cell responded vigorously.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.280
And so if we then did
it systematically,

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:39.150
as I've shown here, you can
generate an orientation tuning

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:40.960
function, it is called.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.470
So you can quantitatively
establish just

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:46.410
how sharply specific
a cell like this

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:48.830
is to different orientations.

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:51.690
So to do that here is an
example of that in a second.

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:54.460
Here is an example.

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:58.270
What you can see here is
when you move the ball down,

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:00.400
you get a huge response here.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:04.020
And then we get rapidly
progressively less

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:05.340
of a response.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:08.960
And then you can establish
by taking the half height,

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:12.815
or whatever point here, what
the width is of this function.

00:30:12.815 --> 00:30:15.720
And then you can plot
that for hundreds of cells

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:19.390
to establish just how
sharply they are tuned,

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:23.030
or how different types of cells,
say simple and complex, how

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:24.790
sharp they are tuned.

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:27.120
Now, that was only
quite amazing.

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.740
But then if you
look at this figure,

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:32.470
I want you guys to be
my best detectives.

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:35.080
I bet you all of you are
best detectives, right?

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.310
So if you are, you
have to tell me

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:40.270
what else is in this figure
that tells you something

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:42.890
more about this cell that
is not just orientation.

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:50.550
Yes.

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:52.554
AUDIENCE: Also, the
direction as well.

00:30:52.554 --> 00:30:53.220
PROFESSOR: A-ha.

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:54.150
There we go.

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:55.010
Best detective.

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:55.510
OK.

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:56.750
Is that your middle name?

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:57.560
Best detective?

00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:57.960
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:58.330
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:30:58.330 --> 00:30:58.940
Very good.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:01.600
So what you see here,
if this cell only

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:05.687
were orientation selective, you
should get another peak here,

00:31:05.687 --> 00:31:07.270
because you have the
same orientation,

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:09.330
but moving upward, like this.

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:09.830
OK?

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:11.660
But you don't have
anything like that.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:12.990
So what does that mean?

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:15.850
That means that this
particular cell is not

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:19.995
only orientation specific, but
it is also direction specific.

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:22.910
Now that's quite something.

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:25.440
And the overwhelming
majority of cells

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.459
in the visual cortex in V1 are
direction selective, as well,

00:31:30.459 --> 00:31:32.250
in addition to being
orientation selective.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.640
And then when you
go to other areas,

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.480
as we'll see in
just a minute, there

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.270
are some areas in which
virtually all the cells

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:42.330
are direction selective.

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:45.160
So direction cell
activity becomes

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:50.970
an inherent central attribute
of visual processing,

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:54.850
as revealed by the fact that all
the cells, I shouldn't say all,

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:57.890
but so many of the cells
in the visual cortex

00:31:57.890 --> 00:31:59.581
have that attribute.

00:31:59.581 --> 00:32:00.080
OK.

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:04.410
So now, what we can do
is ask the next question.

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:08.680
Now, are there other
attributes in the cells

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:13.500
of the visual cortex that
are selective [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.590
some other attribute
of the visual scene?

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:19.450
So far we have orientation,
and we have direction.

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:22.230
So another one that
has been studied

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:26.520
is spatial frequency
selectivity.

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.170
Now, how do you do that?

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:31.220
The most common way
this had been done

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.000
is to use sinusoidal gratings.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.067
An example of that
is shown here.

00:32:35.067 --> 00:32:37.150
But you could use also
[? square-wave ?] gradings,

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:40.610
or sinusoidal gratings work
extremely well for a variety

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:41.220
of reasons.

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:42.960
We will talk about that later.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.630
And what you do
then on each trial,

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:48.130
as you move this back and
forth across the receptive

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:50.060
field in the
optimal orientation,

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:52.930
you can vary the
spatial frequency.

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:55.090
You can make it extremely
high, or extremely low.

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:56.730
This is obviously very low.

00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:57.560
OK?

00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.510
And if you do that
systematically once again,

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:04.080
using a computer system that
can establish to what degree

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:07.480
are cells specific to
different spatial frequencies.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.000
Everybody understand that?

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:09.570
OK.

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:11.540
So let me show you what happens.

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:13.480
Here is an example
of a simple cell,

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.660
and here's an example
of a complex cell.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:19.690
Here we have different spatial
frequencies on each line,

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:21.540
as specified in here.

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:24.740
And it shows that both
of these types of cells

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:28.350
respond to some in-between
level of spatial frequency

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:31.980
selectivity, and don't
respond at the extremes.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:35.630
So that means that these
cortical cells, in addition

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:37.930
to being orientation
and direction selective,

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:40.300
are also spatial
frequency selective.

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:44.840
And that had lead to
many interesting ideas

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:49.680
about what is the coding
operation in the visual cortex

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.200
that enables you to see.

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.525
And that we will
discuss some more later.

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:55.240
OK.

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:58.320
The other important feature
here that is worth mentioning

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:05.070
is that simple cells respond
selectively to each phase,

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:08.827
whereas complex cells respond
in a more general fashion.

00:34:08.827 --> 00:34:10.250
OK?

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:10.750
All right.

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:14.823
So now, we can
summarize, and I'm

00:34:14.823 --> 00:34:16.489
going to add a couple
more things to it,

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:19.964
of what the major
so-called transforms are

00:34:19.964 --> 00:34:22.040
in the visual cortex.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.330
And this is remarkable as
you go from the geniculate

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:27.189
to the visual cortex,
and suddenly there

00:34:27.189 --> 00:34:30.860
are all these
transforms that somehow

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.400
will enable you to
see things better.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.710
So the first one of course,
we talked about a lot,

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:36.940
is orientation.

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:38.370
Next one is direction.

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:39.739
Then spatial frequency.

00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:41.670
Those are the three I
gave you examples of.

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:44.690
But now, one thing I
haven't mentioned so far

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:47.570
is that you have
also a transform

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:49.400
in terms of binocularity.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.790
As I mentioned to you that
already, in the geniculate

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:56.080
you have specificity
by layers of input

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.860
from the left and
right eyes, which

00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:01.160
means that those cells
in each of those layers

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.701
are driven only by one eye.

00:35:02.701 --> 00:35:03.200
OK?

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.170
They have a monocular.

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:07.940
But now when you come
up to the cortex,

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:12.590
the numerous cells once you
get above the major input

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:15.910
layers, 4CL from there or
below, most of the cells

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:18.750
there can be driven
binocularly, meaning

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:22.585
they get an input
from both eyes.

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:27.020
And we shall examine
what that is.

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:30.010
And another thing that
we have that you already

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:32.400
must have inferred on the
basis looking at the receptive

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:36.850
fields, that there is a
dramatic ON/OFF convergence.

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:38.434
In complex terms,
it's so complete

00:35:38.434 --> 00:35:39.725
that it's totally intermingled.

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:43.860
So the cell responds to on and
off by the way you present it.

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:46.010
The simple cells also
respond to on and off,

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:48.550
but there's a small
spatial separation

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:51.680
between the on and
off sub region.

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:58.054
Now in addition, that we
will encounter also later,

00:35:58.054 --> 00:35:59.720
some of the cells,
not all of the cells,

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:02.420
but some of the cells
in the visual cortex

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:06.280
get a convergent in both the
midget and parasol cells,

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:09.900
while others get an input
only from one or the other.

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:16.190
So that further highlights
the extensive increase

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:18.470
of complexity, and
analysis that is

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:21.610
being performed in
the visual cortex.

00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:22.230
OK.

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:26.970
So now, to sort of schematize
about this, what we can say

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:28.010
is the following.

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:31.710
We can say here is
that we have a cell

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:35.150
in primary visual cortex, in V1.

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:35.950
OK?

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:37.730
And many of these
cells, most of them,

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:41.530
get an input from both the
left and the right eyes,

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:43.400
as shown here.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.540
They also get an
input, many of them,

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:49.790
that are convergent from the
parasol and midget system.

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:54.360
And then the output
of these cells,

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.800
in some fashion or
other, should be

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.890
able to tell us, either
from the same cell

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:01.250
or from separate cells
that we've examined,

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:05.400
tell us about luminance, color,
orientation, spatial frequency,

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.360
depth and motion.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:12.790
So those are some of the major
tasks a cortical cell performs,

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:14.540
so that you can see.

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.820
So that then is a
very general scheme

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:20.760
that we are then
going to examine

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.055
in considerably more detail.

00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:25.590
All right.

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:28.350
So now, we take
another step forward.

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:31.700
The question came up.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:39.190
How are these things in general,
these attributes and whatnot,

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:41.700
arranged in the visual cortex?

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.710
Is everything just
helter skelter,

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:47.110
or is there spatial separation
among various attributes?

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:50.800
And this is yet another
major line of research

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:54.289
that Hubel and Wiesel had done,
for which they got the Nobel

00:37:54.289 --> 00:37:56.205
Prize, as well as for
their other discoveries.

00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:05.331
I think they got the Nobel
Prize in 1983, I believe it was.

00:38:05.331 --> 00:38:05.830
OK.

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:07.957
So this is called
cytoarchitecture.

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:10.510
OK?

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:17.960
Your ability to understand what
the layout is of the functional

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:22.211
attributes of the cells
in the visual cortex.

00:38:22.211 --> 00:38:22.710
All right.

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:24.870
So let me, first
of all, tell you

00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:27.700
the initial experiment
Hubel and Wiesel had done.

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:33.100
What they did is they would
inject a label into one eye.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:36.780
And then if they
waited a week or so,

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:40.070
you would get
transneuronal transport,

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:43.080
meaning that the label
would go to the geniculate,

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:47.250
and that label would transport
to the cells in the geniculate,

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:50.440
and then would go up
to the visual cortex.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.930
And so when they looked
at this, put the input

00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:57.290
into the left eye,
what they found

00:38:57.290 --> 00:39:02.220
was in the cortex of
the cat in this case,

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:04.250
you see these
alternations, you can

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:06.500
label them unlabeled regions.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:08.185
And the labels in
unlabeled regions

00:39:08.185 --> 00:39:09.685
are pretty much
equally distributed.

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:15.300
The assumption therefore is,
and that was proven of course,

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.510
that if you were to
label both sides,

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:20.390
then you would get
a continuous label.

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:25.135
These include areas, or if
you labeled the other eye,

00:39:25.135 --> 00:39:28.710
you would get the
dark areas labeled.

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:33.730
So this established then that
we have an orderly arrangement

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:39.679
of, if you will, ocular
dominance columns.

00:39:39.679 --> 00:39:40.720
That's what it is called.

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.160
Ocular dominance columns.

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.250
Now, this is a cross section.

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:48.640
So now, what you can do is
do a similar experiment.

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.850
Unless you're doing
a cross section,

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:56.150
you can take the brain, and
make horizontal cuts across it.

00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:58.190
Now, the brain is slightly
curved, of course,

00:39:58.190 --> 00:40:00.040
depending on the
species how much.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:04.160
And so, when you make these
very thin cross sections,

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.750
they will only tell you about
that particular cross section.

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:09.470
But then you can
put them together.

00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:12.190
You can take a montage.

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:13.710
So let me explain that to you.

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:18.530
Here is a single
section of the left eye

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:21.520
columns that are
labeled in the monkey.

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.830
So in other words to
repeat, you inject a label

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:26.970
into the left eye.

00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:29.620
Then that is transported
transneuronally

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:32.480
to the visual cortex, and
this is how it lights up.

00:40:34.094 --> 00:40:35.510
But now what you
can do is you can

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:37.500
take each of these sections.

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:38.680
There are many sections.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:42.060
I told you the cortex is about
2 millimeters in thickness.

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:42.780
OK?

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:45.220
So we can take a huge
number of sections

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:49.090
across, depending on how thick
or thin you want to cut it.

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:52.660
And then you can
label each of these,

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.680
and then you can
superimpose them.

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:57.020
And this is what
we call a montage.

00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:03.560
In this case we have five layers
that have been superimposed,

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:05.250
so you can see it.

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:08.950
Now, these columns
here, so-called, it's

00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:12.590
a column because it goes through
the thickness of the cortex,

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:18.050
are then ocular
dominance columns.

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:18.550
OK?

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:20.200
Ocular dominance columns.

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:24.850
We will next examine
whether they're also

00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:27.080
columns for orientation.

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.861
That's why I said orientation.

00:41:28.861 --> 00:41:29.360
OK.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.650
Anyway, so we have
this arrangement.

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:36.600
And these often have been
called zebra stripes,

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:38.550
because it looks like a zebra.

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:42.440
And that helps as a mnemonic
device to remember this.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:45.659
Now, what you can
do is to examine

00:41:45.659 --> 00:41:46.950
this a bit more systematically.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.730
And if you do that,
we can draw together

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:54.300
a huge section of
the visual cortex.

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:56.880
This is the fovea
again, in this case.

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:59.220
This is about 80 degrees out.

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:03.310
And so this is a section that
was put together in the Hubel

00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:06.480
Wiesel Laboratory at
Harvard, showing you

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.195
that the thickness of them
is constant throughout.

00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:13.360
And then to understand what
they're talking about in terms

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:17.470
of size, here we have
David Hubel's thumbprint.

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:18.070
OK?

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:19.670
So if you look at
your thumbprint,

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:22.900
the spatial frequency here
is about twice roughly,

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:25.330
twice that you have here.

00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:28.050
So again, if you look
at your thumb like this,

00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:32.050
it can give you a sense
of how unbelievably fine

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:34.350
these columns are in
the visual cortex.

00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:34.850
OK?

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:37.840
So that's basically the layout.

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:42.380
So now, the next big
question came up in the work

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:45.790
that Hubel and Wiesel
originally did,

00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:56.096
was whether you also had
columns for orientation.

00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:59.370
So how do you do that?

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:03.840
Well, another
technique has evolved,

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.990
and everything that you
discover in this business

00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:11.010
heavily depends on you
being able to come up

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:12.680
with a new technique,
or somebody else,

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.790
and use a technique
they invented.

00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:17.350
And when you do that,
almost inevitably you

00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:19.410
can make a major discovery.

00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:23.380
But if you're not sensitive
to new technologies,

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:24.880
then it's unlikely
that you're going

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.130
to make a major new discovery.

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:29.970
So you've got to keep your
nose to the grindstone,

00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:31.370
and constantly
look, and say what

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:33.270
is the latest discovery
in many techniques.

00:43:34.401 --> 00:43:34.900
All right.

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:37.980
So if you do that, one of the
remarkable techniques that

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:41.110
had been developed
is to use a substance

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:45.314
called 2-deoxyglucose
that I'm not

00:43:45.314 --> 00:43:46.730
going to go into
details about it.

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:50.950
It's radioactively
labeled as well,

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:53.540
and what you inject
in the bloodstream.

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:58.370
And then what happens is that
those cells in the brain that

00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:03.010
are highly active, absorb
more of this 2-deoxyglucose

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:05.110
than those cells
that are inactive.

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:08.260
And so if you do
that, the experiment

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:12.710
you would do to look at the
selectivity for orientation,

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:15.380
is you take an animal,
unless it is paralyzed,

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:22.420
and present for an hour
vertically oriented set

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:25.580
of bars, or signs of
gratings that keep moving,

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:27.040
and keep moving,
and keep moving.

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:35.190
And then those cells that are,
in this case going this way,

00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:37.400
have selected the
horizontal orientation.

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:40.190
Those will take up a lot
more of this 2-deoxyglucose,

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:42.730
and therefore that would
be heavily labeled.

00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:45.880
So then the question is,
what does that look like?

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:47.730
And so if you do that
kind of experiment,

00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:51.150
let me skip that, here's
an experiment like that,

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:53.130
and this happens to
be the tree shrew.

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:55.530
It shows that in
this case, when you

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:58.520
use one particular
orientation that you

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:02.940
get these stripes, which
reflect those cells

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:06.720
in the visual cortex in
the column arrangement

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.420
that respond best
to that orientation.

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:12.140
So therefore, if
this is horizontal,

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:15.200
the ones in between with
these cells are vertical.

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.040
All right?

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:19.990
So if you then do this
systematically in the monkey,

00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:23.060
you can see exactly
what that looks like.

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:26.250
And then you can ask the
big question that was posed.

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:31.510
What is the relationship between
orientation selectivity columns

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:34.350
and ocular dominance columns?

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:38.280
So that was then done
by a set of experiments,

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:40.340
also in the
Hubel-Wiesel Laboratory.

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:43.980
And I'm proud to say
that the prime person who

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:47.460
did that experiment was one
of my former students, who

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:50.200
got his PhD in my
laboratory, Michael Stryker.

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.040
And so he did these experiments.

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:58.190
And so in a way,
the experiment was

00:45:58.190 --> 00:46:02.130
done to test a
hypothesis that was

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:04.510
proposed by Huber and Wiesel.

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:07.174
And let me interject
at this point, that one

00:46:07.174 --> 00:46:08.590
of the important
things to realize

00:46:08.590 --> 00:46:12.470
is that you do not want to fall
in love with your hypotheses,

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:17.560
because in most cases the
hypothesis that you dream up,

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:20.520
so to speak, out of
thin air, will end up

00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:23.050
being wrong when it
comes to the brain.

00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:25.350
So in this case,
this also happened.

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:27.330
This is the model
they came up with.

00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:31.650
They proposed that you had
what we call an ice cube

00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:37.260
model, which in one direction
specifies orientation columns,

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:39.905
and in the other direction,
ocular dominance columns.

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:42.620
So this is the ice cube model.

00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:45.480
And now that you had this
model, this hypothesis,

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:46.710
you could test it.

00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:52.110
And the way this was tested
was to use the same procedures

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:55.560
I described to you, but
do it in the same brain.

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:56.190
All right?

00:46:56.190 --> 00:47:02.490
And so here's an example of here
we have a part of the brain,

00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:06.140
again looking at it
from the top down, which

00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:08.820
had been labeled for both
orientation and ocular

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:10.120
dominance columns.

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:12.250
And then you take
that same brain,

00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:15.335
and you label it for
orientation columns.

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:23.170
So now, if your hypothesis is
correct, let me clarify this,

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:25.850
if you say that they are
right angles to each other,

00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:29.980
then you would expect that if
you have a bunch of orientation

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:34.870
columns, the ocular
dominance columns

00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:36.290
should be at right angles to it.

00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:37.190
Right?

00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:39.910
And so if you label this,
and then can draw it out,

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:43.320
you can see whether or not
that hypothesis is correct.

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:48.050
And when you did that, here is
a real example of what they did.

00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:51.470
One of these is orientation,
and the thick ones

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:54.730
and the thin ones is ocular
dominant, maybe the other way

00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:55.440
around.

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:56.210
It doesn't matter.

00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:58.800
But at any rate, if the
hypothesis is correct,

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:00.780
you'll expect something
like what you see here.

00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:02.210
They're at right
angles to each other.

00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:02.790
OK?

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:05.010
But if you look at
it carefully, you

00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:07.230
can see the endless
locations where they're not

00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:09.050
at right angles to each other.

00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:09.550
All right?

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:13.800
And because of that, even
though that's a very attractive

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:18.170
hypothesis, people have come
up with other hypotheses saying

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:20.880
that this hypothesis
is really questionable.

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:24.650
And an alternative hypothesis
that had been proposed

00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:29.650
arose in part by yet another new
discovery that had been made.

00:48:29.650 --> 00:48:32.125
And this discovery
was made by a woman

00:48:32.125 --> 00:48:33.250
called Margaret Wong-Riley.

00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:40.520
But this particular picture
has been done by processing,

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:44.170
again this is a horizontal
view looking down at the brain,

00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:46.970
by Marge Livingstone,
who is at Harvard,

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:50.330
and had done all the
collaborative work with Hubel.

00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:55.376
So what you see here, are the
so-called cytochrome oxidase

00:48:55.376 --> 00:48:55.875
patches.

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:58.150
OK?

00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:00.970
Now, when this was
first discovered,

00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:02.414
people said, my god.

00:49:02.414 --> 00:49:04.330
They had never seen
anything like this before.

00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:09.180
This is the only kind of
stain that showed this up.

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:10.710
Let me explain to you.

00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:13.060
This is also an activity label.

00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:14.420
The cytochrome oxidase.

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:18.469
And we selectively label those
cells that are most active,

00:49:18.469 --> 00:49:20.260
rather than those cells
which are inactive.

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:26.180
And so this is what
these patches look like.

00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:28.770
And so people kept saying,
why do we have this patches?

00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:31.570
We've never seen them
before in the visual cortex.

00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:32.750
What on earth are they for?

00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:34.180
What do they tell us about?

00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:36.590
So all kinds of
hypotheses evolved.

00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:40.100
And people asked the question,
since we have this thing, what

00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:42.860
if we recorded in
one of these patches,

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:45.140
as opposed to outside of them.

00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:48.890
And so when this was
done by several people--

00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:52.780
let me just show you if you
have a much larger section.

00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:57.450
Here again is a fovea
that's about 80 degrees out.

00:49:57.450 --> 00:49:59.810
This is what these
patches look like when

00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:02.170
you do it on the high contrast.

00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:02.710
OK?

00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:04.460
So indeed, they're
extremely frequent.

00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:05.335
They're very orderly.

00:50:06.250 --> 00:50:08.670
And so the question, of course,
is whether these batches

00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:12.370
are relative to the columns
that we talked about.

00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:14.290
And what was
discovered, it if you

00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:18.050
look at the ocular
dominance columns,

00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:20.780
these patches are always
in the middle of a column.

00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:25.560
So in other words,
to make that clear,

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:32.280
if you have here a
column like that,

00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:34.991
the patches would be like this.

00:50:34.991 --> 00:50:35.490
OK?

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:40.463
And the next one over, again
the patches would be like that.

00:50:40.463 --> 00:50:40.962
OK?

00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:44.380
They would not be
between patches.

00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:47.820
So there's a direct relationship
between the ocular dominance

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:52.110
columns, and the layout
of these patches.

00:50:52.110 --> 00:50:52.610
OK?

00:50:53.830 --> 00:50:54.330
All right.

00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:57.559
So now, as a result
of this work,

00:50:57.559 --> 00:50:59.100
people have come up
with yet, and let

00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:04.700
me finish, another
hypothesis, which

00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:06.750
is called the radio model.

00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:09.230
They argued that
the cells that are

00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:14.610
in the center of these patches
are largely unoriented,

00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:18.800
and that the orientation
selectivity goes around

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:26.000
in a radio fashion, as indicated
here in the visual cortex

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.580
within each of the
ocular dominance columns.

00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:30.080
OK?

00:51:32.004 --> 00:51:32.970
AUDIENCE: I'm good now.

00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:33.690
PROFESSOR: Are you good now?

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:34.000
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:34.875
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:51:34.875 --> 00:51:36.855
So that's the second
model that has emerged.

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:41.350
And this model also
was highly questioned,

00:51:41.350 --> 00:51:43.530
because the evidence
was not that you

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:50.490
had these nice clear radio
orientations for orientation

00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:50.990
selectivity.

00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:55.470
So then finally
another technique

00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:58.260
had emerged, which
was carried out again

00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:02.420
at Harvard, at Harvard Medical
School by a fellow called

00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:02.920
Blaisdell.

00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:07.330
He developed a technique
that actually other people

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:08.740
have used, but
then he applied it

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:13.380
to the visual cortex, that
is called optical recording.

00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:20.310
So you could record optically
from the visual cortex

00:52:20.310 --> 00:52:25.860
straight down, and then
it could vary orientation,

00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:27.170
and ocular dominance.

00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:29.290
And when you did
that, this is what

00:52:29.290 --> 00:52:31.350
a typical example looks like.

00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:32.080
OK?

00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:37.030
Those red lines show what the
layout is of the orientation

00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:41.560
selectivity of the cells,
and the patches here

00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:43.150
are those regions
where you don't

00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:45.200
have orientation selectivity.

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.310
OK?

00:52:46.310 --> 00:52:52.230
So this then indicated
that you do not

00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:55.760
have a computer like layout
in the visual cortex going

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:58.200
one way, and the other way
for orientation direction.

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:02.650
But you have it a bit messier.

00:53:02.650 --> 00:53:06.680
And so this particular
arrangement then was called,

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:09.250
or at least I called
it, the swirl model.

00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:09.750
OK?

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:13.130
But actually, to call
it a model is incorrect.

00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:14.270
This is a fact.

00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:15.730
The others are models.

00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:16.230
OK?

00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:19.090
So now to put it all together,
here is the Hubel and Wiesel

00:53:19.090 --> 00:53:23.710
ice-cube model, where the
orientation selectivity

00:53:23.710 --> 00:53:26.050
[INAUDIBLE] right
angles to each other.

00:53:26.050 --> 00:53:27.710
Then we have the radio model.

00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:29.710
And finally we have
the swirl model,

00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:32.340
which is the way it really is.

00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:33.340
All right.

00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:38.000
So that then in
essence tells you

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:43.110
about the cytoarchitecture
of the visual cortex.

00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:45.470
Now we are going to take
another big step forward.

00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:48.850
We are going to look
at extrastriate cortex.

00:53:48.850 --> 00:53:51.860
As I've mentioned
to you before, when

00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:55.270
you look at the
visual cortex, it

00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:57.830
comes actually in many
subdivisions, and maybe

00:53:57.830 --> 00:54:02.832
as many as 30 visual
cortical areas,

00:54:02.832 --> 00:54:04.790
of which we will only
talk about a few of them,

00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:06.206
because it's totally
overwhelming.

00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:16.780
And these areas were presumed
to involve, maybe correctly so,

00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:21.680
initially at least, increasingly
complex visual analyses.

00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:22.180
All right?

00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:28.230
Now, one of the
prime ideas that,

00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:31.390
or hypotheses again if
you will, to my mind

00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:36.200
turned out to be incorrect,
is that each of these areas

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:40.620
in the brain
specializes in analyzing

00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:42.305
a certain aspect of vision.

00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:45.065
So what are certain
aspects of vision?

00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:49.090
Just a few examples
are analyzing color,

00:54:49.090 --> 00:54:54.460
analyzing shape, analyzing
motion, and so on.

00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:57.400
And so they argue that
all these visual areas

00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:00.010
specialize in one of those.

00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:03.690
So that was an interesting
idea, and so people

00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:07.010
began to study extrastriate
cortex in more detail.

00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:08.810
And I'm going to say
few words about it,

00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:11.790
but let me go back even
further in history.

00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:19.520
Let's go back to a time
in the early 1800s.

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:22.250
There were two very
famous people there,

00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:24.640
which were called
Gall and Spurzheim.

00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:29.180
And they came up
with the idea which

00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:31.350
eventually was
called phrenology.

00:55:31.350 --> 00:55:32.790
How many of know phrenology?

00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:34.470
Oh, well.

00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:35.240
My goodness.

00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:36.210
All of you do.

00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:36.960
OK.

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:42.920
So phrenology, in
essence, claimed

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:48.100
that there are specific areas
in the brain, as shown here,

00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:51.825
that specialize in certain
aspects of the information

00:55:51.825 --> 00:55:52.325
processing.

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:55.760
And how did they
come up with this?

00:55:55.760 --> 00:56:01.380
The way they came up with
it was to palpate the skull.

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:03.560
And wherever there
were big bulges,

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.270
they felt that there
was a lot of that

00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:07.980
attribute that a person had.

00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:09.740
And if it was small,
then the person

00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:11.260
didn't have too much of it.

00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:13.800
And so they played with
it, and played with it,

00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:18.130
and they came up in
an 1812 publication

00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:25.800
with essentially 35 basic
visual attributes of processing

00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:32.490
in the brain, for the cortex
of the brain in humans.

00:56:32.490 --> 00:56:34.080
And the interesting
thing about this

00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:35.639
is it gives you a
sense of history

00:56:35.639 --> 00:56:39.100
and how much we have
changed in our lives,

00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:45.220
as to what these specialized
areas were conceived to be.

00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:48.490
Now, to make that a little
bit clearer for you,

00:56:48.490 --> 00:56:49.880
let me stop here for a second.

00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:55.000
And what I want to do here
is I want to enlarge this,

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.270
so you can see it better.

00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:00.880
OK.

00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:02.750
So here are some of these areas.

00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:05.440
And if you look at these, you
will be almost taken aback

00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:08.270
as to what the hell
the names are here.

00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:12.670
I mean, some of the common names
here that you can see would be,

00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:17.660
for example, let's see if I
can put them in the right order

00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:18.160
here.

00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:23.430
Actually, the thing was that
they called these not only

00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:25.910
propensities, but they
called them sentiments.

00:57:27.050 --> 00:57:29.080
So in those days sentiments
were very important.

00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:33.200
There's not much brain
allocated to sentiments anymore.

00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.690
But at any rate,
such things that

00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:41.360
existed as amativeness,
cautiousness, benevolence,

00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:43.070
veneration, wonder and ideality.

00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:47.250
Those are just a few examples
here that you can spot.

00:57:47.250 --> 00:57:49.430
Amativeness right there.

00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:51.200
And indeed you can
ask the question,

00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:55.380
really would that much brain
be devoted to amativeness?

00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:57.570
And certainly that's
not the case anymore.

00:57:57.570 --> 00:58:00.480
So maybe our brains are
totally different from the way

00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:03.660
they were back in 1812.

00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:04.670
I doubt it.

00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:09.630
And so therefore, I think these
things are rather fanciful,

00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:11.705
and very far-fetched hypotheses.

00:58:12.830 --> 00:58:16.530
And as I mentioned before,
that's par for the course.

00:58:16.530 --> 00:58:19.280
So many hypotheses
end up being wrong,

00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:23.010
and the best way
to overcome that is

00:58:23.010 --> 00:58:28.077
to do solid experiments to find
out what is really going on.

00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:50.330
OK.

00:58:50.330 --> 00:58:52.450
So now, we move on.

00:58:52.450 --> 00:59:00.960
And we need to understand what
the more modern techniques are

00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:05.160
that enable us to specify
things about these higher

00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:06.850
cortical areas.

00:59:06.850 --> 00:59:09.600
The first one of these
is architectonics.

00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:10.900
That's obvious what it is.

00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:13.390
That's simply to
look at the brain,

00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:19.020
and identify the various
areas in a systematic fashion.

00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:21.100
The second one is to
look at connections.

00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:23.580
You do anatomical
studies to determine

00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:27.240
which areas to connect to
what areas in what fashion.

00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:29.530
Another one is
topographic mapping.

00:59:29.530 --> 00:59:31.450
We talked about that already.

00:59:31.450 --> 00:59:34.260
One of those was to actually
do single cell recording

00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:36.760
systematically moving
the electrode across,

00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:39.490
or to do the two
digit type studies.

00:59:39.490 --> 00:59:41.900
Another one we can
do is what we call

00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:43.940
physiological characterization.

00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:45.920
That's also known to you.

00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:49.564
When you looked at
the cells in V1,

00:59:49.564 --> 00:59:51.230
you established that
they're orientation

00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:52.940
direction selective.

00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:55.170
That's your physiological
characterization

00:59:55.170 --> 00:59:56.534
of the cells in V1.

00:59:56.534 --> 00:59:58.200
And then you can ask
the question, well,

00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.950
what about V2, V4, and
so on, these other areas.

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:03.550
What are the cells like there?

01:00:03.550 --> 01:00:05.290
What do they respond to well?

01:00:05.290 --> 01:00:06.680
And so on.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:09.040
And then, another very
important technique

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:14.510
is to say, OK, what if we
removed a particular area that

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:16.100
had been identified.

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:19.820
What kind of loss do
you have in vision,

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:21.640
or in general in the brain?

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:25.430
If you move a particular area,
what kind of deficit arises?

01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:27.480
And if that's a
specific deficit,

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:30.090
you can infer that that
particular area plays

01:00:30.090 --> 01:00:32.400
an important role
in the analysis

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.530
that you can no longer do.

01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:40.900
That can also be done instead
of making specific lesions.

01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:43.040
It's less accurate,
but you can do it

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:46.510
by studying humans who
have had various kinds

01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:48.150
of febrile accidents.

01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:51.990
And that's one of the things
that our former chairman,

01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:54.570
Hans-Lukas Teuber,
has done extensively.

01:00:54.570 --> 01:00:56.860
Studying people after
the Second World

01:00:56.860 --> 01:01:00.090
War who have sustained
specific brain injuries to see

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:03.640
what kinds of deficits they had
suffered on the basis of that

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:07.250
you could infer what
various brain areas do.

01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:09.350
And the last one here
that I want to mention

01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:10.430
is imaging, of course.

01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:11.810
We've talked about that.

01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:17.410
You can present certain specific
stimuli to activate the brain.

01:01:17.410 --> 01:01:21.010
And then once you process
that using magnetic resonance

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:24.770
imaging, for example, functional
magnetic resonance imaging can

01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:28.400
tell you how
important, for example,

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:31.510
areas are in recognising faces.

01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:35.790
And some of that work is
being done, actually here,

01:01:35.790 --> 01:01:38.820
by Nancy Kanwisher, for
example, in our department.

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:39.650
OK.

01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:42.540
So to do this then
systematically,

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:48.560
you have to have a sort of
idea of what kinds of functions

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:50.090
do we want to study.

01:01:50.090 --> 01:01:53.460
And so you want to break
it down visual functions.

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:55.640
And one way to break
them down, I'm not

01:01:55.640 --> 01:02:00.390
saying this is overall
satisfactory to everyone,

01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:03.700
they can talk about so-called
basic visual capacities,

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:05.180
and more higher level ones.

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:07.900
When you talk about
basic visual capacities,

01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:09.660
they say well how well
can you see color.

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:13.780
How well can you distinguish
differences in brightness?

01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:17.610
How good are you at
seeing basic patterns?

01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:18.610
Textures?

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:19.630
Motion?

01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:20.560
Depth?

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:21.170
OK?

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:23.760
So those would be your
basic visual functions.

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:26.570
And then when you come to
intermediate visual capacities,

01:02:26.570 --> 01:02:29.210
things become much more
complex, of course.

01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:31.250
You come up with constancy.

01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:33.790
How come that when I look
at something that's nearby,

01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:35.330
and something
that's further way,

01:02:35.330 --> 01:02:37.570
I can recognize
it's the same thing?

01:02:37.570 --> 01:02:38.200
OK?

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:43.220
Or how can we select
things in the visual scene?

01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:46.430
How can we recognize things,
just like recognizing faces?

01:02:48.542 --> 01:02:49.833
How can we make transpositions?

01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:53.046
How can we make comparisons?

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:57.480
And how can we locate
things in space?

01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:00.170
So those would be some of those
so-called intermediate visual

01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:01.420
capacities.

01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:03.930
And I'm not even going
to mention high level

01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:07.240
visual capacities, because
they are even more complicated,

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:09.380
and we know even
less about them.

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:09.880
OK.

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:14.980
So now, let's go and lay
out the visual areas.

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:16.830
Just the very basics
of it, because it's

01:03:16.830 --> 01:03:18.740
unbelievably complicated.

01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:20.480
Here we have a human brain.

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:23.270
And back when this
was put together,

01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:26.960
this posterior area here, which
is the primary visual cortex,

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:30.980
called area 17 then,
we now call that V1.

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:33.140
And 18 would be V2.

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:35.461
And 19, V3, and so on.

01:03:35.461 --> 01:03:35.960
OK.

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:39.390
So now again, we go back
to the monkey brain.

01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:43.620
And when we look at the monkey
brain, what you see here

01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:45.056
is again the central sulcus.

01:03:45.056 --> 01:03:46.930
You're going to see this
over and over again,

01:03:46.930 --> 01:03:49.420
and it's going to
stick into your head.

01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:51.430
Here's the lunate sulcus.

01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:54.030
And here is area V1.

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:58.570
This is where we had examined
the properties of these cells

01:03:58.570 --> 01:03:59.990
that we had just talked about.

01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:04.000
Then if you move on, right at
the edge here of the lunate,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.650
V2 starts, and then goes
from under the gyrus.

01:04:09.970 --> 01:04:14.290
And then in this region here,
we have what is called area V4.

01:04:15.570 --> 01:04:17.339
So those are some
of the basic areas.

01:04:17.339 --> 01:04:19.380
And you are going to see
a few things about them.

01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:21.830
Now, people have studied
this extensively,

01:04:21.830 --> 01:04:24.720
and they came up with
frightening diagrams of this.

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.330
This is a flattened
monkey brain.

01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:28.540
This is V1.

01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:31.180
And then you have a
whole bunch of areas

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:33.820
that are following
succession here.

01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:36.040
I'm not going to
label many of these.

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:38.135
And we talked about V2, V4.

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:41.690
But there are many, many more.

01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:43.650
I'll bring up a few
more in a minute.

01:04:43.650 --> 01:04:46.280
And then, if you look at
the interconnections that

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:49.740
had been made, it's
totally frightening.

01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:51.990
There's so many hundreds,
and hundreds, and hundreds

01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:55.370
of connections going
every which way.

01:04:55.370 --> 01:05:00.527
So it is very difficult to say
that particular area receives

01:05:00.527 --> 01:05:02.860
inputs only from one other
area, or something like that.

01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:06.940
There's just a tremendous
amount of interconnections,

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:10.820
indicating that any analysis is
likely to take place involving

01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:14.270
thousands, and tens of thousands
of thousands of neurons being

01:05:14.270 --> 01:05:17.080
active in many, many
different brain areas.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:17.640
OK.

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:21.850
Now the major cortical visual
areas that we shall consider

01:05:21.850 --> 01:05:27.230
are V1, that we already
did, V2, V3, V4 and MT.

01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:30.440
Then in the temporal
region of the brain,

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:32.540
we have inferotemporal cortex.

01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:34.380
And then in the
private region, we

01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:39.780
have the lateral intraparietal
area, the ventral area,

01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:44.240
and MST, which is called the
Medial Superior Temporal area.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.350
And then lastly, in
the frontal lobe,

01:05:46.350 --> 01:05:47.925
we have the frontal eye fields.

01:05:47.925 --> 01:05:49.590
Now, we will talk
about each of these

01:05:49.590 --> 01:05:52.210
at various levels in the course.

01:05:52.210 --> 01:05:55.465
Today, we will just briefly
talk about V2, V4 and MT.

01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:57.120
OK.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:02.370
So now, a couple of
general principles

01:06:02.370 --> 01:06:05.050
that emerge from
this kind of work.

01:06:05.050 --> 01:06:09.150
First of all is that the
size of the receptive

01:06:09.150 --> 01:06:13.770
fields in these different
areas changes dramatically.

01:06:13.770 --> 01:06:16.580
In the visual cortex there's
aptitudes that are very small.

01:06:17.654 --> 01:06:19.070
I mean, bigger
than in the retina,

01:06:19.070 --> 01:06:21.890
or in the geniculate, but
still very, very small.

01:06:21.890 --> 01:06:24.190
But then when you
get to V2, they're

01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:27.550
about three times bigger
on the average in diameter.

01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:29.730
And when you come
to V4, they're huge.

01:06:29.730 --> 01:06:30.230
OK?

01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:34.540
And that's true throughout,
that the specificity

01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:40.620
of the location of
the receptive fields

01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:46.770
decreases as you progress up
into higher cortical areas.

01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:48.650
Now, there's another
very interesting fact

01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:52.956
that had been discovered, which
again nobody hypothesized.

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:59.280
Namely, that the way these areas
are laid out next to each other

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:03.060
is not what you
would have thought.

01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:04.570
So let me give you an example.

01:07:04.570 --> 01:07:09.350
Suppose what we do is we take
an electrode, and record in V1,

01:07:09.350 --> 01:07:14.040
and then we go in
progressive steps across V1,

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:19.060
where the receptive fields
move out from the fovea

01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:20.175
into the periphery.

01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:23.450
And if you do that,
here's a receptive field

01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:25.470
of that cell.
[INAUDIBLE], right there.

01:07:25.470 --> 01:07:29.190
The next one is a little
bit further removed.

01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:31.510
The next one is a little
bit further removed.

01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:35.570
And here's the next one,
and that one is there.

01:07:35.570 --> 01:07:36.270
OK?

01:07:36.270 --> 01:07:38.370
So what you have
is a progression

01:07:38.370 --> 01:07:39.770
of receptive fields.

01:07:39.770 --> 01:07:43.330
They get bigger, and they
move from the center out.

01:07:43.330 --> 01:07:47.000
So now the big question
is what happens

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.845
when you now come in to V2.

01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:52.890
And think about it for a minute.

01:07:52.890 --> 01:07:53.727
What do you think?

01:07:53.727 --> 01:07:55.310
Where do you think
the receptive field

01:07:55.310 --> 01:07:59.509
will be when you just ride
across from V1 to V2 in the map

01:07:59.509 --> 01:08:00.675
that I had shown you before?

01:08:02.110 --> 01:08:04.540
Well, you will be surprised.

01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:06.170
I think you will be surprised.

01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:09.690
You will find that the next
receptive field, close as this,

01:08:09.690 --> 01:08:12.965
is at the same location, almost,
very close the same location.

01:08:15.010 --> 01:08:16.750
And of course, the
receptive field

01:08:16.750 --> 01:08:18.680
is about three times bigger.

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:21.790
Now, what happens when
you now move one over?

01:08:21.790 --> 01:08:24.819
Well, the receptive field
comes back towards the center.

01:08:24.819 --> 01:08:28.140
And again, and again like that.

01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:35.100
So these areas connect to each
other in reverse, so to speak.

01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:38.200
In other words, if they didn't
one would connect to here.

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.510
Two would connect
to there, and so on.

01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:43.729
But instead, four and five
could have short connections.

01:08:43.729 --> 01:08:46.529
Three and six,
longer, and so on.

01:08:46.529 --> 01:08:49.330
So we have this very
curious arrangement.

01:08:49.330 --> 01:08:51.340
And to this day I
don't have a clue

01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:54.600
as to why in the course of
evolution this happened.

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:56.930
I mean, there all
kinds of hypotheses.

01:08:56.930 --> 01:09:00.000
This may take less
elaborate wiring.

01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:05.825
Not as long wiring
overall, or something,

01:09:05.825 --> 01:09:07.200
because if it were
the other way,

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.540
then all these
wires would be long.

01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:12.970
So that could be a reason,
but one is not sure.

01:09:12.970 --> 01:09:15.260
And to my knowledge,
no experiment

01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:19.819
has yet been done
to truly explain

01:09:19.819 --> 01:09:22.319
why we have this
curious arrangement.

01:09:22.319 --> 01:09:25.060
Now, when you look
at area V2, we

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:27.279
have yet another very
interesting factor.

01:09:27.279 --> 01:09:31.700
When you come back to area
V1, this would use V1.

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:34.209
We have those famous
cytochrome oxidase patches.

01:09:35.359 --> 01:09:39.640
But then when you get to area
V2, instead of what you have,

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:44.840
you have these elongated bars.

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:45.470
OK?

01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:47.000
And if you look
closely, you can see

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.060
that there's a
tendency for the bars

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:54.320
to go from thick to thin
with an inter-bar area.

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.980
And so when this was
discovered, people

01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:59.820
began to record to say why
is this different from here.

01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:01.390
What does it signify?

01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:03.300
And so when they did
that systematically,

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:06.840
they came up with a model, which
may not be entirely correct.

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:10.550
But the claim was that
the thin stripes in V2

01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:13.800
get inputs
predominantly from there

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:16.330
patches that you have in V1.

01:10:16.330 --> 01:10:24.130
And the thick stripes get input
from the so-called parasol

01:10:24.130 --> 01:10:28.640
system, meaning that they
would be heavily involved

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:31.180
in things like what
the parasol cells do,

01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:34.490
namely play an important
role in emotion perception.

01:10:34.490 --> 01:10:36.225
And the interstripes
here called,

01:10:36.225 --> 01:10:40.360
or the pale stripes sometimes
called, they get input

01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:44.770
in this particular model from
the orientation specific cells.

01:10:44.770 --> 01:10:45.450
OK?

01:10:45.450 --> 01:10:49.430
So now, once this was
done and proposed,

01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:51.780
people begin to do
experiments to record

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:54.610
in the thick and
thin stripes of V2

01:10:54.610 --> 01:10:57.150
to see what the properties
are of the cells

01:10:57.150 --> 01:11:02.010
there, recognizing of course
that the size of the receptive

01:11:02.010 --> 01:11:06.190
fields is uniformly about
three times bigger than in V1.

01:11:06.190 --> 01:11:09.210
So when they did that,
they looked at orientation.

01:11:09.210 --> 01:11:13.860
And they found that in
V2, most of the cells

01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:17.280
in the thick stripes are
orientation specific, but also

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:20.790
many in the thin stripes, and
many also in the pale stripes.

01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:24.130
So there didn't seem to
be a huge distinction.

01:11:24.130 --> 01:11:25.699
Then when it came
to end stopping,

01:11:25.699 --> 01:11:26.740
I didn't talk about that.

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:28.500
Let me mention what
end stopping means.

01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:32.190
If you take a bar of
light, and you move it

01:11:32.190 --> 01:11:34.650
across a receptive field,
you get a vigorous response

01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:36.500
when it's a fairly short bar.

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.760
But then when you make
the bar a lot longer,

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:40.670
you get less of a
response, because

01:11:40.670 --> 01:11:42.420
of some surrounding [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:45.640
So that's what's called, by
Hubel and Wiesel, end stopping.

01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:49.390
And so that
attribute is one that

01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:52.580
is again fairly similar
in the three areas.

01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:54.840
When you come to color,
in the thin stripes

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.640
there is much more
color sensitivity

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:57.970
than the fixed stripes.

01:11:57.970 --> 01:12:00.740
When it comes to direction,
again not that much difference.

01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:02.660
Maybe more in the thick stripes.

01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:05.380
Disparity, more in thickness.

01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:06.970
Disparity refers to
depth perception,

01:12:06.970 --> 01:12:08.200
as we have talked about.

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:14.070
So the prime message
here is that you do not

01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:19.950
have a complete clear separation
of function in those three

01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:26.450
stripes that had been
identified in V2,

01:12:26.450 --> 01:12:27.610
virtually inputs from V1.

01:12:29.250 --> 01:12:34.240
So now, we are going
to move on to V4.

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.070
And when you talk
about area of V4,

01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:40.520
we'll talk about that again
in more detail later on.

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:43.440
We have a huge
increase of complexity

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:46.530
of the response
properties of cells.

01:12:46.530 --> 01:12:49.960
And here is area
V4, as you can see.

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:52.070
A lot of recording has
been done in this area.

01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:54.190
Hundreds of papers
have been published.

01:12:54.190 --> 01:12:56.920
And I can conclude
on the basis of that.

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:58.810
First of all, here
the receptive fields

01:12:58.810 --> 01:13:02.410
are even a lot
bigger than in V2.

01:13:02.410 --> 01:13:04.270
And the receptive
field properties

01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:07.665
are far more complex
than in either V1 or V2.

01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:12.900
And the response
properties are dynamic.

01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:15.060
If the monkey is
paying attention,

01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:17.580
or is looking for
something, the cells

01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:21.160
will find a lot more than when
he's not looking for something.

01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:25.490
And yet another
discovery was made

01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:27.910
that the amount of
activity is also

01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:30.870
modulated by how you move your
eyes as you're looking around

01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:31.750
in the visual scene.

01:13:33.010 --> 01:13:35.000
And then, an important
conclusion from that

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.780
is that this is not
just a color area.

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:41.270
And the reason I mention that
is because a good many years

01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:45.420
ago an experiment
was done in England.

01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:48.520
I shan't name the
person who was doing it,

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:52.310
who claimed that
this is a color area.

01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:55.280
Now, one of the reasons
he made that claim

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:59.870
was that he removed
area V4, or studied

01:13:59.870 --> 01:14:02.770
humans who lacked area V4.

01:14:02.770 --> 01:14:06.155
And he found that they had
difficulties in telling colors.

01:14:08.290 --> 01:14:09.660
Well, that was nice.

01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:13.010
But the problem was, and this
is a good lesson for all of us,

01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:16.050
that the only
thing he tested was

01:14:16.050 --> 01:14:18.675
for color, because that
was his hypothesis.

01:14:19.770 --> 01:14:23.580
Had he tested for a
multitude of other functions,

01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:26.920
he would have found
that area V4 has

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:28.830
much more significant
deficits when

01:14:28.830 --> 01:14:33.240
it's removed for many
other visual functions

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:34.900
than for color.

01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:41.320
So again, we'll talk about
that input with more detail

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:44.320
later on when we talk about
very specific processing

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:45.430
of digital attributes.

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:48.900
Now then the next areas
I want to deal with,

01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:51.220
the last areas we
are going to discuss,

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:53.580
are going to be
areas MT and MST.

01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:57.040
MT stands for Middle
Temporal area.

01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:01.860
And MST stands for Middle
Superior Temporal area.

01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:04.980
And again, to look at the
brain, what you can see here

01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:08.040
is a superior temporal sulcus.

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:13.080
And if you went into it, it's
about 13 millimeters deep.

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:16.090
On the posterior
side, we have area MT.

01:15:16.090 --> 01:15:18.770
And on the interior part
of it we have area MST.

01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:21.490
Now, this is a remarkable area.

01:15:21.490 --> 01:15:24.010
An incredible amount of
work had been done on it.

01:15:24.010 --> 01:15:26.600
And the major discovery
that had been made

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:32.200
is that the cells in MT and
MST respond predominantly

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:33.355
to direction.

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:36.500
Virtually, all the cells
are direction specific.

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:42.240
And also, this is in part
believed to be due to the fact

01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:47.510
that this area gets half their
input from the parasol system.

01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:49.660
So to look at this
in more detail,

01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:52.990
here is a receptive field,
quite large and empty.

01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:55.490
And if you move a bar of light
across in this direction,

01:15:55.490 --> 01:15:57.100
you get a huge response.

01:15:57.100 --> 01:15:59.140
This is the cumulative
response histogram.

01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:01.020
But if you move it in
the opposite direction,

01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:03.490
you won't actually
get an inhibition.

01:16:03.490 --> 01:16:05.710
Tremendous direction
specificity.

01:16:05.710 --> 01:16:08.660
And you get the same in MST,
but there the receptive fields

01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:09.606
are just gigantic.

01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:14.760
But again, direction
specificity is just as specific

01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:16.690
as it is in MT.

01:16:16.690 --> 01:16:20.350
So these two areas
play a central role

01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:28.010
in motion analysis, as we shall
see in more detail later on.

01:16:28.010 --> 01:16:28.640
All right.

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:32.130
So now, if you look at the
spatial layout of this,

01:16:32.130 --> 01:16:37.860
what you do is you can move
an electrode into the area.

01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:43.720
And so you move it across
the represented area

01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:46.390
by going into the sulcus.

01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:50.440
And what you can see here is
it's a systematic progression

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:53.520
of directions as you
move the electrodes.

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:58.650
Here the distance is
expressed in micrometers.

01:16:58.650 --> 01:16:59.150
OK?

01:17:01.290 --> 01:17:10.210
Now, if you map that out you
can create a layout of the area,

01:17:10.210 --> 01:17:11.160
area MT.

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:14.110
And what you can see is
there's a systematic kilometer

01:17:14.110 --> 01:17:18.030
arrangement, or different
direction specificities.

01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:21.990
So this is a general
principle, by the way,

01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:24.310
of the way the
cortex is organized.

01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:27.920
It first actually was
discovered by Mountcastle

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:30.030
in the somatosensory system.

01:17:30.030 --> 01:17:30.630
OK?

01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:33.230
Showing that there's a
kilometer arrangement there,

01:17:33.230 --> 01:17:35.750
and then subsequently it
was shown that this is also

01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:40.761
true for many other areas,
including vision and audition.

01:17:40.761 --> 01:17:41.260
All right.

01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:44.370
So now, the last thing I
want to mention very briefly,

01:17:44.370 --> 01:17:47.060
we'll get back to it, is
so-called inferotemporal

01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:48.140
cortex.

01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:51.950
And here once again, we have
a map of the monkey cortex.

01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:55.850
And this down here is
a temporal area here.

01:17:55.850 --> 01:17:58.780
And this is where the
inferotemporal cortex resides.

01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:01.480
And this has been
studied extensively

01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:06.340
by people like Charlie
Gross, and more recently

01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:10.260
with imaging techniques by
people in the department here.

01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:12.440
It was shown that
this area has a lot

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:15.760
to do with object
recognition, face recognition.

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:18.840
A very complex high level area.

01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:20.100
OK.

01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:24.610
So now, I want to summarize
what I have covered today.

01:18:24.610 --> 01:18:27.990
First of all, the
contralateral visual hemifield

01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:31.385
is laid out topographically
in V1 in each hemisphere.

01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:34.340
You know that by now, cold.

01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:37.140
Secondly, the major
transforms in V1

01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:40.969
are orientation, direction,
spatial frequency, selectivity,

01:18:40.969 --> 01:18:41.510
binocularity.

01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:45.390
You have an ON/OFF
convergence, and you

01:18:45.390 --> 01:18:47.210
have also in many
cells a convergence

01:18:47.210 --> 01:18:50.140
of the midget and
parasol systems.

01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:55.136
Then V1 is organized
in a modular fashion.

01:18:55.136 --> 01:18:56.510
Another way to
put it is that you

01:18:56.510 --> 01:19:00.750
have a kilometer
organization, and that we

01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:05.839
talked about three models
that had been proposed.

01:19:05.839 --> 01:19:07.922
One of them, the original
one by Hubel and Wiesel,

01:19:07.922 --> 01:19:09.400
is the ice cube model.

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:11.940
Then we had the radio
model, and the swirl model.

01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:14.450
And I pointed out to you that
the swirl model is not really

01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:15.140
a model.

01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:16.380
It's a fact.

01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:18.260
That's how it's laid out.

01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:19.050
OK.

01:19:19.050 --> 01:19:22.970
And then I said also that there
are more than 30 visual areas

01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:24.860
that make more than
300 interconnections.

01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:29.100
Extrastriate areas
do not specialize

01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:31.820
in any one single
function, contrary to what

01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:36.532
had been very, very popular,
maybe even 10 or 15 years ago.

01:19:36.532 --> 01:19:38.670
The receptive field's
size in neurons

01:19:38.670 --> 01:19:41.100
increases greatly in
progressively higher

01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:42.180
visual areas.

01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:46.680
That is a very
highly solid fact.

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:50.570
Then, area MT is involved
in the analysis of motion.

01:19:50.570 --> 01:19:53.370
And as we shall see
later on, it also

01:19:53.370 --> 01:19:55.320
contributes to
perception of depth,

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:57.385
and to flickering stimuli.

01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:02.580
Area V4 engages in many
aspects of visual analysis,

01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:04.740
and neurons have
dynamic properties.

01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:09.750
Attention and eye
movements modulate

01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:11.680
the way those cells respond.

01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:14.500
And then in inferotemporal
cortex, high level

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:18.750
visual analysis takes place that
includes object recognition,

01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:21.960
and therefore also the
recognition of faces.

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:24.490
So that then summarizes
what I had to say.

01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:28.530
And to conclude
in general, we can

01:20:28.530 --> 01:20:35.870
say that the cells
in the cortex have

01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:41.310
one very important increase
in their mode of functioning

01:20:41.310 --> 01:20:44.520
compared to lower areas, in that
the cells are multifunctional.

01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:49.030
So any one cell can
tell you information

01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:54.510
already in V1 about
direction, as well as

01:20:54.510 --> 01:20:58.370
orientation and
spatial frequency.

01:20:58.370 --> 01:21:01.750
So if one cell can do many,
many different things then

01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:04.860
that's a good thing, because
if each cell in the brain

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:07.160
specialized in
one thing, it used

01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:11.410
to be the hypothesis that was
called your famous grandmother

01:21:11.410 --> 01:21:12.330
cell.

01:21:12.330 --> 01:21:14.160
That there was a
cell in the brain

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:16.580
that represented
your grandmother.

01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:21.090
Now, if that were the case,
that individual cells were

01:21:21.090 --> 01:21:23.880
future selective, you
would need a brain

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:28.390
as big as this room to
accommodate the ability to what

01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:31.110
you can do that
you can do anyway.

01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:33.970
So cells in the brain
are multifunctional.

01:21:33.970 --> 01:21:36.490
They carry out many,
many different analyses,

01:21:36.490 --> 01:21:41.610
just like when computers do
complex mathematical analyses.

01:21:41.610 --> 01:21:43.650
And because of that
it's very difficult,

01:21:43.650 --> 01:21:46.940
of course, especially when you
study with high visual areas,

01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:51.530
to learn just how
these cells function,

01:21:51.530 --> 01:21:54.020
because to understand that
you would need to record

01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:58.310
at the same time from virtually
all the cells in an area

01:21:58.310 --> 01:22:01.910
to see what each of them does,
from which you can derive what

01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:03.900
the actual analysis is.

01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:07.380
So indeed, we have a very
complex task ahead of us

01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:11.130
in trying to understand how
this very complex interaction

01:22:11.130 --> 01:22:15.440
among neurons eventually
results in your ability

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:18.670
to analyze various aspects
of the visual scene.

01:22:18.670 --> 01:22:20.170
And that's true not
only for vision.

01:22:20.170 --> 01:22:22.030
It's true for many other areas.

01:22:22.030 --> 01:22:25.450
In vision it's
very, very complex,

01:22:25.450 --> 01:22:29.760
because you have all these
incredible number of cells.

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:35.550
As I mentioned before, you
have more than a million

01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:38.510
retinal ganglion
cells that project

01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:42.100
from the one eye, from
each eye, into the brain.

01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:48.520
And then this multiplies in
these higher visual areas.

01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:52.540
Then you have millions and
millions, billions of cells

01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:55.640
to perform all of
these analyses.

01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:59.500
Now by contrast, when you
look at the auditory system,

01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:01.260
and I'm not saying
this to belittle it,

01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:04.560
I'm just saying it's probably
easier to understand it,

01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:08.530
because in the auditory
system the fibers that

01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:16.760
project from the cochlear
nucleus amount to about 30,000

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:21.680
in each cochlear to the
central nervous system.

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:28.240
So we're talking about
20, 30-fold higher level

01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:31.680
of number of neurons involved
in the visual system.

01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:35.920
And that's of course
because vision for us

01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:41.350
is just a very, very
important attribute,

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:43.890
perhaps more so than
many other attributes

01:23:43.890 --> 01:23:45.550
that we have in
the nervous system.

01:23:45.550 --> 01:23:46.050
OK.

01:23:46.050 --> 01:23:48.460
So that's what I
have to cover today.

01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:51.559
And then next time, you're
going to sort of move back.

01:23:51.559 --> 01:23:53.600
We're going to talk about
the on and off channels

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.580
to try to understand why
on earth did they evolve.

01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:58.130
OK?
