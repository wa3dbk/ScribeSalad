00:00:21.628 --> 00:00:23.503
PROFESSOR: All right
good afternoon everyone.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.200
What I have on the board here is
what we're going to cover today

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.400
and what we had
covered the last time.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.220
Those in blue here are the ones
we have covered the last time

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.810
and the rest of them,
five through nine,

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.270
are the ones we are
going to cover today.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.740
Actually the last time I didn't
have this last step here,

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.410
dreaming and rapid
eye-movement sleep,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.800
if there is time I want to
say a few words about that

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.250
because that's a very
interesting topic

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.780
and brings us to make a few
comments about Freudian theory.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.280
All right then so we
are going to then start

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.550
with a description of
the cortical structures

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.135
that are involved in
eye-movement control.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.160
Now the first thing
I want to do is

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.275
to show you once again
the monkey brain.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.400
You're already familiar with
those items which are on here.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.580
Here's V1, here's V4, here's
the superior temporal sulcus

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.590
that contains areas MT
and MST and of course

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.620
here's the central sulcus,
principalis, and the arcuate.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.810
Another structure involved
in eye-movement control

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.930
is the lateral intraparietal
sulcus which is in here,

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.600
and then another one is the
medial intraparietal sulcus

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.960
but those two perform
service similar tasks

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.090
and so I'm not going
to talk about the MIP

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.730
separately from LIP.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.690
And then here in
the frontal lobe

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.760
we have the frontal eye fields
as the name implies of course,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.330
it has a lot to do with
eye-movement control

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.840
and then here very
close to the midline

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.760
we have the medial
eye fields which

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.210
also play a role in
eye movement control.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.380
So now we have all
these structures

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.170
and this is not by any
means totally complete,

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.780
because these deal mostly
with saccadic eye movements

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.170
and to a lesser degree
with pursuit eye movements

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.650
but the fact is it that
all these areas that

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.500
play a significant role
in eye-movement control

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.370
and of course, those people
who want to understand

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.000
eye-movement control
need to figure out

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.790
what these various structures
do for you to enable you to look

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.380
around with the great ease
that you can look around

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.620
with actually.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.660
So anyway let's try
a number of views

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.680
of how to go about finding out
the operational characteristics

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.970
of these areas and
furthermore also to find out

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:03.886
how they interconnect.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.930
Now one approach that has been
very useful in delineating

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.090
the areas in the visual cortex
and even in subcortical areas

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.630
is to use electrical
stimulation.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.400
Because it has been found
as, as we had discussed

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.200
like the last time that when
you electrically stimulate

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.250
some structures heavily
involved in eye movement

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.910
control of like the colliculus,
at low current levels

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.260
electrical stimulation
can elicit a saccade

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.200
and by looking at the
characteristics of that

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.100
as we had in the colliculus,
you can gain further insight

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.150
about what the roles are
of these various areas.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.130
And of course people have
done electrical stimulation

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.580
all over creation
in the visual cortex

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.110
as well as in other
cortical areas,

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.360
thereby trying to
determine whether or not

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.500
the electrical stimulation
elicits a motor response

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.910
and of course if you
do this in motor cortex

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.830
then you get a motor
response and if you do

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.680
do it in areas which is
specifically connected

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.060
with eye-movement control
you get eye movement.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.029
So here is an example of the
kinds of things we can do.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:20.320
Here is a monkey
brain and of course

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.080
as we have discussed
already, from the brain stem

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.500
the signal is sent to the
eye muscles which provides

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.060
the so-called rate code
and then above that

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.840
via the superior colliculus
and then in the back

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.070
we have V1 that you're
already familiar with V2, LIP,

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.460
frontal eye fields, and
the medial eye fields.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.410
So now let's ask
the question, what

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.940
happens when you electrically
stimulate these cortical areas?

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.580
And also to compare
that with what

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.700
happens when you stimulate
in the superior colliculus.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.630
So we already know that when you
stimulate the colliculus what

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.040
you get is wherever you put the
electrodes in the colliculus

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.670
and you find out where the
receptive field is of the cells

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.910
that you will be stimulating,
that when you then convert

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.880
and stimulate you get
a saccade that brings

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.770
the fovea into the center of the
receptive fields of the neurons

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.600
that you are stimulating
and that is laid out

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.110
in a nice topographic fashion
and that is shown here

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.040
in a schematic fashion.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.060
So that no matter where the
eye starts, at any given point,

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.520
if you electrically
stimulate you

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.560
get the same vector saccade
in the superior colliculus.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.360
So you have what is called
the vector code which

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.800
if you remember, is quite
different from the code

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.860
that you have in the brain stem
where you have a rate code.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.330
So now the question
is suppose we now

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.860
start stimulating these
other cortical areas

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.860
that I had designated
in the previous slide

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.220
and ask the question what
happens in those places?

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.840
All right so if you stimulate
the visual cortex in this case

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.810
V1 for example, you get the
same kind of coding operation,

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.080
you get vector saccades OK,
constant vector saccades.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.210
Then if you do the
same thing in LIP

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.940
you also get a
constant vector saccade

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.130
and if you do that in
the frontal eye fields

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.410
you still get the same thing.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:23.490
So all of these areas seem
to be coding saccadic vectors

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.970
but now when you stimulate
in the medial eye fields

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.590
you get a very different
kind of effect.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.370
Very interesting
what you get here

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.990
is what is called a place code,
meaning that when you stimulate

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.610
in various regions of the
medial eye fields, the eye

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.860
wherever it starts, converges
on a particular point which you,

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.480
we'll call the motor field, OK?

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.250
And different regions
in the medial eye fields

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:59.300
have motor fields that generate
different locations to which

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.860
the eye will saccade
when you stimulate there.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.545
So that's a very different kind
of code from all the others.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.800
So now the next question is
that you're going to pose is,

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.140
how do the signals from
all these cortical areas

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.730
get down to the brain stem?

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.510
So what kind of
experiment do you

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:23.470
think you would want to do to
get some easy answers to that?

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:31.870
So to, to perhaps highlight
that some people thought,

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.510
that the signals from
all of these areas

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:39.330
go down to the colliculus
and then the colliculus sends

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.150
its signals down
to the brain stem.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.970
So if that's the
case, what would you,

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.250
what experiment would you do?

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:49.550
Well the experiment
you would do is

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.980
you would remove the
superior colliculus OK?

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.110
And then again stimulate
all of these areas.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.600
If that hypothesis, that all
these areas send their signals

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.030
through the superior colliculus
of the brain stem is correct,

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.950
then you would no longer get any
saccades when you electrically

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:12.680
stimulate in the cortex
at any of these sites.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.740
Got it?

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:17.790
All right now, let's see
if an experiment like that

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:21.200
had been done and
yes, yes it has been.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.450
So here it is, here
we're going to remove

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:26.080
the superior colliculus.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.930
All right think about
it for a minute,

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:32.500
think what you would
hypothesize will happen?

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.350
Well what happens
is quite dramatic.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:41.784
When you stimulate
in V1, V2, and LIP

00:08:41.784 --> 00:08:42.950
you no longer get a saccade.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.950
Somehow the signals to generate
the saccade from these areas

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.210
seem to be going
through the colliculus

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.246
because once the
colliculus is not there

00:08:52.246 --> 00:08:53.495
those signals are ineffective.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.430
Now what happens in
the frontal lobe?

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.460
All right what happens
there is quite interesting.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.000
You still get
saccades and you still

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.810
get the same coding operation.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:05.720
You get a constant
vector code when

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.710
you stimulate the
frontal eye fields

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:12.260
and you get your place code
in the medial eye fields

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.550
and you get that at
the same old threshold.

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:19.810
So that discovery then resulted
in the hypothesis first of all

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:22.870
that these posterior areas
send the signals to the brain

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:28.020
stem from the colliculus which
are called the posterior system

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.630
and the ones in the anterior
portions of the brain

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:33.080
from medial and
frontal eye fields

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.290
seem to be able to gain
direct access bypassing

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:41.620
the colliculus to
the brain stem is

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.550
because they're still effective
when you stimulate there

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.610
and so we can call that
the anterior system.

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:50.960
All right, now of
course these two systems

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.643
need to talk to each other,
which they do, there are plenty

00:09:53.643 --> 00:09:56.770
of connections there because
of course, if you will,

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.860
the left hand, it's got to know
what the right hand is doing.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:04.100
So anyway this is then a
very summary arrangement

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:07.170
and now we can proceed
to ask some questions

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:10.090
about just what do
these various areas do?

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.710
And to understand
that data we need

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:17.320
to look into more
detail about the nature

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.130
of electrical stimulation
and compare that

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:25.240
with the nature of eye
movements made to visual target.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.140
So let's look at that next time.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.330
So we can look at
the effects of paired

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.670
electrical and
visual stimulation.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:36.690
All right so, the first
thing we're going to look at

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.620
is what happens
when you stimulate

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.990
two sites say in the
colliculus at the same time?

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.380
And if you remember, medial
is up and lateral is down.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.420
So if you stimulate
each of those alone

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:53.730
you get here in number one
you get an upward saccade,

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.950
you simulate number two
you get a downward saccade.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.330
Now the question
comes up, what happens

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.430
when you stimulate
both at the same time?

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:05.070
Well the number
of hypotheses that

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:08.390
have been proposed and by now
it's been well established

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:12.890
that what happened is that you
get a vector average saccade

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:16.530
not vector summation,
but vector averaging OK?

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.770
Now, to prove that
that is indeed

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:22.350
vector averaging if you
take the same experiment

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:25.130
but you put one
electrode in the anterior

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:28.340
portion and the other
electrode in the posterior

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.890
one of the colliculus,
this one of course

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:34.120
generates a small saccade
and this one a large saccade.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.920
So if its vector
averages, you should

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.690
get an in-between saccade.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:40.460
If your vector sums then it
should get a bigger saccade

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.960
than either of
those and you indeed

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.280
get a vector average saccade.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.260
So depending on
this arrangement,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:51.060
or this arrangement, you get
the same vector average saccade

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.690
because the only thing
that's happening here

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:58.910
is you excite the
neurons in the colliculus

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:00.725
by virtue of this
electrical stimulation.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.330
Now think about
that for a minute.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.890
If this were the case
with visual stimuli,

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.440
suppose two visual
stimuli come up,

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.020
it would be a total
disaster if you

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:16.570
made an eye movement between
the two of them wouldn't it?

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.960
So somehow there's
some mechanisms

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.810
in the brain that
force you, force you,

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:28.580
I guess that may not
be the right word,

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.610
achieve the ability
to select one

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:33.420
or the other of
the visual targets

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:37.490
accurately and not be
vector averaging it.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:41.950
Now to accomplish that logically
speaking, what you need

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:45.360
is some inhibitory
circuits and the mechanism

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.570
for selection and then a
decision as to where to look.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.630
All right so to
highlight that let

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.060
me just say one more thing
about electrical stimulation.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.960
This is true what I told
you about vector averaging

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:03.500
with electrical stimulation
even when you stimulate the two,

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:07.240
the two superior colliculi
or two different locations

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:11.200
in the brain each of those
gives you an eye movement

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.610
into the left or right
hemifield and yet

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.340
they also vector average.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.120
So now let's look
at what happens

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.840
when a similar situation is
used in a real experiment where

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.880
the monkey looks at visual
targets and so what you do here

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:30.050
is you present these two
targets at the same time.

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:32.770
And so the monkey in a
sense has to make a decision

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:36.290
or you have to make a
decision as to where to look.

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.980
And as long as there's a
nice big separation here

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:42.480
which is 90 degrees in this
case, what you can see here

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.640
are the real eye movements that
half the time the monkey looks

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.520
to the left, half
the time to the right

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.370
and it makes very very
few in-between saccades.

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:52.240
Whereas if you
electrically stimulated

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.390
at these sites in
the colliculus you'd

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.000
get a vector
average saccade just

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.665
like what I've
shown you here OK?

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:06.460
All right so now
that being the case,

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.350
we can move on and ask
some additional questions

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:12.710
about what happens
when you bring the two

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:15.980
stimuli closer
together, all right?

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.020
The closer together they
get the more difficult

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.650
it is to make an
independent decision

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:25.230
as to whether to look to the
left or the right target that

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.470
comes up above
the fixation spot.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:30.750
So here's an example
of that, actually what

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.410
I'm going to do is this.

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:36.100
Let me delay for a little
bit what happens with that

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.220
and first I want to
tell you about what

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:42.320
happens with various
kinds of lesions

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.420
that you make on eye
movements and then we'll

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:47.910
talk about this
question of the angular

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:50.085
separation between the
two visual targets.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:56.600
So therefore let's do-- the
reason I want to do this first

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.400
is to give you sort of
a real sense when you

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:04.150
do very informal kind of testing
and by informal testing what

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:07.890
I mean is that you're going
to see a monkey actually

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.090
perform eye movements OK?

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:17.530
So here we are, here's a monkey,
here's his brain so to speak

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:21.490
and this is what we call of
course an intact animal and now

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:24.250
what I'm going to do, I'm going
to start the movie for you

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:26.030
to see what kinds
of eye movements

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:30.010
he makes when we present some
apple pieces for the monkey

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:31.010
to eat.

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:32.040
OK are you ready?

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:32.660
Here it is.

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.200
Can everybody see this OK?

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:52.570
So you can see that when
an apple piece appears

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:56.780
the monkey makes a saccade
to it and grabs it and stuffs

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.950
in his mouth and eats it.

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:02.180
OK so that's what a
normal monkey does

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:06.010
with his fully intact,
functional brain.

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.650
So now we're going to
ask the question, what

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:13.370
happens if you take out
the colliculus on one side,

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:16.620
meaning a unilaterally lesion,
what happens to the eye

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:21.010
movements the monkey makes
subsequent to such a lesion?

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:22.610
Are you ready for that?

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:23.546
Here we are.

00:16:23.546 --> 00:16:24.420
It's the same monkey.

00:16:27.382 --> 00:16:28.965
You can see that his
eye movements may

00:16:28.965 --> 00:16:32.750
be a little bit slower perhaps
but he still looks to the left

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:34.750
and to the right quite well.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.950
He tends to sort of look towards
the side of the lesion when

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:45.190
there's no stimulus OK, but
other than that he seems

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:49.340
to make really rather, rather
good eye movement in spite

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:52.410
of the fact that he has a
colliculus missing on one side.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:17:01.130
So what that means is that just
looking at what the monkey does

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:04.390
in this qualitative
manner is not

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:10.640
going to tell you too much about
what these various structures

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:15.720
do and so consequently you
have to carry out some more

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:20.490
refined experiments to
determine what kinds of deficits

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:24.180
do arise when you take out
the colliculus, you take out

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:29.710
other cortical structures for
the generation of eye movement.

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:34.430
So let me first of all tell
you about a really interesting

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:38.550
finding that was
made that had nothing

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:40.890
to do with the colliculus
at the time it was made,

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:44.990
was a strictly behavioral study
much of it done on humans.

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:48.530
What was done is first of
all a fixation spot came on

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:50.990
and then a single
target appeared

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:54.050
and often what was done is that
the fixation spot was turned

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:59.560
off just a few milliseconds
before the target came

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:03.760
on and on each trial it
appeared someplace else OK?

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.010
So then you've
collected a lot of data

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:11.030
to see what is the nature of
the monkey's eye movements

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:17.210
and in particular that initial
study examined by Fischer

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:21.170
and Boch, examined what the
latency distribution was

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:23.710
of the eye movements
made and they made

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:26.990
an incredible discovery that
they subsequently generated

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:30.500
hundreds of studies published
in numerous journals,

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.850
and this is the discovery.

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:36.320
Here we have the
latency of saccades made

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.840
and here's a number
of saccades and what

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.260
you get is a
bimodal distribution

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.380
of saccadic latencies, amazing.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.030
They call the first
mode, which takes

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:50.290
place in the latency of average
latency for bright stimulus

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:55.450
over about 100 milliseconds,
called express saccades.

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:58.380
The second mode they called
regular saccades and that

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:02.950
took about I don't know,
135, 140 milliseconds

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:03.640
on the average.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.750
So that got this
bimodal distribution

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:12.670
and so people said, my goodness
what could this be due to?

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:14.540
How do we explain this effect?

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:16.560
What other cortical
or subcortical

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.920
mechanisms that give rise
to a bimodal distribution

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:20.890
of saccadic latencies?

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:24.360
As I've said a huge
number of experiments

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.440
had been carried out
to find this out.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.800
So when one group
of investigators

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.986
saw this phenomenon and
they did experiments

00:19:33.986 --> 00:19:35.360
with monkey's and
they found this

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.750
is a real effect everywhere,
these findings were initially

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:42.320
made in Germany and even,
even in the United States

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.430
you get a bimodal
distribution of saccades

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:46.830
in both humans and monkeys.

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:52.500
So once it was established
as a really solid effect

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:56.080
people began to speculate
as to what are the neural,

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.040
underlying mechanisms?

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:02.940
And as I've told
you earlier it was

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:11.580
noted that based on those lesion
studies of the colliculus which

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:15.540
eliminated saccades from the
posterior portion of the cortex

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:19.330
but not from the
interior, that there

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:24.940
is a reasonable hypothesis
involved in proposing that you

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:29.320
have a posterior system
and an anterior system.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.220
And so when people saw
this they said aha,

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.990
now we know why we
have these two systems.

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:37.320
One is for making rapid
saccades and the other

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.380
is to making regular saccades.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:43.020
And so they proposed that
the posterior system does

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:47.060
one of these and the anterior
system does the other.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:50.550
Well that was a nice
hypothesis but so often

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:55.020
when it comes to hypotheses
as to how the brain works,

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:59.270
often most of the time the
hypotheses end up being wrong

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:02.870
and so what you need to do
rather than just hypothesize is

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:05.290
to actually carry
out experiments

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:07.440
to test the hypothesis.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.540
So what is the test
of this hypothesis?

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.206
What would you do as
an experimentalist?

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.112
Well, yes.

00:21:19.036 --> 00:21:21.922
AUDIENCE: You could
ablate either posterior

00:21:21.922 --> 00:21:23.860
or the anterior pathways.

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:25.880
PROFESSOR: Very good
you could ablate.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.660
All right so one
thing you can do

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:32.460
first of all you can ablate
the superior colliculus even

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:39.800
though when you saw that just
with regular easy test just

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.880
filming it, you didn't
see much of a deficit.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:47.642
You sort of sense that maybe the
monkey's a bit slower but other

00:21:47.642 --> 00:21:49.140
than that it wasn't that clear.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.110
But if you take
out the colliculus

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:55.170
then you eliminate the posterior
system in essence all right,

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:57.886
and so the question is what
happens when you do that?

00:21:57.886 --> 00:21:59.260
And then you can
ask the question

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.760
what happens when you take
out some other cortical areas?

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:03.850
So let's look at this.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:11.880
Here we have a monkey 10 weeks
after the colliculus has been

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.510
ablated, we're talking
about a major effect here

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:17.640
that doesn't recover,
and you took out

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:21.090
the colliculus on one
side on the left OK,

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:23.910
so that controls
rightward saccades

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:26.920
and therefore when you look at
the leftward saccades that's

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.980
to the intact side
of the brain you

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.100
get the usual
bimodal distribution

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:32.810
of saccadic latencies.

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:35.460
But then when you look
at rightward saccades

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:39.160
Lo and behold, you don't
see a single express saccade

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.660
and even the regular
saccades have

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:45.822
a longer latency than the
ones to they intact side

00:22:45.822 --> 00:22:47.530
and these are collected
at the same time.

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:49.940
The monkey's sitting
there with his head fixed

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:51.740
and sometimes a target
appears on the left

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.960
sometimes on the right and you
collect hundreds of thousands

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:59.190
of trials that way and you test
this over various time periods

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:03.720
and this is at least 10 weeks, 2
and 1/2 months after the lesion

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.950
and even if you test
the monkey a year

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:08.390
later you still get
the same effect.

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:11.100
So this clearly
points out the fact

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:15.400
that your ability to make these
rapid reflex-like saccades

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:19.980
is something that's got to go
through the superior colliculus

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:21.260
OK?

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:25.090
So now we can ask the question,
well, what about if one

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:28.310
makes lesions in the frontal
and medial eye fields?

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:31.713
All right so think about
that for a minute what would

00:23:31.713 --> 00:23:32.213
you predict?

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:38.170
All right so here we go.

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:41.110
We take out the frontal eye
fields in this case, ready?

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:44.400
Oops let me go back.

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.390
We take out the
frontal eye fields

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:52.090
but to give you a sense of this
overall effect first of all

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:56.520
let's just do the same informal
testing that I've shown you

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.460
before with the
colliculus and see

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.600
what the movie looks like OK?

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.660
Here's a monkey not as
handsome as the other one,

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:08.040
but what you do here
is a person behind

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.100
there sometimes just
presents a target

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:13.000
and sometimes just moves it
around so the monkey tracks it,

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:13.770
can you see that?

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:17.566
And what I shouldn't have
told you which one I feel

00:24:17.566 --> 00:24:18.315
have been ablated.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:26.490
Look at how nicely he
tracks on both sides,

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:29.040
grabs it, puts it in his,
stuffs it in his mouth

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:32.620
and so the monkey seems to
be perfectly fine with making

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:37.630
saccades to either side and
perfectly fine making pursuit

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:41.240
eye movements either
direction, indicating

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:45.740
that this informal testing
doesn't reveal anything truly

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:50.090
obvious about the deficit
that you have in eye movement

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:52.630
control when you take out
the frontal eye fields.

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:55.490
So therefore you
again need to go on

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:59.090
to carry out some more
careful experiments

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:03.320
to obtain some detailed
quantitative data.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.380
So let's look at that.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:09.010
First of all let's go back
and look at express saccades.

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:11.670
You take out the frontal eye
fields and Lo and behold,

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:14.990
you still get express
saccades indicating

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:20.780
that that is definitely specific
for the posterior system

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:23.670
even further if you do
this experiment what

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:26.680
you find if you take out both
the medial and frontal eye

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.310
fields you still
get it, you still

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:31.130
get your express saccades.

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:35.130
So clearly these two areas
are not directly involved

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:38.330
in generating quick rapid
saccadic eye movements

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:42.270
and it's still bimodal so
that initial hypothesis

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:44.290
that the first mode
is the colliculus

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:47.250
and the second posterior
system the colliculus

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:51.570
and the second mode
is the anterior system

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:52.990
is clearly totally wrong.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.430
All right so that's
what then happens

00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:01.810
and once this has been
done, you say, well, you've

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:04.690
got to find something that the
frontal eye and the medial eye

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:05.450
fields are doing.

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:08.330
So let's come up with
some other experiments

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:13.120
to see whether the monkey is
selective for anything else

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.610
when it comes to lesions of
the frontal and the medial eye

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:17.580
fields.

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:22.460
All right so one thing
that had been proposed

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:27.070
is that maybe the important
factor is some high level eye

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:32.130
movement activity such as making
saccades in quick succession

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:35.870
to successive targets
that are out there OK?

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:38.760
So the way that can
be done quantitatively

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.790
is you have the monkey
first fixate OK,

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:45.220
and after they fixate
you present the target

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.310
and then you present
the second target.

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:50.330
So the monkey has to make
two successive saccades

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.670
and what you can
do is you can vary

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:56.900
the temporal delay
between their succession.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:02.540
So the monkey then has to make
a plan to makes two saccades

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:05.820
because these two stimuli
appear before the monkey starts

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:09.130
his initial saccade when the
temporal interval is short.

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:11.420
So then the monkey
somehow knows it's easier

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:15.840
to do, he has to do this even
though he starts a saccade only

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.740
after the two targets have
come on when they are presented

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.810
indeed in the short,
the short latency.

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:25.900
So that's what happens and
of course in different trials

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:28.560
you have different kinds
of pairings like that

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.115
and if you do that what you
find is very interesting

00:27:31.115 --> 00:27:33.250
here are the four
conditions, this

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:37.650
shows the monkey's
performance 18 weeks post

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:39.890
left frontal eye field
lesion and this shows it

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:44.420
60 weeks after and it shows
this to the intact side

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.160
and the side where the
frontal eye fields are missing

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.240
and what you can see
very dramatically

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:52.540
is that the monkey
really has difficulties

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:58.820
in making a plan to execute
two saccades in a row.

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:02.880
Quite dramatic effect
significant [INAUDIBLE] one

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:06.970
level, of course indicating
that the frontal eye fields

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:10.750
play a role in planning
sequences of eye movements.

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:15.860
Now then another, well
this I want to show you,

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:19.560
what happens with
the, when you compare

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.770
the effects of the
frontal eye field

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:24.510
lesions and the medial
eye field lesion

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:29.210
and this is done over
various sequence durations

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:35.030
and for several weeks and what
you find is that in both cases

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:38.170
there is a recovery
but the effect

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:41.600
is much, much more dramatic with
the frontal eye field lesion

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.540
than a medial eye field lesion.

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.640
So indeed there's
for the frontal eye

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.080
fields we can say the
frontal eye fields play

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.680
an important role in planning
sequences of eye movements

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:58.440
which is sort of a high
level activity in executing

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.110
saccadic eye movements.

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:06.070
Now then what we can
do is to examine what

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:10.840
about making a decision
of where to look when

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:14.020
more than one target comes up
and the simplest form of that

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:17.769
is that you present two
targets like that OK?

00:29:17.769 --> 00:29:19.560
And so the monkey has
to make a decision am

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:21.970
I going to look to the
left or to the right?

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:24.240
And then what you
do is you can vary

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:32.510
the temporal delay between the
two like that, or like that OK?

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:35.350
And then you can do that
again either to intact

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:37.180
parts of the visual
field or those

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:40.470
where either frontal eye
fields or some other structure

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:41.450
is missing.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:43.710
All right so let's
look at what happens.

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:46.620
Here is what we have
is the intact monkey

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.020
this part I've shown you before.

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.970
All right this is when
the two targets come

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:55.330
on simultaneously
and in this case

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:58.550
the left target comes on 34
milliseconds before the right

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:00.360
and here's the
reverse and what you

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:04.010
can see that even a 34
millisecond delay causes

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:08.840
the monkey to very much prefer
to go to the, to the target,

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:13.090
make a saccade to the target
that had appeared first.

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:16.620
So that's what happens in
a normal intact monkey.

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:20.680
Now we can ask the next
related questions still

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.350
in the normal
intact monkey, what

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:24.870
happens when you put the
two stimuli closer together?

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.010
OK so here's an example they're,
now they're separated only

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:32.630
by 40 degrees and
here the data again it

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:37.530
shows that when it's, in this
case 67 milliseconds apart

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:39.700
the monkey chooses
almost exclusively

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.640
the target that comes on first.

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:45.270
When they're simultaneous
what happens is interesting,

00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:47.980
you get some so-called
vector average saccades

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:50.870
that you always get with
electrical stimulation.

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:54.140
So those you get, it's still
a minority of the saccades.

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:56.530
And the closer you
bring the two together,

00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:59.480
the more frequent will be
the vector average saccades.

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:02.440
When they're only
separated by set 10 degrees

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.960
they will be all vector
average saccades So this

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.900
is what happens in
the normal monkey you

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:12.168
get this nice bimodal
distribution and vector

00:31:12.168 --> 00:31:14.126
average saccades when
the two are simultaneous.

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:19.370
Now let's ask the question
what happens when you take out

00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:23.360
a cortical structure in this
case the frontal eye fields

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:26.930
and here we are you take out
the left frontal eye fields.

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:30.280
These above are the same
the data I just shown you

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:35.190
adding a bigger delay here, just
to make it even clearer that

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:37.590
by that time the
monkey never chooses

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:39.180
the target that comes on second.

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:45.690
And here we have the monkey
after left frontal eye field

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:48.300
lesion and look at
what, what happens.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:52.000
What happens is
that the monkey at 0

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.790
chooses 100% saccade
to the intact side OK.

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:59.860
There seem to be a little
bit of a shift here

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:02.870
and then when they're
100 milliseconds,

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:04.370
then you have an
equal distribution.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:09.980
So to equalize the choice
that the brain makes

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:13.170
you have to now because of the
missing frontal eye fields,

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:18.950
present one of the targets
a 100 milliseconds earlier

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:23.500
on the affected side to get
the same kind of distribution

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.560
that you get in
the intact monkey.

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.870
So this further
highlights the fact

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:32.660
that the frontal eye fields
play a significant role

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:40.595
in making decisions about the
selection of visual targets.

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:46.260
All right now we can look
at this more quantitatively.

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:54.270
This shows the distribution of
choices OK, to the left target,

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:56.702
this is the intact
monkey preoperative

00:32:56.702 --> 00:32:58.660
and then when you take
out the left frontal eye

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:03.670
fields it's a huge movement
over the equal choices

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:08.420
has to be about 130
milliseconds separated

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:11.590
with the affected side getting
the target a 130 milliseconds

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:12.330
earlier.

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:15.690
Then if you keep doing
this there's some recovery

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:19.795
but even four years later
you still have a huge effect.

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.220
Now you can ask
the question what

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:26.750
if you do the same experiment
in the medial eye fields?

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:29.600
And so if you do that you
first of all get a small effect

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:34.600
to begin with and after just
16 weeks there's full recovery.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.780
So obviously the
medial eye fields

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:40.710
don't, do not seem to
play a central role

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:44.140
in making decisions
as to which target

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:45.980
to look at when more
than one target appears

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.490
in the visual field.

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:52.620
All right so now having
done that quantitative work

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:54.990
indicating that the
frontal eye fields play

00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:57.070
an important role
in target selection

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:59.450
and the sequencing
of eye movements.

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:01.150
We can move on and
ask the question,

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:04.690
well we talked
about the posterior

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:06.775
system and the anterior system.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:12.500
Is it true that there
are these two systems?

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:16.110
Or are there many more systems
that we're not aware of?

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.214
This should remind
you of the fact

00:34:20.214 --> 00:34:21.880
that it had been
proposed when we talked

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:26.510
about extrastriate
cortex that area of V4

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:36.020
essential for processing high
level activity including color,

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:42.340
whereas the area MT and MST play
an important role in emotion

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.380
and so it was purported
that these two

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:48.139
major systems in the posterior
cortex, the medial and lateral

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:48.909
if you will.

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:55.080
So the question was raised if
you remove both of these areas,

00:34:55.080 --> 00:35:03.190
meaning the gateway to these
areas, V4 and MT what happens?

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:05.970
And when you do that
they still the monkey's

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:09.830
able to do a lot of things
indicating that we have more

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:15.690
pathways from V1 than just these
two the anterior, the medial

00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:16.750
and the lateral.

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:18.590
So now the question
is what about when

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:20.250
it comes to this eye
movement control?

00:35:21.972 --> 00:35:23.680
We should do the same
kind of experiment.

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:28.850
We should remove the colliculus
that supposedly eliminates

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:32.380
the posterior system and then
we should remove the frontal eye

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:37.190
fields bilaterally, that
eliminates the anterior system.

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:41.580
So now the question is what
happens when you do that?

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:44.810
And again, we going to
turn to the informal test,

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:46.880
meaning we going
to, we going to take

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:51.674
a movie of the monkey who
has these areas removed.

00:35:51.674 --> 00:35:54.340
Think about it for a minute what
do you think's going to happen?

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:58.280
OK so here's the monkey.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:58.780
Ready?

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:15.700
The monkey sees well, he makes
his movements with his hands

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:19.940
quite accurately but what,
what happens to the eyes,

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:21.310
you watching the eyes right?

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:23.055
No eye movement.

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:25.152
Everybody see this?

00:36:25.152 --> 00:36:26.110
Should I show it again?

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:33.090
The monkey makes
no eye movements.

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:36.260
He cannot make eye movements
because his natural tendency

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:38.930
would be just like I'd seen
in the previous movies that he

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:45.260
makes eye movements to the apple
pieces so he can grab them.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.440
He still pays attention
to them everything

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:51.520
is fine except he doesn't move
his eyes because he can't move

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:54.630
his eyes as a result of
having eliminated these two

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:57.500
systems and because
of that we can say

00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:02.400
with confidence that it's,
as far as the visual as far

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:06.300
as the ocular motor system
is concerned we indeed have

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:10.630
these two major pathways
which when they're eliminated

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:13.690
eliminates their
ability to move,

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:15.670
make saccadic eye movements.

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:22.530
OK now let's go
back to the effect

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:29.130
of electrical stimulation to
gain further insight about what

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:31.310
these various areas
do and what you

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:34.160
can do in these
experiments is not only

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:37.990
to stimulate at a high
level to elicit a saccade

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:41.820
but you can simulate
at a lower level

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:46.540
and then pair that with the
appearance of a visual target.

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:51.610
This then enables you to see
whether there's summation here

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:54.720
or if there's interference,
so let's look at that.

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.240
All right here is
again a monkey brain

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.970
and what I'm going to tell
you is what happens when you

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:04.980
do this experiment in V1, in
LIP, and in the frontal eye

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:08.310
fields, even maybe I
think I may have something

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:09.900
also in the medial eye fields.

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:13.640
All right so let me describe the
experimental procedure for you

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:16.060
so that you understand how
these kinds of experiments

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.280
are conducted.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:20.370
You put an electrode in
to any of these structures

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:23.050
and you find the receptive
field first all right?

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:26.200
Once you've found the receptive
field you electrically

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.610
stimulate then you
confirm the fact

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:33.020
that the electrical
stimulation brings the fovea

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:36.990
into the receptive field of
the simulated neuron's when

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:40.000
you do this in all the areas
except in the medial eye

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:40.770
fields.

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:45.690
Then what you do is you actually
present the visual target there

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:46.560
OK?

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:51.830
And lastly you present
two visual targets

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:54.180
and you electrically
stimulate to see

00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:58.920
how it biases your choice
as a result of this

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:02.570
in most cases sub-threshold
electrical stimulation.

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:06.490
So if you do that what
you find is, first of all,

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:09.740
if you do this experiment
with a intact monkey

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:15.400
without stimulation you find
say a receptive field here

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:19.110
and then you simply see what
the monkey's choices are left

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:21.920
to the right and
what you plot here

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:25.979
is the saccades made to the
target in the receptive field

00:39:25.979 --> 00:39:27.770
and what you can see
is what I've shown you

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:31.380
before namely when the
targets are simultaneous then

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:34.440
the monkey chooses left or
right with equal probability.

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.625
Now we're going to add
the electrical stimulation

00:39:38.625 --> 00:39:42.960
and ask the question can we
shift the curve to the left?

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.940
If you shift it
to the left, that

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:47.780
means that the electrical
stimulation facilitated

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:52.020
the choice and if you shift
to the right it means that it

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:55.470
caused interference,
it lessened the chances

00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:57.560
of the monkey making a
saccade into that area,

00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:00.540
meaning the stimulation
created inhibition.

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:01.570
Got it?

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:04.580
All right, so here's
an example in the lower

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:09.980
layers of V1 remember
in layer six of area

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:14.740
V1 is where you have your
complex cells that project down

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:16.070
to the superior colliculus.

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:19.590
So here if you stimulate at
sub-threshold levels and some

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:23.220
of these are very low levels
only 7 1/2 and 10 microamps.

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:26.180
OK, really very,
very fine currents

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:28.710
using themselves going to
elicit an eye movement.

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:32.400
So if you do that the
stimulation created

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:35.450
a significant, highly
significant facilitatory

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:36.050
affect.

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:38.070
This is in the lower layers.

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:41.730
Now if you do the same
experiment in the upper layers

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:45.800
you get the opposite effect
we get a gigantic even-- look

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:50.670
at this five and 10 microamps,
--even at that low, incredibly

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:54.220
low level you get a gigantic
interference effect.

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:59.660
So that says that there's
a complex interplay in V1

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:02.700
in the decision
process that arises

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.785
as to whether you're
going to look at a target,

00:41:04.785 --> 00:41:07.250
or whether you're not
going to look at a target.

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:10.230
Now we can do the
same experiment in LIP

00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:13.550
and in some regions you get
this huge facilitatory effect

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:16.470
and in other regions you
get an inhibitory effect,

00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:17.890
so that's LIP.

00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:21.850
So therefore this structure
also plays a significant role

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:24.720
in deciding whether
to look at or not

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:27.970
to look at a visual
stimulus and here it

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:31.930
shows that in LIP as
you increase the current

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:35.430
you get a gigantic
increase in the latency

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:38.330
in these inhibitory
areas with which

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:42.360
a saccade can be generated
indicating that LIP plays

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:45.552
an important role
in whether you're

00:41:45.552 --> 00:41:47.510
going to look at a target
or whether you're not

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:48.860
going to look at target.

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:51.560
OK and then if you do
the frontal eye fields

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:53.370
everywhere in the
frontal eye fields

00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:56.830
you get a huge
facilitatory effect

00:41:56.830 --> 00:42:03.560
and in the medial eye fields you
also get a facilitatory effect

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:08.170
as long as the
motor field is where

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:09.410
the visual target appears.

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:13.510
But now you can remember what
I told you about the medial eye

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:17.390
fields the fact is that
they have a place code.

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:19.710
So one can do a
different experiment

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:26.170
in which instead of presenting
the target in the motor field

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:34.780
you can present the
fixation spot there.

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:39.030
So here again to remind you,
we have this place code.

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:41.550
So now we do this
experiment, just

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:44.040
like what I've shown you
before just to repeat it,

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:49.320
in this case the target appears
and that causes a facilitation

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:52.660
in this case we put the
fixation spot in there

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:56.720
and the location of the
target's just displaced

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:59.620
and when you do that you
get a huge inhibitory

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:04.700
effect because somehow the
electrical stimulation forces

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:10.300
the animal keep the eye at
the location where the motor

00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:13.870
field is in the
medial eye fields

00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:16.410
and this is a very
important point

00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:20.710
and it means that the medial eye
fields plays a significant role

00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:23.940
in deciding how long
to look at a target

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:25.550
before making the next saccade.

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:32.410
OK so now we going to,
there's a lot of facts, so

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:34.580
and you're going to get
some more lot of facts.

00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:36.530
So now I'm going to
summarize what I told you

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:39.220
about the effects of
sub-threshold electrical

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:41.080
stimulation OK?

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:44.560
If you stimulate in the
upper layers of V1 and V2,

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.490
V2 I should add to this
you get interference,

00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:51.760
in the lower layers you get
facilitation in V4 there was

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:55.910
no effect I didn't talk about
that before in LIP you can get

00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:59.950
both facilitation interference
and also fixation increase.

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:02.720
In the frontal eye fields
you get facilitation

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.880
and the medial eye
fields depending

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:07.840
on how you set it up
you can get facilitation

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:12.010
if the target appears
in the motor field

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:16.910
and you get inhibition
when it appear,

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:19.550
when the fixation
spot appears in it.

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:23.850
So that's the basic
summary of these effects.

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:29.130
Now what these findings
indicate that somehow

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:34.670
inhibitory circuits are
essential in our ability

00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:38.960
to make saccades to
selected visual targets

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:41.700
and therefore what
we want to do is

00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:45.070
to examine what
happens when you use

00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:48.490
various kinds of
pharmacological agents

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:56.720
that either facilitate
or increase inhibition.

00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:01.760
So to explain that then let me
first of all point out to you

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:04.340
that if you take
again the whole brain

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:08.180
and you look at the
colliculus and you look at V1,

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:11.140
you look at LIP, you look
at the frontal eye fields

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:15.150
you can study these
areas by injecting

00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:16.990
two kinds of
pharmacological agents,

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:20.190
bicuculline and muscimol
some people believe

00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:23.870
you've heard of this as
muscimol I call it muscimol.

00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:25.850
At any rate you
all know I'm sure

00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:30.500
but this is bicuculline is
a GABA antagonist meaning

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:35.840
that if you inject
it OK, it stops

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:39.390
the effectiveness of
inhibition by GABA.

00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:42.230
Muscimol on the other
hand is a GABA agonist

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:44.720
meaning that if
you inject it you

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.740
increase inhibition all right?

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:50.440
Now I'm sure that
all of you must

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:55.250
have had enough of a
background in biochemistry

00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:57.230
to know what these
two agents are.

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:07.840
So now what we can
do is we can inject

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:13.840
either one or the other of these
agents and assess two things.

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:15.580
First off we assess
eye movements

00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:18.090
and secondly we also
have to obviously assess

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:19.910
how it affects your
visual ability.

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:23.450
So let's move on and do this.

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:28.200
The first set of
experiments done with this

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:31.640
was by Hikosaka and Woods many
years ago in the colliculus.

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:38.100
So what they did, very
clever beautiful experiment,

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:42.180
is that they would
put a microelectrode

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:45.640
into the colliculus and then
initially just stimulate

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:48.590
to see what kind of eye
movement you get and then they

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:54.580
would inject either muscimol
or what's the other agent?

00:46:56.302 --> 00:46:57.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:57.270 --> 00:47:00.090
PROFESSOR: Very good
and see what happens.

00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:02.355
Now which of those
causes more inhibition?

00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:04.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:13.190
PROFESSOR: OK, so let's
look at that then.

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:15.550
If you electrically stimulate
just like I've shown you

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:19.100
before you get a constant
vector saccade no matter

00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:21.585
where the eye starts
you get the same vector.

00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:25.630
Now the question is what
happens to the spontaneous eye

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:32.300
movements of the monkey when
you first inject muscimol OK?

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:37.220
Which is an agent that
mimics if you will your GABA,

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:40.050
meaning it increases
inhibition and what happens

00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:43.010
is that the monkey hardly
ever makes a saccade

00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:46.170
with the vectors
represented by the area that

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:47.640
has been injected.

00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:52.280
By contrast if you
inject bicuculline

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:56.790
the monkey keeps making saccades
with that vector even when

00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:59.330
there's nothing out there
like the release of area

00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:00.530
for inhibition.

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:03.070
And the signal is sent down to
the brain step move your eye,

00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:05.230
move your eye, move
your eye, move your eye,

00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:06.530
that's what happens.

00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:12.860
So to show this in
more detail then

00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:18.140
we can ask what happens when
you use two behavioral tasks OK,

00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:20.140
the so-called paired
target task that we already

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:22.740
talked about quite
a bit and you talk

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:25.540
about a visual
discrimination task

00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:27.380
and that one is
that you're already

00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:30.470
familiar with the so-called
audited task you present

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:34.340
several stimuli one of which
is different from the others.

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:38.580
All right so here is an example
of the paired target task.

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:41.740
What we do here again we
vary the temporal asynchrony

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:43.340
between the two
targets just like what

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:45.320
I've shown with the
electrical stimulation

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:47.940
and this is the monkey's
normal behavior when the two

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:53.190
targets are simultaneous the
monkey chooses each randomly.

00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:59.050
Now let's ask the question what
happens is again to remind you,

00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:02.290
if it goes this way the curve
goes this way it's facilitation

00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:05.620
if the current curve goes
that way we get interference.

00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:09.520
So let's ask what happens first
of all, no let me also tell you

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:12.760
about the oddity task just to
make sure that you have it.

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:16.020
All right that's the oddity
task you know that already.

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:19.520
All right so we can now
go on and first examine

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:22.790
what happens with
muscimol or muscimol

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:25.120
or whatever you
prefer to use OK?

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:27.651
Well again what, what
does this agent do?

00:49:27.651 --> 00:49:29.150
Does it do excitation
or inhibition?

00:49:30.314 --> 00:49:31.610
AUDIENCE: Inhibition.

00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:35.710
PROFESSOR: Very good, inhibition
because it mimics GABA

00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:36.430
all right?

00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:38.120
So let's look at what happens.

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:41.300
Here we have a normal
monkey same experiment

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:45.980
as before, here
is the this is V1,

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:48.880
here's a receptive field you
present one visual target

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:51.760
there, the other there, then you
vary the temporary asynchrony

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:56.330
between them, this is what
happens in the normal case OK?

00:49:56.330 --> 00:50:00.120
Now you're going to
inject the muscimol

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:01.800
and ask yourself
the question, we

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.490
increased inhibition what do
you think is going to happen?

00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:06.100
Well it should be
pretty obvious,

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:09.120
what happens is you
get gigantic inhibition

00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:11.190
the monkey practically
never looks

00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:14.880
at here because that area
is not being activated

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:18.690
by the visual stimulus
because of the inhibition.

00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:22.520
Then if you do this over time,
even four hours later there's

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:24.790
a huge, huge effect
but by the next day

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:28.690
the monkey recovers luckily
so one can do this experiment

00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:31.860
several times because
this agent is something

00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:33.780
that washes out of the brain.

00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:36.870
All right so now
let's look at what

00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:38.780
happens in the
frontal eye fields.

00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:42.560
Same experiment, all right,
just a different location

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:43.597
with the electrode.

00:50:43.597 --> 00:50:45.430
And what you get, this
is your preinjection.

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:49.970
And once again,
after the injection,

00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:52.390
you get a big
interference effect

00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:54.120
which recovers by the next day.

00:50:55.410 --> 00:50:57.850
So that is what you
get that with that.

00:50:57.850 --> 00:51:02.010
Then let's examine
what happens in LIP.

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.990
Curiously in LIP
there was no effect.

00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:07.720
All right.

00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:13.640
So now let's next turn to the
so-called oddity task meaning

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:16.900
several stimuli, one of which
is different from the others

00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:21.230
and what is the monkey's
ability to choose

00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:22.970
the different stimulus.

00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:26.260
So if you do this with
a muscimol injection

00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:29.260
there's a huge deficit
for V1 that you

00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:32.720
would expect because it
destroyed the monkey's ability

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.250
to analyze the
visual stimulus that

00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:37.840
appeared in the receptive field.

00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:40.870
Then if you do the same thing
in the frontal eye fields

00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:45.110
you find a mild deficit and then
if you do the same thing in LIP

00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:47.800
you get no deficit at all.

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:51.960
So this is what then happens
with the oddities task

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:55.860
and now what you can do is
ask what happens when instead

00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:59.410
of muscimol we're going
to inject bicuculline?

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:04.560
And we're going to go
through the same procedure

00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:10.529
as what I just shown you
and so we start here in V1

00:52:10.529 --> 00:52:12.570
and when you do that think
about it for a minute,

00:52:12.570 --> 00:52:15.680
now you're
facilitating supposedly

00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:17.370
because you're
eliminating inhibition

00:52:17.370 --> 00:52:18.703
what do you think you would get?

00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:22.150
Well, you'll be in
for a surprise, what

00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:25.230
you get is gigantic
interference again

00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:30.400
because putting bicuculline
in also screwed up you're

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:35.370
ability in the visual cortex
to analyze the visual percept.

00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:39.700
This again recovers over
time by the next day

00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:41.020
it's back to normal.

00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:43.719
Then if you do the same
experiment in the frontal eye

00:52:43.719 --> 00:52:45.510
fields what do you
think's going to happen?

00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:47.670
Can you predict what's
going to happen just

00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:48.660
looking at this slide?

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:53.753
Why do you think this is such
a big empty space here huh?

00:52:55.110 --> 00:53:01.550
OK well look at that, when
you put in bicuculline we

00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:03.066
get this incredible
facilitation.

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:07.300
OK the monkey just
like in the colliculus

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:12.340
barely can help himself to
make a saccade into the field

00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:20.170
that has been disinhibited
OK?, and that again recovers,

00:53:20.170 --> 00:53:22.100
bicuculline is washed
out more rapidly

00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:24.900
than muscimol and
by the next day

00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:26.750
certainly is back to normal.

00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:29.200
Now we can do the same
thing just looking

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:33.490
at the eye movements
themselves to further highlight

00:53:33.490 --> 00:53:35.140
what I've shown you before.

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:38.670
If you'd put bicuculline in
OK, in the frontal eye fields

00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:44.290
the monkey cannot help but make
saccades with similar vectors

00:53:44.290 --> 00:53:49.410
that are represented by the
neurons in the injected site

00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:52.320
and that's why you have all this
is its full stack of saccades

00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:55.290
buh, buh, buh, buh, bang
the monkey just can't help

00:53:55.290 --> 00:53:59.301
but makes saccades because the
signal to make the saccade has

00:53:59.301 --> 00:54:00.050
been disinhibited.

00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:06.000
All right so then you can
ask what happens in LIP

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.420
and when you do that you
get no effect at all,

00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:14.200
and if you do now the
bicuculline injection

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:16.880
with the oddities
task we can once again

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:19.150
ask well what happens with that?

00:54:19.150 --> 00:54:23.530
And then once again as
I've already indicated,

00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:28.020
both bicuculline and muscimol
cause a major interference

00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:34.340
in your ability to
select the odd target,

00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:37.780
in other words to
visually discriminate,

00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:40.220
but if you do the same thing
in the frontal eye fields

00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:44.460
and in the medial and LIP
you get no effect at all.

00:54:47.110 --> 00:54:52.820
So what this then says
to summarize all right

00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:53.575
is the following.

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:57.640
We talk about target selection,
which was a two target

00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:00.930
task, individual discrimination
which was the oddities task

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:03.950
and here we have muscimol
and here bicuculline.

00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:07.810
So if you do that in the
frontal eye field, in V1 first,

00:55:07.810 --> 00:55:10.920
you get interference, you
do it in the frontal eye

00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:12.900
fields you get
interference of muscimol

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:16.630
with great facilitation,
with bicuculline

00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:18.430
and LIP has no effec.

00:55:18.430 --> 00:55:20.850
And then, just to remind
you, it has already

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:23.110
been shown by
Hikosaka and Woods,

00:55:23.110 --> 00:55:25.690
that you get interference
of facilitation

00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:28.770
in the superior colliculus
with these two agents.

00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:31.220
You do the same thing with
visual discrimination,

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:34.350
you get a major
deficit in V1 for both

00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:41.070
and you get a mild effect
for both actually no effect

00:55:41.070 --> 00:55:42.820
really with bicuculline
in the frontal eye

00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:46.140
fields and no effect
at all in LIP.

00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:49.120
So these manipulations
then gives you

00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:54.470
sort of a sense of what
these various areas do

00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:56.780
in the generation
of eye movements

00:55:56.780 --> 00:55:59.830
that involve not only just
to make a saccade to a target

00:55:59.830 --> 00:56:03.780
but to select targets individual
field, make a decision as

00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:08.820
to where to look, and also
to decide when to look,

00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:10.700
because any time you
make an eye movement

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:14.270
and I should've mentioned that
more thoroughly before, you

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:16.840
look at something and
how long you look at it

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:19.890
depends on how long it takes you
to analyze what you're looking

00:56:19.890 --> 00:56:20.465
at.

00:56:20.465 --> 00:56:24.480
Now in most cases
it takes you maybe I

00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:27.220
don't know 200 milliseconds
or less to say,

00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:30.310
oh yeah that's
letter a or whatever

00:56:30.310 --> 00:56:35.677
and then you say it's your brain
mechanisms tell you, OK, now

00:56:35.677 --> 00:56:36.510
you know what it is.

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:38.830
It's OK for you
to move your eye.

00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:42.000
OK so that's involved
and then thirdly,

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.710
you have an important
task in making sequences

00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:46.490
of eye movements
so that when you

00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:49.910
look at a picture like the movie
I showed you in the beginning

00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:53.300
in the previous lecture,
when you look at something

00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:55.480
then you make a decision
as to where to look next,

00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:57.970
where to look next and
if you keep doing this

00:56:57.970 --> 00:57:01.310
for I don't know 20, 30
saccades then you get to a state

00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:02.730
where you say oh
now I understand

00:57:02.730 --> 00:57:03.750
the picture as a whole.

00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:08.350
All right so now we're
going to summarize

00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:11.560
what the tasks are in
a very simple situation

00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:13.870
and what brain structures
are involved in it.

00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:15.990
First of all let's
imagine that you're

00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:20.780
looking at fixation
spot designated by a.

00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:23.240
Let's assume the
two stimuli come on

00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:26.110
and that means that you
have to make a decision as

00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:28.310
to what those two
targets are, you

00:57:28.310 --> 00:57:31.770
have to identify them because
you have to select one of those

00:57:31.770 --> 00:57:32.400
OK?

00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:35.100
Of course in most cases you're
talking about many targets that

00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:38.860
are out there this is a
highly simplified version.

00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:41.510
The next step is to
decide which of these two

00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:45.130
targets now that I know one says
a and the other says b, which

00:57:45.130 --> 00:57:49.030
of those two targets, actually
b and c in the picture here

00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:50.960
which of these targets
should I look at,

00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:54.470
and so you make a decision
all right, that generates

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:58.530
excitation and inhibitin,
inhibition through excitatory

00:57:58.530 --> 00:58:00.880
and inhibitory
circuits, and then you

00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:03.400
decide OK we going
to look here and that

00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:06.920
means that you have to
decide which one not to look

00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:09.640
at in addition to deciding
which one to look at,

00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:13.930
because you've got to make
an accurate saccade so you

00:58:13.930 --> 00:58:15.810
don't want a vector average.

00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:16.310
All right.

00:58:16.310 --> 00:58:22.500
And then what you need
of course is a map,

00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:29.350
if you will, of the motor
field so that you can generate

00:58:29.350 --> 00:58:33.610
the appropriate
direction of the saccade

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:36.720
so that you can decide where
you're going to look at

00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:40.190
and then lastly as I've
mentioned already before,

00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:42.260
you also have to
make a decision as

00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:44.880
to when to make
that eye movement.

00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:48.620
So now in a very
summary fashion we

00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:53.500
can talk about the various
brain areas involved.

00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:55.500
Quite a number of
different areas

00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:59.570
are involved in the decision as
to what these two stimuli are,

00:58:59.570 --> 00:59:02.940
they of course involve much
of the visual system including

00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:05.650
also LIP and
several other areas.

00:59:05.650 --> 00:59:07.920
Then, then you have
to make a decision as

00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:11.470
to which one to look at, again
several areas involve notably

00:59:11.470 --> 00:59:14.510
among them are the frontal
eye fields, LIP, and also

00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:16.440
the medial eye fields.

00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:20.560
Then you also have to decide
which ones not to look at,

00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:23.460
that it was largely
the same areas

00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:27.770
and then you need of course
a topographic arrangement

00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:30.830
to know where things
are and that you

00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:33.890
can find in many areas,
including V1, V2,

00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:36.590
the frontal eye fields, and the
colliculi which are laid out

00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:39.550
in a nice topographic
fashion, and then

00:59:39.550 --> 00:59:42.550
lastly LIP is
important for that,

00:59:42.550 --> 00:59:45.190
and I think to some degree
also the medial eye fields

00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:49.160
but I'm not sure about that to
decide when you should generate

00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:51.090
saccadic eye movements.

00:59:51.090 --> 00:59:52.800
Well that's very
nice and makes you

00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:55.160
realize that even
though we never

00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:58.940
think about making eye movement
all this stuff is going

00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:02.370
on three times a
second it's amazing.

01:00:02.370 --> 01:00:05.980
So now you're going to look at
what the various visual areas

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:10.900
and ocular motor areas are
that play a role in this OK,

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:14.300
and so we're going to
create a summary diagram.

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:16.140
So here we have,
that's the first one

01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:19.720
I shown you, which has a rate
code that from the brain stem

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:22.930
connects with the eye
muscles and activates them.

01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:25.340
Then we have the
superior colliculus,

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:34.420
now the superior colliculus is
under strong inhibitory control

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:37.310
all right, and they're several
inhibitory circuits that

01:00:37.310 --> 01:00:46.960
are involved in that and those
include the substantia nigra

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.840
that sends inhibitory
circuits down

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:54.830
to the colliculus that then
prevents the colliculus

01:00:54.830 --> 01:00:57.190
from generating an eye
movement because it

01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:59.350
is under inhibition,
because every time you

01:00:59.350 --> 01:01:02.120
look around thousands
and thousands

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:05.670
of impressions impinge
on the colliculus

01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:07.800
and you only want one of
those to actually get down

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.400
to the deep place,
the colliculus,

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:12.390
to generate an eye movement.

01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:18.410
Now then the substantia
nigra is under the control

01:01:18.410 --> 01:01:22.010
of several neural structures
which, many of which

01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:24.510
go through this
so-called basal ganglia.

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:29.490
Now we can expand on this
and look at the visual input

01:01:29.490 --> 01:01:30.580
to do this.

01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:32.400
We already talked
about this a lot

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:35.350
you, pointed out to you
that you have these three

01:01:35.350 --> 01:01:39.290
major, many, many different
types of ganglion cells.

01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:40.860
The three major
ones we talked about

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:46.350
are the midget parasol
and the so-called W-cells

01:01:46.350 --> 01:01:48.980
that go to the cortex.

01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:52.670
And the W-cells also project
directly to the colliculus.

01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:57.310
Then from layer five
in the visual cortex

01:01:57.310 --> 01:02:01.410
you have the cells that project
to the superior colliculus

01:02:01.410 --> 01:02:09.370
and the intermediate layers and
that down flow is controlled

01:02:09.370 --> 01:02:15.370
predominantly by the parasol
system as we had described.

01:02:15.370 --> 01:02:17.970
Then we have all
these other areas

01:02:17.970 --> 01:02:24.000
that V1 projects to, V2, MT,
V4, and so on some of them

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.420
dominated by input
from the parasol system

01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:30.060
and others get input
from both, and those

01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:33.120
in turn project to the
parietal and temporal lobes

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:37.150
and those in turn have
an important influence

01:02:37.150 --> 01:02:41.700
on the inhibitory circuits
through the basal ganglia

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:44.200
and the substantia nigra.

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:47.700
Now let me finally come to the
frontal lobe, the frontal eye

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:50.640
fields, and the medial eye
fields and they in turn

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.520
have direct access
to the brain stem

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.920
and also connect to the
superior colliculus.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:00.600
Now this is still
not the whole story

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.450
because what you
have in addition is

01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:09.150
a bunch of interconnections
among numerous cortical areas

01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:11.950
they talk back and
forth to each other

01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:14.590
that enables you to
make these decisions as

01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:16.340
to where to look next.

01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:17.730
Now if you think
this is complete

01:03:17.730 --> 01:03:21.140
you're still wrong because
now what you have to realize

01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:25.530
is that all this
circuitry is also

01:03:25.530 --> 01:03:28.161
one that receives input
from several other areas,

01:03:28.161 --> 01:03:29.660
with the auditory
system that you're

01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:32.860
going to hear a lot about
later on in the course,

01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:36.020
the somatosensory system,
the olfactory system,

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:38.370
the smooth pursuit
system that we'll mention

01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:40.500
a little bit next
time, the vestibular

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:43.050
system, the accessory
optic system we'll

01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:46.290
talk about next time,
and the vergence system.

01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:49.950
So all these fit into this
incredibly complex circuitry

01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:55.050
already and essential
elements in your ability

01:03:55.050 --> 01:03:56.850
to move your eyes about.

01:03:56.850 --> 01:04:04.680
So I think you need to realize
therefore that something even

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:10.040
as simple as just moving your
eyes about it's an incredibly

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:15.510
complicated system
involving many structures

01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:19.360
and involving excitatory
and inhibitory circuits,

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:22.130
interconnections it's just,
it's almost dumbfounding.

01:04:23.170 --> 01:04:29.050
So that then is the essence
of these connections,

01:04:29.050 --> 01:04:31.349
and what I want
turn to next I think

01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:32.515
we still have a little time.

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:37.220
Before I summarize
our results for today,

01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:40.723
I want to say something
about dreaming and rapid eye

01:04:40.723 --> 01:04:41.222
movements.

01:04:43.958 --> 01:04:49.340
I think all of you know that
every night you sleep you dream

01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:51.780
and what you also know that
has been discovered more

01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:56.110
recently is when you dream you
make rapid eye movement so it's

01:04:56.110 --> 01:05:03.960
called REM sleep, and so the
question arose why do we dream?

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:06.000
Why do we have REM sleep?

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:16.320
Now, the major influence
as to why we dream

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:19.710
comes from the work
of Sigmund Freud who

01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:23.750
published a famous book one of
his really great works called,

01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:26.330
The Interpretation
Of Dreams, which

01:05:26.330 --> 01:05:31.850
was the original version in
German was published in 1900.

01:05:31.850 --> 01:05:35.310
OK so 113 years ago.

01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:38.860
Now this was an incredibly
influential book and also

01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:43.240
central for the emergence
of psychoanalysis

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:51.350
and has been used extensively to
interpret quotes why we dream.

01:05:51.350 --> 01:05:55.670
Now the prime, in
very summary fashion,

01:05:55.670 --> 01:06:00.260
the prime idea that
Freud expressed

01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:09.830
is that dreaming is equivalent
to wish-fulling your dreams,

01:06:09.830 --> 01:06:15.110
your wishes, to
fulfilling your wishes.

01:06:15.110 --> 01:06:18.320
So that's why it's called
wish fulfillment dreams.

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:24.100
Now, that's interesting because
one of the stories he has

01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:26.810
in that book of his,
Interpretation Of Dreams,

01:06:26.810 --> 01:06:33.280
is a woman he was
psychoanalyzing who one day

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:38.080
when she came to be, to her
session said you know you told

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:41.710
me the other day that dreams
are wish fulfillment's.

01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:46.280
She said, I don't believe
that, I had a dream last night

01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:51.610
and it didn't go along with
wish fulfillment and Freud said,

01:06:51.610 --> 01:06:54.216
I want you to tell me
what the dream was about.

01:06:54.216 --> 01:06:57.510
Well, my dream was
that I went to a store

01:06:57.510 --> 01:07:01.930
to buy some food because I was
going to have a dinner party

01:07:01.930 --> 01:07:06.890
and when I got to the store
it was closed and I could,

01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:08.870
as much as I wanted
to I couldn't

01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:10.320
buy the food for the dinner.

01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:15.840
Freud scratched his eyes,
you know I'm making that up,

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:21.730
and he said that's true,
he said you know what?

01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:23.370
You didn't want to
give a dinner party

01:07:23.370 --> 01:07:25.430
that's why you dreamt that.

01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:29.620
So that's famous
psychoanalytic stuff.

01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:31.830
You can always twist
things around so

01:07:31.830 --> 01:07:34.760
that it fits with
your hypotheses,

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:39.400
in this case Freud felt that
indeed even though she had

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:42.680
this, what she thought was a
contrary dream it was a wish

01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:44.190
fulfillment dream.

01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:46.650
Well that's one
part of dreaming,

01:07:46.650 --> 01:07:49.440
what the other part that
Freud had emphasized

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:55.710
is that when we dream
so many of our wishes

01:07:55.710 --> 01:07:59.150
are actually
unacceptable to ourselves

01:07:59.150 --> 01:08:01.290
and therefore we
dream it at night

01:08:01.290 --> 01:08:06.590
and so he constructed
in many other studies

01:08:06.590 --> 01:08:11.920
the idea that in humans we have
three subdivisions of the mind.

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:14.660
We have the Id, the
ego and the super ego,

01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:16.120
you all know that right?

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:21.109
So what it means that when
you dream at night some

01:08:21.109 --> 01:08:23.370
of the wishes that
you, unacceptable

01:08:23.370 --> 01:08:26.240
wishes that aren't
in your Id, kind

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:29.580
of seep through
because the super ego

01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:32.965
is not under control
since you're asleep.

01:08:34.189 --> 01:08:40.059
So that was his basic
idea and of course it

01:08:40.059 --> 01:08:43.979
was then many years later
discovered that whenever

01:08:43.979 --> 01:08:48.759
you dream you make all
kinds of eye movements.

01:08:48.759 --> 01:08:50.800
You don't make eye movements
when you don't dream

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:52.549
but when you dream you
make eye movements.

01:08:53.899 --> 01:08:58.200
Now one of the problems
with the Freudian theory

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:06.380
is that animals also dream
and in fact most dramatically,

01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:11.620
animals that hibernate do
a lot of dreaming and not

01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:13.740
only dreaming but
those animals also

01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:16.029
move their eyes about a lot OK?

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:25.010
So that observation
then kind of shifted

01:09:25.010 --> 01:09:29.069
the notion as to why
we have REM sleep

01:09:29.069 --> 01:09:32.800
and so people thought about
that and one observation that

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:37.920
had been made is that when
you eliminate a persons

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:42.899
ability to move the eyes, such
as you lose somehow the ability

01:09:42.899 --> 01:09:47.100
to activate your
eye muscles, this

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:48.390
can be done also in monkeys.

01:09:50.109 --> 01:09:56.110
What happens in
fairly short order

01:09:56.110 --> 01:10:01.610
is it your eye
becomes ill-affected

01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:05.050
and what I mean by that
is that the eye loses

01:10:05.050 --> 01:10:07.700
it's perfect roundness
to some degree

01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:10.010
and more notably
even what happens

01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:13.540
is that your cornea
becomes uneven,

01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:17.070
becomes ridged, because
you're not moving your eye.

01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:21.920
So that discovery then has
led to an alternate theory

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:25.320
about why we dream
which is not nearly as

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:29.480
romantic or intriguing
as Freudian theory,

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:35.460
namely that we have REM
sleep at night in order--

01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:38.930
and especially have it in
animals that hibernate--

01:10:38.930 --> 01:10:41.920
in order to keep the
eyes in healthy condition

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:47.210
and to keep the cornea
nice and smooth and even

01:10:47.210 --> 01:10:50.300
because if you were
not to dream at all

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:52.030
and you would sleep
eight or 10 hours.

01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:55.870
Then you would have
an uneven, would

01:10:55.870 --> 01:11:02.560
result in having an
uneven cornea that

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:05.420
would make it more
difficult for you to see

01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:10.040
and the reason for this
then is that animals

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:13.600
that, which presumably don't
have Ids, egos, and super egos

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:16.900
also dream as do
animals that hibernate

01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:22.900
and so there's a necessity
to move your eyes while you

01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:25.290
are sleeping or hibernating.

01:11:25.290 --> 01:11:28.200
So that's an alternate
theory and we'll

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:31.420
see one of these years
whether they're correct

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:33.110
but I can tell
you, which may not

01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:39.770
be very nice, that basically
Freudian theory has taken quite

01:11:39.770 --> 01:11:45.670
a nose dive and in fact today
psychoanalysis has become

01:11:45.670 --> 01:11:50.070
largely dead for a
number of reasons,

01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:54.140
and so you don't have too many
psychiatrists or psychoanalysts

01:11:54.140 --> 01:12:01.620
out there performing those
psychoanalytic tasks that they

01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:03.960
had, in which a
patient lies down

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:06.740
on a couch and sort
of free associates

01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:13.050
and sometimes even gets
hypnotized to talk about some

01:12:13.050 --> 01:12:15.460
of his unconscious
wishes and so on.

01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:18.300
So anyway that's
the story for today

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:22.760
and that brings me to an
end to eye movement control.

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:24.430
I hope you'll
appreciate the fact

01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:27.660
that even a simple
system like eye movements

01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:30.340
is unbelievably
complex when it comes

01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:33.270
to the brain controlling it.

01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:37.370
Next time we're going to
talk about eye movements

01:12:37.370 --> 01:12:40.390
and towards the end of that
I'll come back a little bit

01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:45.862
and talk more about yet another
aspect of eye movement control.

01:12:45.862 --> 01:12:47.195
Does anybody have any questions?

01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:50.200
Yes please.

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.444
AUDIENCE: Can you
just explain again

01:12:52.444 --> 01:12:55.010
quickly why the
bicuculline injection in V1

01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:56.519
causes interference?

01:12:56.519 --> 01:12:58.310
PROFESSOR: OK, that's
a very good question.

01:12:58.310 --> 01:13:04.140
Why does bicuculline in the,
in V1 cause interference?

01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:09.610
Because it screws up
the neurons ability

01:13:09.610 --> 01:13:12.620
to analyze the visual scene.

01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:17.252
You mess up the centers
around antagonism,

01:13:17.252 --> 01:13:20.600
you mess up the orientation
selectivity of these cells,

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:22.830
or direction
selectivity of them,

01:13:22.830 --> 01:13:26.780
so they're no longer able
to analyze the visual scene

01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:27.840
in the normal fashion.

01:13:29.190 --> 01:13:32.670
Yeah that's, and, it
certainly you see,

01:13:32.670 --> 01:13:36.070
the V1 is quite
far removed really

01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:39.190
from the generation
of a motor response.

01:13:39.190 --> 01:13:45.230
If you inject GABA
inhibitors into areas

01:13:45.230 --> 01:13:49.500
which are closely linked to
the execution of motor acts

01:13:49.500 --> 01:14:00.070
then the, the effect is seen
because you generate a motor

01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:03.940
response or if it's muscimol
then you inhibit the motor

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:07.815
response but the frontal, you
see this in the frontal eye

01:14:07.815 --> 01:14:10.420
fields but you
don't see this in V1

01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:14.240
because V1 is predominantly
the system that

01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:18.770
analyzes visual percepts,
as are V2 and V4 and all

01:14:18.770 --> 01:14:21.495
those other higher
cortical visual areas.

01:14:24.599 --> 01:14:25.515
Any further questions?

01:14:27.170 --> 01:14:30.009
All right very good so I
will see you then next Monday

01:14:30.009 --> 01:14:31.425
and I think you'll
find that we'll

01:14:31.425 --> 01:14:32.800
have an interesting session.

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:35.250
We're going talk about movement
and we're not going talk

01:14:35.250 --> 01:14:38.010
about regular
movement, we're also

01:14:38.010 --> 01:14:44.820
going to talk about
confusing kinds of movements,

01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:47.460
like especially very
important apparent motion.

01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:51.810
You realize and just to
say one more word here,

01:14:51.810 --> 01:14:59.970
that nowadays when you go home
and watch television almost all

01:14:59.970 --> 01:15:02.580
the motion that
you see on the TV

01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:06.150
is apparent motion,
not real motion

01:15:06.150 --> 01:15:07.575
and I-- keep
thinking about that--

01:15:07.575 --> 01:15:09.200
and I'll tell you
about that next time.

01:15:11.575 --> 01:15:13.967
AUDIENCE: Monday is
actually a Holiday.

01:15:13.967 --> 01:15:14.800
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:15.800
Sorry it's not Monday.

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:19.840
It's our next session
is next Wednesday.

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:21.390
Sorry about that.
