00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.360
PROFESSOR: All right, so
this brief reminder here

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.990
is about the basic requirements
in this course, which

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.300
are that we have
two written reports.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.930
And that's the main thing I want
to remind you of, one in vision

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.670
and one in audition.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.490
And I presume all of you
have the syllabus that

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.950
was a hand out.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.600
And in that syllabus--
and if you don't have it,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.260
we can provide you, of
course, with a copy.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.910
And on the second
page of the syllabus,

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.320
it says written
report, vision part,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:11.240
and this report is one that is
based on an article published

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.540
many years ago, which is
very influential article back

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.640
in 1967 about the so-called
accessory optic system.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.080
And what I would like you to
do is to read that article

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.650
but then proceed
through the internet

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.330
to see what have become
the most recent discoveries

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.760
about the so-called
accessory optic system.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.970
And that's what your
report needs to be about.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.110
You can be reasonably
summary about it

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.352
so that you don't need
to write 50 pages.

00:01:50.352 --> 00:01:52.310
But you know, you can
write this whole thing up

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.670
in four or five pages,
taking into account

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.800
as I've said what
has been discovered

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.600
since those days about the
so-called accessory optic

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.590
system.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.920
The reason I thought this would
be a good assignment because it

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.290
will give you a good historical
sense of how knowledge has

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.100
expanded, in this
case, since the 1960s,

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.410
in uncovering yet
another attribute

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.170
that you have in the
visual system that

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.640
starts with a specialized
set of cells in the retina

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.020
and then proceeds through
a special series of steps

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.860
until it connects with
the ocular motor system.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.320
So anyway, that's the task.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.900
And that will consist
of 10% of the report,

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.630
of your total grade.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.660
And the same thing is
10% also for addition.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.630
Then the midterm exam
is going to consist

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:08.060
of 25% of your exams.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.100
And the final exam is a total
55, a which 15 is vision

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.760
and 40 is audition.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.590
So if you add them all up,
you have an equal distribution

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.070
in percentages for
vision and for audition.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.180
So that then is
the basic layout.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.050
And so what I would like
you to start thinking about

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.350
is how you're going to
put this report together.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.200
I was hoping that perhaps you
could get it done by midterm.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.670
But I don't have a hard
and fast rule about that.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.050
As long as you get it in before
the final exam, that's fine.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.350
But it may make
life easier if you

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.740
can start working on that while
we are talking about vision,

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.220
rather than waiting
until we are covering

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.930
the auditory system
in the course.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.655
Does anybody have any questions
about this basic layout?

00:04:04.655 --> 00:04:05.155
OK.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.330
All right, now
today we are going

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.520
to talk about form perception.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.950
Let me say one more thing,
that next time as you have it

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.950
on the syllabus, we are going
to be covering illusions.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:39.970
I think that'll be fun.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.110
You'll see all kinds of
interesting illusions

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.750
and some inferences
as to what we

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.640
think about how those
illusions come about by virtue

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.220
of the fact that there are
all sorts of interesting rules

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.220
and facts about how the
visual system works.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.470
And then during the second
half over the next lecture,

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.375
this is this coming
Wednesday, we

00:05:01.375 --> 00:05:03.466
are going to talk about
visual prosthesis.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.090
All right, so that
in essence what is we

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.410
are going to cover next time.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.259
So now let's get back to today.

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.050
We are going to talk
about form perception.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.870
This is a topic that,
even at this stage,

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.670
we still only have
rather limited knowledge

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:27.270
about how the brain is
capable of carrying out

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.230
the perception of form.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.000
And we are going to look at
some inferences and some ideas

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.860
about it.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.830
And I will also provide you with
a brief historical background.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.440
Because this has been a
topic of tremendous interest

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.090
for people for centuries,
trying to understand just

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:52.710
how we are capable of seeing
forms, shapes, patterns.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.810
All right, so the
first influential idea

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.430
that emerged about this
is called structuralism.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:09.210
And this idea actually took
place in the late 19th century.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.890
And one of the prime proponents
was a fellow called Titchener.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:19.540
And they had, in trying to come
to grips with how we do this,

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.150
had a rather basic
idea, much like building

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.840
a house with bricks.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.970
The idea was that
perception is an aggregate

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.049
of simple elements.

00:06:31.049 --> 00:06:33.590
We just have a whole bunch of
elements that you put together.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.310
And that generates a
more complex precept, OK.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.570
The problem with this approach,
well, the first problem

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.306
was that they began
to do experiments.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.640
And they asked subjects
to try to divorce

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.140
a personal impression of
anything they looked at.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.400
But to sort of
physically describe it.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.990
So for example, if you
looked at an apple,

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:01.350
how do you have the
idea that it's an apple?

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.880
And so they said, well,
it has say, four colors.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.470
And so the person would
list four colors and said

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.050
would have several shades.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.980
And put all those
together, add them all up,

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.620
and that equals apple.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.300
Well, that was the idea then.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.790
And when they did
this systematically,

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.630
and the thing became
almost ridiculous.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.970
Because they came up
with more than 40,000

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.790
elementary sensations,
thinking that somehow you

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.800
puts these elementary
sensations together,

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.910
40,000 of them,
and that gives us

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.550
a sense of an apple,
or banana, or whatever.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:42.260
Now as soon as this sort
of became well known,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.180
a lot of opposition arose.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.450
And one of the most
famous ones then

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.360
was the opposition
that was brought

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.973
about by Gestalt psychologists.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:57.720
And the first consideration that
I want to sort of bring up here

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.480
is a rather simple picture.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.800
Here's a picture
everybody looks at that.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.050
OK, what did you see there?

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.800
You saw a car, right?

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.710
Now if you look at it,
I mean this is actually

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:11.650
a picture of a car,
all right, but it's

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:15.700
interrupted by all these
vertical bars here.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:20.320
And yet we're able to
infer that it's a car.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.090
And so the question comes
up, how do you do this?

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:27.000
I mean, you can't simply
just add up a bunch of bricks

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.310
and say it's a car.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.710
Because there's all
this interruption.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:34.190
And most things that
we see in the world,

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:37.490
we see in a
discontinuous fashion.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:41.620
And as a result of this,
the Gestalt psychologists,

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:45.830
which happened sort
of in the 1920s,

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.860
began to think about
this whole problem

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.470
in a very different way.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.145
And they made a
tremendous influence.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:56.100
And they came up
with these new ideas

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.830
of how we create the
perception of form.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.070
The founder of the
Gestalt psychology

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.750
is a fellow called
Max Wertheimer.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:10.270
So now, you can look this
up in Wikipedia, by the way,

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:13.370
if you look at
them more closely,

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:20.100
they came up with a few basic
principles of organization.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.930
And they call this grouping.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:26.600
They argue that in the brain,
somehow we group things up.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.800
And one of the things we group
has to do with proximity.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.500
Another one has to
do with similarity,

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.500
another one with common motion,
another one with closure,

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.050
and another one with
figure-ground perception.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:42.190
This last one I'm going to talk
about at the end of today's

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:43.310
presentation.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:46.170
But now I'm going to give you
an example of these top two.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.420
All right, so the most
important conclusion

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.810
that they had come to which was
very much against structuralism

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.680
is that the whole
that you see is

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.880
different from the
sum of its parts.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.310
Somehow, there is
an active process

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:07.490
that creates our ability to
see something that is not

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:10.220
evidenced from its
individual parts.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.930
Now here is an example of
what these principles are.

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:18.240
Grouping by proximity, so
here we have a bunch of dots.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.380
And if you'll put them
closer together vertically,

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.150
you see a bunch of
vertical lines essentially.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.760
And if you put them closer
together horizontally,

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.760
you see a bunch
of vertical lines,

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.756
horizontal lines,
vertical lines.

00:10:30.756 --> 00:10:31.490
Yeah?

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:36.980
So we group things
due to proximity.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.170
Another reason we group
things is shown here,

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:45.610
is we group things according to
shape, or similarity of shape,

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.000
I should really say.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.850
And here what we
have, you can readily

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:58.190
see a group of nine disks here,
and a group of nine triangles.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.640
And if they're not all
the same as down here,

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.460
then you have much more
difficulty grouping it.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.970
So there's a strong tendency
that we group things together

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:09.440
that are similar.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.580
So these are some
general principles

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:15.120
of how we organize
our visual percepts.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.680
So now we can look at some
more of these examples.

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.780
In doing this, we
are now going to try

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:27.980
to be able to say a bit
more about the brain itself.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:33.030
And in doing so, it's evident
that the three major theories

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:37.230
that try to deal with how
the brain does it, according

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.070
to the first of
these, form perception

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:43.610
is accomplished by neurons
that respond selectively

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:46.280
to line segments of
different orientations.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.400
Now that theory,
obviously, is the outgrowth

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:56.770
of what we talked about when it
was discovered that in V1, we

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.750
have orientation
selected neurons.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.930
And this orientation
selectivity is something

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.230
that you see in
several progressively

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:08.400
higher visual areas, as if
everything in the world out

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.190
there was broken down into
oriented line segments, which

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:16.750
are then somehow put together
according to there orientation

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.210
to enable us to see shapes.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:19.620
So that's one theory.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.500
Another theory is that form
perception is accomplished

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:29.490
by spatial mapping of the visual
scene onto the visual cortex.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.580
And I will elaborate
on each of these.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.960
And the third theory is one that
form perception is accomplished

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.710
by virtue of Fourier analysis.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:44.580
So let us first then
turn to form perception,

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:49.750
supposedly based on breaking
down the visual scene

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.180
into oriented line segments.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.940
Now, one of the big
problems with this

00:12:54.940 --> 00:13:03.300
is that when you look
at a famous art work

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:10.920
that you see in every day
in the Wall Street Journal,

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.370
there is an artist who
created this originally.

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:17.750
And he created faces
like this using only dots

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.120
and varied the spatial
frequency of the dots,

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.360
as you can see here.

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:25.150
This happens to be a
person called Larry Poons.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.120
I'm sure none of you
have heard of him.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.680
But here was one of the
pictures many years ago

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.280
in the Wall Street Journal.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:36.150
And even today, as I say, you
can see faces created this way.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.700
And you can readily
recognize them,

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.960
even though there are no
oriented line segments here.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:46.300
And in fact, if you sort
of squint up and you three

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.320
quarter ways close your
eyes, so you can't even

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.720
see the dots anymore,
you can still

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.670
make out that face
very, very clearly.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.330
That's because the spatial
frequency effect here

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:58.880
is very important,
and the degree

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.780
of shading, meaning that
this involves rather low

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.650
spatial frequency
analyses, rather than

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:11.870
the analysis of particular
orientations of line segments.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:21.080
Now this particular
analysis has its counterpart

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.900
in the observation that
many of you have seen.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:29.670
When you look at a person's
face on television,

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.750
and they want to
prevent you from being

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:35.184
able to see that face because
it's confidential or something,

00:14:35.184 --> 00:14:35.850
what do they do?

00:14:36.987 --> 00:14:37.695
Anybody remember?

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:41.240
What you do is
you put up a bunch

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:47.890
of squares of different
spatial frequencies.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:52.560
And each square is comprised
of the mean illumination

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.170
level of the actual face.

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:58.930
If you do that, this high
frequency information

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:01.890
is something that
interferes with your ability

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:03.210
to analyze face.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:05.850
So to give you an example
of this, I'm sure all of you

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:08.590
have seen this, but
mainly I show you this.

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:10.280
Here we have this example.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:14.010
How many of you can tell
who these people are here?

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:17.350
I guess nobody can, right?

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:20.780
Now then what we
can do is we can

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.250
increase the frequency of these.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:24.250
Here it is.

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:26.550
And it's still very
difficult to tell.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.180
And now I'm going to show
you the actual photograph.

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:32.710
And what I'm curious about is
how many of these two people

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:33.700
you actually know.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.200
I can tell you
right away, they're

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:41.520
extremely famous
actors and actresses.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.217
Who recognizes these people?

00:15:44.217 --> 00:15:45.300
How many of you recognize?

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.630
Let me see your hand.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:48.480
Only a few people recognize it.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.330
That's how quickly time goes by.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:54.600
These were the most central,
most exciting, best known

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.040
people in the movies.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:04.560
And this is Humphrey
Bogart, Ingrid Bergman.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.760
OK, so these are these
two very famous people

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:12.110
whose faces were obstructed
by this and by this using

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:18.550
these high contrast edges
that obscure your ability

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.980
to smoothly analyze faces.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:33.950
So that then suggests that this
idea that we extensively use

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:43.790
oriented line segments
to analyze faces at least

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:47.570
is an insufficient
explanation of how

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:51.790
the brain processes shapes.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:55.565
Now another idea is so-called
topographic mapping.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.080
This idea I'm sure
you can already

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.480
reject on the basis
of what I told you

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:06.960
about how the visual
system is laid out.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.720
But now I'm going
to belabor that

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.650
so that you can
follow it closely.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:13.369
Here we have a
runner, of course.

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:17.079
And here we have a monkey brain
to make it easy to understand.

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:21.140
And the idea here there is
that this image, once it

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:25.770
was discovered that the
visual field is laid out

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:29.030
topographically in
the visual cortex,

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:33.800
the idea was that what
happens is somehow,

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.480
and I may be am unfair
to poke fun of it,

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.240
but the idea is
that the mind can

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:47.150
look at the creation of this
image on the cortical surface

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.650
there.

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:52.190
And thereby, it can identify.

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:55.180
OK, it's almost
like a photograph,

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.690
looking at a photograph.

00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:01.320
In this case the mind looks at
the photograph, so to speak,

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.850
on the cortical surface.

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:05.470
So they thought at
the time is that this

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:07.250
is what you have there, OK.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:10.310
That's the imprint
of this image.

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:12.290
And indeed, you say,
oh my goodness, that's

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:13.000
just like that.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.210
Therefore, I can recognize that
person, and so on and so on.

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:20.120
Well, I mean that's a cute idea.

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.400
But then when you
take into account

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:27.280
this has been discovered
subsequently to these ideas,

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:33.700
that the topographic
layout in the visual cortex

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:41.320
is actually not one to one
because of the magnification

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.450
factor.

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:45.060
So let's look at
that in some detail.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:51.410
Here is an actual reconstruction
of the monkey area V1 here.

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:55.170
And here is the visual field.

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:58.665
And we are going to
put these red arrows

00:18:58.665 --> 00:19:00.740
in the contralateral hemifield.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:03.030
Now remember what
I told you before,

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:06.120
that if you look at
the visual scene,

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.210
you can imagine your eyes
being vertically cut in half.

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:12.350
And you have a nasal
and temporal hemiretina.

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:18.360
And the one which is
contralateral hemifield

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:22.270
crosses over and gets into
this half of the brain.

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:25.100
And this one crosses
over to that half.

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:28.720
So now if you do this and
take the magnification factor

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:33.750
into account, you
look at these arrows,

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.850
which are all
identical in size, OK.

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:39.430
There are one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven of them.

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:43.940
What you can see here
is the actual impression

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.310
on the cortical
surface of the neurons

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:50.250
that are being activated
by this look like this,

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.480
nothing like those arrows there.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.300
And in fact, the central
arrow is much bigger

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.420
because of the huge
magnification factor.

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:05.790
Now this is already
creates a major problem

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:11.890
in trying to believe in
that particular theory,

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:13.910
the topographic mapping theory.

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:18.180
But now, if instead,
you put those arrows

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:21.520
halfway across each of
the hemispheres like that,

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.720
then whatever is on
this side goes here.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.570
Whatever is on this
side goes there.

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:28.140
And this is the impression
that is created.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.996
And my goodness, you
create that impression.

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:36.234
And you say to yourself, my god.

00:20:36.234 --> 00:20:37.650
If that's the case,
how come I can

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:41.240
see seven straight
arrows of equal size

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.740
when this is the impression that
is being created in the brain?

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:52.080
So therefore, obviously, they
are not using a topographic map

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.180
to analyze the
visual scene at all.

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:58.800
Now this can be driven
home even further.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.780
Let me make another point here.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:04.670
Here we have a monkey visual
cortex again from the rear.

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:06.600
Here is the visual
field laid out.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:11.890
And if here we put in a bunch
of dots in a circular fashion,

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:14.037
this is the activation there.

00:21:14.037 --> 00:21:15.370
Now you say, oh, that's not bad.

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:17.260
That looks like a circle.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:23.060
But then if you put it along
the midline, half and half,

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.300
then this is the
actual activation.

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:29.100
But you still see a circle,
even though the activation,

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:32.910
in terms of the topography,
is nothing like a circle.

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:40.300
So that indeed created a
much, much greater degree

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.270
of skepticism
among investigators

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:46.220
to try to understand
how we process shape.

00:21:47.546 --> 00:21:49.790
Now let me make one
other point here,

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:52.060
which is a wonderful
story, which

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:55.320
I think will be good
for you to remember.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.530
That's called the
Giotto story, which

00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:59.850
says that when Pope
Benedict, that was

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:05.610
in the 12th century,
or the 13th century,

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:09.620
he set out to have the walls
of the great cathedral of Saint

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:13.740
Peter in Rome redecorated.

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.510
And so he sent out a
bunch of messengers

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:21.570
to various artists
in Italy and asked

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.560
them to provide some
of their best work

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.530
so he could evaluate
it and could

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:30.005
pick one guy to actually
do the redecoration.

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:37.520
Well, one of these messengers
went to Ambrogio Bondone Giotto

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.290
and asked him, he was
a well known artist,

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:44.830
and asked him to provide
a painting of his,

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:46.270
a drawing of his.

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:49.210
And Giotto said,
oh, my goodness.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.760
I just don't have
anything around.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.420
But I tell you what I'll do.

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:57.180
He took out a red pen and
drew a perfect circle, OK.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:01.370
And so the messenger
took this to the pope.

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:02.700
And the pope said, my god.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.700
I can't believe how
incredible this is.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:09.610
And so Giotto got the
job of redecorating

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:13.630
the cathedral of Saint Peter.

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:18.820
To this day, there is
this expression in Italy,

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:25.390
in Tuscany in Italy, which
says the round O of Giotto, OK.

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:27.810
So this is the
round O of Giotto,

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:32.850
which somehow, in a sense,
denotes perfection, perfection

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:38.580
in sight and in perfection
in your ability of execution

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.890
in terms of a
drawing, for example.

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:44.350
All right, now to highlight
this even further,

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:46.470
let me point out
this to you here.

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:53.040
What we have here is a bunch of
imperfect circles, one of which

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.810
is perfect.

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:56.810
So if you keep
looking around, you

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:58.920
should be able to
spot which one it is.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.170
And you should tell me what
letter denotes that circle.

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:03.420
Which one is a perfect circle?

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:06.790
AUDIENCE: C.

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:08.510
PROFESSOR: Very good, all right.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:10.370
So we are incredibly good.

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:13.320
There's a slight difference
here, OK, or even slight

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:14.280
difference here.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:17.060
And yet, we can see this
very slight difference.

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:20.520
And we can tell what
a perfect circle is.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:24.890
I mean, that's incredible
given how the impressions are

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:29.380
made by those circles
on the visual cortex.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.685
So that is an
incredible puzzle of how

00:24:31.685 --> 00:24:33.570
we are capable of doing this.

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:35.370
And I'm afraid,
even to this day,

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:39.110
we don't have a really good
answer of how this happens.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:50.340
OK, now the third theory
that has become actually

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:53.940
probably right now, one of
the most successful ones,

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:59.540
it claims that you
analyze the visual scene

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:04.950
by taking into account the
spatial frequencies that

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:08.590
are impinging on the retina, OK.

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:11.470
This was created by Fergus
Campbell and John Robson,

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:12.950
very influential.

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:17.230
And they pointed out, first of
all, that a very interesting

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:19.880
finding, which I think
I've mentioned once

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:23.590
before, that if you vary the
spatial frequency [? both, ?]

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:27.790
as well as the contrast, we
have this sensitivity function

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:28.700
like this.

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.990
I did show you a picture
of it the last time.

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:35.630
And then, furthermore,
what they had shown

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:41.660
is that you can create all
kinds of complex precepts

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:44.630
by varying the gratings.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.440
Make them simple gratings,
compound gratings,

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.110
and compound gratings
with much lower contrast.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:54.194
And this is simple different
spatial frequencies.

00:25:54.194 --> 00:25:54.985
These are compound.

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.390
And these, as I've said, are
lower spatial frequencies.

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:02.190
So then if you again
squint, then you

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:03.610
will see something
much smoother.

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:09.260
So they actually carried out a
detailed mathematical analysis

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:11.480
using Fourier analysis.

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:14.300
And what they did
was quite remarkable.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:17.820
They would down break
down a visual scene,

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:23.270
like a photograph of New
York with all the skylights,

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:25.580
OK, skyscrapers.

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:30.850
And then they would convert
that using Fourier analysis.

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:33.860
And they could recreate
the visual scene

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:36.955
with a high degree of
accuracy using that procedure.

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:42.810
Now if indeed the
visual system uses this,

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:46.390
you have a number of basic
logical requirements.

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:50.340
And those basic logical,
let me come back to that,

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.890
the basic logical
requirements are

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:57.220
that you need spatial
frequency analysis.

00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:00.770
And I've shown you that already
when we talked about V1,

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:05.680
that neurons there are
spatial frequency selective.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:09.000
Secondly, that there
are contrast selective,

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.300
which you know already.

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.270
And of course, the
orientation selective,

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:16.830
and they can tell
you about phase.

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:19.410
As long as you have
these four attributes,

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:22.840
you can perform a
detailed Fourier analysis

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.170
to reconstruct the visual scene.

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:28.270
So now to stress
this even further,

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:32.270
they did a series of
experiments, in which they

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:35.420
asked a question,
is it true that you

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.710
have a particular spatial
frequency analysis,

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:39.570
that you can manipulate that?

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:42.490
And so they did an
experiment, which

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:46.130
called a frequency-specific
adaptation experiment.

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:49.530
They would present to
a subject this display

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:52.840
and have the subject look at
this for a couple of minutes

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.670
without having to fixate.

00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:56.760
And then they would
look at each of those.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.150
And they found that this, which
is the same spatial frequency,

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:03.890
they had difficulty seeing
because of this adaptation.

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:07.080
And so then they did a
series of careful studies

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.420
and carried out this
analysis and showed

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:13.250
that you could get any
kind of spatial frequency

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:16.240
to lose your sensitivity
for it if you

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.170
had been pre-exposed to it.

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:19.860
So that's what that looked like.

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:22.070
And by doing this
systematically,

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:24.880
they came up with
the idea that what

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:31.080
you have in the visual cortex
is a series of channels

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.765
that are spatial
frequency-selective.

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:37.610
And I showed you
we talked about V1,

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:41.760
that indeed, there are neurons
there that are selected

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.640
to particular
spatial frequencies.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:47.510
And they proposed that you have
a series of channels like this,

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:51.550
OK, that peak at different
spatial frequencies.

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:55.160
And by activating
them selectively,

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.830
you can reconstruct
virtually anything out

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:00.750
in the visual scene
using Fourier analysis.

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:11.080
Now OK, I think that then is
the essence of that theory.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:14.550
And I can tell you that some
people avidly believe in it.

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:17.790
And there are some people
who are highly skeptical.

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:20.320
I'm not sure where I stand
at this stage about that.

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:30.330
But now, people began
to study our shape,

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:36.480
the ability to see shapes by
recording various visual areas.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:40.450
And I want to tell you next
about some studies that

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:43.450
had been done primarily
in Japan looking

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:47.900
at inferotemporal cortex,
which is [INAUDIBLE] already

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:52.680
mentioned that to be involved
in the analysis of shapes

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:57.430
and in particular, in the
analysis of faces as well.

00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:01.150
So what these
investigators did is

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:03.910
they would record to
individual neurons

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:07.735
in inferotemporal cortex.

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:13.730
And when they did that, they
would present various stimuli

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:15.135
to see how those
cells responded.

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:19.630
And they found, they
claimed to find,

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:22.750
that there was some
incredible specificity

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:26.370
in inferotemporal
cortex for shapes.

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:29.120
And so what they did,
here's an example.

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.430
Here, we have the neurons'
responses, histograms.

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:35.040
And on top, above it, we
have the particular shape

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.000
that was presented repeatedly.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.940
So this particular cell
responded vigorously to this,

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:44.370
but very poorly to that,
and so on down the line.

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:46.090
But you can see
that it responded

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:48.370
to several different shapes,
quite well to this one,

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:52.480
reasonably well to that one,
so a whole range of them.

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:57.650
So it wasn't like this
particular neuron responded

00:30:57.650 --> 00:31:00.340
only to one particular shape.

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:02.670
But that idea that
you have neurons

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:05.980
which are specific
for certain shapes

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:12.990
did take on a lot of attraction
on part of investigators.

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:15.540
And some of them
indeed thought that you

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:20.180
have these neurons
which are selective

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:23.050
to individual elements
in the visual scene.

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:29.790
And those subsequently
the critics refer to

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:33.050
as your having
grandmother cells.

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:35.100
Somewhere in the
brain there's a cell

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:37.900
that represents your
grandmother, all right.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:41.530
Now that idea was
disabuse subsequently.

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:46.620
But it took very stronghold
in many investigators' minds.

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.600
And here's another
example of yet

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.260
another inferotemporal
neurons, in this case again

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:55.450
for various shapes, showing
that this shape was,

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:58.000
elicited a lot of responses,
as well as did this.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.950
The rest of them didn't
respond, didn't elicit as much

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:02.370
of a response.

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:05.760
So these kinds of
experiments then,

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.843
they tried to systematize.

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:12.810
And they came up with an idea
which, at least to my mind,

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:16.070
borders on the absurd,
which is shown here.

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:18.750
Here is a section of
inferotemporal cortex.

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:21.380
And they argue that
they are columns there,

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:25.610
and that these columns
represent different percepts.

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:27.780
So here we have a
bunch of percepts

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:28.970
that process the monkey.

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:33.470
This is a monkey, of course,
that process monkey faces.

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:35.070
And by inference,
therefore, there

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:38.330
must be some areas in
inferotemporal cortex

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:42.260
that process human
faces in humans.

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:44.790
And then others process
different aspects

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:45.770
of the visual scene.

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:51.430
Now the big problem, technical
problem, with this approach

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:55.530
is that when you record
from individual neurons,

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:57.780
all right, typically
in these experiments,

00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:01.790
you can study a single neuron
for a fairly limited time,

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:06.890
not like for months on end, just
maybe a few hours or something.

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:09.150
And so because of
that, you can only

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:12.890
present a limited number
of visual stimuli.

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:16.510
Now there are millions of
visual stimuli out there.

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:19.850
And so to really establish how
specific this particular neuron

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:22.920
is, they say well, these are
the only shapes it's showing us.

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:28.004
What if you use the
cross, or who knows,

00:33:28.004 --> 00:33:29.420
many, many other
things, something

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:30.990
that is three dimensional?

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:32.910
How would these cells respond?

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:36.297
And so these cells respond
to different degrees,

00:33:36.297 --> 00:33:38.755
to hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of different stimuli.

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:44.440
And the real fact then is
that anytime a stimulus

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:48.290
appears out there, you're
activating tens of thousands

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:53.580
of neurons, maybe even
more, in the visual system.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:55.400
And each of those
neurons, especially

00:33:55.400 --> 00:34:00.450
in inferotemporal cortex,
responds to different degrees

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:02.170
to the different stimuli.

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:07.680
It is the compendium of these
many, many neurons firing

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.590
into different degrees
to different stimuli

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:14.400
that gives you sort of an
overall computational ability

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.810
to say what that stimulus is.

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:20.370
Now to be able to analyze
that, it is that complicated,

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:22.989
that really takes
a lot of effort.

00:34:22.989 --> 00:34:25.630
Now some people are
now trying to do this.

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:29.389
And the way you
try to do this is

00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:31.389
that you're recording
from hundreds and hundreds

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:35.620
of neurons with
multiple electrodes,

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:37.820
present various scenes.

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:42.070
And you see how these neurons
respond as an aggregate,

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:45.400
so that you can determine
whether or not there is indeed

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:48.880
the potential for some
sort of computation

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:52.929
that takes place in
gaining the impression

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:56.570
of a particular individual face.

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:59.340
Now one of the very
important facts

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:02.900
here is, of course, that as you
look around the visual scene,

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.820
let's imagine you're
looking at a face.

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:06.392
You're looking at
a face head on.

00:35:06.392 --> 00:35:07.975
You're looking at a
face in a profile.

00:35:07.975 --> 00:35:09.764
You're looking at a face tilted.

00:35:09.764 --> 00:35:11.055
You're looking at a face close.

00:35:11.055 --> 00:35:13.200
You're looking at a face far.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.090
And it's still
all the same face.

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:17.920
And yet the
impressions that face

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:23.050
makes on the visual
system, in the retina,

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:27.890
in the geniculate, in the visual
cortex, varies a great deal.

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:31.060
And yet we can come
up with constancy,

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:33.280
which is sort of a
higher level process.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.040
And I'll come to
that in short order.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:39.180
All right, so now,
therefore, we need

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:44.000
to start to talk about what we
call intermediate level vision.

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:47.350
What is intermediate
level vision?

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:49.760
So far, we've talked
almost exclusively

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:53.470
about basic visual capacities,
color, brightness, pattern,

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:55.720
texture, motion,
depth, the very,

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.410
just the very basic types.

00:35:57.410 --> 00:36:00.880
But now when we talk about
intermediate visual capacities,

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.580
we talk about constancy.

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.350
One example of
constancy, of course,

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:06.590
is that the face that
you're looking at,

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:10.010
whether it's profile, or head
on, or near, or far, it's

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:11.140
still the same face.

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:13.810
So we get constancy out of it.

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:16.610
Then there's an
important necessity

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:19.020
to be able to select
various aspects out

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:23.270
of the visual scene, to be
able to select if you recognize

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:28.500
things, to induce
transposition and variance,

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.950
and to be able to
make comparisons,

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:34.860
and also lastly, to be able to
say where things are in space.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.190
So those are these
intermediate capacities.

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:40.150
And we'll talk a little
bit about them next.

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:44.650
All right, so here's an
example of constancy.

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:48.715
What we have here
is a bunch of words

00:36:48.715 --> 00:36:52.360
for doubt in different
sizes, and orientations,

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:56.020
and some handwritten, and so on.

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:58.260
And yet all of them say
the same thing, doubt.

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:00.210
We extract that, OK.

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:04.720
Now to make this
even more difficult,

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:08.380
I'm going to tell you that
there's one of these words here

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:10.780
which is not doubt
and see who can

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.610
find the word that is not doubt.

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:18.840
Everybody find it yet?

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:24.250
OK, right there, not
doubt but doubts.

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:27.570
And so we are able to
extract the difference

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:29.750
in this kind of
visual scene, even

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:31.810
though it is incredibly subtle.

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:35.680
And yet, we are also able
to say that this doubt,

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.760
and this doubt, and this
doubt are all the same,

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:42.930
even though they're different
size or different in print.

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:48.220
We can extract from
that the common element.

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:50.160
So this is an
incredible capacity

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.440
on part of the visual system.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:57.570
And of course, the big question
comes up, how is this achieved?

00:37:57.570 --> 00:38:00.720
And at this stage, we only
have very preliminary answers

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:01.640
to that.

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:06.630
OK, so now I want to show you a
couple other cute things here.

00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:10.035
This is another famous
artist, Hirschfeld,

00:38:10.035 --> 00:38:12.220
He is no longer with
us, unfortunately.

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:17.410
He published hundreds
of these little cartoons

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:21.220
in The New Yorker, all right.

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:25.146
Now, you see his named
here, Hirschfeld.

00:38:25.146 --> 00:38:26.770
What do you see at
the end of his name?

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:30.410
What's that-- what is this?

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:32.830
What, that?

00:38:35.085 --> 00:38:36.510
Huh?

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:37.390
A number three.

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:40.130
Why does it say
Hirschfeld three?

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:42.280
His name isn't Hirschfeld three.

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:44.800
And then if you've
seen several of these,

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.170
how many of you have
seen these before?

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:50.530
Oh, you missed out on
something very good.

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:55.290
At least look it up sometimes
again on the internet.

00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:57.300
Just type in Hirschfeld.

00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.650
And some of these will come up.

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:01.060
So he says three.

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.300
And some of his
pictures may have one.

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:07.160
Some of his pictures may
have five or six at the end.

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.500
And you say, well,
what on earth is that?

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:10.260
Anybody know?

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:11.810
Yes.

00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:14.268
AUDIENCE: Doesn't he have other
names hidden in the images?

00:39:14.268 --> 00:39:15.610
So maybe that's the [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:17.234
PROFESSOR: Ah ha,
you're thinking well.

00:39:17.234 --> 00:39:18.560
OK, that's getting there.

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:21.355
OK, so he's telling us
something that there

00:39:21.355 --> 00:39:23.330
are three of in this picture.

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:24.700
That's what he's telling us.

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:25.530
OK.

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:27.790
So what is the three of
that he has in this picture?

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:31.420
Ah ha, anybody want
to come up with?

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:33.150
It

00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:34.650
AUDIENCE: The line orientation?

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:35.300
PROFESSOR: Huh?

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:36.750
AUDIENCE: Like the
orientation of the line?

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:37.708
PROFESSOR: Orientation?

00:39:38.925 --> 00:39:39.424
No.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:42.260
Mhm.

00:39:44.339 --> 00:39:45.380
OK, I'll give you a clue.

00:39:48.796 --> 00:39:49.920
Hirschfeld had a daughter--

00:39:51.505 --> 00:39:52.130
AUDIENCE: Nina.

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:56.990
PROFESSOR: Who he was very
fond-- hey, fantastic, Nina.

00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:57.490
OK.

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:00.250
So had a daughter, Nina.

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:08.860
And he decided in his display
to put her name up there.

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:11.700
And now he said three,
that he put her name up

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.180
there three times.

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:15.656
Now who can find
all three of them?

00:40:15.656 --> 00:40:17.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the arm [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:19.460
PROFESSOR: OK, here's one.

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:21.320
Here is another one.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:24.330
OK, and here is the
third one, in the arms.

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:29.100
And so if you, that's one of
the fun things you can do.

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:33.530
Back when he was
doing this actively,

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:35.580
every time he had a
cartoon like this,

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:38.775
I would spend some time trying
to see where were the Ninas.

00:40:38.775 --> 00:40:40.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:44.350
So that I think is
quite remarkable

00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:49.720
and further highlights
the complexities

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:53.830
and the remarkability
of our visual system.

00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:56.700
OK, so now, I'm showing
you yet another picture.

00:40:58.344 --> 00:40:59.760
In this case again,
you have to be

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.270
knowledgeable about something.

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:03.050
Does anybody know who this is?

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:08.162
Oh, all right.

00:41:08.162 --> 00:41:09.745
Well, let me see if
I make it smaller.

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:13.010
Can you see that now?

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:14.050
Who is that?

00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:16.180
OK, that's Voltaire.

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:17.080
All right.

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:25.090
Now Voltaire, 18th century, is
a guy who had outdone all of us.

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:29.430
And he had written 2,000 books.

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:30.620
Can you believe that?

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:33.280
The guy had written 2,000 books.

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.880
But that's not the
prime point here.

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:38.190
Most of us who know a
little bit about history

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:41.560
immediately recognize him
as, oh yeah, that's Voltaire.

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:45.640
But then if you go back here and
you look at this more closely,

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:49.060
and so what I'm going
to do here is just

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:51.170
to tell you what a
remarkable artist.

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:53.350
The guy who did this
is Salvador Dali.

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:56.140
This, by the way,
is his wife, OK.

00:41:56.140 --> 00:42:01.090
And so what I'm
going to do here,

00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:04.200
I'm going to blow up the
center portion of this figure.

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:09.140
There it is.

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.100
Can you see this?

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:13.560
This is two faces, two nuns.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.100
And this is their outfit.

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:20.200
So there's nothing there
that is really Voltaire.

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:23.300
But he's such a
remarkable artist

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:27.900
that he could create Voltaire
by playing around with this, OK.

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:33.035
So let me go back to
the display again.

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.920
OK, so this is Salvador Dali.

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:53.720
And certainly, it's an
artist who is remarkable.

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:56.930
He has many paintings
in which this kind

00:42:56.930 --> 00:43:01.590
of a double confusing thing,
playing on your ability to see.

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:04.720
So because of that,
for people like me

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:06.890
who's interested in
how we see things,

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:09.830
certainly I'm very
intrigued by his artwork.

00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:14.790
And you may enjoy looking
that up again on the internet.

00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:21.180
OK, so now I'm going to tell you
yet another interesting aspect

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.856
of art involved in this.

00:43:23.856 --> 00:43:30.530
And this one has to do with a
book, a very clever book that

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:33.460
was written by David Hockney.

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:35.380
Has anybody ever heard of him?

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:38.810
I'm not surprised since
he's not that well known.

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:43.105
But the book he wrote is
called Secret Knowledge.

00:43:44.196 --> 00:43:46.290
Now what was that all about?

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:55.400
Well, he analyzed how artists
created paintings way,

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:59.380
way, way back when and
in subsequent years

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:01.730
up to the present.

00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:04.590
And now I'm going to show
you some of his pictures

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:07.040
and give you a sense of
what this is all about.

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:15.490
Here is a picture, OK, by
Masolino da Panicale in 1425.

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:18.530
This was a typical kind
of picture back then.

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:20.780
Artists had a very
poor sense of how

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:24.930
to create depth
perception in a painting.

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:28.840
That was before they came
up with vanishing point.

00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:35.430
And so this kind of looks flat
and fairly expressionless.

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:39.220
This was in 1425.

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:44.440
And then Hockney noticed
that just five years later,

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:50.290
another artist came
up with a picture,

00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:53.960
just five years later, that
looks almost like a photograph.

00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:57.555
And he said, what on
earth has happened?

00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:01.610
And that's why the book is
called the Secret Knowledge.

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:02.560
So what happened?

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:03.200
Anybody know?

00:45:05.657 --> 00:45:06.240
Ah, all right.

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.739
Well, let me tell
you what happened.

00:45:07.739 --> 00:45:16.530
What happened is that at
that time, in the 1400s,

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:19.800
they came up with the lens, OK.

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:27.385
And so they created a device
called the camera obscura.

00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:30.670
Does anybody know what
the camera obscura is?

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:39.520
It's essentially very
similar to a camera, OK.

00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:41.940
So here we have it.

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.120
Here's a camera obscura.

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:47.240
And what they did,
these artists,

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.580
they would create a building.

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:51.400
So it will be dark inside.

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.280
And then they would
put the lens here.

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:55.110
And they would put
some object out here

00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:59.390
that they wanted to
make a painting of.

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:04.670
And that would be reflected
onto a piece of canvas here.

00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:06.890
Of course, it would
be upside down, right?

00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:09.050
And then they would paint it.

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:12.980
And so once it was painted,
they could turn it around

00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:16.910
and finish it and sell it.

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:20.040
Now, the reason they did this,
the prime reason they did this,

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:23.470
is because it was much
much, much quicker

00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:25.700
to create a portrait,
for example,

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:29.880
by using this procedure than
to actually look at a person

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:35.620
and paint them on the
canvas while looking at it.

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:36.120
OK.

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:38.720
So that was done.

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:41.270
And of course, this was
sort of a no, no thing.

00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:44.850
And because of that,
it was kept secret.

00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:47.780
All these artists who did this,
and some very famous artists

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:57.540
did so, were very careful
never to disclose to the public

00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:58.950
that they did this
kind of thing.

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:02.780
Because it was conceived to be
kind of a cheating thing, OK.

00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:08.390
So what happened then was
that all these paintings were

00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:09.170
created.

00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:13.100
And here's an example
by van Eyck in 1436.

00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:15.430
Again, this looks much
like a photograph.

00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:18.210
But some other thing
is a bit distorted.

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:24.050
So Hockney undertook a
careful, detailed analysis

00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:26.810
of how we could tell
whether a painting was

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:31.380
a real painting or one that
used the camera obscura method.

00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:33.220
And that's also a real
painting in a sense,

00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:37.270
but a painting using the
camera obscura method.

00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:39.580
And he came up with
a series of criteria

00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:40.850
which are listed in the book.

00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:43.140
But I'm only going to
deal with one of them.

00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:44.535
OK, so here is an example.

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:49.510
This is in 1597.

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:51.473
This is by Caravaggio, OK.

00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:54.540
And what is notable
about this person?

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:03.580
Well, to Hockney,
what was notable

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.820
is that this person
is holding the wine

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:07.684
glass in his left hand.

00:48:07.684 --> 00:48:08.184
Yeah?

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:11.000
And he said, huh.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.069
That's curious.

00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:14.360
And then he looked at a whole
bunch of other paintings.

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:15.810
And he had one in
which there were

00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:19.090
three people on the painting.

00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:21.170
And all three of them
were left handed.

00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:22.350
Yeah.

00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:24.760
And he said, my god,
that is really curious.

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:26.200
And he said, well,
let me analyze

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:30.480
what happens when you
do this kind of stuff

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:33.000
with the camera obscura method.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.780
So here's the example of this.

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:38.350
This is the original
image, he claims,

00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:41.630
meaning the person is right
handed, is not left handed.

00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:45.470
Then you put this
person through the lens

00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:49.940
and put him up here
upside down like that, OK.

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:53.520
He's painted on the
canvas like that.

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:58.910
And then what you do is you
rotate this 180 degrees.

00:48:58.910 --> 00:49:00.930
And when you do
that, lo and behold,

00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:02.660
the person becomes left hand.

00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:05.110
And to make this clear,
I added the F here.

00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:07.360
So this is a normal
F. This is what

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:12.130
is projected onto the canvas.

00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:14.370
And this is when you
rotate it 180 degrees.

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:19.370
So you reverse the left
according to Hockney,

00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:22.130
reverse the image.

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:29.300
And so it was a dead giveaway
that most of the people who

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:33.360
appeared left handed in his
paintings, in these paintings,

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:34.910
I should say, not
just Caravaggio,

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:39.910
but several other people,
used the camera obscura method

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:42.510
for creating the painting.

00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:46.680
All right, so that
is the process.

00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:50.250
And then I want to show you
one more example of this.

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:53.820
OK, this is a very famous
painting also, all right.

00:49:55.320 --> 00:50:00.576
This is the so-called marriage
of Giovanni Arnolfini.

00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:08.370
And this by van Eyck, again
1493, way, way, way, way, way,

00:50:08.370 --> 00:50:09.280
way back then.

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:11.656
Now this is a famous painting.

00:50:11.656 --> 00:50:13.030
Now there's one
interesting thing

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:14.080
first of all I
want to point out.

00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:15.100
You see this here?

00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:19.080
That's proof that
in those days they

00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:22.150
had come up with the lens, yeah.

00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:28.100
Now what is wrong
with this picture?

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:35.700
This guy who is about
to marry this woman

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:38.380
is holding her
with his left hand.

00:50:39.114 --> 00:50:40.280
I mean, that's unacceptable.

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:45.010
You're supposed to hold it
with the right hand, yeah.

00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:47.400
Now the reason he's holding
it with the left hand

00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:54.200
is because the artist, van
Eyck, used the camera, according

00:50:54.200 --> 00:51:01.460
to Hockney, used the camera
obscura method to take this,

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:03.710
to paint this picture, OK.

00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:07.420
And then he rotated
180 degrees and became,

00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:08.965
he became left
handed as a result.

00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:16.040
Now if instead of having
done that, you would go back,

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:17.530
you don't have to go back.

00:51:18.865 --> 00:51:21.300
Go back to here, and
let's go back to this.

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:28.750
If you take this guy here
and you create the picture.

00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:32.190
But then instead of rotating
it, if you could flip it,

00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:35.860
then you would, he will
remain right handed.

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:39.380
But of course, we can't do
that because it's on a canvas.

00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:40.505
It's not on a transparency.

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:48.780
So that then is the
interesting story of artwork

00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:51.820
that was created using
the camera obscura

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:55.790
system that further
the highlights

00:51:55.790 --> 00:52:03.310
the amazing interestingly
complicated manner

00:52:03.310 --> 00:52:06.620
in which we can analyze the
visual scene for shapes.

00:52:07.690 --> 00:52:14.100
All right, now another factor
that is in a similar vein

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:17.250
has to do with the
recognition of faces.

00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:20.360
Lots of experiments have
been done, including several

00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:24.090
in our department here,
that has recognized

00:52:24.090 --> 00:52:32.720
that, unfortunate use of
terms, recognition, recognize,

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:36.940
became aware of the fact that
facial recognition depends

00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:40.720
very heavily on seeing
faces right side up.

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:46.350
When faces are upside down,
you have great difficulty

00:52:46.350 --> 00:52:48.720
telling who is who, OK.

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:50.080
So let's do that.

00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:51.760
Here are a bunch of faces.

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:55.000
And I bet you can you
can tell this one, right?

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:55.540
Who is it?

00:52:57.250 --> 00:52:58.150
And who is this?

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:00.000
Very good.

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:03.920
And those two you don't know.

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:06.770
The problem is that I am
going to flip this over now.

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:08.780
And you still don't
know who those two are.

00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:16.290
OK, so this one
is Norbert Wiener.

00:53:16.290 --> 00:53:18.185
Now all of you know
about Norbert Wiener.

00:53:18.185 --> 00:53:20.590
He is one of the great
geniuses of our time.

00:53:20.590 --> 00:53:22.415
He came up with
the digital code.

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:27.030
He used to be a
professor at MIT.

00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:29.340
And this here is Chuck Vest.

00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:31.240
Anybody recognize him?

00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:36.650
Chuck Vest was a
president of MIT for what?

00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:39.620
For eight years, I believe,
maybe more, 12 years?

00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:40.120
I forget.

00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:47.740
And he has sunk into
obscurity, even though he

00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:50.000
was incredibly visible
for many, many years.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.970
If I had shown this to you
say eight or 10 years ago,

00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:55.980
you would immediately
recognize him.

00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:59.470
Because he, at that time,
was a president at MIT.

00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:03.890
So that then is an
interesting fact

00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:08.660
that even though we are capable
of using intermediate level

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:12.250
vision in a very
sophisticated way,

00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:16.430
it does not seem to work that
well for upside down faces.

00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:20.620
You guys did pretty
good with those.

00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:22.290
But it takes a while.

00:54:22.290 --> 00:54:27.290
If I had flashed that
on in a tachistoscope,

00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:31.260
you wouldn't have had a vague
idea of who those people were.

00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:33.650
But once it's on for a while
and you can analyze it,

00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:38.780
you can eventually tell
even an upside down face.

00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:47.700
OK, now in the same vein
as we are talking about,

00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:57.680
our ability to process shapes
based on contours and whatnot,

00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:01.330
one of the interesting set of
experiments people had done

00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:05.070
is to look at what is
called subjective contours.

00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:07.690
And so let me give you a
couple of examples of that.

00:55:07.690 --> 00:55:09.160
Here's an example.

00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:11.520
Almost instantly, here
you can see a disk.

00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:15.430
And here you can
see a square rotated

00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:18.980
45 degrees, a
diamond if you will.

00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:22.290
But if you analyze
this carefully,

00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:27.150
you can see that about
80% of this border

00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:28.940
here is not a border.

00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:30.270
There's no border here.

00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:32.830
There's no border here,
here, here, here, here.

00:55:32.830 --> 00:55:34.770
And yet we can see a square.

00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:39.350
So there's some strange ability
in part of the visual system

00:55:39.350 --> 00:55:43.510
to complete inferred borders.

00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:45.950
All right, I'll come back
to that in just a minute.

00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:49.240
Now another example
of this is shown here.

00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:53.040
Can you make out
what it says here?

00:55:54.024 --> 00:55:56.190
If you look a little bit,
you should be able to see.

00:55:56.190 --> 00:55:57.760
What is it?

00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:59.000
Visual system, very good.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.730
It was difficult to see.

00:56:00.730 --> 00:56:04.020
But as soon as I
turn this into color,

00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:05.270
you have no trouble at all.

00:56:06.490 --> 00:56:09.290
And that highlights
another important reason

00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:13.610
why color vision is so
useful and has evolved.

00:56:13.610 --> 00:56:16.940
Because it enables
us to see borders,

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:19.980
where under certain conditions
and lighting conditions,

00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:24.380
borders would not be visible
on the black and white.

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:29.020
OK, so now that's another
interesting example,

00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:33.670
has to do with further
subjective contours.

00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:37.040
And here's an example of
one with a high contrast,

00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:39.600
where you can
readily see a cube.

00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:41.473
Does everybody see a cube there?

00:56:41.473 --> 00:56:45.130
All right, but if you look
here, it's next to impossible

00:56:45.130 --> 00:56:46.120
to see that.

00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:48.730
Because here the
stimuli are isoluminant.

00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:55.290
So here you eliminated
contrast, which

00:56:55.290 --> 00:56:57.290
is a very important
aspect of being

00:56:57.290 --> 00:57:05.380
able to analyze the visual
scene in various ways,

00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:06.680
including three dimensions.

00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:11.020
All right, so now here's a
very interesting discovery that

00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:14.200
was made by recording
an area, V2.

00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:20.730
The recordings were
then made to see

00:57:20.730 --> 00:57:25.850
whether those neurons
perceive subjective contours.

00:57:25.850 --> 00:57:27.880
So here's a receptive field.

00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:31.220
And you take this bar and move
it back and forth across it.

00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:33.670
And you can see it gives
a vigorous response.

00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:35.710
Now you do the same thing.

00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:39.760
But you don't, here you have
only a subjective contour.

00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:42.500
And then you move this
back and forth across.

00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:49.340
Somehow the information is
added up from other areas,

00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:53.940
so that this cell
responds, not that well,

00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:58.130
but responds reasonably well
to the subjective contour.

00:57:58.130 --> 00:58:02.440
So it's said that in
V2, you can carry out

00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:05.440
some of these higher
level processes that

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:09.200
enables you to
complete figures even

00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:11.890
when they are
incomplete like that.

00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:14.290
OK, here's another
example of that.

00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:15.970
This is even more dramatic.

00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:18.600
In this case, we take this
bar back and forth across.

00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:20.959
That's a vigorous response.

00:58:20.959 --> 00:58:22.250
And then you do the same thing.

00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:27.370
You create a bar here simply
by these continuous horizontal

00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:28.420
bars.

00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:30.980
And still, the cell
responds quite well,

00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:34.090
as if it were
seeing an edge here.

00:58:34.090 --> 00:58:38.140
So we have this kind of
completion in area V2.

00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:40.290
So this is sort
of an initial hint

00:58:40.290 --> 00:58:44.650
then that already
in area V2, you

00:58:44.650 --> 00:58:50.210
begin to process
higher level events,

00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:52.830
among which is the
fact that you can

00:58:52.830 --> 00:58:54.690
complete incomplete contours.

00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:59.440
All right, so now, the next
thing we're going to turn to,

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:01.970
we're going to ask
the question, when

00:59:01.970 --> 00:59:05.740
we deal with these
so-called intermediate level

00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:11.900
visual capacities, what
happens when you take out

00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:16.850
such areas as V4 and
MT to your ability

00:59:16.850 --> 00:59:19.710
to see these intermediate
visual capacities?

00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:21.990
So let me describe
to you some of these,

00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:25.230
how one would do
experiments like this.

00:59:25.230 --> 00:59:27.680
First of all,
monkeys are trained.

00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:30.320
This is done with monkeys, of
course, because we can't just

00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:32.900
take a human and remove V4 MT.

00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:38.820
And so what you do here is you
first present a fixation spot.

00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:43.390
Once the monkey fixates,
you present a shape,

00:59:43.390 --> 00:59:45.060
in this case a square.

00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:49.300
And then you present a whole
bunch of other ones, only one

00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:51.350
of which is the same
as the original.

00:59:51.350 --> 00:59:53.450
And the monkey has to
make a [INAUDIBLE] there

00:59:53.450 --> 00:59:54.710
to be rewarded.

00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:59.090
So he has to be able to
detect identity, which

00:59:59.090 --> 01:00:01.850
is an intermediate
visual capacity.

01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:03.850
So that's what this is like.

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:08.180
And so then what
you can do here is

01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:10.930
to vary the amount
of information

01:00:10.930 --> 01:00:15.740
you can provide, again by
reducing the amount of contour

01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:17.650
information that
you can provide.

01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:19.120
You can do this in several ways.

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:25.020
First of all, before we do that,
I'll come to that in a second,

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:26.770
let's just see, how
does the monkey do

01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:30.040
when you do those very similar
shapes I just have shown you

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.870
after you take out area V4?

01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:36.370
What you find here is that the
monkey initially, after you

01:00:36.370 --> 01:00:42.030
take out the area V4, can't
even do the regular task, which

01:00:42.030 --> 01:00:43.530
is this one, right?

01:00:43.530 --> 01:00:46.140
So this is identical to
this one in this case.

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:49.540
And when you do that, he does
very poorly to begin with

01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:51.710
and then gradually,
over many, many days,

01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:53.540
improves a great deal.

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:56.917
Then if you put a new figure
in, then it takes a while for it

01:00:56.917 --> 01:00:59.070
to learn that, all right.

01:00:59.070 --> 01:01:02.520
Now then, what you
can do, now I come

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:06.550
to this business of
having these same figures.

01:01:06.550 --> 01:01:09.720
But you can vary
them now, so that you

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:13.450
have to do a transposition to
do an intermediate visual task.

01:01:13.450 --> 01:01:17.760
In this case, what you do
is that you vary the size.

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:20.200
In this case, it's
identical just like it was.

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:23.394
In this case, you see that
this is smaller than this.

01:01:23.394 --> 01:01:25.310
But you say, oh, I have
to go find the circle.

01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:27.960
I'm not looking for identity.

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:31.050
I'm looking for something
that's the same looking.

01:01:31.050 --> 01:01:32.680
And here we have
even bigger case.

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:33.749
This is a triangle.

01:01:33.749 --> 01:01:35.290
And so the monkey
makes a [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:35.290 --> 01:01:36.940
to that one here to this one.

01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:40.870
So that has to do a
test position in size.

01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:43.350
Another thing you can
do that we talked about,

01:01:43.350 --> 01:01:46.060
you can vary the amount
of contour information

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:48.480
by doing this kind of occlusion.

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.130
And the degree of
occlusion you can

01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:53.530
vary by varying the spatial
frequency of the display.

01:01:53.530 --> 01:01:57.500
And lastly, you can also
decrease or increase the amount

01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:00.170
of contour information
that you provide.

01:02:00.170 --> 01:02:05.760
Now if you do with this, you get
a huge effect after V4 lesion.

01:02:07.210 --> 01:02:11.390
This was the normal condition
with the varied object size.

01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:13.040
This is the occlusion.

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:16.530
And here is the varied
contour information.

01:02:16.530 --> 01:02:19.020
You can see that there is
quite a dramatic loss, not

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:23.600
a total, but quite a notable
loss, in the monkey's ability

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.130
to perform this task.

01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:28.010
And this is also reflected
in the huge increase

01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:32.230
in the latencies with which the
monkey can perform the task.

01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:35.720
So area V4 seems to
play an important role

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:38.860
in these intermediate
visual capacities.

01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:42.240
And I come to some more examples
of that in just a minute.

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:47.150
Now, yet another
important factor

01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:59.400
in analyzing the
visual scene occurs

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:02.530
when it is our task
to find something

01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:05.540
out there that is
less noticeable.

01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:13.830
Remember, we talked a little
bit about using camouflage,

01:03:13.830 --> 01:03:18.105
in which case, you have to find
something lesser to survive.

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:22.520
Now in this case,
what we can do here,

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:24.740
do a similar
experiment in a monkey.

01:03:26.130 --> 01:03:28.820
On the left side,
the target, the one

01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:32.330
the monkey's supposed to select,
has a much higher contrast

01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:34.660
than the distractors.

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:36.610
And you can vary the
degree of difference,

01:03:36.610 --> 01:03:39.760
but always the target is
brighter than the others,

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:41.240
so that it stands out.

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:44.740
But then, you must
be equally able,

01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:46.280
whether you're an
animal or a human,

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:47.990
to be able to pull
out something that's

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:50.615
lesser in the visuals field.

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:55.120
And you have to
be able to do this

01:03:55.120 --> 01:04:02.555
if you are going to survive
in your environment.

01:04:02.555 --> 01:04:06.120
Now here then, the task is to
go to this lesser stimulus,

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:07.780
because it's the odd stimulus.

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:10.730
So what you're extracting
is the odd stimulus.

01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:14.270
Here it's easy to extract, and
here it's difficult to extract.

01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:21.830
And so now the question is what
happens in the visual cortex?

01:04:21.830 --> 01:04:25.230
What area plays a role in this?

01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:28.450
And so it was
discovered that area V4

01:04:28.450 --> 01:04:29.690
is very important for this.

01:04:29.690 --> 01:04:31.600
And let me explain
this to you then.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:36.480
You do an experiment in
which you remove area V4

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.520
and see what happens.

01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:42.900
And here what we have is
when the star gets brighter,

01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:45.940
you vary the
luminance difference.

01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:48.900
And you can see there's a mild
deficit with the V4 lesion,

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:50.980
highly significant
but still fairly mild.

01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:53.760
On the other hand, when
you make it dimmer,

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:57.800
the monkey is practically
staying at the probability.

01:04:59.050 --> 01:05:01.190
He cannot do the task at all.

01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:04.360
So somehow, V4 plays
a very important role

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:09.200
in being able to ferret
out some subtle things

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.050
in the environment,
lesser things.

01:05:12.410 --> 01:05:15.860
All right, so this
then brings us

01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:17.970
to yet another way
of analyzing this.

01:05:17.970 --> 01:05:21.370
We can, in this case,
go to the larger target,

01:05:21.370 --> 01:05:23.250
in this case to
the smaller target.

01:05:23.250 --> 01:05:25.660
And you can recognize yourself
that this is certainly

01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:27.190
easier than that.

01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:31.820
But a normal monkey can do
both of these quite well,

01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:32.750
shown here.

01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:34.520
This is the normal
monkey's performance,

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:37.300
the target larger, here
the target smaller.

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:38.840
He does extremely well.

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:41.880
But with a V4 lesion when
the target is smaller,

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:50.150
it's totally devastated, so
as if area V4 were involved

01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:57.360
in the analysis of subtle
things, things which are lesser

01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:59.750
then, rather than
being reflex like

01:05:59.750 --> 01:06:04.640
and going to the brightest,
biggest thing in the world.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:12.270
OK, so that then indeed
highlights the fact

01:06:12.270 --> 01:06:13.970
that we have some
of these areas,

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:17.850
including V4 and of
course, therefore MT,

01:06:17.850 --> 01:06:25.030
that involved in these much more
subtle types of visual analyses

01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:26.920
that we need to perform.

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:34.350
Now capitalizing on these
kinds of subtle things

01:06:34.350 --> 01:06:37.670
that we are capable of doing,
artists, in addition to

01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:41.160
the ones that I've
shown you before, also

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:48.210
created all kinds of percepts, I
should say paintings, sketches,

01:06:48.210 --> 01:06:54.730
precepts, that cause
confusion by playing around

01:06:54.730 --> 01:06:55.950
with these factors.

01:06:55.950 --> 01:07:01.345
One of these here is a very well
known audience called Escher.

01:07:03.350 --> 01:07:07.940
This was so near the
end of the 19th century.

01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:11.155
And here what we
have is this is sort

01:07:11.155 --> 01:07:13.740
of a figure-ground confusion.

01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:17.400
Here what we have is a bunch
of birds that fly to the right,

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:20.060
and also a bunch of birds
that fly to the left.

01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:21.820
And so it's confusing.

01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:22.760
It's alternating.

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:24.420
You don't know
which one is which.

01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:27.960
And it has to do with a
very, very clever creation

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:31.370
of figure-ground confusions.

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:36.220
And actually, next time
we talk about illusions,

01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:40.300
I will bring in some more of
these kinds of curious effects.

01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:42.980
And then here's another one.

01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:47.250
And it's very hard for you to
tell are the stairs going up?

01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:48.560
Are they going down?

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:49.730
What's going on?

01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:56.590
It's the same kind of
play with the paintings

01:07:56.590 --> 01:07:59.990
to create confusion
in your perceptions.

01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:02.060
And then here is
yet another one,

01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:04.390
where you don't know
is water running up,

01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:06.280
or is the water
running down here?

01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:09.020
That's again an
interesting confusion

01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:11.360
that Escher has created.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:15.150
All right, so that
then is the essence

01:08:15.150 --> 01:08:20.200
of what I wanted to
cover today to highlight

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:25.380
the fact that our
ability to extract shape

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:30.410
information in the world
is absolutely incredible.

01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:33.479
And it has triggered
not only experiments

01:08:33.479 --> 01:08:36.640
to try to understand
that by scientists,

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:41.810
but it has created a
tremendous amount of artwork

01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:46.979
that played with these
because it was so enjoyable.

01:08:46.979 --> 01:08:49.649
And certainly, the several
paintings that I have shown you

01:08:49.649 --> 01:08:51.630
must have given you
a pretty good sense

01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:57.660
of how artists capitalize on
these limitations in ability

01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:02.550
to extract intermediate
and high level vision

01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:05.490
capacities from
the visual scene.

01:09:05.490 --> 01:09:08.830
All right, so to summarize
them, first of all,

01:09:08.830 --> 01:09:12.470
I mentioned three
major theories that

01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:14.350
have to do with form processing.

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:17.160
The one, the orientation
of line segments.

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:19.840
And I pointed out to you
that that theory is not

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.170
particularly powerful.

01:09:21.170 --> 01:09:24.979
And then the one, the
topographic theory,

01:09:24.979 --> 01:09:28.359
which turned out to be
bordering on the ridiculous.

01:09:28.359 --> 01:09:30.350
And finally, Fourier
analysis, which

01:09:30.350 --> 01:09:33.229
seems to have a lot of
power, even though it also

01:09:33.229 --> 01:09:35.740
has created a lot of skeptics.

01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:40.060
All right, then I pointed
out to that are the V2, V4,

01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:43.779
and inferotemporal cortex,
play important roles

01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:49.460
in intermediate vision, these
intermediate visual capacities

01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:51.640
we talked about in detail.

01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:57.020
Then I pointed out to
you also that in V2, it

01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:59.900
was discovered that there
are some neurons that

01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:06.170
respond to subjective contours,
indicating that already in area

01:10:06.170 --> 01:10:09.470
V2, we can perform these
incredibly higher level

01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:13.260
abilities to extract
information when

01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:15.850
it is unclear in
the visual scene.

01:10:15.850 --> 01:10:19.840
Then I pointed out to
you that recognition

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:22.390
of objects transformed
in the various ways

01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:25.760
is compromised by V4 and
inferotemporal lesions.

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:28.970
And V4 lesions also
produce major deficits

01:10:28.970 --> 01:10:34.100
in learning and selecting
lesser stimuli, which

01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:35.980
is a very important
attribute for us

01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:39.830
to be able not the respond
in reflex-like fashion

01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:41.490
to what is most
obvious out there,

01:10:41.490 --> 01:10:44.410
but to be able to
extract the subtle things

01:10:44.410 --> 01:10:46.300
from the visual scene.

01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:48.880
Some inferotemporal neurons
are selective for objects

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:50.140
including faces.

01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:53.430
But most respond to a variety
of objects whose recognition is

01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:55.920
based on the
differential activity

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.740
of a great many neurons.

01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:03.860
OK, so that then brings me
to the last point, which

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:08.670
is how we process and deal
with ambiguities in perception,

01:11:08.670 --> 01:11:11.850
unfortunately still
remains a mystery.

01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:19.600
And so there's a lot of space
here for new investigators

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:24.170
to come up with exciting,
interesting new findings

01:11:24.170 --> 01:11:31.440
about how the brain performs
these kinds of subtle analyses

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:32.657
of the visual scene.

01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:38.250
OK, I think I'll leave
this until next time.

01:11:38.250 --> 01:11:39.635
I'll talk about this next time.

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.891
OK, does anybody
have any questions?

01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:50.400
All right, I hope that you
can take a little bit of time

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:53.540
out, look at some of these
artists on the internet,

01:11:53.540 --> 01:12:00.410
and look at Hirschfeld and the
Ninas that I had shown you.
