00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.490
PROFESSOR: Well, OK.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.330
So first important
things about the course,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.890
plans for the course.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.970
And then today I'm going
to move to the next section

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.670
of the notes, section 2,
or part 2, I should say.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.260
And actually I'll skip for
the moments section 2-1

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.180
and go to section 2-2,
and all of chapter 2

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.840
will come to you probably
today or latest tomorrow.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.480
So that's where
we're going next.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.060
I'm following the
notes pretty carefully,

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.180
except I'm going to skip the
section on tensors until I

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.640
learn more basically.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.140
Yeah.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.650
Yeah.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.510
I could say a little
about tensors,

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:29.190
but this flows
naturally using the SVD.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.620
So it's just a terribly
important problem,

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.400
least squares.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.910
And of course, I know that
you've seen one or two

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.440
ways to do least squares.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.310
And really the whole
subject comes together.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.750
Here I want to say
something, before I send out

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.620
a plan for looking ahead
for the course as a whole.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.220
So there's no final exam.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.810
And I don't really see how to
examine you, how to give tests.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.220
I could, of course,
create our tests

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.229
about the linear algebra part.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.730
But I don't think it's--

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.440
it's not sort of the
style of this course

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.010
to expect you quickly to create
a proof for something in class.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.530
So I think, and
especially looking

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.360
at what we're headed for,
and moving quite steadily

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.750
in that direction,
is all the problems

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.280
that this linear algebra
is is aimed at, right up to

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.990
and including conjugate gradient
descent and deep learning,

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:58.270
the overwhelmingly important and
lively, active research area.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.140
I couldn't do better than
to keep the course going

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.500
in that direction.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.060
So I think what I
would ask you to do

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:17.380
is late in sort of April, May,
the regular homeworks I'll

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.900
discontinue at a certain point.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:27.220
And then instead, I'll be asking
and encouraging a project--

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.700
I don't know if that's the
right word to be using--

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.150
in which you use
what we've done.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.070
And I'll send out a
message on Stellar

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.820
listing five or six
areas and only--

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.090
I mean, one of them is
the machine learning, deep

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.850
learning part.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.410
But they're all the
other parts, things

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.050
we are learning how to do.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.010
How to find sparse
solutions, for example,

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.400
or something about
the pseudo inverse.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.700
All kinds of things.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.310
So that's my goal,
is to give you

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.800
something to do which uses the
material that you've learned.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.010
And look, I'm not
expecting a thesis.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.040
But it's a good chance.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.880
So it will be more
than just, drag

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.120
in some code for deep learning
and some data matrix and do it.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.910
But we'll talk more
as the time comes.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.420
So I just thought I'd
say, before sending out

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.920
the announcement,
I would say it's

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:47.180
coming about what as a
larger scale than single one

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.090
week homeworks would
be here before.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.400
Any thoughts about that?

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.310
I haven't given you details.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.520
So let me do that with a
message, and then ask again.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.930
But I'm open to--

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.640
I hope you've understood--

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.270
I think you have-- that
if you make suggestions,

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.850
either directly to my email
or on Piazza or whatever,

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.890
they get paid attention to.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.450
OK.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.220
Shall I just go forward
with least squares?

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.900
So what's the least
squares problem,

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.470
and what are these four
ways, each bringing--

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.150
so let me speak about
the pseudo inverse first.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.770
OK, the pseudo
inverse of a matrix.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:34.270
All right.

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.770
Good.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.510
So we have a matrix A, m by n.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.680
And the pseudo inverse
I'm going to call A plus.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.630
And it naturally is
going to be n by m.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.370
I'm going to multiply
those together.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.570
And I'm going to get as near
to the identity as I can.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.970
That's the idea, of course,
of the pseudo inverse,

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.330
The word pseudo is in
there, so no one's deceived.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.330
It's not an actual inverse.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:14.210
Oh, if the matrix is square
and has an inverse, of course.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:22.130
Then if A inverse
exists, which requires--

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.620
everybody remembers
it requires the matrix

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.360
to be square, because I
mean inverse on both sides.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.910
And it requires
rank n, full rank.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.710
Then the inverse will exist.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.000
You can check it.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.460
MATLAB would check
it by computing

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.540
the pivots in elimination
and finding n pivots.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.130
So if A inverse
exists, which means

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:55.280
A times A inverse, and A
inverse times A, both give I,

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:01.640
then A plus is A
inverse, of course.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:07.810
The pseudo inverse is the
inverse when there is one.

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.600
But I'm thinking
about cases where

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.920
either the matrix
is rectangular,

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:19.550
or it has zero eigenvalues.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.090
It could be square, but it has
a null space, other than just

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.840
the 0 vector.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.800
In other words, the
columns are dependent.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.370
What can we do then
about inverting it?

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.350
We can't literally invert it.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:38.520
If A has a null
space, then when I

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:44.910
multiply by a vector x in
that null space, Ax will be 0.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.720
And when I multiply
by A inverse, still 0.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.850
That can't change the 0.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:56.560
So if there is an x in the null
space, then this can't happen.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.000
So we just do the best we can.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.390
And that's what this
pseudo inverse is.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:06.400
And so let me draw a picture of
the picture you know of the row

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.530
space and the null space.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.120
OK, and it's there, you see.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.950
There is a null space.

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:19.210
And over here I have the
column space and the null space

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:20.880
of A transpose.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.850
OK.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.620
So this is the row
space, of course.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.180
That's the column
space of A transpose,

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:32.030
and there is the
column space of A. OK.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:35.059
So which part of that picture
is invertible, and which part

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:37.250
of the picture is hopeless?

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.710
The top part is invertible.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:45.470
This is the r-dimensional row
space, r-dimensional column

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:46.040
space.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.450
A takes a vector in here,
zaps it into every--

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:54.710
you always end up
in the column space.

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:57.410
Here I take a vector
in the row space--

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:02.210
say, x-- and it
gets mapped to Ax.

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:10.080
And between those two spaces,
A is entirely invertible.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.260
You get separate
vectors here, go

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.230
to separate vectors
in the column space,

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:19.720
and the inverse
just brings it back.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.770
So we know what the
pseudo inverse should do.

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:30.060
It will take A will go
that way, and A plus,

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.160
the pseudo inverse
will be just--

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.810
on the top half of the
picture, it'll give us A plus.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:46.800
We'll take Ax back
to x in the top half.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.570
Now, what about here?

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.210
That's where we have
trouble, when we don't have--

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.340
that's what spoils our inverse.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:59.970
If there is a null space
vector, then it goes where?

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.940
When you multiply by A, this
guy in the null space goes to 0.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.840
Usually along a straighter
line than I've drawn.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.590
But it goes there.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.300
It gets to 0.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.780
So you can't raise it from
the dead, so to speak.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.950
You can't recover it when
there's no A inverse.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:24.120
So we have to think, what shall
A inverse do to this space

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.910
here, where nobody's hitting it?

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:34.830
So this would be the null
space of A transpose.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:40.040
Because A-- sorry-- yeah, what
should the pseudo inverse do?

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.690
I said what should
the inverse do?

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:43.430
The inverse is helpless.

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:46.610
But we have to define A plus.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.630
I've said what it should do on
that guy, on the column space.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.520
It should take everything
in the column space

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.790
back where it came from.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:11:00.020
But what should it do on this
orthogonal space, where--

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.460
yeah, just tell me,
what do you think?

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.750
If I have some vector here--

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.580
let's call it V r plus 1.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.410
That would be like--

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:24.430
so here I have a nice
basis for the column space.

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:30.400
I would use V's for the ones
that come up in the SVD.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.090
They're orthogonal, and they
come from orthogonal U's.

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.040
So the top half is great.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:40.120
What shall I do with this stuff?

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.780
I'm going to send
that back by A plus.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.720
And what am I going
to do with it?

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.750
Send it to-- nowhere
else could it go.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.430
0 is the right answer.

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:53.470
All this stuff goes back to 0.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.090
I'm looking for a linear
operator, a matrix.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:02.440
And I have to think,
once I've decided

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.740
what to do with all those and
what to do with all these,

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.110
then I know what to do
with any combination.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:09.640
So I've got it.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:10.540
I've got it.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:19.050
So the idea will be, this is
true for x in the row space.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:25.735
For x in the row space,
if x is in the row space,

00:12:25.735 --> 00:12:29.710
Ax is in the column space, and
A inverse just brings it back

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:30.980
as it should.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.510
And in the case of
an invertible matrix

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:37.000
A, what happens to my picture?

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.230
What is this picture looking
like if A is actually a 6

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:44.020
by 6 invertible matrix?

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:47.200
In that case,
what's in my picture

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.800
and what is not in my picture?

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.070
All this null space
stuff isn't there.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:57.800
And null space is
just a 0 vector.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.670
But all that I don't
have to worry about.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:01.980
But in general,
I do have to say.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:08.890
So the point is
that A plus on the--

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.330
what am I calling this?

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.980
It's the null space
of A transpose,

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:25.790
or whatever on V r
plus 1 to Vn, all those

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:32.150
vectors, the guys that are not
orthogonal to the column space.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:36.540
Then we have to say, what
does A plus do to them?

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.470
And the answer is, it
takes them all to 0.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:45.580
So there is a
picture using what I

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.850
call the big picture of linear
algebra, the four spaces.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.520
You see what A plus should do.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:55.610
Now, I need a little
formula for it.

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:58.970
I've got the plan for
what it should be,

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:01.310
and it's sort of
the natural thing.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:06.470
So A plus A is, you could
say it's a projection matrix.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:11.420
It's not the identity
matrix because if x

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:17.750
is in the null space, A
plus A will take it to 0.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:18.830
So it's a projection.

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:22.130
A plus A is the identity
on the top half,

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:23.840
and 0 on the bottom half.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.780
That's really what
the matrix is.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:34.240
And now, I want a
simple formula for it.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.700
And I guess my message
here is, that if we're

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:41.750
looking for a nice expression,
start with the SVD.

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:46.070
Because the SVD
works for any matrix.

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:49.160
And it writes it as
an orthogonal matrix

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:53.920
times a diagonal matrix
times an orthogonal matrix.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.560
And now I want to invert it.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.460
Well, suppose A had an inverse.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:01.360
What would that be?

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:13.870
This is if invertible, what
would be the SVD of A inverse?

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:18.080
What would be the singular value
decomposition, if this is good?

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.410
So when is this
going to be good?

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:24.380
What would I have to know
about that matrix sigma,

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.680
that diagonal matrix
in the middle,

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:32.100
if this is truly an
invertible matrix?

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:32.600
Well, no.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.590
What's its name?

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:35.270
Those are not eigenvalues.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:38.900
Well, they're eigenvalues
of A transpose A.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.280
But they're singular values.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.850
Singular value, that's fine.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:44.300
So that's the
singular value matrix.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:51.250
And what would be the
situation if A had an inverse?

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.050
There would be no 0's.

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:54.880
All the singular
values would be sitting

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.220
there, sigma 1 to sigma n.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.650
What would be the shape
of this sigma matrix?

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:05.470
If I have an inverse, then
it's got to be square n by n.

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:09.280
So what's the shape
of the sigma guy?

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.220
Also square, n by n.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:16.010
So the invertible
case would be--

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.110
and I'm going to erase
this in a minute--

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:23.426
the invertbile case would
be when sigma is just that.

00:16:23.426 --> 00:16:25.800
That would be the
invertible case.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.830
So let's see.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:30.660
Can you finish this formula?

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:35.220
What would be the
SVD of A inverse?

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.370
So I'm given the SVD
of A. I'm given the U

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:43.080
and the sigma is cool
and the V transpose.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.640
What's the inverse of that?

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.190
Yeah, I'm just
really asking what's

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:51.130
the inverse of that
product of three matrices.

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:52.930
What comes first here?

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:56.230
V. The inverse of
V transpose is V.

00:16:56.230 --> 00:17:00.380
That's because V is
a orthogonal matrix.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.830
The inverse of sigma,
just 1 over it,

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:04.720
is just the sigma inverse.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.609
It's obvious what that means.

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:09.020
And the inverse of
U would go here.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.230
And that is U transpose.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.589
Great.

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:13.089
OK.

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:16.140
So this is if invertible.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:21.609
If invertible, we know what
the SVD of A inverse is.

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:28.560
It just takes the V's back
to the U's, or the U's back

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.830
to the V's, whichever.

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:30.540
OK.

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:31.170
OK.

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:37.970
Now we've got to do it,
if we're going to allow--

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:42.330
if we're going to get beyond
this limit, this situation,

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:46.860
allow the matrix sigma
to be rectangular.

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:51.750
Then let me just show
you the idea here.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:57.510
So now I'm going to say,
now sigma, in general,

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:59.190
it's rectangular.

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:04.460
It's got r non 0's on the
diagonal, but then it quits.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:09.610
So it's got a bunch of 0's
that make it not invertible.

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:14.020
But let's do our best
and pseudo invert it.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.130
OK.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:20.650
So now help me get started
on a formula for using--

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:24.970
I want to write this A plus,
which I described up there,

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:27.880
in terms of the subspaces.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:33.700
Now I'm going to describe A plus
in terms of U, sigma, and V,

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.350
the SVD guys.

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:36.010
OK.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:39.520
So what shall I start with here?

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.410
Well, let me give a hint.

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:43.360
That was a great start.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.620
My V is still an
orthogonal matrix.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.170
V transpose is still
an orthogonal matrix.

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.780
I'll invert it.

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:57.280
At the end, the
U was no problem.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.170
All the problems are in sigma.

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:04.640
And sigma, remember, sigma--

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.320
so it's rectangular.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:10.070
Maybe I'll make
it wide, two wide.

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:13.970
And maybe I'll only give
it two non-zeros, and then

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:16.260
all the rest.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:22.400
So the rank of my matrix
A is 2, but the m and n

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.990
are bigger than 2.

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:26.660
It's just got two
independent columns,

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:30.980
and then it's just sort
of totally singular.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:31.550
OK.

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:35.630
So my question is, what
am I going to put there?

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:37.850
And I've described it
one way, but now I'm

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.500
going to describe
it another way.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.940
Well, let me just say,
what I'll put there

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.390
is the pseudo inverse of sigma.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:50.680
I can't put sigma inverse
using that symbol,

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.080
because there is no such thing.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.220
With this, I can't invert it.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:59.390
So that's the best I can do.

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:03.330
So I'm almost done, but to
finish, I have to tell you,

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:06.880
what is this thing?

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.250
So sigma plus.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.860
I'm now going to
tell you sigma plus.

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:15.490
And then that's what should
sit there in the middle.

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:18.400
So if sigma is this
diagonal matrix

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.690
which quits after two sigmas,
what should sigma plus be?

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:28.180
Well, first of all, it should
be rectangular the other way.

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:33.130
If this was m by n column,
n columns and m rows,

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:39.070
now I want to have n
rows and m columns.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:42.750
And yeah, here's the question.

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:44.760
What's the best inverse
you could come up

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.270
with for that sigma?

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:51.230
I mean, if somebody
independent of 18.065,

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:55.850
if somebody asks you, do your
best to invert that matrix,

00:20:55.850 --> 00:21:00.320
I think we'd all
agree it is, yeah.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:04.580
One over the sigma
1 would come there.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:08.180
And 1 over sigma
2, the non zeros.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.800
And then?

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.290
Zeros.

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:15.630
Just the way up there, when
we didn't know what to do,

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:17.860
when there was
nothing good to do.

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.400
Zero was the right answer.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.310
So this is all zeros.

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:25.470
Of course, it's
rectangular the other way.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:28.200
But do you see
that if I multiply

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.260
sigma plus times
sigma, if I multiply

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:35.250
the pseudo inverse times
the matrix, what do I

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:39.170
get if I multiply that by that?

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:41.440
What does that
multiplication produce?

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.950
Can you describe the--

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:46.100
well, or when you tell
me what it looks like,

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:47.170
I'll write it down.

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:50.740
So what is sigma
plus times sigma?

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:54.250
If sigma is a diagonal,
sigma plus is a diagonal,

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:59.510
and they both quit
after two guys.

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:01.990
What do I have?

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:03.300
One?

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:07.480
Because sigma 1 times
1 over sigma 1 is a 1.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:11.260
And the other next guy is a 1.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.320
And the rest are all zeros.

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.360
That's right.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.250
That's the best I could do.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:22.250
The rank was only two, so
I couldn't get anywhere.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:26.020
So that tells you
what sigma plus is.

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.320
OK.

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:30.210
So I described
the pseudo inverse

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:33.020
then with a picture
of spaces, and then

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.750
with a formula of matrices.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:39.960
And now I want to use
it in least squares.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.820
So now I'm going to say what
is the least squares problem.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:50.450
And the first way to solve
it will be to involve--

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:52.550
A plus will give the solution.

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:53.050
OK.

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:56.420
So what is the least
squares problem?

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:58.010
Let me put it here.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:09.190
OK, the least squares problem
is simply, you have an equation,

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:10.440
Ax equals b.

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:16.730
But A is not invertible.

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:19.190
So you can't solve it.

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:21.290
Of course, for which--

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:24.740
yeah, you could solve
it for certain b's.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.380
If b is in the
column space of A,

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:30.620
then just by the
meaning of column space,

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.270
this has a solution.

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:36.440
The vectors in the column space
are the guys that you can get.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.540
But the vectors in the
orthogonal space you cannot

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:40.040
get.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.230
All the rest of the
vectors you cannot get.

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:50.090
So suppose this is like so,
but always A is m by n rank r.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:24:03.820
And then we get A inverse
when m equals n equals r.

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:06.190
That's the invertible case.

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:07.730
OK.

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:12.960
What do we do with a
system of equations

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.600
when we can't solve it?

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.050
This is probably the main
application in 18.06.

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:25.560
So you've seen this
problem before.

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:29.180
What do we do if Ax
equal b has no solution?

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:33.210
So typically, b would be
a vector of measurements,

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:39.480
like we're tracking a satellite,
and we get some measurements.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:44.310
But often we get too
many measurements.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:46.800
And of course, there's
a little noise in them.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.790
And a little noise means that
we can't solve the equations.

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:54.900
That may be the
case everybody knows

00:24:54.900 --> 00:25:02.340
is, where this equation is
like expressing a straight line

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:03.860
going through the data points.

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:07.170
So the famous example
of least squares

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:21.140
is fit a straight line
to the b's, to b1, b2.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.985
We've got m measurements.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.450
We've got m measurements.

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:32.170
The physics or the
mechanics of the problem

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:34.000
is pretty well linear.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.650
But of course, there's noise.

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:41.480
And a straight line only
has two degrees of freedom.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.870
So we're going to have only
two columns in our matrix.

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:53.190
A will be only two
columns, with many rows.

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:54.900
Highly rectangular.

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.490
So fit a straight line.

00:25:56.490 --> 00:26:02.400
Let me call that line Cx plus
D. Say this is the x direction.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.880
This is the b's direction.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.910
And we've got a whole
bunch of data points.

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:10.720
And they're not on a line.

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:11.730
Or they are on the line.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.780
Suppose those did lie on a line.

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:22.610
What would that tell
me about Ax equal b?

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:25.540
I haven't said
everything I need to,

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:28.960
but maybe the insight
is what I'm after here.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.940
If my points are
right on the line--

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:37.590
so there is a straight
line through them--

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:39.830
the unknowns here-- so let me--

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:44.930
so Ax-- the unknowns
here are C and D.

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:48.845
And the right hand side
is all my measurements.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.380
OK.

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.920
Suppose-- without my
drawing a picture--

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.300
suppose these points
are on the line.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:05.000
Here's the different x's,
the measurement times.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.680
Here is the different
measurements.

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:10.870
But if they're on
a line, what does

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:16.060
that tell me about my
linear system, Ax equal b?

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:19.800
It has a solution.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.740
Being on a line means
everything's perfect.

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.360
There is a solution.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.210
But will there
usually be a solution?

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:28.080
Certainly not.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:35.980
If I have only two parameters,
two unknowns, two columns here,

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:38.350
the rank is going to be two.

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:44.440
And here I'm trying to hit
any noisy set of measurements.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.800
So of course, in general the
picture will look like that.

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.500
And I'm going to look
for the best C and D.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:28:01.840
So I'll call it Cx
plus D. Yeah, right.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.250
Sorry.

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:05.760
That's my line.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.570
So those are my equations.

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:14.200
Sorry, I often
write it C plus dx.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.810
Do you mind if I put
the constant term

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:21.770
first in the highly
difficult equation here

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:22.780
for a straight line?

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:29.340
So let me tell you what I'm--

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:32.565
so these are the points where
you have a measurement--

00:28:32.565 --> 00:28:35.820
x1, x2, up to xn.

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:39.410
And these are the actual
measurements, b1 up to bm,

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:40.770
let's say .

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:43.740
And then my equations are--

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.530
I just want to set
up a matrix here.

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:49.420
I just want to
set up the matrix.

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:55.160
So I want C to get multiplied
by ones every time.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:29:02.010
And I want D to get multiplied
by these x's-- x1, x2, x3,

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:05.790
to xm, the measurement places.

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:07.740
And those are the measurements.

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.300
Anyway.

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:13.165
And my problem is,
this has no solution.

00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:17.770
So what do I do when
there's no solution?

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:24.810
Well, I'll do what Gauss did.

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:28.570
He was a good mathematician,
so I'll follow his advice.

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:34.020
And I won't do it all
semester, as you know.

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:40.330
But Gauss's advice
was, minimize--

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:43.200
I'll blame it on Gauss--

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:53.550
the distance between Ax and b
squared, the L2 norm squared,

00:29:53.550 --> 00:30:02.030
which is just Ax minus
b transpose Ax minus b.

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:04.190
It's a quadratic.

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:10.050
And minimizing it gives me a
system of linear equations.

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:12.330
So in the end, they
will have a solution.

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:14.660
So that's the whole
point of least squares.

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:20.080
We have an unsolvable
problem, not no solution.

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:25.330
We follow Gauss's advice
to get the best we can.

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:28.840
And that does produce an answer.

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:34.690
So this is-- if I multiply
this out, it's x transpose,

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:36.610
A transpose, Ax.

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:39.830
That comes from
the squared term.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:42.100
And then I have probably these--

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:48.150
actually, probably I'll
get two of those, and then

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:52.240
a constant term that
has derivative 0

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.100
so it doesn't enter.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.590
So this is what I'm minimizing.

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:59.800
This is the loss function.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.540
And it leads to--

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:07.390
let's just jump to the key here.

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:11.920
What equation do I
get when I look for--

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:19.160
what equation is solved
by the best x, the best x?

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:23.610
The best x solves the famous--

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:28.860
this is regression in
statistics, linear regression.

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:36.240
It's one of the main
computations in statistics,

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.700
not of course just for
straight line fits,

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:42.930
but for any system Ax equal b.

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:45.300
That will lead to--

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:48.660
this minimum will lead
to a system of equations

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:50.760
that I'm going to
put a box around,

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.340
because it's so fundamental.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:58.990
And are you willing to tell
me what that equation is?

00:31:58.990 --> 00:31:59.750
Yes, thanks.

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:00.750
AUDIENCE: A transpose A.

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:04.240
PROFESSOR: A transpose A is
going to come from there--

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.270
you see it--

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:13.080
times the best x
equals A transpose b.

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.610
That gives the minimum.

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:23.610
Let me forego checking that.

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:27.520
You see that the quadratic
term has the matrix in it.

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:29.920
So it's derivative.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:34.980
Maybe the derivative of
this is 2 A transpose Ax,

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:38.100
and then the 2 cancels that 2.

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:43.650
And this could also be written
as x transpose A transpose b.

00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:47.970
So it's x transpose
against A transpose b.

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:48.960
That's linear.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:53.990
So when I take the derivative,
it's that constant.

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:55.490
That's pretty fast.

00:32:55.490 --> 00:33:04.090
18.06 would patiently
derive that.

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:08.640
But here, let me give
you the picture that

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:12.500
goes with it, the geometry.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:17.950
So we have the problem.

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:19.920
No solution.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:24.920
We have Gauss's best answer.

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:29.210
Minimize the 2
norm of the error.

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:33.410
We have the conclusion,
the matrix that we get in.

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:36.170
And now I want to draw a
picture that goes with it.

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:37.010
OK.

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:38.450
So here is a picture.

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:48.630
I want to have a column space
of A there in that picture.

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:54.060
Of course, the 0 vector's
in the column space of A.

00:33:54.060 --> 00:34:01.070
So this is all
possible vectors Ax.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:06.100
Right?

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:11.630
You're never forgetting that the
column space is all the Ax's.

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:15.820
Now, I've got to put
b in the picture.

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:20.770
So where does this vector
b-- so I'm trying to solve Ax

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:23.350
equal b, but failing.

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:28.570
So if I draw b in this
picture, how do I draw b?

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:29.830
Where do I put it?

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:32.889
Shall I put it in
the column space?

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:34.120
No.

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:37.389
The whole point is, it's
not in the column space.

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:39.580
It's not an Ax.

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:43.000
It's out there somewhere, b.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.350
OK.

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:47.960
And then what's
the geometry that

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:51.860
goes with least squares
and the normal equations

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:57.710
and Gauss's suggestion
to minimize the error?

00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:04.460
Where will Ax be, the
best Ax that I can do?

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:12.350
So what Gauss has
produced is an A here.

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:14.390
You can't find an x.

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:17.040
He'll do as best he can.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.550
And we're calling
that guy x hat.

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:24.690
And this is the
algebra to find x hat.

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:28.770
And now, where is
the picture here?

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:31.910
Where is this
vector Ax hat, which

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:35.750
is the best Ax we can get?

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:39.320
So it has to be in
the column space,

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:41.420
because it's A times something.

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:44.210
And where is it in
the column space?

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:48.330
It's the projection.

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:50.640
That's Ax hat.

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:54.540
And here is the error, which
you couldn't do anything about,

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.040
b minus Ax hat.

00:35:58.970 --> 00:35:59.470
Yeah.

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:02.170
So it's the projection, right.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:07.210
So all this is justifying the--

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:13.030
so we're in the second
approach to least squares,

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:15.940
solve the normal equations.

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:18.730
Solve the normal equations.

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:22.590
That would be the second
approach to least squares.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:30.800
And most examples, if they're
not very big or very difficult,

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.550
you just create the
matrix A transpose A,

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:39.130
and you call MATLAB and
solve that linear system.

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:41.692
You create the matrix, you
create the right hand side,

00:36:41.692 --> 00:36:42.400
and you solve it.

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:51.330
So that's the ordinary run of
the mill least squares problem.

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:54.150
Just do it.

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:56.620
So that's method
two, just do it.

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:02.590
What's method three?

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:05.140
For the same-- we're talking
about the same problem here,

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:10.950
but now I'm thinking it may
be a little more difficult.

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:17.820
This matrix A transpose A
might be nearly singular.

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:21.200
Gauss is assuming that--

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.410
yeah, when did this work?

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:24.890
When did this work?

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:30.150
And it will continue to
work in the next three--

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:38.110
this works, this is
good, if assuming A

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:41.295
has independent columns.

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:54.810
Yeah, better just make clear.

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:58.320
I'm claiming that when A has--

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.570
so what's the reasoning?

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:03.430
If A has independent columns--

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:06.550
but maybe not enough
columns, like here--

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:07.840
it's only got two columns.

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:10.750
It's obviously not going to be
able to match any right hand

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:11.410
side.

00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:13.570
But it's got
independent columns.

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:16.630
When A has independent
columns, then what can I

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:17.815
say about this matrix?

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.870
It's invertible.

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:25.500
Gauss's plan works.

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:29.790
If A has independent
columns, then this

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:32.880
would be a linear algebra step.

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.040
Then this will be invertible.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.230
You see the importance
of that step.

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:38.910
If A has independent
columns, that

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:41.550
means it has no null space.

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:44.760
Only x equals 0 is
in the null space.

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:48.000
Two independent
columns, but only two.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.140
So not enough to solve
systems, but independent.

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:53.560
Then you're OK.

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.590
This matrix is invertible.

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:57.120
You can do what Gauss tells you.

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:03.530
But we're prepared now--

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:07.790
we have to think, OK.

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:11.930
So what do I really want to do?

00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:19.410
I want to connect this Gauss's
solution to the pseudo inverse.

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:22.860
Because I'm claiming they
both give the same result.

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:29.065
The pseudo inverse will apply.

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:35.790
But we have something--

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:37.280
A is not invertible.

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:40.310
Just keep remembering
this matrix.

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:41.990
It's not invertible.

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:47.850
But it has got
independent columns.

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:50.143
What am I saying there?

00:39:50.143 --> 00:39:51.435
Just going back to the picture.

00:39:56.030 --> 00:40:01.040
If A is a matrix with
independent columns,

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:03.370
what space disappears
in this picture?

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:08.690
The null space goes away.

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:10.450
So the picture is simpler.

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:16.160
But it's still the null
space of A transpose.

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.800
This is still pretty
big, because I only

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.530
had two columns and
a whole lot of rows.

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:24.530
And that's going to
be reflected here.

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:28.520
So what am I trying to say?

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:31.250
I'm trying to say that
this answer is the same

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:33.740
as the pseudo inverse answer.

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:36.590
We could possibly
even check that point.

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:38.210
Let me write it down first.

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:52.160
I claim that the
answer A plus b is

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:58.870
the same as the answer coming
from here, A transpose A,

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:10.710
inverse A transpose b, when
I guess the null space is 0,

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:15.740
the rank is all of n,
whatever you like to say.

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:23.970
I believe that method one, this
two within one quick formula--

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:32.970
so you remember that this was V
sigma plus U transpose, right?

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:35.550
That's what A transpose was.

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:37.250
That this should
agree with this.

00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:49.820
I believe those are the same
when the null space isn't

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:51.380
in the picture.

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:54.920
So the fact that the null
space is just a 0 vector

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:58.700
means that this
inverse does exist.

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:01.400
So this inverse exists.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:07.970
But A A transpose
is not invertible.

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:09.410
Right?

00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:12.200
No inverse.

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:18.170
Because A A transpose
would be coming--

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:20.750
all this is the null
space of A transpose.

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:22.790
So A transpose is
not invertible.

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:30.950
But A transpose A is invertible.

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:34.090
How would you check that?

00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:36.610
You see what I'm--

00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:40.330
it's taken pretty
much the whole hour

00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:46.930
to get a picture of the
geometry of the pseudo inverse.

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:50.790
So this is the pseudo inverse.

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:57.090
And this is-- that
matrix there, it's

00:42:57.090 --> 00:43:00.090
really doing its best
to be the inverse.

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:03.450
In fact, everybody here
is just doing their best

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:04.950
to be the inverse.

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:07.680
Now, how well is
this-- how close

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.420
is that to being the inverse?

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:11.820
Can I just ask you about
that, and then I'll

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:15.870
make this connection, and
then we're out of time.

00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:18.600
How close is that to
being the inverse of A?

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:25.660
Suppose I multiply that
by A. What do I get?

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:26.835
So just notice.

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:38.110
If I multiply that
by A, what do I get?

00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:40.170
I get, yeah?

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:45.480
I get I. Terrific.

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:47.340
But don't be
deceived to thinking

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:51.370
that this is the inverse of
A. It worked on the left side,

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:54.670
but it's not going to be
good on the right hand side.

00:43:54.670 --> 00:44:06.640
So if I multiply A by this
guy in that direction,

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:09.730
I'll get as close to the
identity as I can come,

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:12.250
but I won't get the
identity that way.

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:14.455
So this is just a
little box to say--

00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:19.420
so what's the point I'm making?

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:23.170
I'm claiming that this
is the pseudo inverse.

00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:25.420
Whatever.

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:26.880
Whatever these spaces.

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:30.580
The rank could be
tiny, just one.

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:36.190
This works when the rank is n.

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:38.440
I needed independent columns.

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:40.240
So when the rank is n--

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:44.470
so this is rank equal n.

00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:46.930
That Gauss worked.

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:48.290
Then I can get a--

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:51.500
then it's a one-sided
inverse, but it's not

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:52.730
a two-sided inverse.

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:54.010
I can't do it.

00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:55.940
Look, my matrix there.

00:44:55.940 --> 00:45:01.160
I could find a one-sided inverse
to get the 2 by 2 identity.

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:04.640
But I could never multiply
that by some matrix

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:09.520
and get the n by n identity out
of those two pathetic columns.

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:12.020
OK.

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:14.990
Maybe you feel like
just checking this.

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:16.520
Just takes patience.

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:18.200
What do I mean by checking it?

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:28.940
I mean stick in the pseudo SVD.

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:32.780
Just put it in the SVD
and cancel like crazy.

00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:35.120
And I think that'll pop out.

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.006
Do you believe me?

00:45:38.006 --> 00:45:40.380
Because it's going to
be a little painful.

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:45.707
3 U sigma V transpose, all
transposed, and then something

00:45:45.707 --> 00:45:46.790
there and something there.

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:50.690
I've got nine matrices
multiplying away.

00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:52.400
But it's going to--

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.837
all sorts of things will
produce the identity.

00:45:54.837 --> 00:45:56.420
And in the end,
that's what I'll have.

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:08.420
So this is a one-sided true
inverse, where the SVD--

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:13.960
this fit formula is prepared to
have neither side invertible.

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:16.580
It's still-- we know
what sigma plus means.

00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:18.740
Anyway.

00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:22.910
So under the assumption
of independent columns,

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:27.215
Gauss works and gives the same
answer as the pseudo inverse.

00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:31.347
OK.

00:46:31.347 --> 00:46:31.930
Three minutes.

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:40.380
That's hardly time,
but this being MIT,

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:43.110
I feel I should use it.

00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:44.340
Oh my god.

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:45.075
Number three.

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:49.850
So what's number three about?

00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:57.430
Number three has
the same requirement

00:46:57.430 --> 00:47:02.640
as number two, the same
requirement of no null space.

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:07.590
But it says, if I could get
orthogonal columns first,

00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:11.490
then this problem would be easy.

00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:15.750
So everybody knows that
Gram-Schmidt is a way--

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:22.780
boring way-- to get
from these two columns

00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:26.300
to get two orthogonal columns.

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:28.250
Actually, the whole
idea of Gram-Schmidt

00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:29.900
is already there for 2 by 2.

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:32.840
So I have two minutes,
and we can do it.

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:37.025
Let's do Gram-Schmidt
on these two columns--

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.060
I don't want to use U and V--

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:46.970
column y and z.

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:48.020
OK.

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:50.570
Suppose I want to
orthogonalize those guys.

00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:53.190
What's the Gram-Schmidt idea?

00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:54.210
I take y.

00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:56.160
It's perfectly good.

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.710
No problem with y.

00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:03.160
There is the y
vector, the all 1's.

00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:07.680
Then this guy is not
orthogonal probably to that.

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:11.970
It'll go off in this
direction, with an angle

00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:14.160
that's not 90 degrees.

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.170
So what do I do?

00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:19.680
I want to get
orthogonal vectors.

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:23.520
I'm OK with this first
guy, but the second guy

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.110
isn't orthogonal to the first.

00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:27.430
So what do I do?

00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:30.070
How do I-- in this
picture, how do I come up

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:32.620
with a vector orthogonal to y?

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:36.900
Project.

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:40.630
I take this z, and I
take its projection.

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:43.830
So z has a little piece--

00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:49.020
that z vector has a big piece
already in the direction of y,

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:52.080
which I don't want, and
a piece orthogonal to it.

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.970
That's my other piece.

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:55.020
That's my other piece.

00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:56.830
So here's y.

00:48:56.830 --> 00:49:05.340
And here's the-- that is z minus
projection, let me just say.

00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:06.560
Whatever.

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:07.200
Yeah.

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:09.300
I don't know if I even
drew that picture right.

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:10.290
Probably I didn't.

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:11.040
Anyway.

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:11.890
Whatever.

00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:17.100
The Gram-Schmidt idea
is just orthogonalize

00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:18.730
in the natural way.

00:49:18.730 --> 00:49:21.660
I'll come back to that at
the beginning of next time

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:27.950
and say a word about
the fourth way.

00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:32.330
So this least squares
is not deep learning.

00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:36.350
It's what people
did a century ago

00:49:36.350 --> 00:49:38.730
and continue to do
for good reason.

00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:39.770
OK.

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:43.100
And I'll send out that
announcement about the class,

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:44.840
and you know the
homework, and you know

00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:48.000
the new due date is Friday.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:48.500
Good.

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:50.089
Thank you.
