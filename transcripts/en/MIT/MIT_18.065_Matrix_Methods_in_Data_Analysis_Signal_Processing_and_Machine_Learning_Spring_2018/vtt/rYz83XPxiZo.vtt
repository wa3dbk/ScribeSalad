00:00:22.824 --> 00:00:25.960
PROFESSOR: So this is a big
day mathematically speaking,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.320
because we come to
this key idea, which is

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.000
a little bit like eigenvalues.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.970
Well, a lot like
eigenvalues, but different

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:44.410
because the matrix A now is
more usually rectangular.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.250
So for a rectangular matrix,
the whole idea of eigenvalues

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.160
is shot because if I
multiply A times a vector

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.590
x in n dimensions, out will
come something in m dimensions

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.810
and it's not going
to equal lambda x.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:08.620
So Ax equal lambda x is not even
possible if A is rectangular.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.330
And even if A is square, what
are the problems, just thinking

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.420
for a minute about eigenvalues?

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.950
The case I wrote up
here is the great case

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.790
where I have a symmetric
matrix and then it's

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.720
got a full set of
eigenvalues and eigenvectors

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.360
and they're
orthogonal, all good.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.730
But for a general square
matrix, either the eigenvectors

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.800
are complex--

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.550
eigenvalues are complex
or the eigenvectors

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.870
are not orthogonal.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.410
So we can't stay with
eigenvalues forever.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.000
That's what I'm saying.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.840
And this is the
right thing to do.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.910
So what are these pieces?

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:07.710
So these are the left and these
are the right singular vectors.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.035
So this is the new
word is singular.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.660
And in between go the--

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.790
not the eigenvalues,
but the singular values.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.780
So we've got the
whole point now.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.690
You've got to pick up on this.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.490
There are two sets of
singular vectors, not one.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.540
For eigenvectors, we just
had one set, the Q's.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.690
Now we have a
rectangular matrix,

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.870
we've got one set of left
eigenvectors in m dimensions,

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.630
and we've got another
set of right eigenvectors

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.030
in n dimensions.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.280
And numbers in between
are not eigenvalues,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.700
but singular values.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.770
So these guys are--

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.150
let me write what
that looks like.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.090
This is, again, a diagonal
matrix sigma 2 to sigma r,

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.470
let's say.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.250
So it's again, a diagonal
matrix in the middle.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:26.670
But the numbers on the
diagonal are all positive or 0.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.110
And they're called
singular values.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.920
So it's just a different world.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.940
So really, the first step by
have to do, the math step,

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.550
is to show that
any matrix can be

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:47.630
factored into u times
sigma times v transpose.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.810
So that's the parallel
to the spectral theorem

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.650
that any symmetric matrix
could be factored that way.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.380
So you're good for that part.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:04.230
We just have to do it to see
what are u and sigma and v?

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.280
What are those vectors
and those singular values?

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.810
Let's go.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:16.990
So the key is that A
transpose A is a great matrix.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:24.370
So that's the key to the
math is A transpose A. So

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.650
what are the properties
of A transpose A?

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.970
A is rectangular again.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.710
So maybe m by n A transpose.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.715
So this was m by n.

00:04:36.715 --> 00:04:39.760
And this was n by m.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.500
So we get a result
that's n by n.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.630
And what else can you tell
me about A transpose A?

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.780
It's a metric.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.610
That's a big deal.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.230
And it's square.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.690
And well yeah, you
can tell me more now,

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.690
because we talked
about something,

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.390
a topic that's a little more
than symmetric last time.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.070
The matrix A transpose A
will be positive, definite.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.990
It's eigenvalues are
greater or equal to 0.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.190
And that will mean that we
can take their square roots.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.720
And that's what we will do.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.020
So A transpose A we'll
have a factorization.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.380
It's symmetric.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.200
It'll have a like, a Q
lambda Q transpose, but I'm

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.630
going to call it V lambda--

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.610
no, yeah, lambda-- I'll still
call it lambda V transpose.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.700
So these V's-- what do we know
about eigenvectors of these

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.180
V's or eigenvectors of this guy?

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.030
Square, symmetric,
positive, definite matrix.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.740
So we're in good shape.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.420
And what do we know about the
eigenvalues of A transpose A?

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.380
They are all positive.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.230
So the eigenvalues are--
well, or equal to 0.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.905
And these guys are orthogonal.

00:06:02.905 --> 00:06:04.780
And these guys are
greater or equal to there.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.700
So that's good.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.520
That's one of our--

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.300
We'll depend a lot on that.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.365
But also, you've got
to recognize that A,

00:06:17.365 --> 00:06:24.310
A transpose is a different
guy, A, A transpose.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.300
So what's the shape
of A, A transpose?

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.160
How big is that?

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.180
Now I've got-- what do I have?

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.220
M by n times n by m.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.580
So this will be what size?

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.340
N by m.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:44.370
Different shape but with
the same eigenvalues--

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:45.510
the same eigenvalues.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.210
So it's going to have some other
eigenvectors, u-- of course,

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.752
I'm going to call
them u, because I'm

00:06:49.752 --> 00:06:51.330
going to go in over there.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.140
They'll be the same.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.000
Well, they're saying
yeah, let me--

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.650
I shouldn't-- I have to
say when I say the same,

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.690
I can't quite literally
mean the very same,

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.700
because this has got n
eigenvalues and this has m

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.650
eigenvalues.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.660
But the missing guys, the
ones that are in one of them

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:21.110
and not in the other, depending
on the sizes, are zeros.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:25.670
So really, the heart of the
thing, the non-zero eigenvalues

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:26.290
are the same.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.210
Well actually, I've
pretty much revealed

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.350
what the SVD is going to use.

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:43.520
It's going to use the U's from
here and the V's from here.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.280
But that's the story.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.550
You've got to see that story.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:52.330
So fresh start on the
singular value decomposition.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.110
What are we looking for?

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:56.990
Well, as a factorization--

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:58.030
so we're looking for--

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:12.450
we want A. We want vectors v,
so that when I multiply by v--

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:17.100
so if it was an eigenvector,
it would be Av equal lambda v.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.600
But now for A, it's rectangular.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.530
It hasn't got eigenvectors.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:31.780
So Av is sigma, that the
new singular value times u.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:38.169
That's the first guy and the
second guy and the rth guy.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:42.740
I'll stop at r, the rank.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:43.350
Oh, yeah.

00:08:46.047 --> 00:08:46.880
Is that what I want?

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.740
A-- let me just see.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.200
Av is sigma u.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.570
Yeah, that's good.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:02.750
So this is what takes the
place of Ax equal lambda x.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.200
A times one set of
singular vectors

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.590
gives me a number of times the
other set of singular vectors.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:13.010
And why did I stop
at r the rank?

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.360
Because after that,
the sigmas are 0.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.700
So after that, I could
have some more guys,

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:29.030
but they'll be in the null
space 0 on down to of Vn.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:32.460
So these are the important ones.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.910
So that's what I'm looking for.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.680
Let me say it now in words.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:43.540
I'm looking for a bunch
of orthogonal vectors v

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.330
so that when I
multiply them by A

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.910
I get a bunch of
orthogonal vectors u.

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:53.570
That is not so clearly possible.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.090
But it is possible.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:57.320
It does happen.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.840
I'm looking for one set
of orthogonal vectors

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.960
v in the input
space, you could say,

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:07.850
so that the Av's in the output
space are also orthogonal.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.390
In our picture of
the fundamental--

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:18.560
the big picture
of linear algebra,

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:27.530
we have v's in this space, and
then stuff in the null space.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:34.190
And we have u's over
here in the columns space

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:38.160
and some stuff in the
null space over there.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.840
And the idea is that I
have orthogonal v's here.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.820
And when I multiply by A--

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.920
so multiply by A--

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:54.760
then I get orthogonal u's over
here, orthogonal to orthogonal.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:11:00.260
That's what makes the
V's and they u's special.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.510
Right?

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:03.370
That's the property.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:04.960
And then when we
write down-- well,

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.390
let me write down
what that would mean.

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:11.950
So I've just drawn a
picture to go with this--

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.930
those equations.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:16.610
That picture just goes
with these equations.

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.970
And let me just write
down what it means.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:23.200
It means in matrix--
so I've written it.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:28.653
Oh yeah, I've written it here
in vectors one at a time.

00:11:28.653 --> 00:11:30.070
But of course,
you, know I'm going

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:33.610
to put those vectors into
the columns of a matrix.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:44.380
So A times v1 up to
let's say vr will equal--

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:45.490
oh yeah.

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:47.780
It equals sigma as times u.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:53.420
So this is what I'm
after is u1 up to ur

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:58.400
multiplied by sigma
1 along to sigma r.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:05.540
What I'm doing now
is just to say I'm

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:10.360
converting these
individual singular

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.680
vectors, each v going
into a u to putting them

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.300
all together into a matrix.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:21.670
And of course, what I've written
here is Av equals u sigma,

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:25.300
Av equals u sigma.

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:32.550
That's what that amounts to.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:38.790
Well, then I'm going to put
a v transpose on this side.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:44.520
And I'm going to get to A
equals u sigma v transpose,

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.380
multiplying both sides
there by v transpose.

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.750
I'm kind of writing the same
thing in different forms,

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.155
matrix form, vector
at a time form.

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:01.440
And now we have to find them.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.210
Now I've used up boards
saying what we're after,

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.430
but now we've got to get there.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.335
So what are the v's
and what are the u's?

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:20.700
Well, the cool idea is to
think of A transpose A.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.470
So you're with me
what we're for.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:26.210
And now think about
A transpose A.

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:29.740
So if this is what
I'm hoping for,

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.700
what will A transpose
A turn out to be?

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:41.770
So big moment that's going
to reveal what the v's are.

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:46.000
So if I form A transpose A--

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.080
so A transpose-- so I got
to transpose this guy.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:57.390
So A transpose is V sigma
transpose U transpose, right?

00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:04.670
And then comes A, which is
this, U sigma V transpose.

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:08.040
So why did I do that?

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:12.810
Why is it that A transpose A
is the cool thing to look at

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.550
to make the problem simpler?

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:20.370
Well, what becomes simpler
in that line just written?

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:25.960
U transpose U is the
identity, because I'm looking

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:29.830
for orthogonal, in
fact orthonormal U's.

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:31.240
So that's the identity.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:38.980
So this is V sigma
transpose sigma V transpose.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:42.080
And I'll put parentheses
around that because that's

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.100
a diagonal matrix.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.180
What does that tell me?

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:53.440
What does that tell all of us?

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.840
A transpose A has this form.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.420
Now we've seen that form before.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:01.320
We know that this is a
symmetric matrix, symmetric

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.090
and even positive definite.

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:06.160
So what are the v's?

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:13.860
The v's are the eigenvectors
of A transpose A.

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:20.770
This is the Q lambda Q transpose
for that symmetric matrix.

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:24.360
So we know the v's
are the eigenvectors,

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:32.040
v is the eigenvectors
of A transpose A.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:35.820
I guess we're also going
to get the singular values.

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:41.760
So the sigma transpose sigma,
which will be the sigma squared

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:51.800
are the eigenvalues of
A transpose A. Good!

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:58.190
Sort of by looking for the
correct thing, U sigma V

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:01.790
transpose and then just
using the U transpose U

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:04.640
equal identity, we got
it back to something

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.800
we perfectly recognize.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.430
A transpose A has that form.

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:11.400
So now we know what the V's are.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:17.940
And if I do it the other way,
which, what's the other way?

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.220
Instead of A transpose
A, the other way

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.760
is to look at A, A transpose.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.910
And if I write all
that down, that a

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:32.910
is the U sigma V transpose, and
the A transpose is the V sigma

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:35.230
transpose U transpose.

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:39.030
And again, this stuff
goes away and leaves me

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:45.610
with U sigma, sigma
transpose U transpose.

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:47.990
So I know what the U's are too.

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:53.990
They are eigenvectors
of A, A transpose.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:03.670
Isn't that a beautiful symmetry?

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.940
You just-- A transpose
A and A, A transpose

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.440
are two different guys now.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:13.089
So each has its own
eigenvectors and we use both.

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:15.680
It's just right.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:19.190
And I just have to
take the final step,

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:23.730
and we've established the SVD.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.550
So the final step is to remember
what I'm going for here.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.030
A times a v is supposed
to be a sigma times a u.

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:37.960
See, what I have
to deal with now

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:41.870
is I haven't quite finished.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.020
It's just perfect
as far as it goes,

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:48.710
but it hasn't gone to
the end yet because we

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:51.650
could have double eigenvalues
and triple eigenvalues,

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:56.590
and all those horrible
possibilities.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:18:01.400
And if I have triple eigenvalues
or double eigenvalues,

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.030
then what's the deal
with eigenvectors

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:05.750
if I have double eigenvalues?

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:10.630
Suppose a matrix has
a symmetric matrix,

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.770
has a double eigenvalue.

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:14.610
Let me just take an example.

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:20.950
So symmetric matrix like
say, 1, 1, 5, make it.

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:23.550
Why not?

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.620
What's the deal
with eigenvectors

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:29.510
for that matrix 1, 1, 5?

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.610
So 5 has got an eigenvector.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.720
You can see what it is, 0, 0, 1.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:39.410
What about eigenvectors
that go with lambda equal 1

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:42.440
for that matrix?

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.230
What's up?

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:48.530
What would be eigenvectors
for a lambda equal 1?

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:52.040
Unfortunately, there was
a whole plane of them.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:56.840
Any vector of the form x, y, 0.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:04.220
Any vector in the x, y
plane would produce x, y, 0.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.440
So I have a whole
plane of eigenvectors.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:11.420
And I've got to pick two that
are orthogonal, which I can do.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:12.940
And then they have to be--

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.860
in the SVD those
two orthogonal guys

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:18.420
have to go to two
orthogonal guys.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:23.732
In other words, it's a
little bit of detail here,

00:19:23.732 --> 00:19:28.710
a little getting into
this exactly what is--

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:38.950
well, actually, let
me tell you the steps.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:44.710
So I use this to conclude that
the V's the singular vectors

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:46.270
should be eigenvalues.

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:49.240
I concluded those
guys from this step.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.240
Now I'm not going to
use this step so much.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:57.010
Of course, it's in the back of
my mind but I'm not using it.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:00.820
I'm going to get
the u's from here.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:17.190
So u1 is A v1 over sigma
1 ur is Avr over sigma r.

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:20.330
You see what I'm doing here?

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:28.540
I'm picking in a possible
plane of things the one I want,

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:29.490
the u's I want.

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:31.510
So I've chosen the v's.

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:33.640
I've chosen the sigmas.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:37.750
They were fixed
for A transpose A.

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:40.780
The eigenvectors are
v's, the things--

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:44.770
the eigenvalues
are sigma squared.

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:49.460
And now then this
is the u I want.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.980
Are you with me?

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:56.830
So I want to get
these u's correct.

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.150
And if I have a whole
plane of possibilities,

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:01.890
I got to pick the right one.

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:05.600
And now finally, I have to
show that it's the right one.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:08.970
So what is left to show?

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:14.100
I should show that these u's are
eigenvectors of A, A transpose.

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:21.050
And I should show that
they're orthogonal.

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:22.850
That's the key.

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:27.320
I would like to show that
these are orthogonal.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.420
And that's what goes
in this picture.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.690
The v's-- I've got
orthogonal, guys,

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:36.410
because they're the eigenvectors
of a symmetric matrix.

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:37.850
Pick them orthogonal.

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:40.490
But now I'm multiplying
by A, so I'm

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:46.370
getting the u which is Av over
sigma for the basis vectors.

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:48.290
And I have to show
they're orthogonal.

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:52.490
So this is like
the final moment.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:54.590
Does everything
come together right?

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:02.480
If I've picked the v's as the
eigenvectors of A transpose A,

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:09.420
and then I take these for
the u, are they orthogonal?

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.900
So I would like to think
that we can check that fact

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.550
and that it will come out.

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:18.570
Could you just help
me through this one?

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:23.716
I'll never ask for anything
again, just get the SVD one.

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:37.580
So I would like
to show that u1--

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.250
so let me put up what I'm doing.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:47.610
I'm trying to show that
u1 transpose u2 is 0.

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:49.680
They're orthogonal.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:57.890
So u1 is A v1 over sigma 1.

00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:59.040
That's transpose.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.740
That's u1.

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:06.000
And u2 is A v2 over sigma 2.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.280
And I want to get 0.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:13.560
The whole conversation
is ending right here.

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.866
Why is that thing 0?

00:23:16.866 --> 00:23:19.370
The v's are orthogonal.

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:21.850
We know the v's are orthogonal.

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:25.070
They're orthogonal
eigenvectors of A transpose A.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.580
Let me repeat that.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:36.970
The v's are orthogonal
eigenvectors of A transpose A,

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:40.150
which I know we can find them.

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:42.520
Then I chose the u's to be this.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.920
And I want to get the answer 0.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.470
Are you ready to do it?

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:53.210
We want to compute
that and get 0.

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:56.580
So what do I get?

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:57.680
We just have to do it.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:02.180
So I can see that the
denominator is that.

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:09.030
So is it v1 transpose
A transpose times A v2.

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:17.690
And I'm hoping to get 0.

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:21.060
Do I get 0 here?

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:23.240
You hope so.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.060
v1 is orthogonal v2.

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:28.900
But I've got A transpose A
stuck in the middle there.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:33.210
So what happens here?

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:34.230
How do I look at that?

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:44.960
v2 is an eigenvector of
A transpose A. Terrific!

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:50.670
So this is v1 transpose.

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:54.030
And this is the matrix times v2.

00:24:54.030 --> 00:25:00.420
So that's sigma 2
transpose v2, isn't it?

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:04.050
It's the eigenvector
with eigenvalue sigma

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:07.550
2 squared times v2.

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:10.825
Yeah, divided by
sigma 1 sigma 2.

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:18.000
So the A's are out of there now.

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:25.310
So I've just got these
numbers, sigma 2 squared.

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:28.900
So that would be
sigma 2 over sigma 1--

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:34.660
I've accounted for these numbers
here-- times v1 transpose v2.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:40.810
And now what's up?

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:43.030
They're orthonormal.

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:44.200
We got it.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.610
That's 0.

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:49.020
That is 0 there, yeah.

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:53.710
So not only are the v's
orthogonal to each other,

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:57.490
but because they're eigenvectors
of A transpose A, when

00:25:57.490 --> 00:26:00.460
I do this, I discover
that the Av's

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:06.460
are orthogonal to each other
over in the column space.

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:11.010
So orthogonal v's in the
row space, orthogonal Av's

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:13.110
over in column space.

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:19.260
That was discovered late--
much long after eigenvectors.

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:22.980
And it's a interesting history.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.430
And it just comes out right.

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:30.930
And then it was discovered,
but not much used, for oh,

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:32.670
100 years probably.

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:38.880
And then people saw that it
was exactly the right thing,

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.370
and data matrices
became important, which

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:47.060
are large rectangular matrices.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:48.530
And we have not--

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:52.040
oh, I better say a word, just
a word here about actually

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:58.310
computing the v's and
sigmas and the u's

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:02.030
So how would you
actually find them?

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:05.870
What I most want to
say is you would not

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:09.065
go this A transpose A route.

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:15.750
Why is it like it?

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.300
Is that a big mistake?

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:24.180
If you have a matrix
A, say 5,000 by 10,000,

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:27.480
why is it a mistake
to actually use

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.790
A transpose A in
the computation?

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:33.840
We used it heavily in the proof.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.530
And we could find another proof
that wouldn't use it so much.

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:45.310
But why would I not
multiply these two together?

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:48.320
It's very big, very expensive.

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:55.450
It adds in a whole
lot of round off--

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:57.780
you have a matrix that's now--

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:02.580
its vulnerability to round
off errors is squared--

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.220
that's called its condition
number-- gets squared.

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.560
And you just don't go there.

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:12.330
So the actual computational
methods are quite different.

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:14.770
And we'll talk about those.

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:18.550
But the A transpose
A, because it's

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:24.100
symmetric positive definite,
made the proof so nice.

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:30.640
You've seen the nicest
proof, I'd say, of the--

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.560
Now I should think
about the geometry.

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:38.150
So what does A
equal A for u sigma?

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:45.570
Maybe I take another
board, but it will fill it.

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:49.110
But it's a good U
sigma V transpose.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.190
So it's got three factors there.

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:57.500
And I would like
then each factor

00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.840
is kind of a special matrix.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.980
U and V are orthogonal matrix.

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:05.090
So I think of
those as rotations.

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:07.370
Sigma is a diagonal matrix.

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:09.200
I think of it as stretching.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.310
So now I'm just going
to draw the picture.

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:14.450
So here's unit vectors.

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:22.420
And the first thing--
so if I multiply by x,

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.370
this is the first
thing that happens.

00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:26.530
So that rotates.

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:28.900
So here's x's.

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:31.720
Then V transpose x's.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:35.730
That's still a circle
length and change

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:39.420
for those, when I multiply
by an orthogonal matrix.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:43.670
But the vectors turned.

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:46.250
It's a rotation.

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:49.580
Could be a reflection, but
let's keep it as a rotation.

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:52.250
Now what does sigma do?

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:55.450
So I have this unit circle.

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:56.090
I'm in 2D.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:03.390
So I'm drawing a
picture of the vectors.

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:08.120
These are the unit
vectors in 2D, x,y.

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:12.620
They got turned by
the orthogonal matrix.

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:17.160
What does sigma do
to that picture?

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:20.220
It stretches, because
sigma multiplies

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.500
by sigma 1 in the
first component,

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.120
sigma 2 in the second.

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.130
So it stretches these guys.

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:30.000
And let's suppose this is
number 1 and this is number 2,

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.190
this is number 1 and number 2.

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:36.320
So sigma 1, our
convention is sigma 1--

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.360
we always take sigma 1
greater or equal to sigma 2,

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:43.720
greater or equal whatever,
greater equal, sigma rank.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.530
And they're all positive.

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:51.540
And the rest are 0.

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:53.890
So sigma 1 will be
bigger than sigma 2.

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:58.660
So I'm expecting a
circle goes to an ellipse

00:30:58.660 --> 00:30:59.905
when you stretch--

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:07.480
I didn't get it quite
perfect, but not bad.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:15.250
So this would be sigma
2 v2, sigma 1 v1,

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:17.890
and this would be sigma 2 v2.

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:19.105
And we now have an ellipse.

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:25.190
So we started with
x is in a circle.

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:26.540
We rotated.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:27.560
We stretched.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:31.610
And now the final step
is take these guys

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:33.650
and multiply them by u.

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:38.150
So this was the
sigma V transpose x.

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:42.050
And now I'm ready for the
u part which comes last

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:44.060
because it's at the left.

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:45.200
And what happens?

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.340
What's the picture now?

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.710
What does u do to the ellipse?

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:54.370
It rotates it.

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:56.820
It's another orthogonal matrix.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:59.370
It rotates it
somewhere, maybe there.

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:11.330
And now we see the
u's, u2 and u1.

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:23.980
Well, let me think about that.

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:26.460
Basically, that's
not that's right.

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:34.010
So this SVD is telling us
something quite remarkable

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:36.800
that every linear
transformation,

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:40.040
every matrix
multiplication factors

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:46.020
into a rotation times a stretch
times a different rotation,

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:50.350
but possibly different.

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:55.240
Actually, when would the
u be the same as a v?

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.430
Here's a good question.

00:32:56.430 --> 00:33:00.280
When is u the same as v
when are the two singular

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.030
vectors just the same?

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:03.190
AUDIENCE: A square.

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:06.220
PROFESSOR: Because A
would have to be square.

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:12.340
And we want this to be
the same as Q lambda Q

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:15.730
transpose if they're the same.

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:18.430
So the U's would be
the same as the V's

00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:22.180
when the matrix is symmetric.

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:26.050
And actually we need it
to be positive definite.

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:27.830
Why is that?

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:33.290
Because our convention is these
guys are greater or equal to 0.

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:36.080
It's going to be
the same, then--

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:42.080
so far a positive
definite symmetric matrix,

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:47.740
the S that we started
with is the same

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:50.070
as the A on the next line.

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:55.340
Yeah, the Q is the U, the Q
transpose is the V transpose,

00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:57.780
the lambda is the sigma.

00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:59.520
So those are the good matrices.

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:02.580
And they're the ones that
you can't improve basically.

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:06.300
They're so good you can't make
a positive definite symmetric

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:08.070
matrix better than it is.

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:14.400
Well, maybe diagonalize
it or something, but OK.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:18.239
Now I think of like,
one question here

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:26.830
that helps me anyway to
keep this figure straight,

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:32.820
how I want to count
the parameters

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:38.699
in this factorization.

00:34:38.699 --> 00:34:40.980
So I am 2 by 2.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.199
I'm 2 by 2.

00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:48.110
So A has four
numbers, a, b, c, d.

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:55.510
Then I guess I feel
that four numbers should

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:59.440
appear on the right hand side.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:03.190
Somehow the U and the
sigma and the V transpose

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:06.050
should use up a total
of four numbers.

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:10.780
So we have a counting
match between the left side

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:14.050
that's got four numbers a,
b, c, d, and the right side

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:18.360
that's got four numbers
buried in there somewhere.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:21.690
So how can we dig them out?

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:23.340
How many numbers in sigma?

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:24.900
That's pretty clear.

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:31.462
Two, sigma 1 and sigma 2.

00:35:31.462 --> 00:35:34.560
The two eigenvalues.

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.900
How many numbers
in this rotation?

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:42.340
So if I had a
different color chalk,

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:47.890
I would put 2 for the number of
things I counted for by sigma.

00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:53.520
How many parameters does a
two by two rotation require?

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:54.020
One.

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:56.570
And what's a good
word for that one?

00:35:59.961 --> 00:36:02.740
Is that one parameter?

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:05.380
It's like I have our
cos theta, sine theta,

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:07.000
minus sine theta, cos theta.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.610
There's a number theta.

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:12.230
It's the angle it rotates.

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:18.380
So that's one guy to tell
the rotation angle, two guys

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:25.740
to tell the stretchings, and
one more to tell the rotation

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:29.070
from you, adding up to four.

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:31.620
So those count--
that was a match up

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:35.160
with the four numbers, a,
b, c, d that we start with.

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:39.450
Of course, it's a complicated
relation between those four

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:43.410
numbers and rotations
and stretches,

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:45.320
but it's four
equals four anyway.

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:51.720
And I guess if you
did three by threes--

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:54.390
oh, three by threes.

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:56.400
What would happen then?

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.780
So let me take three.

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:01.180
Do you want to care
for three by threes?

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:04.690
Just, it's sort of satisfying
to get four equal four.

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:07.590
But now what do we
get three by three?

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:13.050
We got how many numbers here?

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:13.550
Nine.

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.915
So where are those nine numbers?

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:24.420
How many here?

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:26.850
That's usually the easy--

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:28.470
three.

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:33.310
So what's your guess for
the how many in a rotation?

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:38.490
And a 3D rotation, you take
a sphere and you rotate it.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:42.570
How many how many numbers
to tell you what's what--

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:44.410
to tell you what you did?

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:44.910
Three.

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:45.930
We hope three.

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:51.900
Yeah, it's going to be three,
three, and three for the three

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:53.520
dimensional world
that we live in.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:38:00.300
So people who do rotations for a
living understand that rotation

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.378
in 3D, but how do you see this?

00:38:02.378 --> 00:38:03.670
AUDIENCE: Roll, pitch, and yaw.

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:04.390
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:05.280
AUDIENCE: Roll, pitch and yaw.

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.750
PROFESSOR: Roll, pitch, and yaw.

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:07.740
That sounds good.

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:11.040
I mean, it's three words
and we've got it, right?

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:11.970
OK, yeah.

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:13.270
Roll, pitch and yaw.

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:19.030
Yeah, I guess a pilot hopefully,
knows about those three.

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:21.310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:22.260
Which is roll?

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.030
When you are like
forward and back?

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:29.280
Does anybody, anybody?

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.840
Roll, pitch, and yaw?

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:35.415
AUDIENCE: Pitch is
the up and down one.

00:38:35.415 --> 00:38:37.140
PROFESSOR: Pitch is
the up and down one.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:37.640
OK.

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:41.550
AUDIENCE: Roll is like,
think of a barrel roll.

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:43.305
And yaw is your
side-to-side motion.

00:38:43.305 --> 00:38:46.980
PROFESSOR: Oh, yaw, you
stay in a plane and you--

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:48.270
OK, beautiful.

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:50.040
Right, right.

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:54.030
And that leads us to our
four-- four dimensions.

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:57.090
What's your guess on 4D?

00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:59.130
Well, we could do
the count again.

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:02.670
If it was 4 by 4, we would
have 16 numbers there.

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:06.060
And in the middle, we always
have an easy time with that.

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:07.890
That would be 4.

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:10.620
So we've got 12
left to share out.

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:13.110
So six somehow-- six--

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:17.720
six angles in four dimensions.

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.220
Well, we'll leave it there.

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:21.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:23.210
OK.

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:27.330
So there is the SVD
but without an example.

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:30.990
Examples, you know, I would
have to compute A transpose A

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:32.220
and find it.

00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:35.010
So the text will do that--

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:37.690
does it for a particular matrix.

00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:39.930
Oh!

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:43.740
Yeah, the text does it
for a matrix 3, 4, 0,

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:48.260
5 that came out pretty well.

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:50.810
A few facts we
could learn though.

00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:54.890
So if I multiply all
the eigenvalues together

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:58.160
for a matrix A, what do I get?

00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:59.850
I get the determinant.

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:04.430
What if I multiply the
singular values together?

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:06.170
Well again, I get
the determinant.

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:10.190
You can see it right away
from the big formula.

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:15.000
Take determinant--
take determinant.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.220
Well, assuming the
matrix A is square.

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:18.990
So it's got a determinant.

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:21.990
Then I take determinant
of this product.

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:24.660
I can take the
separate determinants.

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:29.890
That has determinant
equal to one.

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:39.120
An orthogonal matrix,
the determinant is one.

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:40.960
And similarly, here.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:45.710
So the product of the sigmas
is also the determinant.

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:46.240
Yeah.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.410
Yeah, so the product of the
sigmas is also the determinant.

00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:52.130
The product of the
sigmas here will be 15.

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:59.960
But you'll find that sigma
one is smaller than lambda 1.

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:02.650
So here are the
eigenvalues, lambda 1

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:06.630
less or equal to lambda 2, say.

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:12.380
But the singular values
are outside them.

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:13.040
Yeah.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.930
But they still multiply.

00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:19.730
Sigma 1 times sigma
2 will still be 15.

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:22.770
And that's the same as
lambda 1 times lambda 2.

00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:23.270
Yeah.

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:31.930
But overall, computing
the examples of the SVD

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:35.510
take more time because--

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:40.270
well, yeah, you just compute
A transpose A and you've got

00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:40.930
the v's.

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:42.820
And you're on your way.

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:47.560
And you have to take the
square root of the eigenvalues.

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:54.390
So that's the SVD as
a piece of pure math.

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:58.170
But of course, what we'll do
next time starting right away

00:41:58.170 --> 00:42:01.010
is use SVD.

00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:04.540
And let me tell you
even today, the most--

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:11.910
yeah, yeah most important
pieces of the SVD.

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:14.300
So what do I mean by
pieces of the SVD?

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.860
I've got one more blackboard
still to write on.

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:18.200
So here we go.

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:30.380
So let me write out A is
the u's times the sigmas--

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:35.300
sigmas 1 to r times the v's--

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:39.540
v transpose v1 transpose
down to vr transpose.

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:43.240
So those are across.

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:43.790
Yeah.

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:48.940
Actually what I've
written here--

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:57.130
so you could say there
is a big economies.

00:42:57.130 --> 00:43:01.400
There is a smaller size SVD
that has the real stuff that

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:02.720
really counts.

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:07.220
And then there's a larger SVD
that has a whole lot of zeros.

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:10.415
So this it would be the
smaller one, m by r.

00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:15.410
This would be r by r.

00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:17.570
And these would all be positive.

00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:19.430
And this would be r by n.

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:29.720
So that's only using
the r non-zeros.

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:33.360
All these guys are
greater than zero.

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:37.590
Then the other one
we could fill out

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:43.882
to get a square
orthogonal matrix,

00:43:43.882 --> 00:43:52.060
the sigmas and square v's v1
transpose to vn transpose.

00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:54.000
So what are the shapes now?

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.030
This shape is m by m.

00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:59.370
It's a proper orthogonal matrix.

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:01.680
This one also n by n.

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.740
So this guy has to be--
this is the sigma now.

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:07.280
So it has to be what size?

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.220
m by m.

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:10.800
That's the remaining space.

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:17.460
So it starts with the sigmas,
and then it's all zeros,

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:19.140
accounting for null space stuff.

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:23.630
Yeah.

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:29.130
So you should really see
that these two are possible.

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:34.100
That all these zeros
when you multiply out,

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:37.010
just give nothing, so
that really the only thing

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:41.250
that non-zero is in these bits.

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:43.080
But there is a complete one.

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:49.405
So what are these extra u's
that are in the null space of A,

00:44:49.405 --> 00:44:51.970
A transpose or A transpose A?

00:44:51.970 --> 00:44:57.290
Yeah, so two sizes, the large
size and the small size.

00:44:57.290 --> 00:45:03.500
But then the things that
count are all in there.

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.820
OK.

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:09.940
So I was going to
do one more thing.

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:13.140
Let me see what it was.

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:21.130
So this is section
1.8 of the notes.

00:45:21.130 --> 00:45:25.350
And you'll see examples there.

00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:33.440
And you'll see a second
approach to the finding the u's

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:36.700
and v's and sigmas.

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:38.200
I can tell you what that is.

00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:47.380
But maybe with just do
something nice at the end,

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:57.380
let me tell you about another
factorization of A that's

00:45:57.380 --> 00:46:09.260
famous in engineering, and
it's famous in geometry.

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:12.740
So this is NEA is a
U sigma V transpose.

00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:14.070
We've got that.

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:17.120
Now the other one
that I'm thinking of,

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.450
I'll tell you its name.

00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:23.075
It's called the polar
decomposition of a matrix.

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:31.400
And all I want you to see
is that it's virtually here.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.160
So a polar means--

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:37.310
what's polar in--
for a complex number,

00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:40.990
what's the polar form
of a complex number?

00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:42.280
AUDIENCE: e to the i theta.

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:44.990
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's e
to the i theta times r.

00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:46.010
Yeah.

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:49.100
A real guy-- so
the real guy r will

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:52.490
translate into a symmetric guy.

00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:55.190
And the e to the i theta
will translate into--

00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:02.510
what kind of a matrix reminds
you of e to the i theta?

00:47:02.635 --> 00:47:03.510
AUDIENCE: Orthogonal.

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:06.650
PROFESSOR: Orthogonal, size 1.

00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:08.022
So orthogonal.

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:14.460
So that's a very,
very kind of nice.

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:18.750
Every matrix factors
into a symmetric matrix

00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:20.830
times an orthogonal matrix.

00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:26.790
And I of course, describe these
as the most important classes

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:27.600
of matrices.

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:33.380
And here, we're saying every
matrix is a S times a Q.

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:37.220
And I'm also saying that
I can get that quickly out

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:39.410
of the SVD.

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:43.210
So I'm just want to do it.

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:47.190
So I want to find an S
and find a Q out of this.

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:49.200
So to get an S--

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.550
So let me just start it.

00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:55.350
U sigma-- but now
I'm looking for an S.

00:47:55.350 --> 00:47:59.530
So what shall I put in now?

00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:02.710
I better put in--

00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:04.950
if I've got to U
sigma something,

00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:06.860
and I want it to
be a symmetric, I

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:13.860
should put in U
transpose would do it.

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:15.600
But then if I put
it in U transpose,

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:20.970
I've got to put it in U.
So now I've got U sigma.

00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:22.560
U transpose U is the identity.

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:26.470
Then I've got to
get V transpose.

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:30.490
And have I got what
the polar decomposition

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:35.080
is asking for in this line?

00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.300
So, yeah.

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:38.220
What have I got here?

00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:41.570
Where's the where's
the S in this?

00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:46.460
So you see, I took the SVD and I
just put the identity in there,

00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:48.080
just shifted things a little.

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:50.860
And now where's the S
that I can read off?

00:48:55.360 --> 00:49:01.100
For three, that's an S.
That's a symmetric matrix.

00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:02.420
And where's the Q?

00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:06.020
Well, I guess we can see
where the Q has to be.

00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:11.060
It's here, yeah.

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:14.000
Yeah, so just by
sticking U transpose U

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.120
and putting the
parentheses right,

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:23.860
I recover that decomposition
of a matrix, which

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:27.910
in mechanical engineering
language, is language

00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:32.530
tells me that any
strain can be--

00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:36.460
which is like stretching
of elastic thing,

00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:48.160
has a symmetric kind of a
stretch and a internal twist.

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:50.320
Yeah.

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:51.970
So that's good.

00:49:51.970 --> 00:50:00.130
Well, this was a 3, 6, 9
boards filled with matrices.

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:02.840
Well, it is 18 0, 6, 5.

00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:04.630
So maybe that's all right.

00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:11.890
But the idea is to use
them on a matrix of data.

00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:16.230
And I'll just tell
you the key fact.

00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:27.240
The key fact-- if I have
a big matrix of data, A,

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:30.000
and if I want to pull
out of that matrix

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.790
the important part,
so that's what

00:50:33.790 --> 00:50:36.280
data science has to be doing.

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:42.340
Out of a big matrix, some part
of it is noise, some part of it

00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:43.510
is signal.

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:46.060
I'm looking for the most
important part of the signal

00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:46.840
here.

00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:49.240
So I'm looking for the most
important part of the matrix.

00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:57.420
In a way, the biggest
numbers, but of course,

00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:00.810
I don't look at
individual numbers.

00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:04.950
So what's the biggest
part of the matrix?

00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:06.930
What are the
principal components?

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:08.700
Now we're really getting in--

00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:13.140
it could be data.

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:15.060
And we want to do
statistics, or we

00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:18.120
want to see what has
high variance, what

00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:24.240
has low variance, we'll do these
connections with statistics.

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:26.950
But what's the important
part of the matrix?

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:33.130
Well, let me look at
U sigma V transpose.

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:37.600
Here, yeah, let me look at it.

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:43.900
So what's the one most
important part of that matrix?

00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:44.950
The right one?

00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:46.430
It's a rank one piece.

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:50.750
So when I say a part, of course
it's going to be a matrix part.

00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:52.900
So the simple matrix
building block

00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:57.850
is like a rank one matrix, a
something, something transpose.

00:51:57.850 --> 00:52:00.550
And what should I
pull out of that

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:02.890
as being the most
important rank one

00:52:02.890 --> 00:52:06.230
matrix that's in that product?

00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:09.890
So I'll erase the
1.8 while you think

00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:16.640
what do I do to pick out the big
deal, the thing that the data

00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:19.200
is telling me first.

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:24.360
Well, these are orthonormal.

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:26.740
No one is bigger
than another one.

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:29.580
These are orthonormal, no one
is bigger than another one.

00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:35.130
But here, I look here, which
is the most important number?

00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:37.200
Sigma 1.

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:37.880
Sigma 1.

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:41.930
So the part I pick out is
this biggest number times

00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:45.080
it's row times it's column.

00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:55.220
So it's u 1 sigma 1 v1 transpose
is the top principal part

00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:57.320
of the matrix A.
It's the leading

00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:01.700
part of the matrix A.
It's the biggest rank one

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:04.040
part of the matrix is there.

00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:07.580
So computing those three
guys is the first step

00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:10.080
to understanding the data.

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:10.580
Yeah.

00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:12.920
So that's what's
coming next is--

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:17.230
and I guess tomorrow,
since they moved--

00:53:17.230 --> 00:53:24.410
MIT declared Tuesday
to be Monday.

00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:25.860
They didn't change Wednesday.

00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:32.450
So I'll see you tomorrow for
the principal components.

00:53:32.450 --> 00:53:34.000
Good.
