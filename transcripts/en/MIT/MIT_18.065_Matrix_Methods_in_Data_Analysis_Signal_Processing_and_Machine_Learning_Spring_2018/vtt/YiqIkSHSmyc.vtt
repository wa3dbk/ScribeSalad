00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.130
GILBERT STRANG: Shall we start?

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.780
Let me just say, this is
a great adventure for me

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.900
to be here all on my own,
teaching a course that

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.400
involves learning from data.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.450
So it's an exciting subject,
and a lot of linear algebra

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.290
goes into it.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.350
So it's a second course
on linear algebra.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.900
Can I just-- so there is a
Stellar site established,

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.770
and that will be the
basic thing that we use.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.470
This is a public site--

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.310
math.mit.edu/learningfromdata.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:11.630
So a book is coming pretty
quickly as we speak,

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:20.410
or after we speak, and that
site has the table of contents

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.140
of the book, which would
give you an idea of what

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.580
could be in the course.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.480
And I printed out a copy for
everybody just of that one

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.980
page.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.340
This is probably the final--

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.820
first and last handout--

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.780
maybe-- with a
table of contents,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.930
which you'll see there.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.050
And also, you'll see there
the first two sections

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.820
of the book, which is
what I'll talk about today

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.830
and a little bit into Friday.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.400
So that's linear algebra, of
course, because the course

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.820
begins with linear algebra--

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.640
actually, things that you
would know from 18.06,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.310
but this is a way to say this
is really important stuff.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.820
So that's what I'll do today.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.410
I'd like to start on the
linear algebra today.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.205
Here's a great fact
about the course.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.830
So we taught it last
year, several of us

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.840
together, and we knew there
wouldn't be a final exam,

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.580
but we imagined there might
be quizzes along the way.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.610
But then we couldn't think of
anything to put on the quizzes.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.590
So we canceled those.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.930
But you do we learn
a lot, nevertheless.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.410
And so I guess we base the
grades on the homeworks.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.140
So the homeworks will be
partly linear algebra questions

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.990
and partly online, like
recognizing handwriting,

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.880
stitching images together,
many other things.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.330
And I'll talk about
those as we go.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.980
Good.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.710
So that's the general picture.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.310
And I'll say more
about it today.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.140
And I could answer
any question about it.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.740
So we're getting videotaped.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.990
So if anybody's bashful,
sit in the far back.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.860
But it'll be fun.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.430
You may know the
videos for 18.06.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.270
So this is the
next step, 18.065.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.170
It's pretty exciting for me.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.210
So any question, or
shall I do a little math?

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.990
Why not?

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:53.620
And then I'll say a little
more about the course,

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.610
just so you have an
idea of what's ahead.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.910
And it looks like this room is
exactly the right size to me,

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.140
so I'm pleased.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.210
So what's the deal
in linear algebra?

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.970
Forgive me if I
start with what I

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.730
do the very first day
in 18.06, which is

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.770
multiply a matrix by a vector.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.290
And then I'll graduate
to multiplying a matrix

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.410
by a matrix.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.640
And you will say,
I know that stuff.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.500
But do you know
it the right way?

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.660
Do you think of the
multiplication the right way?

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.320
So let me tell you what I
believe to be the right way.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:56.190
So let me take a matrix, say,
2, 3, 5, 1, 1, 7, and 3, 4, 12.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.470
And I'll always call matrices A.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.750
So first step is just A
times x, A times a vector.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.640
So I multiply A by,
let's say, x1, x2, x3.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.310
And how do I look
at that answer?

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.020
So the choices-- think
of the rows of the matrix

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.440
or think of the columns.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.110
And if you think
of the rows, which

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.690
is the standard way to multiply,
you would take the dot product.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:43.280
So the first way is dot
products of row dotted with x.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.200
2x1 plus x2 plus 3x3.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.330
It gives you the answer
a component at a time.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.630
That's the low level way.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.140
The good way to see
it is vector-wise.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:08.690
See this as x1 multiplies
that first column, x2 times

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:14.360
the second column,
1, 1, 7, and x3 times

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.530
the third column, 3, 4, 12.

00:06:21.994 --> 00:06:24.480
Good.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.750
So it's a combination
of vectors,

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.740
and of course, it
produces a vector.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.800
And here, we have a 3 by
3 matrix on our vectors

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.960
are in R3.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.100
And most vectors will be in
R3 or Rn for this course.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.400
So that's the right answer.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.430
And of course, the
first component

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.950
is 2x1 and 1x2 and 3x3.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.510
The same 2, 1, 3-- the same dot
product, it comes out right.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.920
But you see it all at
once instead of piecemeal.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.860
Part of the course--

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.740
I guess part of what
I hope to get across

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:11.590
is thinking of a matrix
as a whole thing,

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.270
not just a bunch of nine
or m times n numbers.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:19.280
But thinking of it as a thing.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:25.020
A matrix multiplies a vector
to give another vector.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:32.040
So when I say Ax, you
immediately think that--

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.580
you immediately think, OK,
Ax has a clear meaning,

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.310
it's a combination
of the columns of A.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:44.530
So now let me take
that next step.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:49.540
And the next step is think
about all combinations

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.645
of the columns of A.
We take the matrix A,

00:07:52.645 --> 00:07:57.670
and we take all x's and we
imagine all the outputs.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.330
And what I want to ask you
is, what does that look like?

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:06.070
If I just take 1 vector
x, I get a vector output.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:08.410
It takes a vector to a vector.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.990
But now I take all x's--

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:17.060
all of vectors x in 3D and
I get all these answers,

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.435
and I think of
them all together.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.390
So I've got a bunch of vectors--

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.940
infinitely many
vectors, actually.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.290
And the question is, if I plot
those infinitely many vectors,

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.179
what do I have?

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:35.480
And the beauty of linear algebra
is that questions like this--

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:40.429
you can answer them and
you intuitively see it.

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:45.680
You certainly see it in 3D
and you have the right idea

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.620
in 10 dimensions, even.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.290
Most of us don't see
too well in 10d--

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:53.090
in R10.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:54.740
But here we got three.

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:58.850
So do you see what I'm saying?

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:00.950
I'm taking all x's.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:09.800
So all Ax gives us a
big bunch of vectors.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.400
And that collection
of vectors is

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:20.460
called the column space of A.
It's a space, in other words.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.412
That's the key word there,
the column space of A.

00:09:23.412 --> 00:09:29.900
And I'll just write it as C of
A when I need letters for it.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.540
So I'm going to ask you,
what does this column space

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.190
look like?

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.650
And that depends on the matrix.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:41.230
Sometimes that column space
would be the whole of R3.

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:47.070
Sometimes it's a smaller
set in R3, a space.

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:48.700
Do you know what
it is in this case?

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:53.110
Do I get all of 3D
out of these guys

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:57.380
by choosing all
x1 and x2 and x3?

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:01.090
It seems like if it
was a random matrix,

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:04.010
the answer would
be, surely, yes.

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:07.720
If a random three
by three matrix is--

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.390
it's column space is going
to be all of our three,

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:13.050
its columns are going
to be independent,

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.990
its rows are going
to be independent,

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.890
it's going to be invertible,
it's going to be great.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:19.420
But is this matrix--

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.930
what's up with that matrix?

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.210
No, it's not.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:28.560
So what do I get
instead of all of R3?

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.390
I get a plane, yeah.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:32.910
If you get that insight.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:35.280
So by taking x's--

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.170
everybody's with
me-- all x's here.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:42.460
So that means that
it fills in whatever.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.250
And, well, because
it's linear algebra,

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:52.960
it's going to be likely all of
R3 or a plane, or even a line.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.390
Let me just bat over
here for a moment.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:11:03.650
Give me a matrix whose column
space would only be a line.

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:04.780
All 1s?

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:05.300
OK.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:09.500
Wow, that's a-- let me
liven it up a little.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:14.180
3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8.

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:21.410
So I think that the
combinations of those columns

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:23.870
are all on the same line.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:27.800
That says that the column
space is just a line.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.220
And I would say then
that the matrix--

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:34.520
so column space of
this A is a line.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:38.930
Another way I could say this
is that the rank of the matrix

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.450
is 1.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:45.470
The rank is sort of the
dimension of the column space.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.180
Well, not sort,
that's what it is.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.430
The rank is the
dimension of the column--

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:51.530
everybody sees that
you get a line?

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:54.410
Because any combination
x1 of that plus x2

00:11:54.410 --> 00:12:00.150
of that plus x3 of that is
going to go along that line.

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.050
Here's the first column,
here's the second column.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:04.580
They're all on a line.

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:07.070
So I'll never get off that line.

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:10.470
If I allow all x's,
I'll get the whole line.

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:14.070
Now here, you said not a line.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:18.410
What was the column
space for this guy?

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:19.730
Plane.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:23.130
Now, why isn't it all of R3?

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.860
What do you see
that's special there--

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.050
because it is special--

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:34.350
that's making the column
space special, a plane instead

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:35.820
of the whole thing?

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.430
Yeah, what's up with
these three columns?

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.820
AUDIENCE: The third
column is the sum of it.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:46.160
GILBERT STRANG: The third
column is the sum of these two.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.660
So the first column
is fine, 2, 3, 5.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.210
Second column is in a
different direction.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:55.190
And when I take combinations
of the first two columns,

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:57.200
what will I get?

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.900
Sorry to keep asking you
questions, but that's--

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.960
anyway, that's what I always do.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.470
So the combinations of those
first two columns are--?

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:11.420
AUDIENCE: A plane.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.170
GILBERT STRANG: A
plane because they're

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:15.790
in different-- everybody
sees that picture.

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:18.960
We've got column one going
that way and column two

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:19.630
going that way.

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:22.500
And then if I take any
multiple of column one,

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.890
I've got a whole line, any
multiple of column two.

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:27.840
And then when I put
the two together,

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:32.940
it fills in the plane.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:33.440
Yeah.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.910
Your intuition
says that's right.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:38.640
So this is a matrix of rank.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.350
What's the rank of this matrix?

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:41.240
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.030
GILBERT STRANG: Two.

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:45.550
Because it's got two
independent columns,

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:47.800
but the third
column is dependent.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.510
The third column is a
combination of the others.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:56.620
So matrices like this are
really the building blocks

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.290
of linear algebra, they're
the building blocks

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:00.930
of data science.

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.100
They're rank one matrices.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:07.390
And let me show you a special
way to write those rank one

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:10.010
matrices.

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:15.100
I think of this matrix as
the column vector 1, 1,

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:19.720
1 times the row vector 1, 3, 8.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.050
So it's a column times a row.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.640
That's a rank one matrix.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.850
Do you see-- that's a
true multiplication there.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:35.960
It looks a little weird, but
it's a 3 by 1 matrix times a 1

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.580
by 3 matrix.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.350
These numbers have
to be the same,

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.110
and then the output is 3 by 3.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:43.020
And it's that.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.780
And do you see that it factors?

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.820
So I'm going to move
on to that idea.

00:14:51.820 --> 00:15:01.600
The next idea coming up
will be that we can see--

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:06.570
well, that's coming, that
we're going to see matrices

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:08.950
with two factors.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:13.630
Let me move to that, but back
for this original matrix.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.380
So what's with this?

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.860
The column space is a plane.

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:30.110
Think about now the key
idea of independent columns.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:33.777
How many independent
columns have I got here?

00:15:33.777 --> 00:15:34.360
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.740
GILBERT STRANG: Two, correct.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:36.970
Two.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:41.290
The third column, if I want to
especially pick on that one--

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:42.850
I'll often go left to right.

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:46.230
So I'll say the first guy
is good, second guy is good,

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:51.080
the third guy is not
independent of the others.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.290
So I just have two
independent columns.

00:15:54.290 --> 00:16:01.080
And those two columns would be
a basis for the column space.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.280
So that's the critical
idea of linear algebra.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.160
That's what you compute
when you find a basis,

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.910
and everything in
the column space

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:14.780
is a combination of these,
including that is also--

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.430
that's already a
combination of those.

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:18.920
But everything else
in the column space

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.010
is a combination of those two.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:23.600
So they're a basis for it.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:31.060
So you have the
idea of A times x.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.090
You have the idea of
column space of A,

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:36.470
which allows all x's.

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:43.990
Then now, we're moving into the
idea of independent columns,

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:48.230
and the number of independent
columns is the rank.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:51.640
So the rank-- shall I
write that somewhere?

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.630
Maybe here.

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:55.765
The rank is the number
of independent columns.

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:04.880
And right now, what do I
mean by independent columns?

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:10.730
Well, let's just see what
that means by using it.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:11.720
Are we good?

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.520
I know I'm reviewing here.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:19.690
But allow me for this first
class and part of next time

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:20.589
also to review.

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:21.970
But you'll see something new.

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.220
In fact, why don't we see
something new right away.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:32.520
Let me follow up on the
idea of independence

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.900
in a systematic way.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:41.370
So here's my matrix A.
Can I write that again?

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:50.430
2, 3, 5, 1, 1, 7, and this
guy was the sum of those.

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.970
So that's my matrix A.

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:59.520
So let's start from scratch
and find a basis for the column

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.670
space in the most natural way.

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:05.760
So I'm going to take a basis--

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.500
what's a basis?

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:13.270
A basis is independent columns.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:16.840
So all three together
would not be a basis.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.170
But they have to be
not just independent,

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:23.290
but they have to fill the
space-- their combinations have

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:24.760
to fill the space.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.580
So 2, 3, 5--

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.860
let's say I want
to create a basis.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:35.080
I'll call the matrix C, a
basis for the column space.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.460
So here's a natural
way to do it.

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:38.620
I look at the first column.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:42.370
It's not 0s.

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:45.925
If it was all 0s, I wouldn't
want that in a basis.

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:49.760
But it's not.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.530
So I put it in.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:55.930
So that's the first
vector in my basis.

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:59.130
Then I go on to
the second column.

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:04.780
If that column was 4,
6, 10, what would I do?

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:07.040
If that second
column was 4, 6, 10,

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.084
would I put it in the basis?

00:19:09.084 --> 00:19:11.060
No.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.100
But 1, 1, 7, is OK, right?

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:15.390
1, 1, 7 is in a
different direction.

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:18.380
It's not a combination of
what we've already got.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.980
So I say, OK, that
adds something new.

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.500
Put it in.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.590
Then I move on to
the third column.

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:29.730
Do I put that into a basis?

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:31.110
You know the answer by now.

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:32.130
No.

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:37.140
Because I'm looking to see, is
it a combination of these guys?

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.640
And it is.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.650
It's one of that
plus one of that.

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:42.120
So it's not independent.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.730
So I've finished now.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:51.974
I've got a matrix C, which
was taken directly from A,

00:19:51.974 --> 00:19:55.100
and I kept only
independent columns

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:58.360
and I worked from left to right.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:02.230
And I can see that right away
now that the rank is two--

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:06.350
the column rank, I should
say-- the column rank.

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:08.490
The number of independent
columns is two.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.220
Good?

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.830
Now comes the key step.

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:26.790
I'm going to produce
a third matrix, R,

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:32.090
which is going to tell me
how to get these columns

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:35.160
from these columns.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.290
And its shape is going to be--

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:40.140
well, its shape-- I
don't have any choice.

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:45.960
This is three by two, so Rx
would be two by something.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.840
So I'm like so.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.360
I guess it has to be two by
three because I want to come

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.230
out this way, two by three.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:57.670
What am I going to do here?

00:20:57.670 --> 00:20:59.310
I'm just going to
put it in the numbers

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:00.555
R that make this correct.

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:07.600
So this is a first
matrix factorization.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.510
It's not-- well, it is
a famous one, actually.

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:14.930
When we see it, we'll
recognize what it is.

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:17.850
It's famous in teaching
linear algebra,

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:22.210
but now, actually, C times
R, columns times rows

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:28.120
has become very, very
important in large scale

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.490
numerical linear algebra.

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:38.610
So let's figure out
what goes into R.

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:40.560
What am I thinking here?

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.940
I'm putting in R. So
every one of these columns

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.350
is a combination of these.

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:48.300
That's the whole point.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:52.080
And I'm just going to put in
the numbers that you need.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.960
So what goes in the
first column of R?

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.300
What goes in the
first column of R?

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.460
So I want to look,
what combination

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:03.450
of that column and that
column gives me this one?

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:03.950
Yeah?

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:04.795
AUDIENCE: 1, 0.

00:22:04.795 --> 00:22:05.670
GILBERT STRANG: 1, 0.

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:16.750
Because you remember how we
multiply a matrix by a vector?

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:18.860
When I multiply that
matrix by that vector,

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:21.410
I take one of this
plus zero of that.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:25.580
I see it vector-wise, and
of course I get it right.

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:28.460
And what about the
second column of R?

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:30.980
So the second column
should be the combination

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:34.820
that produces the second
column of A correctly.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:35.720
What will that be?

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:36.415
AUDIENCE: 0, 1.

00:22:36.415 --> 00:22:37.290
GILBERT STRANG: 0, 1.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:39.570
Thanks.

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:41.736
And finally the third column?

00:22:41.736 --> 00:22:42.650
AUDIENCE: 1, 1.

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:44.040
GILBERT STRANG: 1, 1.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.570
Yes, right.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:50.690
Because one of this plus one of
this produces the third column.

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:54.000
So all I did was put in the
right numbers there, really.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:07.070
And this is correct now.

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:12.380
A is C times R. And so this is--

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:15.590
what I've done here
is the first two pages

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:20.395
of section 1.1 in these notes.

00:23:20.395 --> 00:23:25.900
So 1.1.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.600
And actually, I'll
tell you literally

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.980
what happened earlier this year.

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.510
I had finished this.

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:38.830
I wrote this down with
a different example.

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:44.290
And then I realized
something, that sitting here

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:48.850
in front of me was the
first great theorem

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:55.030
in linear algebra, the fact that
the column rank equals the row

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.700
rank.

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:03.980
The fact that if I
have a matrix where

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.750
that column plus that
column gives that one.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:07.250
Oh.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.120
So what am I going to say here?

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.920
I'm getting nervous about it.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:20.070
I believe that a combination
of the rows gives 0.

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:21.570
Do you believe that?

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:22.830
You've got to believe it.

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:24.120
This is linear algebra.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:28.410
The matrix is not
invertible, it's square.

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:32.020
But the columns are dependent.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:34.800
So the rows have
to be dependent.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:38.230
And I don't exactly see--

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.280
there's some combination
of that row and that row

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.080
that gives that one.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.390
And of course, when I
looked at the first column,

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:49.980
I thought, OK, it's
going to be too easy.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.810
One of that and one
of that gives that.

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:55.320
But then my eye went over
to the second column,

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.850
and I realized it's
not easy at all.

00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:03.810
So you're entitled to pull out
your phone and figure this out.

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:06.894
But there is some damn
combination of those--

00:25:06.894 --> 00:25:08.136
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:08.136 --> 00:25:11.220
--of those two rows that
gives the third row.

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:13.900
Otherwise, the course
is over, we stop.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.580
Well, and maybe we're
going to find somehow.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.050
So this is the theorem.

00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:30.880
So I have to tell you,
I was really pleased.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.450
So the first two pages
got two more pages

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:36.910
to follow up on that
idea, that here, we

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:38.710
were seeing something that--

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:45.400
I proved in 18.06, but not
in the first lecture, that's

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:49.330
for sure, and not
maybe so clearly.

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:54.310
But now I can try to prove it.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:56.890
There won't be a lot of
proofs in this class,

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:59.650
but this is such
an important fact--

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:02.590
A equals CR is an
important factorization.

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:06.730
And out of it, we
can connect them.

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:08.650
So what am I saying?

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:12.445
I am saying that all--

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:18.550
so what's the row rank?

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:20.110
I have to back up here.

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:22.690
What's the row rank?

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:24.160
What's the row space?

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:29.740
So the row rank is going to be
the dimension of that space.

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:33.040
So I look at my matrix A.
What's the row space of A?

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.590
I'm going to look at its rows.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:42.760
Now, maybe just so we
don't get whole new letters

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:43.750
for the row space--

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:52.540
for me, the row space
of A of a matrix--

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:56.180
so first of all, tell
me in words what it is.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:59.072
What's the row
space of the matrix?

00:26:59.072 --> 00:27:00.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:04.960
GILBERT STRANG: All
combinations of the rows.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:09.520
All combinations of the
rows, that's the space.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:13.960
So I would take all
combinations of those rows.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.930
To get combinations
of the rows--

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:19.630
well, two ways I can get
combinations of the rows.

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:25.250
And the way I'll do it is,
I'll just transpose the matrix.

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:27.730
So those rows become
columns, and then I'm

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:29.770
back to what I did.

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:36.850
So the row space of A is the
column space of A transpose.

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:38.920
And this has the
advantage that we

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.260
don't introduce a new letter.

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:45.560
So it'll be the column
space of A transpose.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.780
So we don't introduce
a new letter.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:52.600
We keep the convention
that vectors

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:57.990
are column vectors, which
would be the MATLAB and Julia

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:03.730
and Python convention.

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:05.290
So is that OK?

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:08.020
The row space is the
combination of these rows.

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.840
But I'll flip-- I'll
make them stand up--

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:15.470
2, 1, 3-- to be column vectors.

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:17.630
So it's a totally
different space.

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:22.520
And actually, I happened to
take a three by three example,

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:27.320
so that the column
space is part of R3

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.780
and the row space
is also part of R3.

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.270
Because my matrix
is three by three.

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:36.980
A better example-- and the
whole point of data-- data

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.770
doesn't come in square matrices.

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:44.420
Fortunately for us, data very,
very often comes in matrices.

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:48.125
But the two-- the
columns might be sample,

00:28:48.125 --> 00:28:51.050
it might be patients,
and the rows

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:54.530
might be diseases or something.

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.540
They're different spaces.

00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:03.820
So matrices are not
likely to be square.

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:07.120
But anyway, we're good here.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.640
So the row space.

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.310
Now can I come
back to the proof?

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:14.170
Because what I want to
say is that the proof

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:17.800
of this fundamental
fact is staring at us,

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.860
but we don't quite see it yet.

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:25.620
And I want to see it.

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:37.745
So I claim that these rows
are a basis for the row space.

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:45.450
And we already saw
that these columns are

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:48.690
a basis for the column space.

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:55.940
And two equals two, right?

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:59.740
Two vectors here were a
basis for the column space.

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:03.820
Now if I can see why it shows
me that these two vectors are

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:08.110
a basis for the row
space, then my example

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:11.830
is right, that both of
these will give two.

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:14.320
The column rank is
two, two columns,

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.210
the row rank is two, two rows.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:27.050
I have to explain why I
believe that these two rows are

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:31.040
a basis for the row space.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:31.822
Are you with me?

00:30:31.822 --> 00:30:32.530
I have to prove--

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:34.210
I have to see why.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:39.240
First, so when I say basis,
what do I have to check?

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:45.660
Basis is the critical idea.

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:49.060
I have to check that
they're independent, so I

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:50.770
haven't got too many vectors--

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:53.290
I haven't got any
extra vectors in there.

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:57.760
And I also have to check that
their combinations produce--?

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:01.830
All the rows.

00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:05.670
Should I say that again?

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:07.350
Because that's what
I'm going to check.

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:09.475
I'm going to check that
those guys are independent.

00:31:09.475 --> 00:31:11.458
Well, you can see that
they're independent.

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:19.070
And I'm going to check that
their combinations produce

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:22.370
all three of these rows.

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:27.200
We didn't create those
numbers for this purpose,

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:31.150
but what I'm saying
is they work.

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:35.860
So I claim that this is a
basis, because what combination

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:40.330
of those two rows would
produce this first row?

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:44.110
Yeah, let me just ask you that.

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:47.440
What numbers should I
multiply these two rows by

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.410
to get the first row of A?

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:50.410
AUDIENCE: 2, 1.

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:52.630
GILBERT STRANG: 2 and 1.

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:56.510
And where do you find 2 and 1?

00:31:56.510 --> 00:32:04.550
It's sitting there in
C. Will it work again?

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:10.720
Does three of this plus
one of that give 3, 1, 4?

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.190
Yes.

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:13.930
So far, so good.

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:19.660
Does five of this and seven of
that-- see, I'm multiplying--

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:23.560
I guess I'm doing matrix
multiplication a backward way

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.120
or a different way.

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:31.300
I'm taking combinations of
the rows of the second guy.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.430
The wonderful thing about
matrix multiplication

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:36.220
is you can do it a lot
of ways, it comes out

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:40.590
the same every way, and each
way tells you something.

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:44.950
So five of that row plus seven
of that row, sure enough,

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:45.450
is here.

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.595
Do you see that that
is not accident?

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:57.100
The proof is really to look
at this multiplication,

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:59.680
C times R, two ways.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:02.800
Look at it first as
combinations of columns of C

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.380
to give the columns.

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:09.100
Look at it second to get as
combinations of the rows of R,

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:11.750
and that produces the rows.

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:19.910
So that factorization A
equals CR was the key idea.

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:32.690
And actually, this R that
we've come up with has a name.

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:36.770
Anybody remember enough 18.06?

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:39.690
Have you all taken 18.06?

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:40.310
No.

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:43.660
I see-- how many have?

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:44.240
Yes.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:44.940
OK.

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:45.440
Good.

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:52.540
For a while, 18.06 was taught
in a very abstract way.

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:53.980
I said, what's going on?

00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:58.120
But anyway, so if you
took it that semester,

00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:01.210
you maybe never heard
of the column space.

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:02.900
I'm not sure.

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:04.630
Or by a different name.

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:06.070
It has another name.

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:07.840
What's its other name?

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.579
The column space of a matrix?

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:16.010
Range-- I think it's the range.

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:16.600
Yeah.

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:21.460
And of course, all this is
fundamental in mathematics.

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:27.909
So of course, everything
here has different languages

00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:30.190
and different emphasis.

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:33.310
But you see what the
emphasis is here.

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:38.080
So you see the proof,
that A equals CR just

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.560
reveals everything.

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:45.199
So it's our first idea of a
factorization of a matrix.

00:34:45.199 --> 00:34:51.360
And we've multiplied C
times R. I could just say--

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:55.980
so really, you've seen now
the main point of Section 1.1

00:34:55.980 --> 00:35:00.750
of the notes to come up
with that factorization

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:01.980
and that conclusion.

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:09.280
And you see why C has
the same number of--

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:13.000
the number of columns of C
equals the number of rows of R,

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.510
and those are the column
rank and the row rank.

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:18.970
Yeah, it's just pretty neat.

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:24.670
And here was the special case
where those the column space is

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:27.730
all multiples of U--
it's a line through U.

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:30.490
The row space is
all multiples of V--

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:34.200
it's a line through V. And
that's the basic building

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:34.700
block.

00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:39.820
Can I just say
another little word

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:43.310
before I push on beyond CR?

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:45.970
That this has become--

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:51.800
if you have a giant matrix,
like size 10 to the 5th,

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.630
you can't put that
into fast memory.

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:56.870
It's a mess.

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:59.360
How do you deal with a
matrix of size 10 to the 5th,

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:02.670
when you cannot deal
with all the entries?

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:06.030
That's just not possible.

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:08.230
Well, you sample it.

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:10.480
So later in the
course, we'll be doing

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.970
random sampling of a matrix.

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:16.460
So how could you
sample a matrix?

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:17.900
So you have a matrix.

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:21.440
Of course you're looking
at it, but it's--

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:26.920
and you want to get
some typical columns.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.240
Here's the natural idea.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.640
You just look at A times x.

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:37.900
Let x be a random vector.

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:43.810
Rand of-- so it's got
m rows and one column.

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:44.440
It's a vector.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.410
And what can I say about Ax?

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.623
It's in the-- what
space is it in?

00:36:56.623 --> 00:36:57.450
AUDIENCE: Column.

00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:58.200
GILBERT STRANG: Column space.

00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:58.740
Thanks.

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:02.380
That was the first
idea in this lecture.

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:04.120
Ax is in the column space.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:06.930
So if you want a random
vector in the column space,

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:09.210
I wouldn't suggest
to just randomly pick

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:11.170
one of the columns.

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:14.440
Better to take a
mixture of columns

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:18.520
by taking a random vector
x, and looking at Ax.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.680
And if you wanted
100 random vectors,

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:25.540
you'd take a 100 random
x's, and that would give you

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:30.460
a pretty good idea, in many
cases, of what the column

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:32.290
space looks like.

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:34.410
That would be enough
to work with often.

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:40.370
Can I just throw in
another question?

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:44.030
So Ax is in the
column space of A.

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:46.060
Let me just ask
you this question.

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:55.000
Is ABCx-- is that in
the column space of A?

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.710
Suppose I have matrices A,
B, and C, and a vector x,

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:01.540
and I take their product.

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:04.420
Does that give me something
in the column space of A?

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:05.710
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:07.870
GILBERT STRANG:
Yes, good for you.

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:09.126
How do you know that?

00:38:09.126 --> 00:38:11.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.800
GILBERT STRANG: Yeah,
it's A times something.

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.120
Right.

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.100
Putting parentheses
in the right place

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.050
is the key to linear algebra.

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:23.082
And there it is.

00:38:23.082 --> 00:38:24.790
It's a question that
just occurred to me.

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:29.040
And I thought, well, I
wonder if you'd do it.

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:34.210
So we have still time
to multiply matrices.

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:36.840
Oh, I was going to
say about C and R--

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:42.660
so these are real columns
from A. But R is--

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:47.370
the rows are not taken directly
from the rows of A. Actually,

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:49.200
there is a name for this.

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:53.580
It's called the row reduced
echelon form of the matrix,

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:57.880
and it's a big goal in 18.06.

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:02.970
It has the identity there,
and then the other columns

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:04.770
tell you the right combinations.

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:15.500
Another big factorization would
be to take columns from A--

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.680
so this is another--

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.070
so I'll put maybe or--

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:26.810
and we won't be doing
this for a month.

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:31.040
We could start to
take columns of A

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:34.550
and put them into C, if
they were independent.

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:37.910
And suppose I took
rows of A. Now I'm

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:43.850
going to take literally rows
of A, and put them into R--

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:47.200
well, shall I call it
R twiddle or something,

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:51.260
because it'll be a
different R. I'm not

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:55.850
going to use those rows,
but I'm going to take two

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:59.630
actual rows of A. Then what?

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:01.260
So that's an important
factorization,

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:02.135
but it's not correct.

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:09.620
If I took two other rows
of R, it wouldn't work.

00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:12.430
So you have to put it
in the middle some two

00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:17.410
by two matrix U that
makes it correct.

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:24.310
You'll see in that Section
1.1 that I got excited

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:28.000
and wrote a page about CUR.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.160
Yeah, so I'll just mention that.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.770
So now I'm ready-- oh, I
wanted to say something

00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:35.540
about the course.

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:43.210
I got excited thinking about
math, but there is this course.

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:44.080
So what's up?

00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:50.820
So there'll be linear
algebra problems.

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:55.810
But what makes this course
special is the other homeworks,

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:58.600
which are online.

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:00.235
And you would use--

00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:03.590
let's see.

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:07.910
In principle, you could
use any of the languages--

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:12.990
MATLAB, Python, which
has become the biggest--

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:16.740
most used for deep
learning, or Julia,

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.705
which is the hot, new language.

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:28.900
So last time, last
year, the problems--

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:32.290
oh, so what happened last year?

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:35.410
Well, everything
in this course is

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:40.090
owed to a professor who
visited from the University

00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:41.740
of Michigan, Professor Rao--

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:47.490
Raj Rao, who gave most of
the lectures a year ago,

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:50.580
brought these
homework problems--

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:52.770
online homework
problems, so that people

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:55.950
brought laptops to class
and we did things in class.

00:41:58.650 --> 00:42:02.990
So he had and has a
very successful course

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:07.500
at EE in Michigan.

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:10.950
But he was a PhD from here, and
he came back on a sabbatical,

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:13.980
and he created this--
got us started.

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:15.650
And we really owe a lot to him.

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:23.850
Also, Professor Edelman was
involved with this course.

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:26.310
And you maybe know
that he created Julia.

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:29.040
How many know what Julia is?

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.660
Oh, wonderful.

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:31.920
That will make his day.

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.050
He tells me every time I
see him, Julia is good.

00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:38.910
And I tell him, I believe it.

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:40.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:44.220
Anyway-- and it's become--

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:47.520
Professor Johnson in
18.06 has used Julia.

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:54.120
And every semester, Steven
Johnson gives in the first week

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:58.440
a tutorial on Julia.

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:02.370
And so that's arranged,
and I promised to tell you

00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:05.910
where and when that is.

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:08.220
So I think if you don't
know anything about Julia,

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:09.360
try to go.

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.250
It's in Stata.

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:14.570
It's on Friday at 5:00--

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:16.140
5:00 to 7:00.

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:22.545
So Julia from Professor Johnson.

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:27.210
So he's done this
multiple times.

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:28.390
He's good at it.

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:35.130
I don't think we know yet what--

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:39.090
I guess I'm hoping that
you'll have an option to use

00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:41.170
any of the three languages.

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:47.880
But the online thing that we
give you was created in Julia.

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:51.290
So professor Rao had to
learn Julia last spring,

00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:53.160
and the class did, too.

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:55.740
And there was a certain
amount of bitching about it.

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:57.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:01.750
But I think, with
maybe one exception,

00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:06.105
who still got an
A, everybody was OK

00:44:06.105 --> 00:44:08.330
and was glad to learn Julia.

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:12.330
And Professor Rao now
uses Julia entirely.

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:16.650
So he's creating a new
on ramp with Julia.

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:19.920
MATLAB, by the way, has
just issued an on ramp

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.450
to deep learning that
I'll tell you about,

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:25.380
and probably get a MATLAB--

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:30.630
somebody from Math Works
to say something about it.

00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:36.960
So that's what's coming, that
we don't quite know exactly how

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.150
well organized those homeworks.

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:43.720
We'll just take the first
one and see what happens.

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:48.990
So I'll certainly say more
about homeworks when--

00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:50.610
maybe even Friday.

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:54.282
But are there other questions
that I should answer?

00:44:54.282 --> 00:44:55.990
Because some people
will be thinking, OK,

00:44:55.990 --> 00:45:00.180
am I going to do this or
am I going to sit in 6.036,

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:03.960
or some other course
in deep learning?

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.090
Anything on your mind?

00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:08.910
And you can email me.

00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:12.310
So we will have a Stellar
site and you'll see all the--

00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:14.550
the TAs are still to be named.

00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:17.970
But the wonderful thing is
that the undergraduates who

00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:22.080
took this course last
year are volunteering

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:25.170
to be graders for you guys.

00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:30.990
So they will know what those
online homeworks were about.

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:37.860
So that's a first word
about what's coming

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:41.670
and about the language.

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:47.160
I'm going to finish by
a very important topic,

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:51.050
multiplying A times B.
Oh, look, a clean board.

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:57.110
So now I want to multiply
a matrix by a vector.

00:45:57.110 --> 00:46:00.680
Everybody knows how to do it.

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:07.650
You take a row of A--
so you take a row of A

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:13.330
and you take a column of B,
and you take the dot product.

00:46:13.330 --> 00:46:14.720
So you get a dot product.

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:18.380
Row dot column.

00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:30.180
That's, again, low
level, OK for beginners.

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:36.510
But we want to see that matrix
multiplication, AB, in a deeper

00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:38.250
way.

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:42.840
And the deeper way
is columns times row.

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:48.060
Columns of A, rows of
B. Columns times row.

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:49.950
Oh, we had a column times a row.

00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:54.355
That was this rank one example.

00:46:57.130 --> 00:47:00.040
We had a column times a row,
and it produced a matrix.

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.040
And that's what it looked like.

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:04.600
And its rank was one.

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:05.890
So those are what--

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.850
so it's a combination of.

00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:16.740
It's very like Ax.

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:20.040
I'm really just extending
the Ax idea to AB.

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:25.340
So this is the old way.

00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:26.750
The new way is columns.

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:32.150
So there's column
K. It will multiply.

00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:36.980
Sure enough, it multiplies
row K. Everybody sees

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:39.420
that it will happen that way.

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:41.210
If you do it the
old way, when you

00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:44.540
do a dot product of something
here, something here,

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:46.280
you're doing these
multiplications.

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:50.000
And when you hit column K
here, you hit row K there.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.942
So these are connected.

00:47:56.370 --> 00:48:08.130
So I get things like column
K of A times row K of B.

00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:10.010
And I don't know
what notation to use,

00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:14.430
so I just wrote the words.

00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:21.000
But now that's one piece
of the final answer, AB.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.650
That's a rank one piece.

00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:24.570
That's a building block.

00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:31.920
So I add from K equals 1
column one times row one.

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:35.150
Column one of A times
row one of B plus--

00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:38.380
da, da, da, plus column K plus--

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:48.500
and of course, I stop at
column n of A times row n of B.

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:51.890
So it's a sum of outer products.

00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:57.650
So everybody sees
a sum because I

00:48:57.650 --> 00:49:05.690
have column one times row
1, column K times row K,

00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:10.720
column n times row n, and
then I add those pieces.

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:17.440
It's just the generalization
of Ax to a matrix B there.

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:30.310
So it's a sum of Column K row
K of A row K of B. And maybe,

00:49:30.310 --> 00:49:34.780
should we check that that
gives us the right answer?

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:38.350
I won't do that here,
but all we're doing

00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:44.210
is the same multiplications
in a different order.

00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:46.550
Actually, let's just
quit with one minute.

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:49.430
We can figure out how many
multiplications are there.

00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:52.760
How many more applications
to do an m by n

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:58.570
matrix A times an
n by p matrix B?

00:49:58.570 --> 00:50:02.610
So that's A times B. How
many individual numbers--

00:50:02.610 --> 00:50:05.180
because this would
determine the cost of it.

00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:09.870
How many numbers would we need?

00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:18.240
Well, suppose we do it the
old way, by inner product,

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:19.440
row times column.

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:23.460
So how many multiplications
to do a row times column

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:26.580
and get one entry in the answer?

00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:29.060
n, right?

00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:31.070
The row has length
n, the column has

00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:33.860
length n, n multiplications.

00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:34.800
So that's n.

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:38.150
And now how many of
those do I have to do?

00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:39.950
AUDIENCE: mp.

00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:41.330
GILBERT STRANG: mp.

00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:44.120
Because what's the
size of this answer?

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:46.340
The size of this
answer is m by p.

00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:54.225
So if I do it in that old
order, like n multiplication

00:50:54.225 --> 00:50:56.310
is to do a dot product.

00:50:56.310 --> 00:50:59.250
And I've got this many dot
products in the answer.

00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:02.540
So I've mnp multiplied.

00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:09.120
Now suppose I do it this way.

00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:16.440
How many multiplications
to do one of those guys?

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.450
To multiply our column by a row?

00:51:23.716 --> 00:51:29.291
This is an m by 1,
and this is a 1 by p.

00:51:29.291 --> 00:51:30.980
One column, one row.

00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:34.390
How many multiplications
for that guy?

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:36.530
mp.

00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:40.718
And how many of those
rank ones do I have to do?

00:51:40.718 --> 00:51:43.640
n.

00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:44.940
You got it?

00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:46.740
mp times n.

00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:56.580
Now, the other way
was n times mp.

00:51:56.580 --> 00:52:00.330
So it gives the same
answer, mnp multiplication.

00:52:00.330 --> 00:52:02.940
In fact, they're exactly the
same multiplications, just

00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:04.000
a different order.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:04.500
OK.

00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:06.540
We're at 1:55.

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:08.760
Thanks for coming today.

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.640
I'll talk more about the
class and about linear algebra

00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:12.570
on Friday.

00:52:12.570 --> 00:52:13.984
Thank you.
