00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.020
GILBERT STRANG: OK, so
this is an important day,

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.730
and Friday was an important day.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.800
I hope you enjoyed Professor
Sra's terrific lecture as much

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.610
as I did.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.430
You probably saw me taking notes
like mad for the section that's

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.020
now to be written about
stochastic gradient descent.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.020
And he promised a
theorem, if you remember,

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.710
and there wasn't time.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.720
And so he was going
to send it to me

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.760
or still is going
to send it to me.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.520
I'll report, I
haven't got it yet,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.599
but I'll bring it to class,
waiting to see, hopefully.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:09.280
And that will give us a chance
to review stochastic gradient

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.930
descent, the central
algorithm of deep learning.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.980
And then this today is
about the central structure

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.780
of deep neural nets.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.780
And some of you will know
already how they're connected,

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:36.800
what the function F,
the learning function--

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.360
you could call it the
learning function--

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.980
that's constructed.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.990
The whole system is aiming
at constructing this function

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.180
F which learns the
training data and then

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.480
applying it to the test data.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.570
And the miracle is that it
does so well in practice.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.150
That's what has transformed
deep learning into such

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.290
an important application.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.270
Chapter 7 has been
up for months on the

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.340
math.mit.edu/learningfromdata
site,

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.525
and I'll add it to Stellar.

00:02:28.525 --> 00:02:33.270
Of course, that's where
you'll be looking for it.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.630
OK, and then the second,
the back propagation,

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.940
the way to compute
the gradient, I'll

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.940
probably reach that idea today.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.070
And you'll see it's the chain
rule, but how is it organized.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.290
OK, so what's the structure?

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.360
What's the plan for
deep neural nets?

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.830
Good.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.820
Starting here, so what
we have is training data.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:13.640
So we have vectors, x1 to x--

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.840
what should I use for
the number of samples

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.590
that we have in
the training data?

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.480
Well, let's say D for Data.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.120
OK.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.980
And each vector, those are
called feature vectors,

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.055
so equals feature vectors.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:48.010
So each one, each x,
has like m features.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:55.230
So maybe my notation
isn't so hot here.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.640
I have a whole lot of vectors.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.510
Let me not use the subscript
for those right away.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.010
So vectors, feature
vectors, and each vector

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.170
has got maybe shall
we say m features?

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.250
Like, if we were measuring
height and age and weight

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.594
and so on, those
would be features.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.140
The job of the neural
network is to create--

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.730
and we're going to classify.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:35.220
Maybe we're going to classify
men and women or boys

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.080
and girls.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.330
So let's make it a
classification problem,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.720
just binary.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.610
So the classification
problem is--

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.600
what shall we say?

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:59.040
Minus 1 or 1, or 0
or 1, or boy or girl,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.760
or cat or dog, or truck or car,
or anyway, just two classes.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.360
So I'm just going to do
two-class classification.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.480
We know which class the
training data is in.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.970
For each vector x, we
know the right answer.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.660
So we want to create a function
that gives the right answer,

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.460
and then we'll use that
function on other data.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.420
So let me write that down.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:42.600
Create a function F
of x so that gets--

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:50.140
most of gets the class correct.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:58.010
In other words, F of x
should be negative for when

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:04.960
the classification is
minus 1, and F of x

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.470
should be positive when the
classification is plus 1.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.080
And as we know, we
don't necessarily

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.860
have to get every x,
every sample, right.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.990
That may be over-fitting.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.850
If there's some sample that's
just truly weird, by getting

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.380
that right we're
going to be looking

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:32.100
for a truly weird
data in the test set,

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.830
and that's not a good idea.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.650
We're trying to
discover the rule that

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:46.420
covers almost all cases but
not every crazy, weird case.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.290
OK?

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.020
So that's our job,
to create a function

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:58.000
F of x that is correct on
almost all of the training data.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:02.360
Yeah.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:12.760
So before I draw the
picture of the network,

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:23.750
let me just remember to
mention the site Playground.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.840
I don't know if you've looked at
that, so I'm going to ask you,

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.640
playground@tensorflow.org.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:40.140
How many of you know that
site or have met with it?

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.530
Just a few, OK.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:46.140
OK, so it's not a very
sophisticated site.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:49.680
It's got only four
examples, four examples.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:03.590
So one example is a whole
lot of points that are blue,

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:08.830
B for Blue, inside
a bunch of points

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:18.760
that are another set that are
O for Orange, orange, blue.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.350
OK, so those are the two
classes, orange and blue.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:34.480
So the points x and the feature
vector here is just the xy,

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:42.820
the coordinates features are the
xy coordinates of the points.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.420
And our job is to
find a function that's

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:51.400
positive on these points and
negative on those points.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.910
So there is a simple model
problem, and I recommend--

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.060
well, just partly--

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.910
if you're a expert
in deep learning.

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:07.150
This is for children, but
morally here, I certainly

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:10.960
learned from playing
in this playground.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:19.320
So you set the step size.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.980
Do you set it, or
does it set it?

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.570
I guess you can change it.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.310
I don't think I've changed it.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:31.320
What else do you set?

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:41.460
Oh, you set the nonlinear
activation, the nonlinear

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:46.590
activation function,
active I'll say function.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:51.570
And let me just go over here
and say what function people now

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:52.500
mostly use.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:59.520
The activation
function is called

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.570
ReLU pronounced different ways.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.470
I don't know how we got
into that crazy thing.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:13.430
For this function,
that is 0 and x.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.680
So the function,
ReLU is a function

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:20.935
of x is the maximum
the larger of 0 and x.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.400
The point is, it's not
linear, and the point

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.690
is that if we didn't allow
nonlinearity in here somewhere,

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:34.630
we couldn't even solve
this playground problem.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:38.980
Because if our classifiers
were all linear classifiers,

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:44.410
like support vector machines,
I couldn't separate the blue

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:48.685
from the orange with a plane.

00:10:48.685 --> 00:10:53.130
It's got to somehow create some
nonlinear function which maybe

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.610
the function is trying to be--

00:10:55.610 --> 00:11:03.430
a good function would be a
function of r and theta maybe,

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:07.060
maybe r minus 5.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.210
So maybe the
distance out to that.

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:13.970
Let's suppose that
distance is 5.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.680
Then, r minus 5 will be
negative on the blues,

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.630
because r is small.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:22.720
And r minus 5 will be
positive on the oranges,

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.340
because r is bigger.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:30.705
And therefore, we will have
the right signs, less than 0

00:11:30.705 --> 00:11:35.310
or greater than 0,
and it'll classify

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:39.960
this data, this training data.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.450
Yeah.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.230
So it has to do that.

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:45.060
This is not a hard one to do.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:51.450
There are four examples,
as I say, two are trivial.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:53.430
It finds a good function.

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:56.760
Well yeah, I've forgotten,
they're so trivial,

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:07.920
they shouldn't be mentioned, and
then this is the medium test.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.350
And then the hard
test is when you

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:17.370
have a sort of
spiral of oranges,

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:20.880
and inside, you have
a spiral of blues.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.905
That was cooked up by a fiend.

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:35.020
So the system is trying
to find a function

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:39.580
that's positive on one spiral
and negative on the other

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:45.670
spiral, and that takes quite a
bit of time, many, many epochs.

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:47.320
I learned what an epoch is.

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.670
Did you know what an epoch is?

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.320
I didn't know
whether it was just

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:58.780
a fancy word for counting the
steps in gradient descent.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:03.250
But it counts the
steps, all right,

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:07.930
but one epoch is the number
of steps that matches

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:11.610
the size of the training data.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:14.710
So if you have a
million samples--

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:18.760
where ordinary gradient descent
you would be doing a million--

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:23.780
you'd have a million by a
million problem per step.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:27.040
Of course, stochastic
gradient descent

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:32.650
just does a mini-batch of 1 or
32 or something, but anyway.

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:41.860
So you have to do it
enough mini-batches

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.440
so that the total
number you've covered

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:54.563
is the equivalent of one full
run through the training data,

00:13:54.563 --> 00:13:55.980
and that was an
interesting point.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.340
Did you pick up that point?

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:01.690
That in stochastic
gradient descent,

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:05.810
you could either
do a mini-batch,

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:11.320
and then put them back in the
soup, so with replacement.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:17.760
Or you could just put
your data in some order,

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.610
from one to a zillion.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:25.290
So here's a first x
and then more and more

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:30.330
x's, and then just
randomize the order.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:34.050
So you'd have to randomize the
order for stochastic gradient

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.930
descent to be
reasonable, and then

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:38.940
take a mini-batch
and a mini-batch

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.600
and a mini-batch
and a mini-batch.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.070
And when you get to the bottom,
you've finished one epoch.

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:47.070
And then you'd probably
randomize again, maybe,

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:51.510
if you wanted to live right.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:56.040
And go through the
mini-batches again,

00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:01.320
and probably do
1,000 times or more.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:06.060
Anyway, so I haven't said yet
what you do, what this F of x

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:09.870
is like, but you can sort
of see it on the screen.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:14.410
Because as it creates
this function F,

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:17.150
it kind of plots it.

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:23.680
And what you see on the screen
is the 0 set for that function.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:27.810
So perfect would be for
it to go through 0--

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:29.640
if I had another color.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.290
Oh, I do have another color.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:36.160
Look, this is the first time the
whole semester blue is up here.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:43.310
OK, so if the function
was positive there--

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.390
in this part, on the blues--

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:51.560
and negative outside that
region for the oranges, that

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.940
would be just what we want.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:53.840
Right?

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.530
That would be what this little
Playground site is creating.

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:59.780
And on the screen,
you'll see it.

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:05.210
You'll see this curve,
where it crosses 0.

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:07.040
So that curve,
where it crosses 0,

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.130
is supposed to
separate the two sets.

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:12.610
One set is positive,
one set is negative,

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:15.250
where 0 is in between.

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:19.870
And the point is, it's not a
straight line, because we've

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:22.100
got this nonlinear function.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:33.490
This is nonlinear, and
it allows us to have

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:36.520
functions like r minus 5.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:42.640
And so at 5, that's where
the function would be 0,

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.290
and you'll see
that on the screen.

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:50.110
You might just go to
playground@tensorflow.

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:53.650
Of course, TensorFlow
is a big system.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:17:00.025
This is the child's
department, but I

00:17:00.025 --> 00:17:01.150
thought it was pretty good.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:04.470
And then on this
site, you decide

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:08.800
how many layers there will be,
how many neurons in each layer.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:13.140
So you create the structure
that I'm about to draw.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:21.180
And you won't be able to
get to solve this problem

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:25.290
to find a function F
that learns that data

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:31.440
without a number of layers
and a number of neurons.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.080
If you don't give it enough,
you'll see it struggling.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:46.120
The 0 set tries to follow this,
but it gives up at some point.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.850
This one doesn't
take too many layers,

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:54.910
and the two trivial examples,
just a few neurons do the job.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:55.720
OK.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:18:02.350
So now, that's a little
commented on one website.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:05.530
If you know other websites
that I should know

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:10.430
and should call attention to,
could you send me an email?

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:15.000
I'm just not aware of
everything that's out there.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:22.650
Or if you know a good
Convolutional Neural Net, CNN,

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:27.450
that is available
to practice on,

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:32.760
where you could give
it the training set.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.730
That's what I'm
talking about here.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.050
I'd be glad to
know, because I just

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:43.300
don't know all that I should.

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:43.930
OK.

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:47.430
So what does the
function look like?

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:51.230
Well, as I say, linear
isn't going to do it,

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:56.840
but linear is a very important
part of it, of this function

00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:01.220
F. So the function F
really has the form--

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:08.000
well, so we start here
with a vector of one,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.840
two, three, four, m is five.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:19.840
This is the vector
x, five components.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:23.690
OK, so let me erase that now.

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:36.700
OK, so then we have layer 1
with some number of points.

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:47.670
Let's say, n1 is 6 neurons,
and let me make this simple.

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:51.420
I'll just have that one layer,
and then I'll have the output.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:57.600
This will be the output
layer, and it's just

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.890
going to be one number.

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:08.970
So I'm going to have a matrix,
A1, that takes me from this.

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:18.040
A1 will be 6 by 5, because I
want 6 outputs and 5 inputs.

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:23.570
6 by 5 matrix, so I have
30 weights to choose there.

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:31.230
And so the y that
comes out is going

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:36.730
to be y1 will be A1 times x0.

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:44.140
So x0 is the feature
vector with 5 components.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.740
So that's a purely
linear thing, but we also

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:54.650
want an offset
function, offset vector.

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:56.120
So that's a vector.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:02.060
Then, this, the y that's
coming out, has 6 components.

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:07.940
The A1 is 6 by 5,
the x0 was 5 by 1,

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.550
and then of course,
this is 6 by 1.

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:12.830
So these are the weights.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:19.460
Yeah, I'll call them all
weights, weights to compute.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.020
So these are connected.

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:34.450
The usual picture is to
show all these connections.

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:38.270
I'll just put in some of them.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:49.010
So in here, we have 30 plus
6 parameters, 36 parameters,

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:52.070
and then I'm going
to close this.

00:21:52.070 --> 00:22:02.960
It's going to be a very shallow
thing, so that will be just 1

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:03.930
by 6.

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:04.910
Yeah.

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:05.410
OK.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:11.210
Right, so we're just
getting one output.

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:18.290
So that's just a vector at this
final point, but of course,

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:21.170
that the whole idea
of deep neural nets

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:23.810
is that you have many layers.

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:29.420
So 36 more realistically is
in the tens of thousands,

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.330
and you have it multiple times.

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:42.000
And the idea seems to be
that you can separate what

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:49.200
layer one learns about the data
and from what layer two learns

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.400
about the data.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:57.130
Layer one-- this A1, apparently
by just looking after

00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:58.810
the computation--

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:04.630
this learns some basic
facts about the data.

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:13.930
The next, A2 which would go in
here, would learn more detail,

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:16.000
and then A3 would
learn more details.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.540
So we would have a
number of layers,

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:27.150
and it's that construction that
has made neural net successful.

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:32.670
But I haven't finished, because
right now, it's only linear.

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:36.090
Right now, I just have,
I'll call it A2 in here.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:38.700
Right now, I would just
have a matrix multiplication

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:47.850
apply A1 and then apply A2,
but in between there is a 1

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:55.930
by 1 action on each
by this function.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:02.860
So that function
acts on that number

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:06.610
to give that number
back again or to give 0.

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:09.850
So in there is ReLU.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:18.340
In this comes ReLU on each,
6 copies of ReLU acting

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.820
on each of those 6 numbers.

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:21.630
Right?

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:32.460
So really x1 comes from
y1 by applying ReLU to it.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.470
Then, that gives the x.

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:37.830
So here are the y's
from the linear part,

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:39.540
and here are the x--

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:40.480
that's y1.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:46.920
That's a vector y1 from just
the linear plus an affine map.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:51.120
Linear plus constant,
that's affine.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:55.590
And then the next step
is component by component

00:24:55.590 --> 00:25:03.240
we apply this function, and
we get x1, and then do it

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.100
again and again and again.

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.660
So do you see the function?

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:10.830
How do I describe now
the function F of x?

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:26.390
So the learning function
which depends on the weights,

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:28.655
on the A's and b's.

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:39.270
So I start with an
x, I apply A1 to it.

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:41.610
Yeah, let me do this.

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:44.600
This is the function F of x.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:48.710
F of x is going to
be F3, let's say,

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:58.520
of F2 of F1 of x, one, two,
three, parentheses, right?

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.520
OK, so it's a chain,
you could say.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:06.830
F is a-- what's the right
word for a chain of functions,

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:09.890
if I take a function
of a function?

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:12.800
The reason I use the word
chain is that the chain rule

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.360
gives the derivative.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:19.430
So a function of a function
of a function, that's

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:23.570
called composition,
composing function.

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:27.720
So this is a composition.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.900
I don't know if there's a
standard symbol for starting

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:36.820
with F1 and do some composition
and do some composition.

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.970
And now what are
those separate F's?

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:47.670
So the separate F's are the--

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:52.410
F1 of a vector would
be-- it includes

00:26:52.410 --> 00:27:01.900
the ReLU part, the nonlinear
part, of A1, x0 plus b1.

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:07.590
So two parts, you do
the linear or affine map

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:13.080
on your feature vector,
and then component

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:18.560
by component you apply
that nonlinear function.

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:22.770
And it took some years before
that nonlinear function

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:27.630
became a big favorite.

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:29.670
People imagined
that it was better,

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:33.180
it was important, to
have a smooth function.

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:42.950
So the original functions
were sigmoids, like S curves,

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:46.560
but of course, it turned
out that experiments showed

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.630
that this worked even better.

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:52.140
Yeah, so that would
be F1, and then F2

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:55.780
would have the same form, and
F3 would have the same form.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:59.640
So maybe this had 36
weights, and the next one

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:04.440
would have another number
and the next another number.

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:08.940
You get quite complicated
functions by composition,

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:14.640
by like e to the sine of x, or
e to the sign of the logarithm

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:18.510
of x, or things like that.

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:23.190
Pure math has asked, what
functions can you get?

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:24.780
Try to think of them all.

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:27.690
Now, what kind of
functions do we have here?

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:33.870
What can I say about F of x as
a function, as a math person?

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:37.140
What kind of a function is it?

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:42.660
So it's created out of
matrices and vectors,

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:49.980
out of a linear or affine
map, followed by a nonlinear,

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:54.490
by that particular
nonlinear function.

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:56.980
So what kind of
a function is it?

00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:04.000
Well, I've written those
words down up here, and F of x

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.960
is going to be a continuous
piecewise linear function.

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:15.580
Because every step
is continuous,

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:17.800
that's a continuous function.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.900
Linear functions are a
continuous functions,

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:24.700
so we're taking a composition
of continuous function,

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.500
so it's continuous.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:30.940
And it's piecewise linear,
because part of it is linear,

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:32.950
and part of it is
piecewise linear.

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:51.480
So this is some continuous,
piecewise, linear function

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:58.900
of x, x in m dimensions.

00:29:58.900 --> 00:29:59.400
OK.

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:07.810
So one little math
question which I think

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:13.810
helps to understand,
to like to swallow

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:19.960
the idea of a chain, of the
kind of chain we have here,

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.525
of linear followed by ReLU.

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:29.470
So here's my question.

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:31.450
This is the question
I'm going to ask.

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:34.660
And by the way, back
propagation is certainly

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:37.510
going to come Wednesday
rather than today.

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:41.120
That's a major topic in itself.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.450
So let me keep going
with this function.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:50.750
Could you get any function
whatsoever this way?

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:53.270
Well, no, you only get
continuous, piecewise,

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:56.500
linear functions.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:59.060
It's an interesting case.

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:01.840
Let me just ask you.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:04.810
One of the exercises
says, if I took

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:09.790
two continuous, piecewise,
linear functions--

00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:12.640
the next 20 minutes
are an attempt

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:16.780
to give us a picture of
the graph of a piecewise,

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:23.605
linear function in say a
function of two variables.

00:31:23.605 --> 00:31:30.160
So I have m equal to 2,
and I draw its graph.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.340
OK, help me to draw this graph.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:38.330
So this would be a
graph of F of x1, x2,

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:41.000
and it's going to be continuous
and piecewise linear.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.550
So what does its
graph look like?

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:45.680
That's the question.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:50.540
What's the graph of a piecewise,
linear function looks like?

00:31:50.540 --> 00:32:00.220
Well, it's got flat pieces
in between the change from--

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:04.230
I do say piecewise, that means
it's got different pieces.

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:12.060
But within a piece, it's linear,
and the pieces with each other,

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.800
because it's continuous.

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:20.050
So I visualize, well,
it's like origami.

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:24.760
This is the theory
of origami almost.

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:27.320
So right, origami,
you take a flat thing,

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:32.580
and you fold it
along straight folds.

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.330
So what's different
from origami?

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:35.300
Maybe not much.

00:32:38.136 --> 00:32:43.520
Well, maybe origami allows
more than we allow here,

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.790
or origami would allow you
to fold it up and over.

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:51.050
So origami would give
you a multi-valued thing,

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:55.880
because it's got a top and
a bottom and other folds.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:33:02.980
This is just going out to
infinity in flat pieces,

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:06.020
and the question will
be, how many pieces?

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:07.710
So let me ask you that question.

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:11.890
How many pieces do I have?

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:15.440
Do you see what I
mean by a piece?

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:19.300
So I'm thinking of a graph
that has these flat pieces,

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:23.880
and they're connected
along straight edges.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:30.870
And those straight edges
come from the ReLU operation.

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:33.520
Well, that's got two pieces.

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:35.290
Actually, we could do it 1D.

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:39.170
In 1D, we could count the
number of pieces pretty easily.

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:41.450
So what would be a
piecewise linear?

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:45.260
Let me put it over here on
the side and erase it soon.

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:48.140
OK.

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:56.350
So here's m equal 1, a
continuous, piecewise, linear

00:33:56.350 --> 00:34:00.380
F. I'll just draw its graph.

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:08.159
So OK, so it's got
straight pieces,

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:11.300
straight pieces like so.

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.855
Yeah, you've got the idea.

00:34:12.855 --> 00:34:14.540
It's a broken line type.

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:16.310
Sometimes, people
say broken line,

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:21.350
but I'm never sure that's
a good description of this.

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:24.500
Piecewise, linear,
continuous, so it's continuous

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:30.070
because the pieces meet,
and it's piecewise,

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:31.900
linear, obviously.

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:34.909
OK, so that's the
kind of picture

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:39.460
I have for a function
of one variable.

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:42.650
Now, my question is--

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:47.630
as an aid to try to visualize
this function in 2D--

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:51.500
is to see if we can
count the pieces,

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.540
see if we can count the pieces.

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:55.639
Yes.

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:58.060
So that's in the notes.

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:06.270
I found it in a paper by
five authors for a meeting.

00:35:08.946 --> 00:35:16.390
So actually, the whole
world of neural nets,

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:21.150
it's the conferences
every couple of years

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:27.150
that everybody prepares for,
submits more than one paper.

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:30.450
So it's kind of a piecewise,
linear conference,

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:35.460
and those are the
big conferences.

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.300
OK.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.550
So this is the back
propagation section,

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:42.800
and I want to look at the--

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:43.300
OK.

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.400
So this is a paper by
Kleinberg and four others.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:54.530
Kleinberg, he's a computer
science guy at Cornell.

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:57.440
He was a PhD from
here in math, and he's

00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:04.700
a very cool and
significant person,

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:13.930
not so much on neural networks
as just this whole part

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:15.130
of computer science.

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:15.820
Right.

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:19.390
So anyway, they and
other people too

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:20.740
have asked this same problem.

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:24.910
Suppose I'm in two variables.

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:33.830
So what are you imagining
now for the surface,

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:39.200
the graph of F of x and y?

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:43.520
It has these lines,
fold lines, right?

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:45.600
I'm thinking it has fold lines.

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.890
So I can start with a
complete plane, and I fold it

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:53.520
along one line.

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.920
So now, it's like ReLU.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:00.070
It's one half plane there going
into a different half plane

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:00.570
there.

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:03.130
Everybody with it?

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:08.170
And now, I take that
function, that surface

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:14.020
which just has two parts,
and I put in another fold.

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:17.850
OK, how many parts
have I got now?

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:20.450
I think four, am I right?

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:26.430
Four parts, yes, because this
will be different from this,

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:28.840
because it was folded
along that line.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:31.380
So these will be four
different pieces.

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:34.820
They have the same value
at the center there,

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:39.230
and they match along the lines.

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:43.800
So the number of flat
pieces is four for this.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:47.640
So that's with two folds, and
now I just want to ask you,

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.975
with m folds how many
pieces are there?

00:37:51.975 --> 00:37:53.655
Can I get up to three folds?

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:59.390
So I'm going to look
for the number of folds.

00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:04.690
So let me just use
a notation, maybe r.

00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:22.910
r is the number of flat pieces,
and m is the dimension of x.

00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:29.530
In my picture, it's two, and
N is the number of folds.

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:35.340
So let me say it again.

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.310
I'm taking a plane.

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.240
I'll fold that plane--

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:45.060
because the dimension was two--

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:47.205
I'll fold it N times.

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:52.860
How many pieces?

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:53.930
How many flat pieces?

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:10.150
This would be a central
step in understanding

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:13.750
how close the function--

00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:18.730
what freedom you have in
the function F. For example,

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:22.850
can you approximate
any continuous function

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:27.910
by one of these functions
F by taking enough folds?

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:30.910
Seems like the answer should
be yes, and it is yes.

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:38.380
For pure math,
that's one question.

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:41.830
Is this class of
functions universal?

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:44.230
So the universality
theorem would

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:49.060
be to say that any function--

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:53.680
sine x, whatever--
could be approximated

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:59.380
as close as you like by one of
these guys with enough folds.

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:05.010
And over here, we're kind
of making it more numerical.

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:07.570
We're going to count
the number of pieces

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:10.480
just to see how
quickly do they grow.

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.490
So what happens here?

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:14.760
So I have four folds.

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:18.660
Right now, I have N equal 2.

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:23.080
m is 2 here in this picture.

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:27.030
And I'm trying to draw this
surface, in here I've put in 2.

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:28.050
Did I take N?

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:34.030
Yeah, two folds, and now I'm
going to go up to three folds.

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:34.720
OK.

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:37.890
So let me fold it
along that line.

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:39.570
How many pieces of I got now?

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:49.600
Let's see, can I
count those pieces?

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.360
Is it seven?

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.340
So what is a formula?

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:55.810
What if I do another fold?

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:01.910
Yeah, let's pretend
we do another fold.

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:02.630
Yeah?

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:04.260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.600
GILBERT STRANG: Uh, yeah.

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:10.050
Well, maybe that's
going to be it.

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:15.020
It's a kind of nice
question, because it asks

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:16.970
you to visualize this thing.

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:17.470
OK.

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:22.030
So what happened?

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:24.250
How many of those
lines will be--

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:27.190
if I put in a fourth line--

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:29.040
how many?

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:33.300
Yeah, how many new
folds do I create?

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.850
That's kind of the
question, and I'm

00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:37.430
assuming that
fourth line doesn't

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:39.110
go through any of these points.

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:40.655
It's sort of in
general position.

00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:47.650
So I put it in a fourth line,
da-da-da-da, there it is.

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:50.620
OK, so what happened here?

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:53.890
How many new ones did it create?

00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:55.360
How many new ones did it create?

00:41:58.690 --> 00:42:01.390
Let me make that one
green, because I'm

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:03.460
distinguishing
that's the guy that's

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:06.580
added after the original.

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:07.660
We had seven.

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:14.860
We had seven pieces,
and now we've got more.

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:15.580
Was it seven?

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:16.390
It was, wasn't it?

00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:20.800
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, but now how many

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.090
pieces have I got?

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:30.160
Or how many pieces did
this new line create?

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.750
We want to build it
up, use a recursion.

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:35.150
How many pieces did this new--

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:39.920
well, this new line created
one new piece there.

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:40.910
Right?

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:43.760
One new piece there,
one new piece there,

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:50.050
one new piece there, so
there are four new pieces.

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:52.410
OK.

00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:55.490
Yes, so there's
some formula that's

00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:59.430
going to tell us that, and now
what would the next one create?

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:03.870
Well, now I have one,
two, three, four lines.

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:06.870
So now, I'm going to put
through a fifth line,

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:09.300
and that will create a
whole bunch of pieces.

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:14.970
I'm losing the thread of this
argument, but you're onto it.

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:16.410
Right?

00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:19.800
Yeah, so any suggestions?

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:20.860
Yeah.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:23.910
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think you add
essentially the number of lines

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:26.840
that you have each time
you add a line at most.

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:27.960
GILBERT STRANG: OK.

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.230
Yes.

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.930
That's right.

00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:34.290
So there is a recursion
formula that I want to know,

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:36.840
and I learned it from
Kleinberg's paper.

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:42.210
And then we have
an addition to do,

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:45.970
so the recursion will tell
me how much it goes up

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:49.330
with each new function,
and then we have to add.

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:49.960
OK.

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.210
So the recursion formula,
let me write that down.

00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:06.030
So this is r of N and m that
I'd like to find a formula for.

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:12.260
It's the number of flat pieces
with an m dimensional surface--

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:14.510
well, we're taking m to be 2--

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:16.115
and N folds.

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:22.340
So N equal 1, 2, 3.

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:25.982
Let's write down
the numbers we know.

00:44:25.982 --> 00:44:29.630
With one fold, how many pieces?

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:32.710
Two, good, so far so good.

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:38.940
With one fold, there
were two pieces.

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:44.640
So this is the count r, and
then with two folds, how many?

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:46.740
Oh, we've gone past that point.

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:50.130
So can we get back
to just those two?

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:51.280
Was it four?

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.020
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:55.050
GILBERT STRANG: OK, thanks.

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:59.790
Now, when I put in that third
fold, how many did I have

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:02.550
without the green line yet?

00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:06.180
Seven, was it seven?

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:12.300
And when the fourth one went in,
that green one, how many have I

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:13.320
got in this picture?

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:19.860
So the question is how many
new ones did I create, I guess.

00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:24.270
So that line got chopped
into that piece, that piece,

00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:27.930
that piece, that piece, four
pieces for the new line.

00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:32.400
Four pieces for the new line,
and then each of those pieces

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:36.720
like added a flat bit.

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:40.350
Because that piece
from here to here

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:43.260
separated these two
which were previously

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:45.770
just one piece, one flat piece.

00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:47.400
I folded on that line.

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.420
I folded on this.

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:49.380
I folded there.

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:51.930
I think it went up by 4 to 11.

00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:59.740
So now, we just have
to guess a formula that

00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:02.950
matches those numbers, and
then of course, we really

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:09.490
should guess it for
any m and any N.

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:13.390
And I'll write down the
formula that they found.

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:19.410
It involves binomial numbers.

00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:24.450
Everything in the world
involves binomial numbers,

00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:28.650
because they satisfy every
identity you could think of.

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:35.065
So here's their formula.

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:43.180
r with N folds, and
we're in m dimensions.

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:46.300
So we've really in our
thinking had m equal to 2,

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:53.470
but we should grow up and
get m to be five dimensional.

00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:55.540
So we have a five dimensional--

00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:57.700
let's not think about that.

00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:00.180
OK.

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:03.030
So it turns out it's
binomial numbers--

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:11.840
N 0, N 1, up to N m.

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:28.880
So for m equals 2, which is
my picture, it's N 0 plus N 1

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:32.750
plus N 2, and what are these?

00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:37.560
What does that N 2
mean, for example?

00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:41.040
That's a binomial number.

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:45.640
I don't know if you're
keen on binomial numbers.

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:50.170
Some people, their whole lives
go into binomial numbers.

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:53.290
So it's something like--

00:47:53.290 --> 00:48:00.610
is it N factorial divided
by N minus 2 factorial and 2

00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:01.390
factorial?

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:08.070
I think that's what
that number means.

00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:09.410
That's the binomial number.

00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:17.030
So at this point, I'm hoping to
get the answer seven, I think.

00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:25.200
I'm in m equal to--

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.690
I've gone up to 2.

00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:36.510
Yeah, so I think I've obviously
allowed for three cuts,

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:41.430
and the r, when we
had just three, was 7.

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:49.110
So this is now I'm
taking N to be 3,

00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:56.050
and I'm hoping for answer is 7.

00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:03.170
So I add these three things.

00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:08.490
So what is 3, the
binomial number 3 with 2?

00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:10.550
I've forgotten how to say that.

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:11.660
I'm ashamed to admit.

00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:13.380
3 choose 2, thanks.

00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:14.550
I knew there was a good way.

00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:15.890
So what is 3 choose 2?

00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:23.450
Well, put in 3, and 2
is in there already,

00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:28.520
so that'd be 6 over 1 times 2.

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:29.690
This would be 3.

00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:30.530
Would that be 3?

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:39.639
And what is 3 choose 1?

00:49:39.639 --> 00:49:41.120
AUDIENCE: 3.

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:42.780
GILBERT STRANG: How
do you know that?

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:45.730
You're probably right.

00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:48.190
3, I think, yeah.

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:52.800
Oh yeah, probably a theorem
that if these add 3.

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:55.340
Yeah, so I'm doing
N equals 3 here.

00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:55.840
OK.

00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:57.270
So yeah, I agree.

00:49:57.270 --> 00:50:01.000
That's 3, and what about N to 0?

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.580
That you have to live
with 0 factorial,

00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:10.000
but 0 factorial
is by no means 0.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.200
So what is 0 factorial?

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:17.470
1, yeah.

00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:19.510
I remember when I was
an undergraduate having

00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:20.470
a bet on that.

00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:29.030
I won, but he didn't pay off.

00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:31.480
Yeah, so it's 3.

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:35.320
This is 3 factorial over 3
factorial times 0 factorial.

00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:37.060
So it's 6 over 6 times 1.

00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:38.130
So it's 1.

00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:41.496
Yeah, 1 and 3 and 3 make 7.

00:50:41.496 --> 00:50:44.450
So that proves the formula.

00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:46.190
Well, it doesn't quite
prove the formula,

00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:51.380
but the way to prove
it is by an induction.

00:50:51.380 --> 00:51:00.910
If you like this stuff,
the recursion that you use

00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:01.850
induction on.

00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:04.810
Which is just what we did
now, what we did here.

00:51:04.810 --> 00:51:11.130
Here comes in a number
4, and it cuts through,

00:51:11.130 --> 00:51:14.910
and then we just counted
the 4 pieces there.

00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:23.250
So yeah, so let me just tell
you what the r then and m.

00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:26.250
The number we're looking
for is the number

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:30.780
that we had with one less cut.

00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:35.310
So that's the previous
count of flat pieces

00:51:35.310 --> 00:51:43.080
plus the number that was here
was 4, the number of pieces

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.310
that cut that.

00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:52.000
And that's r of N
minus 1, m minus 1.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:57.790
Yeah, and I won't go further.

00:51:57.790 --> 00:52:02.800
Time's up, but that
rule for recursion

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:08.440
is proved in the section
7.1 taken from the paper

00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:11.030
by Kleinberg and others.

00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.530
Yeah.

00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:14.320
So OK, I think this is--

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:16.180
I don't know what you feel.

00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:20.380
For me, this like gave
me a better feeling

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:25.660
that I was understanding what
kind of functions we had here.

00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:30.430
And so then the question is--

00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:35.220
with this family
of functions, we

00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:45.880
want to choose the A's and
the weights, the A's and b's,

00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:50.130
to match the training data.

00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:56.190
So that we have a problem in
minimizing the total loss,

00:52:56.190 --> 00:53:00.480
and we have a gradient
descent problem.

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:04.370
So we have to find the gradient,
so that Wednesday's job.

00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:09.330
Wednesday's job is to
find the gradient of F,

00:53:09.330 --> 00:53:11.260
and that's back propagation.

00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:11.760
Good.

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:14.040
Thank you very much.

00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:16.790
7.1 is done.
