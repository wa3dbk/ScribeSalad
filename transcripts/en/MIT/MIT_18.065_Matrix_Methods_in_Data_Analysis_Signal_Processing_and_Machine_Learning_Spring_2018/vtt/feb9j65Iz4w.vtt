00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.410
GILBERT STRANG: OK.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.070
Let me just say our next
topic, moving really

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.210
toward machine
learning, would be

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.990
the last section
of chapter 6 about

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.730
stochastic gradient descent.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.810
I think Professor Sra
from computer science,

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.410
if he is able, he will take
the class Friday and tell us

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:01.130
about SGDs, Stochastic Gradient
Descent, critical algorithm.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:07.550
I mean that, at a quick look,
stochastic gradient descent

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.720
does smaller batches at a time,
so it's computationally faster

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.810
than pure gradient descent.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.150
But also, stochastic
gradient descent

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.990
is able to solve
probabilistic problems where

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.300
you're trying to minimize
an expected value instead

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.310
of a function.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.220
Anyway, it's an important thing.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.450
Actually, there is
a lecture at 2:00

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:42.020
in neuroscience about the
gradient descent algorithms.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.110
And then Professor Boyd
is speaking here at 4:30

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.040
this afternoon.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.330
It's overwhelming.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:57.350
So I'm going to talk today
about several topics that are

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.250
specific parts of optimization.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.910
Linear programming is a very
famous part of optimization.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.170
I don't know if you've met it.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.400
I think it's worth knowing
what the inputs are

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.270
and what's the key fact
about linear programming.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.870
And, of course, also,
what are the algorithms.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.150
That's usually what
we want to know.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.460
What's the problem?

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.980
What are the results,
the mathematical results?

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.910
And what are the
computational tools?

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.220
Yes, so that's very established.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.200
Max-flow min-cut is one
specific linear programming

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.780
that I think maybe would
serve as the best example.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.310
And then two-person
games, have you met those?

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.830
So would you know
what the rules are

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.330
in a two-person zero-sum game?

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.930
In game theory, those are
the ones that are clear--

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.230
everything's
well-established there.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.850
And, in fact, they're
equivalent to a linear program.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.640
So that's why those two
are coming in today.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.860
And then the key fact about
two-person games and about

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.870
linear programming is duality.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.060
So if there's any
word on that board,

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.640
it's the one in capital
letters that has math content.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.190
I'm just going to start
with linear programming

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:35.190
and then move on.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.965
So what's a linear program?

00:03:37.965 --> 00:03:41.610
It's we're optimizing
a linear cost function.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.580
So we're minimizing
the cost c transpose x.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.810
So that vector x is the
unknown that we're looking for,

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.210
and this vector c
is the cost vector.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:59.540
So that is c1 x1
plus, plus cn xn.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.450
So you can see why it's
called linear programming.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.130
The cost is linear.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.560
The constraints are also linear.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:19.820
So the constraints on x are
a set of linear equations.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.480
Of course, I'm not thinking of
A as being a square invertible

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.070
matrix.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.100
No way.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.680
If it were, that would
tell us what x had to be

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.420
and our problem would be over.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.630
We have n unknowns.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.470
This is m by n, of course.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.060
x is n by 1.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.000
That's our unknown vector.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.520
And I'm thinking that m
would be smaller than n.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.250
But we do have
constraints, and now comes

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.780
the thing that makes linear
programming not actually

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.280
linear.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.410
And that's the constraint
x greater or equal to 0.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.960
And I've written
that as a vector

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:14.840
but that means x1 greater
or equal to 0, on to xn

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.110
greater or equal to 0.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.010
So it's a vector inequality.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:24.080
So we have minimizing
a very simple function

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.170
with pretty straightforward
constraints but inequality

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.570
constraints.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.690
So the set of--

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.210
these two together
are the constraints.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.060
And in linear algebra--

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:45.710
in linear programming language
this is called a feasible set

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.680
of x's.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:54.250
It's the constraint set,
capital K in the notes.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:06:01.660
So let me draw a
picture to show--

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.910
or maybe I'll just ask.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.040
How many of you are
already familiar

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.060
with linear programming?

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.700
Oh, quite a lot.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.900
So I won't belabor the point.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.600
But let me just draw a picture.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:22.340
So my picture will be just here.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.730
So that's n equals 3.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.880
So this is the x1, x2, x3 space.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.450
And x greater or
equal to 0 means what?

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:40.830
It means that I'm in this
1/8 of this space, right?

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.310
It's the non-negative--
well, I would say quadrant

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.190
but I really should
say octant because it's

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.630
1/8 of the full 3D space.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.250
So I'm in here.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:59.250
And then maybe I have m as
maybe just one constraint.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:08.880
So let me take the cost to be,
say, x1 plus 2 x2 plus 5 x3,

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.360
say.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.100
And the constraint, I'm just
going to have one equation--

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.110
x1 plus x2.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:22.380
Let me make it easy, make that
constraint an easy one to--

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:27.960
so this is what we
want to minimize.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:33.210
And that's what we have
to satisfy, as well

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.070
as x greater or equal to 0.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.150
So that's a plane.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.410
One equation gives
us a plane in R3.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.085
The plane would go through--

00:07:47.222 --> 00:07:57.110
would hit the axes at 3, 0, 0.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.990
And so the min--

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.840
the point has to
lie on that plane.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.250
And it has to lie in the octant,
so that plane is chopped off

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.960
to be a triangle.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.820
This is a good visualization
of linear programming.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.470
And what's the conclusion?

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.210
Well, our cost is linear.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.800
So the result is that one
of these three corners

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.860
is the winner.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.040
It could happen.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.570
It could happen that maybe I
have equal values on those two

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.480
corners, and therefore
all the way along

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.309
would be also winners.

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:39.559
But when I have a
linear function,

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.960
it's a maximum at the ends.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:46.370
And these are the ends,
those three corners.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:56.330
So 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, or 0,
0, 3 are the three corners,

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.640
and one of those is the winner
and the problem is solved.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.290
And, in fact, for this
case, since I'm minimizing,

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.230
I guess it would be
that corner that wins.

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:09.080
So let me give it
a star, not an x.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.480
Yes.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.980
3, 0, 0 because that--

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:13.600
oh.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.100
No, that's 3.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:24.980
So the value turned out to
be 3 at the point 3, 0, 0.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.050
And that's x star.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:30.875
Good.

00:09:30.875 --> 00:09:33.770
Good, good, good.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.290
What more do I
want to do, I said?

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:37.530
Yes.

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.322
AUDIENCE: Shouldn't it
be at point 0, 0, 3?

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.650
GILBERT STRANG: Should it be--

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:44.870
oh, no.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:47.730
0, 0, 3 would have x3 is 3.

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:48.350
That's fine.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.630
It gives us a chance, I think.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.030
That would give me a cost of 15.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:53.930
This would give me a
cost of 6, and that

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:55.270
would give me a cost of 3.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:55.770
Yes.

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:02.750
It's obvious that if we could
enumerate all the corners,

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:09.290
we would have a super fast
way to get the answer.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:14.260
But the trouble is, of course,
that for large values of m

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.810
and n, there are
exponentially many corners,

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.830
and we don't want
to see them all.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:30.050
So that's what makes linear
programming take time and need

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:31.200
ideas.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.800
So, for algorithms,
there are two types

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:39.370
of algorithms, two types
of codes that solve these.

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:45.320
The older, well-established
ones are the--

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:56.860
so one way is the simplex
method, which finds a corner.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.730
We know the optimum
one of the corners.

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:07.020
So it will find one corner, and
it will go to the next corner.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:15.280
So if it starts at
one of these corners,

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:21.610
it will travel along an
edge that lowers the cost.

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:25.050
And it has to stop at the
end because it's linear.

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:27.610
The cost will keep going
down and going down

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:32.200
until it bumps
into the end point,

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.910
and then it can't go further.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.940
And then we would, from
that next corner, we

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.185
would go to the next corner.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:49.090
Each time, it's like steepest
descent on the edges.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:52.550
From the first corner,
we go the steepest way

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:56.320
till we can't go further,
we've hit another corner.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.020
And we recompute
the linear algebra,

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:03.880
find which direction
is steepest from there.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.490
So that's the idea of
the simplex method,

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:09.190
which was invented by Dantzig.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:20.310
And the algebra is not going
to be in today's lecture

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:23.020
but it's straightforward.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.340
Well, people have to
optimize it because that's

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.200
a highly frequently used method.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.580
Yes.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:35.250
But then, about 20 years
later maybe, or 30, I

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:40.980
remember going to a lecture in
downtown Boston by Karmarkar.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.360
So I have to put his name down--

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:44.995
Karmarkar.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:55.950
And he was in The New York
Times, all the newspapers,

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:58.890
so it was a big deal.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:04.190
He had an alternative algorithm.

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:09.860
And the exact
algorithm he proposed

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:15.200
hasn't survived until
today but the idea has.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:21.920
And the idea was to go to travel
inside the feasible set and not

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.420
around the edges.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:27.800
So his idea-- because
in here, would maybe

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:31.670
travel down near that edge,
start again, travel again.

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:38.900
So it's steepest descent in the
constraint set, the feasible

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:39.920
set.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:46.310
And you can use
calculus and this idea.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:51.440
So this is interior
point method.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.440
So I'll just use
the word interior.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:14:01.550
That's telling us that we're
inside the feasible set.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:04.490
We don't hit, come all
the way to the boundary

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:06.920
intentionally,
because we want room

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.490
to move, and to find
derivatives, and to use

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:13.780
Newton's method to minimize.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:17.930
You choose a search direction,
just as all of optimization

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:18.950
does.

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:20.780
And in that search
direction, you

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:25.130
track it and you
stop before you bump

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.800
into the edge of
the feasible set.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.010
And then you compute
derivatives again.

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:32.270
So you can use calculus.

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:35.120
And it's a method that--

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.130
it's an idea that--

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.760
the interior idea
came before Karmarkar.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:46.460
But he got super publicity,
so it really got attention,

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.020
got new thinking.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:52.080
And new ideas came partly
from people at MIT.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:01.180
And these two are now still
locked in competition.

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:06.710
One hasn't beaten the
other in all problems.

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:11.390
So linear programming is here.

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:13.760
But then, for
nonlinear programming,

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.330
quadratic programming,
where the cost is quadratic,

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:21.320
nonlinear programming,
semi-definite programming--

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.890
that's where you have a
matrix unknown and matrix

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.200
constraints--

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.250
those are all-- the more
complicated you get,

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:35.960
the more it tends to be
interior point methods.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.147
That's a summary of
linear programming.

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:44.500
Now I'd like to give an example.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.390
And then I haven't
told you the main--

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:48.525
well, let me tell you the
main fact about duality.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:55.090
This is really-- and I'll write
that maybe here next to it.

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:05.230
So duality is there's a
dual program, a dual LP.

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:12.770
And that dual is going to do
a maximum instead of a minimum

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:20.030
And the cost is going to involve
the b from the primal problem.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:24.980
So this is now called the primal
problem, and this is its dual.

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.320
So they're twin problems.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.230
They use the same data
but quite differently.

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:33.030
It's like transposing things.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:36.890
So let's call it the unknown y.

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:47.030
So for y1 to ym, I guess,
because b, the right-hand side

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:49.940
over here, is m by 1.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:59.190
So that's maximize that subject
to-- what are the constraints?

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:03.080
Well, the cost function over
here, c, the cost vector,

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.260
goes into the constraints.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:10.220
And I think the greater or
equal sign probably becomes

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.190
a less or equal to sign.

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:15.650
The A gets transposed.

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:20.660
I think that's probably
the constraint in the dual.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:23.020
And it happens it
doesn't need y.

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:26.690
We don't have y greater
or equal to 0 over here.

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:28.820
So that's a dual problem.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.910
It has a linear cost.

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:35.720
It has linear
inequality constraints.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.480
It can be solved by
the simplex method.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.570
You could choose whether you
solve that one or this one,

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:45.761
because if you solve
one, you solve the other.

00:17:45.761 --> 00:17:48.530
The two are closely
connected and that's

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:51.140
the key idea of duality.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:56.745
So maybe I'll put the idea of,
first of all, a weak duality.

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:08.160
Which says that this quantity
that we're trying to maximize--

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.180
we're getting it as
large as possible--

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:18.630
is always less or equal
to any c transpose x.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:28.020
This is for any
feasible, allowed--

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:32.430
any x and y that
satisfy the constraints.

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:35.640
Remember, feasible means
satisfies the constraints.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.300
So, in other words, this
problem, this maximization

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.190
problem, you're trying
to push this up.

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:46.020
The minimization problem,
you're trying to pull this down.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.950
And it's easier to show
that the one, the b

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.860
transpose-- it's easier
to show that inequality.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.360
Let's do that.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.150
So b transpose y proof.

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:01.560
It should be a one-line proof.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.290
So b transpose y--

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.830
what do I do?

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.950
So b transpose y well,
I look over here.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:14.280
That's where b shows up.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:24.900
That's x transpose A
transpose y, because b is Ax.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:29.730
I'm feasible, so my b is Ax.

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:32.700
And for any x-- this
is for this is for any

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.930
x that b is going to be Ax.

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:38.340
So am I good so far?

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.730
And now what do I do?

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.440
Now I look here.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.920
I see A transpose y sitting
right in front of me.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:50.760
So I say, well, OK,
less or equal to.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.560
And I guess I'm done.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.870
A transpose y is
less or equal to c.

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:59.880
So I have x transpose
c, c transpose x.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:04.800
So this equals this,
less or equal that.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.780
I've got it.

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:11.820
Weak duality is just put
together the requirements

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.650
on x and y and you have it.

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:19.600
But was this important?

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.300
If the mathematics
is right, everything

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.840
has to have its
place, play its role.

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:32.460
And so what's the role of x
greater or equal to 0 there?

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.260
Why do we need x--

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:40.160
If we just even think of
n equal 1, just a number,

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.970
where do we use the fact that
x is greater or equal to 0?

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:45.020
Do we use it?

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:52.975
This looks so smooth,
because A transpose y--

00:20:52.975 --> 00:20:58.880
I'll write that as x
transpose c for the moment,

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:03.720
just so your eye says
that's the same x transpose,

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.010
and the A transpose y
is less or equal to c.

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:08.926
Where is x greater or
equal to 0 coming in?

00:21:08.926 --> 00:21:10.732
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:10.732 --> 00:21:11.565
GILBERT STRANG: Yes.

00:21:11.565 --> 00:21:12.060
AUDIENCE: Like above.

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:12.905
It's from the that.

00:21:12.905 --> 00:21:14.280
GILBERT STRANG:
Yes, that's true.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.070
But I want to see--

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:19.860
so here's my point.

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.720
The fact that A
transpose y is less

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.880
or equal to c, that's fine.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.420
Highly important.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:30.300
But if x was negative, it
would be the other way.

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:31.890
You would go the
other way and you

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.780
wouldn't have what you want.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:38.220
So we really do use the fact
that x is greater or equal to 0

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:41.250
to say that I have this
less or equal this.

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:44.310
And then I multiply
by something positive

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:46.290
and then I still
have less or equal.

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:47.620
OK, good.

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:50.800
So the math is right.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.160
Everything does its part.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:56.700
And then, of course,
the beautiful result,

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.680
the important
result is that there

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.330
is strong duality,
just called duality,

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:06.810
which is that at the maximum--

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:10.380
now this is not for any
x and y but this is for--

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:14.700
this is going to be for
x y star, the winner,

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.560
and x star, the winner--

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.570
equality holds.

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:19.500
So that's duality.

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.540
The maximum in the
dual problem is

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:27.550
the same as the minimum
in the primal problem.

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:29.640
The two have met.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.550
There is no duality gap.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:36.360
In some cooked up
nonlinear problems,

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:41.620
there could be a gap between
the maximum and the minimum,

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.920
but you hope not.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:48.010
And here the big theorem is not.

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:49.390
They're equal.

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:53.580
You push this up,
push that down.

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:59.100
Another way to say that
duality is that this is

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.050
pushing that up at some max--

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:06.660
I could write that as a maximum
of a minimum equaling a minimum

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.660
of a maximum, if I wanted.

00:23:12.366 --> 00:23:16.270
So the duality in
linear programming

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:20.710
was the same as von
Neumann's minimax theorem.

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:25.300
And his theorem applied
to two-person games.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:34.090
So the key math result is
duality for linear programming,

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:38.110
and it's going to be-- you'll
see the same thing happening

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:41.200
for two-person games.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.590
And it's a minimax
theorem, or a saddle point.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:50.740
Or it's just things
come out right.

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:51.410
Yes.

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:58.440
So just to mention that
mathematical programming,

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:03.440
of course, includes much
more difficult problems.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.850
This is linear programming.

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:10.790
That problem, as you see, has
a beautiful, simple theory.

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:16.410
And the paying attention
is paying attention

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:19.410
to the algorithm, because
you've got two important choices

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:21.770
and they both get
highly developed.

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:25.490
Now, OK.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:28.740
So for game, now I'm
going to turn to--

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:33.930
well, I'll do an example
of max flow equal min cut,

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:35.900
just see what--

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.960
and then go to two-person game.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.100
So here's an example of a--

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:56.200
so I start with a graph.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.400
Let me just imagine.

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.400
So this is the source.

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:11.680
This is the sink.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.770
And I'm sending flow
through the network.

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:19.810
So it's a network that
I'm sending flow through.

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.760
So my job is to maximize--

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:27.380
I'll set x at the
source to be 0.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:36.130
And then the flow, the total
flow will come into the sink.

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:42.520
So I want to maximize
x at the sink.

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.080
So it's a linear programming
and there are constraints.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.370
So what are the constraints?

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:50.130
Every edge has a capacity.

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:51.240
So let's see.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:57.460
Suppose that edge
has capacity 5.

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:01.710
Let me put capacities
on all these edges.

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:07.860
2, 1, 3, 4.

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.780
I'm just stabbing around here.

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.710
1,000.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:22.310
And let me say 2 and 4.

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:25.570
I have no idea what's
happening here.

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:31.170
But if we see the problem, we'll
probably be able to solve it.

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:36.710
So these constraints are
that the flow variable,

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:42.520
which would be the y that I'm
trying to maximize, cannot--

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.340
the amount of flow,
just in ordinary words,

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:50.170
the amount of flow on
the edges can't go higher

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:51.520
than the capacity.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.880
I could send 11 along this
edge, but then I've got nowhere

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.870
to send it after that.

00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:00.670
I could send, well,
900 on that edge.

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:04.980
but, obviously, it
would get stuck there.

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:09.250
So the question is,
what's the maximum I

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:11.620
can send through that network?

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:15.670
It's a classical problem.

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:20.400
And, in fact, it's an
integer programming problem.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.950
These are all
integer capacities.

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:27.560
I could insist on integer flow.

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:32.880
But it's a very
remarkable integer problem

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.080
because I could allow
fractions and the answer

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:40.020
would not be a-- would
not involve fractions.

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:44.730
In other words, if I keep
it as an integer problem,

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:49.420
then the mathematics
is definitely

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.660
harder for an integer problem.

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:53.380
What's different?

00:27:53.380 --> 00:28:02.720
So the x's could be integers
or they could be real numbers.

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:11.000
Over here, they
were real numbers.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.040
I happened to get
an integer for this,

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:20.540
but if I had 10 crossing
planes in 15 dimensions,

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:24.330
the integers would
be totally lost.

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:32.460
But the point is, here, that
if I allow real numbers,

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:36.360
it doesn't get me any more
flow, that the winning

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.490
flow is an integer anyway.

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:43.350
So it's an integer problem
which can be safely relaxed,

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:48.240
and you can safely use simplex
method, or Karmarkar's method,

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:53.250
or any interior point
method with non-integers,

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:57.600
because in the interior here
you're not starting or ending

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.070
at integers.

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:04.650
You can do it because
the integer answer

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:07.340
will be, in the end, better.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.480
And what is that answer?

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:16.470
I think I've made those
capacities too easy to--

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:17.940
oh, I didn't do this one.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.710
So what shall I-- shall
I make it large, like 9?

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:29.280
I don't know.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:40.460
What's the best we can
do through that network?

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:42.620
Can you-- I can't
see it from here yet?

00:29:45.515 --> 00:29:47.580
What should I do?

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.885
Obviously, in this
simple problem

00:29:49.885 --> 00:29:54.360
I can get anything I want
pretty much that far.

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.040
But then what can I do?

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:00.430
Let me even make that 19.

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:10.710
So I'm not imposing much of
a limit on that edge either.

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:12.920
But these edges are
quite tight limits,

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:15.810
and these are sort of
intermediate limits.

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:22.140
What do you think is the
most I can send through?

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:25.800
And how would you show me
that I couldn't send more?

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.020
That's the key question.

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:31.530
I want to get a bound on the--

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:34.250
an upper bound on this maximum.

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:36.860
This maximum getting
into the sink

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:41.900
is less or equal to-- and
what number would you propose?

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.270
Could I get 1,000 through?

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:49.460
I could start, but of course
it would pile up there.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:50.810
I couldn't get further.

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:57.574
What do you think is
the best I can do?

00:30:57.574 --> 00:30:58.550
AUDIENCE: 10?

00:30:58.550 --> 00:30:59.860
GILBERT STRANG: 10?

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.380
I can't do more than 10?

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:04.340
How could I do 10?

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:07.140
AUDIENCE: So you go 12--

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:08.710
GILBERT STRANG: 12 this way?

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:09.293
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:09.293 --> 00:31:10.242
19.

00:31:10.242 --> 00:31:11.200
GILBERT STRANG: Oh, OK.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.070
AUDIENCE: And then
split the 8 and 2.

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:14.733
Can you split?

00:31:14.733 --> 00:31:15.650
GILBERT STRANG: I see.

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:19.280
10 that way, 10 this-- yes,
absolutely you can split.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:23.650
And then this could go here, and
that would be able to go there.

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:25.910
So I can get 10 through.

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:27.220
Correct.

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.180
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:31.190
GILBERT STRANG: Can
I do anything better?

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:35.900
Oh, I could be sending some
up this way at the same time.

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:38.950
So I could get 3 along the top.

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:41.440
So this is like an auction.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.720
We can get up to 13.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:53.300
Can we get-- so that was 3 going
this way and 10 going this way.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:58.248
Is 13 an-- can I not exceed 13?

00:31:58.248 --> 00:31:58.790
AUDIENCE: 14?

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:00.670
AUDIENCE: 14.

00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:04.010
GILBERT STRANG: Do I hear 14?

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:06.470
Oh, I've got a lot
of room for one more.

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:07.670
So, OK.

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:10.440
So 14 in any case.

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:10.940
All right.

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:12.227
Do I hear 15?

00:32:12.227 --> 00:32:14.060
AUDIENCE: Can you do
two more on the bottom,

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:15.710
like 12 instead of 10?

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:18.350
GILBERT STRANG: If I did
12, then what would I do?

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:20.380
AUDIENCE: Split
the other two up.

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:23.170
GILBERT STRANG: I'd
send two up here.

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:24.920
What am I going to do
with them from here?

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.027
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:26.027 --> 00:32:27.110
GILBERT STRANG: Send them?

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:28.070
AUDIENCE: Up again.

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:30.630
GILBERT STRANG: Up
again, and along.

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:37.850
But then the 3 that I had right
now would be cut back to 1.

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:46.780
It's a lot of fun,
this max flow problem.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:49.260
And I'm looking
for a bound to know

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:51.990
when to quit, to know
when I've optimized.

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:53.850
That's the whole
idea of duality,

00:32:53.850 --> 00:33:00.940
is to find some upper thing
that I'm trying to push down

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:03.350
but I can't go beyond it.

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:06.540
So I don't think I
could get more than--

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:09.040
you see, everything has
to cross this middle.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.610
So 3 and 4.

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:13.540
And I don't think
I could beat 23.

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:18.360
If somebody said more than
23, I would be very doubtful,

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:21.352
because I couldn't get
it across the middle.

00:33:21.352 --> 00:33:24.390
But then, can I get 23?

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:25.920
I doubt it.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.840
Maybe 14 is the best possible.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.330
So how would we show that
14 is the best possible?

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:37.760
I think if I could find--

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:43.610
so this is called a cut,
a cut in this network.

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:45.185
Oh, yes, I see a cut.

00:33:45.185 --> 00:33:46.985
A cut like there.

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:51.750
You see that?

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:58.180
Every bit of flow has
got to cross that cut.

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:03.640
And the total capacity crossing
is the 3 and the 1 and the 2

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:06.510
and the 8, which is 14.

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:08.590
So I can't get more
than 14 through.

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:13.620
And somehow that cut
is loaded to capacity.

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:19.494
Probably those edges
all have to be fully up

00:34:19.494 --> 00:34:23.530
to capacity that cross the cut.

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:27.290
So the cut is a
separation of edges

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:29.800
that go with the source and--

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.110
sorry-- nodes that go
with the source, nodes

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:33.510
that go with the sink.

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:34.010
Yes.

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:39.219
And then it's the
edges across the cut.

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.739
Is that OK for an example?

00:34:45.739 --> 00:34:47.679
So that's the duality.

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:51.679
The maximum flow
turned out to be 14,

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:54.139
and the minimum cut
turned out to be 14.

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:58.110
And when those match, 14
equal 14, I know I'm through.

00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:00.560
I know I'm through because
I'm able to get 14 through

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.560
and I could never get more.

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.060
Yes.

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.880
3 and 4 and 6 and 8.

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.770
Yes.

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:11.180
And, of course,
in a big network,

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:15.110
the maximum cut is not
going to be visible.

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:18.590
Well, you couldn't-- it would
have thousands of edges.

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:21.080
You couldn't see
what you were doing,

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:26.660
But you could solve this
problem fast, actually fast.

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:28.440
And it's an important--

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:31.210
in practice, it's an
important example.

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:36.740
A lot of other things fit into
the max flow min cut example.

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:40.310
And therefore solving
it in faster than-- oh,

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:44.150
I didn't even say about speed.

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:49.760
So the simplex method, almost
always it's average case.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:51.790
Dan Spielman, who
was on the faculty

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:58.520
here, who's just
terrific in this area,

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:03.260
was maybe among the first
to study the average case.

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:08.960
So for an average
choice of A and b and c,

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:11.180
instead of making
the worst choice--

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:15.050
for the worst choice, you
can create a feasible set

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:17.030
that it has to go
corner, corner, corner,

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:22.310
corner to get to the end,
so the simplex method would

00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:24.890
take exponentially long.

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:27.020
But that's extremely rare.

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:30.020
It doesn't happen in
practice, I think.

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:33.590
And the average one
is a polynomial,

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:40.580
so it's a fast
method on average.

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:43.880
And we can show-- actually,
that was a famous result that

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:51.260
came from Russia, that linear
programming is in the big P

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:55.220
versus LP world,
linear programming

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:57.620
goes with P. Linear
programming is

00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:01.480
a problem that can be
solved in polynomial time.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:05.700
The simplex method won't always
do it but it can be done.

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:06.200
Yes.

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:10.430
There came into the world,
the ellipsoid methods,

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:15.650
and it was an exciting time to
decide that linear programming

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:18.400
was actually P and not LP.

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:27.130
So this is a case of duality
where you can understand

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:32.620
duality by the statement
that the flow cannot exceed

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.720
the capacity of the cut.

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:42.460
So that's what duality
is, that any flow has

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:51.955
to be less or equal the
capacity of any cut,

00:37:51.955 --> 00:37:56.650
the capacity being
the sum of the ones.

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:58.720
So, of course, there
are other cuts.

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:01.810
That cut has to be
crossed, but that's

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:05.710
gone 3, 7, 14, 22 capacity.

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:11.030
So the 14 capacity
was the minimum,

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:12.620
and that gave the maximum.

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:13.120
Nice.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.060
Isn't it nice?

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:14.560
Yes.

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:22.860
So there is another world
here of two-person games

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:26.190
that also has duality
and could be expressed.

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:31.680
So let me just talk finally
today about two-person games.

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:35.430
So the two persons
are x and y of course.

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:37.770
What other names
could they have?

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:44.670
And there is a matrix involved.

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:47.325
This is the payoff matrix.

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:53.930
So let me take a very
simple game first.

00:38:56.690 --> 00:39:01.890
So x is going to choose
one of these rows,

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:05.040
and y is going to choose
one of these columns.

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.920
And let's say
payoff from x to y.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:16.980
I like it that way because,
then, x, who's paying,

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:21.090
is going to be minimizing,
as x was up here.

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:24.170
And y, who's
collecting, is going

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:28.070
to be maximizing,
as in the dual.

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:30.660
So the payoff-- well, let's see.

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:37.050
I think maybe 1, 4, 2, 8 would
be probably a fairly easy game

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:39.900
to play.

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:43.290
So it's a two-person
game, a zero-sum game.

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:54.630
Zero sum means--
that means all pay--

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:58.026
what x pays goes to y.

00:39:58.026 --> 00:40:03.840
y gets all that x pays.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:08.250
There's no third party here.

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:09.300
No lawyers involved.

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:16.280
And y is going to
choose a column,

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.870
and x is going to choose a row.

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:23.790
And x wants to make it small,
and y wants to make it big.

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:26.100
So what happens in this game?

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:28.230
What does y choose
to make it big?

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:29.760
The second column.

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.930
What does x choose
to make it small?

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:33.420
The first row.

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:37.510
So it's going to be
focused in on that 2,

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:42.920
because if y keeps choosing
that column, 2 is the best--

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:46.170
the least that-- x is
going to have to pay 2,

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:50.550
and he achieves that by
choosing the first row.

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:52.820
So it's a simple game.

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:54.890
That's a saddle point.

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:59.000
It's a minimum for
y in its column,

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.090
and it's a maximum
for x in its row.

00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:05.400
But, of course, a
matrix, another matrix

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:08.380
might not have such
a saddle point.

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:09.630
So let me-- do you see--

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:12.960
OK with this game?

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:15.090
That would be a sort
of straightforward game

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:17.460
where simple strategy--

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:22.320
column 2 every time, row 1
every time is the optimal.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.570
But now let me
just exchange that.

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:33.440
So, again, x1 and x2.

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:36.230
y1 and y2 are the two columns.

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:37.100
What happens now?

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:43.641
Well, y kind of likes
the big number 8 there.

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:48.550
So it goes for the second.

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:51.580
The second column still
has the bigger numbers.

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:55.180
So y aims for column 2.

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:58.440
But then what does x do?

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:03.143
What row does x choose
if y is in the column 2?

00:42:03.143 --> 00:42:04.010
AUDIENCE: Second.

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:05.520
GILBERT STRANG: The second.

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:06.160
OK.

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:09.600
So have I found a saddle point?

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:14.640
Where y chooses this
column, x chooses this row,

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:16.810
is that a saddle point?

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:17.310
No.

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:20.100
Because what will y do now?

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:24.480
He sees x choosing the
second row all the time,

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:29.280
and y sees a 4, a very
tempting 4, in that row.

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:35.040
So y is going to choose y1,
the first column, pretty often.

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:38.580
Not all the time, because
what happens if he just--

00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:42.300
if y chooses this
column all the time,

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:45.270
then x will choose
this row and the payoff

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:50.880
would only be 1, so that things
went downhill for y there.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:53.950
So this is not a saddle point.

00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:54.840
And what do we do?

00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:07.390
Mixed strategy, which is y
will choose the two columns

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:10.770
with some probabilities
that add to 1.

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:19.360
So there will be a third
possibility, that p x1 and 1--

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:22.840
I'm sorry-- p y1.

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:28.120
p times this column and 1 minus
p times the second column.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:38.410
So that will be p plus 1
minus p times 8, and 4p plus 1

00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:41.250
minus p times 2.

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:44.170
That's this mixed column.

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:51.550
By mixing his strategy,
we have a strategy

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:53.050
like a third person, y3.

00:43:55.630 --> 00:44:03.520
And, of course, the x is going
to notice after a while what

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:06.350
the strategy is.

00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:09.650
This is an open competition.

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:13.040
You're not hiding-- you're
not able to hide anything.

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:16.220
You might think, well,
maybe y will jump around,

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.620
but that's foolishness.

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:24.470
y is going to end
up finding the best

00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:26.880
choice of p between 0 and 1.

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:32.060
And it will actually
be between 0 and 1

00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:38.010
because the extreme strategies
of column 1 and column 2

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:39.760
were not winners.

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.290
But now x is going
to do the same thing.

00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:44.660
p x1-- he's going to--

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:51.160
he or she is going to
combine those rows.

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:58.420
So this would be p1 for
the first row, and 1--

00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:03.900
sorry-- p-- oh, I better
choose another number.

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:05.510
What's another letter than p?

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:06.460
AUDIENCE: q.

00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:08.620
GILBERT STRANG: q?

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:09.810
OK, q.

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:21.360
So this row is a combination
of those rows, so it's q plus 1

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:32.500
minus q times 4 in the first
position, and p times 8 and 1

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:35.760
minus p-- q times 8.

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:39.940
q times 8 and 1 minus q times 2.

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:44.242
I'm sorry that I've
written this too small.

00:45:44.242 --> 00:45:46.126
But what's going to happen?

00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:54.200
What's going to determine
p and q and solve the game?

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:04.100
Well, if these are
equal, then what happens?

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:08.180
Then x is OK with either one.

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:14.330
x has nothing to choose
if those are equal

00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:18.740
and y is staying with his
mixed strategy, which gives him

00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:22.640
this third combination column.

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:24.620
Then x is good.

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:28.730
Now, you might say, well, then
x could do what it wanted.

00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:31.850
But x couldn't do
what it wanted.

00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:37.850
If x doesn't stick with the
optimal strategy q for x,

00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:40.040
then y will take advantage.

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:45.460
So, really, the game
settles down to once--

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:47.630
so these should be equal.

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:51.770
So when those are
equal, what do I get?

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:57.110
I have p-- it looks
like I have 8 minus 7p

00:46:57.110 --> 00:46:59.000
there for the first one.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.670
And here, I have 4p minus 2p.

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:04.640
That's 2p plus 1.

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:07.074
Did I get that possibly right?

00:47:07.074 --> 00:47:08.038
AUDIENCE: Plus 2.

00:47:11.412 --> 00:47:15.550
GILBERT STRANG: 2, 4p
minus 2p is the 2p.

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:16.690
Oh, it's 2.

00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:17.640
Yes.

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.190
OK.

00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:20.770
So those are equal.

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:25.635
And that tells me that
9p is 6, and p is 2/3.

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:33.800
So it turned out that
the best strategy for y

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:39.770
is 2/3 on the first column
which didn't look so promising,

00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:42.950
and 1/3 on the second column.

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:48.210
And by creating that strategy,
what do these numbers come out

00:47:48.210 --> 00:47:48.710
to be?

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:50.730
And they're supposed
to come out equal.

00:47:50.730 --> 00:47:57.040
So 4p plus-- so 4
times 2/3 is 8/3,

00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:00.320
plus 1 minus p is 1/3 times--

00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:03.140
plus 2/3 is 10/3.

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:06.260
So I think that this is 10/3.

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:10.250
And if that one isn't
10/3, I'm very surprised.

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:14.220
So that's 2/3-- help.

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:16.172
Is it?

00:48:16.172 --> 00:48:23.140
4p, 2p, 4/3.

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:27.860
Yes, it's telling
me they're the same.

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:29.070
Did I set them equal?

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:29.570
Yes.

00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:30.920
I set them equal to find p.

00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:33.330
So they have to be the same.

00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:38.070
Except for instructor mistakes,
which never happen, I suppose.

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:38.910
OK.

00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:41.580
So those should be equal.

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:48.330
Then x has no way to do
better, choose these columns.

00:48:48.330 --> 00:48:50.220
But he can't choose
those columns freely--

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:55.590
those rows freely because y
could take advantage, unless--

00:48:55.590 --> 00:49:00.990
so this would give the
best strategy for q--

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:04.030
sorry-- the best q for x.

00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:04.530
Yes.

00:49:07.533 --> 00:49:08.700
Do you see that picture now?

00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:10.860
There could be other--

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:13.470
it could be a much
bigger matrix, of course.

00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:15.150
There could be other columns.

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:19.830
Suppose there was a 0, 0 column.

00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:21.630
What difference-- what
would be the effect

00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:25.620
on the optimal strategy of
having that additional column,

00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:29.820
that additional option for y3?

00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:32.130
Well, he wouldn't take it.

00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:34.850
So let's make it more tempting.

00:49:34.850 --> 00:49:38.730
10, 10, 10.

00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:41.360
Oh, he would take that, right?

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:41.860
Yes.

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:45.760
That was not-- so I'm not sure
what I am trying to say here.

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:51.150
Yes.

00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:54.900
There certainly could be--
there could be rows that--

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:59.770
or columns, or rows for x,
that don't enter the mixed,

00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:02.040
the optimal mixed strategy.

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:04.060
A mixed strategy
is some combination

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:08.350
of strategies, some
combination of pure strategies,

00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:11.500
like choose this
column, choose this row.

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:15.820
But some columns may
not-- or rows-- may not

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:17.800
show up in the best mixture.

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:22.342
So I won't complete that
partial thought there.

00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:31.260
So do you see that we
have a duality theorem?

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:35.470
First of all, you could write
that as a linear program.

00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:39.030
The unknown is p for x--

00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:40.190
for y.

00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:42.630
The unknown is q for x.

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:50.370
So, actually, you just have one
unknown in this simple problem,

00:50:50.370 --> 00:50:52.200
for this small problem.

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:55.690
But you have a minimization,
a maximization.

00:50:55.690 --> 00:50:58.260
They meet at the optimum.

00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:05.460
And the duality theorem
becomes the theorem

00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:08.040
for two-person games.

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:12.330
Linear programming
matches two-person games.

00:51:12.330 --> 00:51:16.430
The point about two
persons is very important.

00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:20.400
Three-person games are
incredibly complicated.

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:27.600
No theory at this simple level
would solve three-person games.

00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:32.760
So that's where John
Nash's Nobel Prize

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:35.830
comes into the picture.

00:51:35.830 --> 00:51:38.340
So his Nobel Prize
was in economics

00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:40.710
because of the
wide applications,

00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:45.060
but he was able to
analyze the problem of--

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:47.895
and for functions more
than for matrices--

00:51:47.895 --> 00:51:53.760
of a three-person
or n-person game.

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:57.070
So you know the
story of John Nash?

00:51:57.070 --> 00:52:01.070
The book A Beautiful Mind and
the movie A Beautiful Mind.

00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:03.560
So it's one of those
movies that involves MIT

00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.750
because he was here.

00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:09.760
But you can't recognize
anything about MIT in the movie.

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:12.762
It's like Good Will Hunting.

00:52:12.762 --> 00:52:17.360
You're maybe in some basement
of some remote building.

00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:20.360
But anyway.

00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:22.550
It was of course a tragic--

00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:26.750
tragic, and then cheer, then
wonderful, and then tragic

00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:29.060
again for John Nash.

00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:33.650
He had-- so when
I met him, he was

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:36.470
going to teach linear
algebra, one section,

00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:39.530
but that never developed.

00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:41.310
That was when he was--

00:52:41.310 --> 00:52:45.710
his mental state
was going downhill.

00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:53.010
And he moved to Princeton
and just stayed.

00:52:53.010 --> 00:52:55.640
And then the wonderful
thing was that he improved,

00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:58.820
and then the very sad
thing was his death

00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:04.640
in a car accident on the way
home from the Nobel Prize.

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:09.090
So quite a story,
an amazing story.

00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:10.430
Yes.

00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:17.180
So that's specific optimization
problems, linear programming

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:19.250
and two-person games.

00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:27.240
And I hope that Friday it
will be Professor Sra. Anyway,

00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:30.540
the lecture will certainly
be about stochastic gradient

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:31.200
descent.

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:31.800
Good.

00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:33.350
Thanks.
