00:00:21.746 --> 00:00:23.160
PROFESSOR: So
we're really moving

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.550
along this review of the
highlights of linear algebra.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.460
And today it's matrices Q.
They get that name there.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.500
They have orthonormal columns.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.020
So that's what one looks like.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.920
And then the key fact,
orthonormal columns

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.100
translates directly into that
simple fact that you just

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.400
keep remembering every
time you see Q transpose Q,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.390
you've got the identity matrix.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.820
Let's just see why.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.410
So Q transpose would be--

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.135
I'll take those columns
and make them into rows.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.250
And then I multiply
by Q with the columns.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.830
And what do I get?

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.050
Well hopefully, I get
the identity matrix.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.830
Why?

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.510
Because-- oh yeah, the normal
part tells me that the length

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.800
of each vector--

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.190
that's the length
squared Q transpose Q--

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.650
the length squared is one.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.190
So that gives me the one
in the identity matrix

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.900
all along the diagonal.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.040
And then Q transpose times
a different Q is zero.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.050
That's the ortho part.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.510
So that gives me the zeros.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.290
So that's a simple
identity, but it

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:55.700
translates from a lot of words
into a simple expression.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.130
Now does that mean that in the
other order, Q, Q transpose,

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.810
is that the identity?

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.810
So that's a question
to think about.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.680
Is Q, Q transpose
equal the identity?

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.420
Question, sometimes
yes, sometimes no--

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.025
easy to tell which.

00:02:17.025 --> 00:02:28.830
If the answer is yes, yes when
Q is square, the answer is yes.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.640
If Q is a square m
a square matrix--

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.550
this is saying that
a square matrix

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.750
Q has that inverse on its left.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.450
But for square matrices,
a left inverse,

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.800
Q transpose is also
a right inverse.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.490
So for a square
matrix, if you have

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.210
an inverse that
works on one side,

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.480
it will work on the other side.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.180
So the answer is
yes in that case.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.720
And then in that case, that's
the case when we call Q is--

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.740
well, we really--

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.330
I don't know what
the right name would

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.300
be, but here is the
name everybody uses,

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.695
an orthogonal matrix.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.900
And that's only in their
square case, square.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.330
Q is an orthogonal matrix.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.060
Do you want to just see an
example of how that works?

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.670
So if Q is rectangular--

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.500
let me do a rectangular
Q and a square Q.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.530
So I think there must be a
board up there somewhere.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.030
Here.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.770
OK, square.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.730
All right.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.782
Good to see some
orthogonal matrices,

00:03:56.782 --> 00:03:58.240
because my message
is that they are

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.340
really important in all
kinds of applications.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.220
Let's start two by two.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.160
I can think of
two different ways

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.320
to get an orthogonal matrix.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.050
That's a two by two matrix.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.800
And one of them you
will know immediately,

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.970
cos theta sine theta.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.000
So that's a unit vector.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.990
It's normalized.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.360
Cos squared plus
sine squared is one.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.250
And this guy has to
be orthogonal to it.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.590
So I'll make that minus
sine theta and cos theta.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.530
Those are both length
one, they're orthogonal,

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.960
then this is my Q.
And the inverse of Q

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.630
will be the transpose.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.900
The transpose would put
the minus sign down here

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.180
and would produce
the inverse matrix.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.970
And what is that particular
matrix represent?

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:00.110
Geometrically, where
do we see that matrix?

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.880
It's a rotation, thank you.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.240
It's a rotation of the
whole plane by theta.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.930
Yeah.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.190
So if I apply that to
one, zero for example,

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.600
I get the first column, which
is cos theta sine theta.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.710
And that's just-- let
me draw a picture.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.270
That vector one, zero has
gotten rotated up to--

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.810
so there's the one, zero.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.260
And there, it got rotated
through an angle theta.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.990
And similarly,
zero, one will get

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.650
rotated through an
angle theta to there.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.200
So the whole plane rotates.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.920
Oh, that makes me remember
a highly important,

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:50.370
very important property of
Q. It doesn't change length.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.260
The length of any vector is
the same after you rotate it.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.100
The length of any vector is the
same after you multiply by Q.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.810
Can I just do that?

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.640
I claim any x, any
vector x, I want

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.890
to look at the length of Qx.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.630
And I claim it has
the same length as x.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.750
Actually, that's the
reason in computations

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.460
that orthogonal matrix
are so much loved,

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.330
because no overflow can happen
with orthogonal matrices.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.130
The lengths don't change.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.030
I can multiply by any number
of orthogonal matrices

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.820
and the length don't change.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.960
Can we just see why that's true?

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.670
So what do we have to go on?

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:43.740
What we have to go on is
Q transpose Q equal I.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.350
Whatever we're going to prove,
it's got to come out of that,

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.260
because that's all we know.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.852
So how do I use that
to get that one?

00:06:53.852 --> 00:06:55.810
Well, we haven't said a
whole lot about length,

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.460
but you'll see it all now.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.120
It'll be easier to prove that
the squares are the same.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.760
So what's the what's
the matrix expression

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.410
for the length squared?

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.920
What's the right hand
side of that equation?

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.200
X transpose x, right?

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.560
X transpose x gives me
the sum of the squares.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.670
Pythagoras says that's
the length squared.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:21.030
So that right hand
side is x transpose x.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.530
What's the left side?

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.810
It's the length
squared of this, of Qx.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:32.290
So it must be the same
as Qx transpose Qx.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:36.510
And the claim is that
that equation holds.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:40.030
And do you see it?

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:45.710
So any property from Q has
to just come out directly

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:46.660
from that.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.430
Where is it here?

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.730
Do I just like, push away a
little bit at that left hand

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.070
side and see it?

00:07:55.070 --> 00:08:00.500
Qx transpose is the same
as x transpose Q transpose.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.500
And Qx is Qx.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.560
And now I'm seeing--

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.130
well, you might
say, wait a minute.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.650
The parentheses were
there and there.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:13.160
But I say the most important
law for matrix multiplication

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.560
is you can move parentheses
or throw them away.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.970
Let's throw them away.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:21.230
So in here I'm
seeing Q transpose Q,

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:22.460
which is the identity.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:26.500
So it's true, yeah.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.830
So that means that you're
never under flow or overflow

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:35.770
when you're multiplying by
Q. Every numerical algorithm

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:42.309
is written to use orthogonal
matrices wherever it can.

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:44.545
And here's the first example.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:53.260
I think it may be good for
me to think of other examples

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.720
or for us to think
of other examples

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.790
of orthogonal matrices.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:03.360
So I'm using that word
orthogonal matrix.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.070
We should really be
saying orthonormal.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:11.230
And I'm really thinking
mostly of square ones.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:16.550
So in this square case when
Q transpose is Q inverse.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.140
Of course, that fact
makes it easy to solve

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:27.610
all equations that have Q
as a coefficient matrix,

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:31.180
because you want the inverse
and you just use the transpose.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:40.342
Let's just take some minutes
to think of examples of Q's.

00:09:40.342 --> 00:09:41.800
If they're so
important, there have

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.560
to be interesting examples.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.450
And that was a first one.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:52.180
Now there's one more two by two
example that you should know.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.890
Do you know what that would be?

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:58.990
This will be an example two, and
it's also going to be only two

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.870
by two and real.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:07.310
And what possibility
have I got left here?

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:11.240
I'll use this same first
column, cos theta sine theta,

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:17.620
because that's more or less any
unit vector in two dimensions,

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.030
this has got that form.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:25.036
So what do you propose
for the second column?

00:10:25.036 --> 00:10:25.994
Yes?

00:10:25.994 --> 00:10:29.347
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:29.347 --> 00:10:33.550
PROFESSOR: Yeah, put the
minus sign down here.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.890
So you think does that
make any difference?

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:41.240
So sine theta and
minus cos theta.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.100
I don't know if you've
ever looked at that matrix.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.990
We're trying to collect
together a few matrices that

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:51.050
are worth knowing,
are worth looking at.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.150
Now what's happened here?

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:57.290
You may say that was a trivial
change, which it kind of was.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.150
But it's a different matrix now.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.520
It's not a rotation anymore.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.530
That's not a rotation.

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:08.630
And yeah, somehow
now it's symmetric.

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:15.300
And yeah, it's eigenvectors
must be something or other.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.670
We'll get to those.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:20.970
But what does that matrix do?

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.680
I don't know if you've seen it.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:29.190
If you haven't, it doesn't jump
out, but it's a important case.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:30.960
This is a reflection matrix.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.290
Notice that it's
determinant is minus one.

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:45.500
You have minus cos square
theta, minus sine squared theta.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.940
It's determinant is minus one.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:54.350
There's some eigenvalue
coming up that's got a minus.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:59.960
So what do I mean by
a reflection matrix?

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.265
Let me draw the plane.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.460
So one, zero, let's
follow that, follow again.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.470
One, zero, where does that go?

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:10.950
That gives me the first column.

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:15.800
So as before, it goes
to cos theta sine theta.

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:22.600
And when I say
reflection, let me

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.170
put the mirror into
the picture so you

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.000
see what reflection it is.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.330
The mirror is along here
at angle theta over two,

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.780
theta over two line.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:42.520
So sure enough, one,
zero at angle zero

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:48.960
got reflected into a unit
vector at angle theta,

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:53.730
and halfway between was
theta over two line.

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:55.300
That's OK.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:59.590
Now what about the
other guy, zero, one?

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:01.950
Here's zero, one.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:03.350
I multiply that.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:07.440
Can I put the zero,
one up here, so your I

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.480
does the multiplication?

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.630
Where is the result
of zero, one?

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:19.400
What's the output from
Q applied to zero, one?

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.170
Sine theta minus
cos theta, right?

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.300
It's the second column.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.990
And so where is that?

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:29.000
Well, it's perpendicular
to that guy.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.100
That's what I know.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:34.970
That was the point, that the
two columns are perpendicular.

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:37.910
So it must go down
this way, right?

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:41.630
Sine theta cos theta.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.970
And it doesn't
change the length.

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:47.690
All these facts that we
just learned are key.

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:50.630
So there's zero, one.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:56.960
And it goes to this guy, which
is whatever that second column

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.190
is sine theta minus cos theta.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:07.730
And if you check
that, actually, gosh!

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.800
This is like plain geometry.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:14.150
I believe-- it never occurred
to me before-- but I believe it,

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:18.525
that this angle
going down to there,

00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:22.850
that that goes straight through,
and that the halfway one

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:23.650
is that line.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.580
Yeah, I think that
picture has got it.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.070
And I think it's in the note.

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.390
So that's a reflection matrix.

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:38.650
Well, that's a two by
two reflection matrix.

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:45.060
Would you like to see some
other matrices like this one,

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.590
but larger?

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:53.940
They're named after a
guy named Householder.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:57.660
So these are
Householder reflections.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.210
What am I doing here?

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:07.260
I'm collecting together
some orthogonal matrices

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.930
that are useful and important.

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:15.530
And Householder found
a whole bunch of them.

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:18.990
And his algorithm
is a much used part

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.330
of numerical linear algebra.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.400
So he started with
a unit vector.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:31.040
Start with a unit vector
u transpose u equal one.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.940
So the length of
the vector is one.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:34.890
And then he created--

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.970
let's name it after him--

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:37.470
H.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:41.865
He created this matrix,
the identity minus two u,

00:15:41.865 --> 00:15:42.780
u transpose.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.325
And I believe that that's
a really useful matrix.

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:57.780
I think this review is
like going beyond 18.06,

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:04.230
into what ones are
really worth knowing,

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.960
worth knowing individually.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.470
Could we just check what are
the properties of Householders

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.200
reflection of that I minus two?

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:17.800
You recognize here a
column times a row.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.690
So that's a matrix.

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:27.000
And what could you tell me about
that matrix u, u transpose?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.810
It's yeah?

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:39.080
What can we say about H?

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:44.540
So I guess I'm believing that
H is a orthogonal matrix,

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.160
otherwise it wouldn't
be here today.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.070
So I believe that-- and that
not only is it orthogonal,

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.580
it is also--

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:52.940
have a look at it--

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.130
symmetric.

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:55.460
It's also symmetric.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.260
The identity is symmetric.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.290
u, u transpose is symmetric.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:03.380
So this is a family of
symmetric orthogonal matrices.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.109
And that was one of them.

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:08.450
That's a symmetric
orthogonal matrix.

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:13.130
These matrices are
really great to have.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:17.660
In using linear
algebra, you just

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:22.550
get a collection of useful
matrices that you can call on.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:26.780
And these are
definitely one family.

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:28.369
Well, it's obviously symmetric.

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:31.040
Shall we check that
it's orthogonal?

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.110
So to check that
it's orthogonal,

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:40.540
so I'm going to check that H
transpose H is the identity.

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.380
Can I just check that?

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.800
Well, H transpose is the same
as H because it was symmetric.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.070
So I'm going to square this guy.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.650
This is really H times H.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:53.360
I'm squaring it.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.730
And what do I get if I square--

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:57.830
So I get--

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:01.740
I hope I get the identity,
but let's see it.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:05.835
What do I get when
I square this?

00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:09.020
I get little-- multiply it out.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.170
So I times I is I.

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:15.590
And then I get some
number of u, u transposes.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:19.162
How many do I get from that?

00:18:19.162 --> 00:18:22.400
So I'm squaring this
thing because H transpose

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.760
J is the same as H times
H. So I'm squaring it.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.080
So what do I put here?

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.740
Four, thanks.

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.720
And now I've got this
guy squared with a plus.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:38.360
So that's four, u, you,
transpose u, u transpose.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:45.700
Yeah, I'm totally
realizing I've practiced

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:49.660
for a lifetime doing these
dinky little calculations.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.970
But they are dinky.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:55.750
And you'll get the
hang of it quickly.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:59.390
Now what am I hoping
out of that bottom line?

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:04.450
That it is I. We're hoping we're
going to get I. Do we get I?

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:05.770
Yes.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:09.760
Who sees how to get
I out of that thing?

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:15.190
Yeah, u transpose u
in here is a number.

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:18.730
That was u-- that was column
times row times column times

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:19.570
row.

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:23.750
And I look at in the middle
here is row times column.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:28.430
And that's the number one
right because it's there.

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:31.240
So that's one and
then I have minus 4

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.650
of that plus 4 that that.

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:37.690
They cancel each
other, and I get I.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:40.260
So those are good matrices.

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:43.920
We'll use them.

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:47.330
We'll use them.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.400
Actually, they're better
than Gram-Schmidt.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:53.750
So we'll use them in
making things orthogonal.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:57.750
So what other
orthogonal matrices?

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:59.430
Let's create some.

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:05.410
Creating good
orthogonal matrices is--

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:08.030
you know, it pays off.

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:11.200
Let's think.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:22.790
So there a family named
after this French guy

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:23.900
who lived to 100.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:27.820
He was a real old timer.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:32.890
Well, MIT had a faculty
member in math, when I came,

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:36.100
Professor Struik,
who lived to 106.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:40.420
And I heard him give a lecture
at Brown University at age 100.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.100
And it was perfect.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.020
You could not have
done it better.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.550
So he's my inspiration.

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:46.540
I'm keep going.

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:50.710
I only have I like, n
more years to get there.

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:53.440
And then it's-- well,
it's too many anyway.

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:58.240
So Hadamard, he created--

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:06.750
well, that's the
simplest, the smallest.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:10.410
Now the next guy is
going to be four by four.

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:12.060
I'm going to put that--

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:16.940
so where I see a
one, I'm going to put

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:22.580
Hadamard one, one, one minus
one, one, one, one minus one.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.610
And then when I say a minus, I'm
going to put an n with a minus.

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:32.300
You saw that picture?

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:39.440
It was a picture of H2,
H2, H2, and minus H2.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.640
That's what I've got there.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:46.303
And I believe those
columns are orthogonal.

00:21:49.081 --> 00:21:51.860
Right?

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:53.670
Now what could I do?

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:56.090
Well it's not quite
an orthogonal matrix.

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:59.690
What do I have to do to
make-- this isn't quite

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:01.520
an orthogonal matrix either.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:05.630
What do I do to make that
an orthogonal matrix?

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:11.000
Divide by square root of two?

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.120
I need unit vectors there.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.190
And here, those links are one
squared, one squared, got four,

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:20.710
square root of four is two.

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:23.720
So I better divide
by the two there.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.190
And now here I'm up to--

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.810
yeah.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:29.080
So that was that one.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.010
Tell me the next one up.

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:32.140
What's that going to be?

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.040
Eight by eight?

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:34.640
What's that?

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.290
So this is H4 here.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.720
Oops, four.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:45.330
So tell me, what I should
do for eight by eight.

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:47.240
You know, it's simple.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:51.560
But that's a good
thing to say about it.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.380
You know, they're
in coding theory,

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:58.040
all sorts of places you want
matrices of ones and minus

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.450
ones.

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:01.770
What's H8?

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:04.850
I'm going to build it out of H4.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:07.810
So what's it going to be?

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:09.620
I'm going to put an H4 there.

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:12.230
What am I going to put here?

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:14.190
Another H4.

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:16.260
And up here?

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:17.430
Another H4.

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:19.530
And finally, here?

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:20.370
Minus H4.

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:26.190
And I think I've got
orthogonal columns again.

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:36.210
Because the columns within these
dot products with themselves

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:38.230
give zero and zero.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:42.030
The dot products from these
columns and these columns

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:43.980
obviously, have the minus.

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:48.120
And the dot products in here
are zero from that and zero

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:48.690
from that.

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:50.010
Yeah, it works.

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:59.770
And we could keep going
to 16 and 32 and 64.

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:04.600
But then up comes a question.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.930
What about H12?

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:14.920
Is there ones and minus ones
matrix of size 12, 12 by 12?

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:22.590
It doesn't come directly from
our little pattern, which

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:25.110
is doubling size every time.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:27.060
But you could still hope.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:28.890
And it works.

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:30.600
I don't know what
it is, but there's

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:36.000
a there's a matrix of
ones and minus ones 12

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.890
orthogonal columns.

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:38.925
So the answer is yes.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:47.550
So we make an 18.065 conjecture.

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:52.090
Every matrix size-- well,
not every matrix size,

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:54.850
because three by three
is not going to work.

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:57.570
One by one is not
going to work either.

00:24:57.570 --> 00:25:00.970
But H12 works, H8, H16--

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:02.860
What's our conjecture?

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.770
We won't be the first
to conjecture it,

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:09.440
that there is a
ones and minus ones

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:13.290
orthogonal matrix with
orthogonal columns

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:15.570
of every size n.

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:25.320
So I'll start the
conjecture, always possible

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:31.470
if n, which is the size
of the matrix, let's say.

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:34.840
What would you guess?

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.040
Just take a shot.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.100
You won't be asked for a proof,
because nobody has a proof.

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:43.700
Even?

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.310
Well, you could hope for even.

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:49.860
You could look for try six, I
guess, would be the first guy

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:50.360
there.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.700
And I don't think it's possible.

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.430
I think six is not possible.

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:59.220
So every even size
is, I think, not

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:02.870
going to work, but a
natural idea to try.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:05.200
What's the next thought?

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.370
Every multiple of four.

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:10.890
If n over a four
is a whole number.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:25.340
But nobody has a systematic
way to create these things.

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:27.830
So like some of
them, at this point,

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:30.080
we're down to doing
it one at a time.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.430
And we're up to 668.

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:36.680
But we haven't got that one yet.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.520
Isn't that crazy?

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.440
So all this is coming
from Wikipedia.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.450
My source of all that's
good in mathematics

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:46.520
is there on Wikipedia.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:49.340
Anyway, this is the conjecture.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.800
Conjecture means you
don't have any damn idea

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:55.280
of whether it's true or not.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.710
Is that divisible by four?

00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:59.480
Yeah, I guess it would be.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.200
600 certainly is,
and 68 certainly is.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.680
Yeah, OK.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.570
So I think that's the first one.

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:10.910
If you find one of size
668, just skip the homework

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:13.620
and tell us about that one.

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:18.340
But I don't think
I'll assign that.

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:21.320
Yeah, I must have
searched for it online.

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:25.050
But yeah.

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:29.865
Anyway, so those are
the Hadamard matrices.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:37.430
Now where else do I remember
orthogonal matrices coming

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.930
from?

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:44.760
Well, yeah really,
the biggest source.

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.400
So when I'm looking for
orthogonal matrices,

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:52.020
I'm looking for a basis
of orthogonal vectors.

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:56.320
And where in math am I
going to find vectors

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.700
that come out to be orthogonal?

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.340
We haven't seen-- that's the
next section of the notes,

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:05.130
but maybe you are remembering.

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:08.580
Where will we sort of
like, automatically show up

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:11.920
with orthogonal vectors?

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.440
They could be the
eye eigenvectors

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:17.830
of symmetric matrix.

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:22.270
And that's where the most
important ones come from.

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:24.970
Oh, I could tell you
about wavelets though.

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:26.910
Wavelets are more
like this picture.

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:30.220
They're ones and minus ones,
or the simplest wavelets

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.530
are ones and minus ones.

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:36.540
Before I go on to the
eigenvector business,

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:40.450
can I mention the
wavelets matrices?

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:44.860
Yeah, these are really
important simple and important

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.540
constructions.

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:55.570
So wavelets- let me
draw a picture of--

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:57.250
I'm going to come up with four--

00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:59.440
I'll do the four by four case.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:07.410
And these are the
orthogonal guys.

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:14.680
And then the next one
is and down and zero.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:20.980
And the last one is
zero and up and down.

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:22.940
So that's four things.

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:24.850
But let me show you the matrix.

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:27.880
So I'll call it W for wavelets.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:31.810
So that guy, I'm thinking
of was one, one, one, one.

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:35.320
This guy I'm thinking of as
one, one, minus one, minus one.

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.770
It's looking sort
of Hadamard's way.

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:40.870
But there's a difference here.

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:44.770
This guy is one minus
one, zero, zero.

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:48.630
So the wavelengths rescale.

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:51.390
That's the difference between
Hadamard and wavelets.

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:56.880
Wavelets are self-scaling.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.010
And what's the last guy here?

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:00.480
What's the fourth column?

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.430
From that fourth wavelet?

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:11.460
Zero, zero, one minus one, yeah.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:17.560
So Haar came up with that.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:23.610
This is the Haar wavelet, which
was many years before the word

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:26.970
wavelets was invented.

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:32.690
He came up with this
construction, the Haar matrix,

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:34.460
the Haar functions.

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:38.840
So they're very simple
functions, but you know,

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:42.680
that makes them usable that the
fact that they're so simple.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:47.030
Now I don't know if you want
to see the pattern in eight

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:50.600
by eight but let me start
the eight by eight so you'll

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.240
know what wavelets are about.

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.840
You'll know what these Haar
wavelets are about, anyway.

00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:02.540
They're the ones that were
kind of easy to visualize.

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:08.330
So if that's W4, let's
just take a minute.

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:12.680
It won't take long for W8.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.815
So the first column is
going to be eight, one.

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:23.370
And what's the next
column going to be?

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:30.480
Four ones and four
minus ones, like so.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:34.350
So four ones and
four minus ones.

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:46.420
And now the next column, two
ones two minus ones and zeros.

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:50.660
One, one, minus one,
minus one and zero.

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:58.310
And the fourth will be zeros
and two ones and two minus ones.

00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:59.480
We got half a matrix now.

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:07.290
Now if we just tell me the
fifth, what do you think?

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:10.410
What do I put in the fifth one?

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:15.810
So again, it's going to
squeeze down and rescale.

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:18.740
And what's fifth
column up here that's

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:22.740
going to be ones and
minus ones and zeros now?

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:25.440
So it's not Hadamard, it's Haar.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.430
And what shall I put?

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:29.630
One, one.

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:31.757
Shall I start with one, one?

00:32:31.757 --> 00:32:32.590
AUDIENCE: 1 minus 1.

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:35.510
PROFESSOR: Oh!

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:36.330
And then all zeros?

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:40.700
Oh yeah, thanks!

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:41.870
Perfect!

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:44.240
One minus and then all zeros.

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:46.340
And then the next
three columns, we'll

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:50.330
have the one minus one here
and the one minus one here,

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:51.620
and the one minus one here.

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:53.080
And otherwise all zeros.

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:53.930
Yeah.

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:55.130
So you see the pattern.

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:57.200
It's scaling at every step.

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:04.640
So that matrix has
the advantage of being

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:07.670
quite sparse, short of--

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:13.680
This, in my mind is a--

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:21.670
or four ones, that get involved
with like, taking the average.

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:26.740
Then this guy is like,
taking the differences

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:28.270
between those and those.

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:32.920
And then this is like taking the
difference at a smaller scale.

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.240
And that also at
a smaller scale.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.700
So that's what we keep doing.

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:37.270
Yeah.

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:37.600
Yeah.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:38.380
So that wavelets.

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:48.876
It looks so simple
right, but just

00:33:48.876 --> 00:33:51.030
a one minute
history of wavelets,

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:54.480
so Haar invented
this in like, 1910.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.700
I mean, a long--

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:00.260
forever.

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:03.560
But then you wanted
wavelets said

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:09.110
we're a little
better, and not just

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:11.510
ones and minus ones and zeros.

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:16.670
And that took a lot of thinking.

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:18.690
A lot of people were
searching for it.

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:23.449
And Ingrid Daubechies-- so
I'll just put her name--

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:27.280
became famous for finding them.

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:36.560
So in about 1988 she
found a whole lot

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.350
of families of wavelets.

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:40.790
And when I say
wavelets, she found

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:43.159
a whole lot of
orthogonal matrices

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:45.630
that had good properties.

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:46.130
Yeah.

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:49.040
So that's the wavelet picture.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.300
OK.

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.600
Now to close today
and to connect

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:58.310
with the next lecture on
eigenvalues, eigenvectors,

00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:01.520
positive definite matrices--
we're really getting

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.520
to the heart of things here.

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.220
Let me follow
through on that idea.

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:17.950
So the eigenvectors
of a symmetric matrix,

00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:25.743
but also of an orthogonal
matrix are orthogonal.

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:35.970
And that is really
where, people--

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:37.680
where you can invent--

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.570
because you don't
have to work hard.

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:42.210
You just find a
symmetric matrix.

00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:46.980
Its eigenvectors are
automatically orthogonal.

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:51.300
That doesn't mean they're
great for use, but some of them

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:55.650
are really important.

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:57.750
And that maybe the
most important of all

00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:59.670
is the Fourier.

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:03.630
So you probably have
seen Fourier series sines

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:04.530
and cosines.

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:07.830
Those guys are
orthogonal functions.

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:11.760
But the discrete Fourier series
is what everybody computes.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.500
And those are
orthogonal vectors.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.970
So the are orthogonal
vectors that

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:22.900
go into the discrete
Fourier transform.

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:24.990
And then they're
done at high speed

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:27.360
by the fast Fourier transform.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:32.520
Those are eigenvectors of Q,
eigenvectors of the right Q.

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:39.390
So let me just tell you
in the right Q that get--

00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:41.410
who's eigenvectors--

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:43.110
So here we go.

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:50.610
Eigenvectors of
Q-- you will just

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:53.880
be amazed by how
simple this matrix is.

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.370
It's just that matrix.

00:36:56.370 --> 00:37:01.920
It's called a
permutation matrix.

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:04.782
It just puts the--

00:37:04.782 --> 00:37:15.840
those are the four, eight,
four Fourier discrete--

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:18.160
let me put that word
discrete up here--

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:18.660
transform.

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:26.260
So I really meant to put
discrete Fourier transform.

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:27.630
Yeah.

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:31.650
The eigenvectors of that
matrix, first of all,

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:37.680
they are orthogonal, and then
second, and more important,

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.380
they're tremendously useful.

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:42.630
They're the heart of
signal processing.

00:37:45.808 --> 00:37:50.620
In signal processing, they
just take a discrete Fourier

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:53.270
transform of a vector
before they even look at it.

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:55.910
I mean, like that's
the way to see it,

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:58.990
is split it into
its frequencies.

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:01.930
And that's what the
eigenvectors of this will do.

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:07.570
So we're going to see the
discrete Fourier transform.

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:15.050
But my point here is to know
that they're orthogonal just

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:18.620
comes out of this fact
that the eigenvectors are

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:22.490
orthogonal for any Q.
And that is certainly

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:27.380
a Q. Everybody can see that
those columns are orthogonal.

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:33.840
That's a permutation matrix.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.030
You've taken the columns
of the identity, which

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:38.430
are totally orthogonal,
and you just

00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:40.530
put them in a different order.

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:43.230
So a permutation
matrix is a reordering

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:44.910
of the identity matrix.

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:51.740
It's got to be a Q, and
therefore, its eigenvectors

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:53.210
are orthogonal.

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:56.690
And they're just the winners.

00:38:56.690 --> 00:39:01.530
I mean, the matrix
of the Fourier matrix

00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:06.930
with those four eigenvectors
in it, I'll show you now.

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:13.530
We're finishing today by leading
into Wednesday, eigenvectors

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:15.000
and eigenvalues.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000
And we happen to be doing
eigenvectors and eigenvalues

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:24.600
of a Q, not today, of
an S. Most of the time,

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:27.980
it's a symmetric matrix
whose eigenvectors we take,

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:30.960
but here that happens
to be a Q. Can I

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:35.780
show you the eigenvectors,
the four eigenvectors of that?

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:36.810
Now, oh!

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:44.470
The complex number I
is going to come in.

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:46.510
You have to let it in here.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:47.270
Yeah, sorry!

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:57.370
If S is a real symmetric matrix,
its eigenvectors are real.

00:39:57.370 --> 00:40:02.190
But if Q is a orthogonal
matrix, its eigenvectors--

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:07.470
even though you couldn't ask for
a more real matrix than that--

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:13.450
but its eigenvectors
are at least,

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:17.210
the good way are
complex numbers.

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:19.630
So can I just show you
the eigenvectors of--

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:29.070
So again, overall
the point today

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:33.120
is to see orthogonal matrices.

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:36.870
So I'll just repeat
now while I can--

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:54.240
rotations here, reflections,
wavelets, the Householder idea

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:58.350
of reflections of
big, large matrices

00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:02.880
that have this form I minus 2
u, u transpose are orthogonal.

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.080
And now we're going
to see the big guys,

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:12.400
the eigenvectors of Q. Yes?

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:17.138
PROFESSOR: Ah yeah, we
don't have orthonormal.

00:41:17.138 --> 00:41:17.680
That's right.

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:18.940
We don't have orthonormal.

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:21.820
I better divide by the
square root of eight.

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:24.100
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:25.200
PROFESSOR: Oh yes!

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.470
Oh, you're right!

00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.970
Sorry.

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:31.390
I just thought I'd get away
with that, but I didn't.

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:32.620
Yeah.

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:34.870
So these guys these
words of eight.

00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:35.830
So are these.

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:38.350
But these guys are
square roots of four.

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:39.970
These guys are
square roots of two.

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:40.750
Thank you.

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:42.130
Absolutely right.

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:43.270
Absolutely.

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:45.040
Yeah.

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:50.120
OK, so what are the
eigenvectors of a permutation.

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:54.830
This is going to be nice to see.

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:58.010
And I'll use the matrix
F for the eigenvector

00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:12.280
matrix of that Q up there,
and F is for Fourier.

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.840
And it'd be the four
by four Fourier matrix.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:15.380
OK.

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:19.240
What are the eigenvectors of Q?

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:20.320
OK.

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:23.850
So Q is a permutation.

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:27.450
So like, I'm going to ask
you for one eigenvector

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:29.340
of every permutation matrix.

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:34.170
What vector can you tell me
that actually the eigenvalue

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:35.610
will be one?

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:39.180
What vector can you tell
me where if I permute it,

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:41.670
I don't change it?

00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:43.650
One, one, one, one.

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:46.260
Like, it's everywhere
here, one, one, one, one.

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:52.220
So that's the zero
frequency for a vector,

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:55.220
the constant vector, all ones.

00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:59.610
Everybody sees if I'm multiply
by Q, it doesn't change.

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:00.110
OK.

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:01.880
Now the next one--

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:04.430
I'll show you the four now.

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:08.720
The next one will be 1
I, I squared and I cubed.

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:15.070
Of course, I squared--

00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:19.720
I don't know how many course
6J people are in this audience,

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:21.600
but this is a math building.

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:22.560
We paid for it.

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:23.820
It's 2-190.

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:25.380
And it's I in this room.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:36.280
Anyway, I is the
first letter in what?

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:36.970
Imaginary.

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:39.270
Thank you, the first
letter in imaginary.

00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:42.080
You can't say jimaginary.

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:43.150
So that's it.

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:44.080
OK.

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:49.510
And then the next one is 1 I
squared, I fourth, I sixth.

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:55.060
And the next one is
1 I cubed, I6 and I9.

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:57.340
Isn't that just beautiful?

00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:01.960
And you could show that every
one of those four columns,

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:06.970
if you multiply them by Q,
you would get the eigenvalues.

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:11.590
And you would see that
it's an eigenvector.

00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:17.080
And this is just sort of like a
discrete Fourier stuff, instead

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:22.460
of e to the I, e to the Ix,
e to the 2Ix, e to the 3Ix

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:22.960
and so on.

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:23.835
We just have vectors.

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:32.680
So those are the
four eigenvectors

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.720
of that permutation.

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:38.960
And those are orthogonal.

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:41.720
Could I just check that?

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:45.050
How do you know that this first
column and the second-- well,

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:48.950
I should really say zeros
column and first column,

00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:53.620
if I'm talking frequencies.

00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:56.330
Do you see that that's
orthogonal to that?

00:44:56.330 --> 00:44:59.480
Well, y is one plus
I plus I squared

00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:01.850
plus I cubed equal zero.

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:06.360
That's the dot product is this
column one dot column two.

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.440
Yeah, you're right.

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.420
This happens to come out zero.

00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:17.205
Is that right?

00:45:17.205 --> 00:45:19.130
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that
will come out zero.

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:22.540
PROFESSOR: That
will come out zero.

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:27.040
But somebody mentioned
that this isn't right.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:29.590
It's true that
that came out zero,

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:36.550
but when I have imaginary
numbers anywhere around,

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:40.540
this isn't a correct dot
product to test orthogonal.

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:42.680
If I have imaginary--

00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:45.160
complex vectors-- if I
have complex numbers,

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:52.060
complex vectors, I should test
column one conjugate dotted

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:53.770
with column two--

00:45:53.770 --> 00:46:00.730
column I conjugate-- well,
let me take column see,

00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:02.230
which ones shall I take?

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:04.660
Maybe that guy and that guy.

00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:09.030
Many of them, you luck out here.

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:15.000
But really, I should be
taking that conjugate.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.670
So these ones--

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:20.970
But the thing is, the complex
conjugate of one is one.

00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:23.700
So that was OK.

00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:25.980
But in general, if
I wanted to take

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:33.570
column two dotted
with column maybe four

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:35.820
would be a little dodgy--

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:36.600
yeah.

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.980
Look what happens.

00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:41.760
Take that column
and that column.

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.450
Take their dot product.

00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:47.370
Do it the wrong way.

00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:49.500
So what's the wrong way?

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:52.110
Forget about the
complex conjugate

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:54.195
and just do it the usual way.

00:46:54.195 --> 00:46:55.950
So one times one is one.

00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:57.570
I times I cube is?

00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:02.430
One.

00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:05.110
I squared times I6 is?

00:47:05.110 --> 00:47:05.610
One.

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:07.380
I'm getting all ones.

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:10.260
I'm not getting
orthogonality there.

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:14.430
And that's because I forgot
that I should take the complex

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:17.010
conjugate-- well, of
these guys-- one--

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:21.750
I should take minus I,
minus I, minus I squared--

00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:22.500
well, that's real.

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:23.760
So it's OK.

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.310
Minus there.

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:32.316
So minus I squared
is still minus one.

00:47:32.316 --> 00:47:36.250
So now if I do it,
it comes out zero.

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:39.330
So let me repeat again.

00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:41.730
Let me just make this statement.

00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:50.280
If Q transpose Q is
I, and Qx is lambda x,

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:57.230
and Qy is different
eigenvalue y--

00:47:57.230 --> 00:48:00.680
so I'm setting up the main fact.

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:03.440
In the last minute, I'm
just going to write down.

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:05.930
So I have an orthogonal matrix.

00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:08.990
I have an eigenvector
with eigenvalue lambda.

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:12.740
I have another eigenvector with
a different eigenvalue, mu.

00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:14.930
Then the claim is that--

00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:18.830
what is the claim
about eigenvectors?

00:48:18.830 --> 00:48:22.310
So here, this has an eigenvalue.

00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:24.700
This has a different eigenvalue.

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:27.170
I need them to be
different to really know

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:31.520
that the x's and the
y's can't be the same.

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:32.990
So what is it that
I want to show?

00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:34.598
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:34.598 --> 00:48:35.630
PROFESSOR: Yes!

00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:39.980
That x-- and I have to
remember to do that.

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:43.640
x transpose y is zero.

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:46.340
That's orthogonality.

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:49.460
That's orthogonality
for a complex vectors.

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:54.440
I have to remember to change
are every I to a minus

00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:56.780
I in one of the vectors.

00:48:56.780 --> 00:49:00.770
And I can prove that fact
by playing with these.

00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:07.560
By starting from here,
I can get to that.

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:08.060
OK.

00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:08.560
That's it.

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:10.820
We've done a lot
today, a lot of stuff

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:13.340
about orthogonal matrices.

00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:18.560
Important ones, and those
sources of important ones,

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:19.400
eigenvectors.

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:23.950
And so it will be
eigenvectors on Wednesday.
