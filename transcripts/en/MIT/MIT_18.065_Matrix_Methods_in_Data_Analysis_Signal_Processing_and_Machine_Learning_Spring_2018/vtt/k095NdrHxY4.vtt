00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.340
GILBERT STRANG: So last time
was orthogonal matrices--

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.995
Q. And this time is
symmetric matrices, S.

00:00:32.995 --> 00:00:37.620
So we're really talking about
the best matrices of all.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.620
Well, I'll start with any square
matrix and about eigenvectors.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.130
But you've heard of
eigenvectors more than once--

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.540
more than twice--

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.580
more than 10 times, probably.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.690
OK.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.270
So eigenvectors.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.440
And then, let's be sure we
know why they're useful,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.820
and maybe compute one or two.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.910
But then we'll move
to symmetric matrices

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.260
and what is special about those.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.060
And then, even more
special and more important

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.350
will be positive definite
symmetric matrices--

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.280
so that when I say, positive
definite, I mean symmetric.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.850
So start with A. Next comes
S. Then come the special S--

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.190
special symmetric
matrices that have

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.950
this extra positive
definite property.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.270
OK.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.360
So start with A.
So an eigenvector--

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.470
if I multiply A by
x, I get some vector.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:51.010
And sometimes, if x is
especially chosen well,

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.988
Ax comes out in the
same direction as x.

00:01:55.988 --> 00:02:01.830
Ax comes out some
number times x.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.530
So there are-- normally,
there would be,

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.120
for an n by n matrix--

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:13.040
so let's say A is n by n today.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.910
Normally, if we
live right, there

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.260
will be n different
independent vectors--

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.740
x eigenvectors-- that have
this special property.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.680
And we can compute them
by hand if n is 2 or 3--

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.140
2, mostly.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.920
But the computation of
the x's and the lambdas--

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:46.230
so this is for i
equal 1 up to n,

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.920
if I use this sort
of math shorthand--

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.880
that I have n of
these almost always.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.190
And my first question is,
what are they good for?

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.840
Why does course after course
introduce eigenvectors?

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.440
And to me the key property is
seen by looking at A squared.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.910
So let me look at A squared.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.690
So it's another n by n matrix.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.140
And we would ask, suppose
we know these guys?

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.890
Suppose we've found
those somehow.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.410
What about A squared?

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.020
Is x an eigenvector
of A squared also?

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.310
Well, the way to find out is
to multiply A squared by x,

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.390
and see what happens.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.640
Do you see what's
going to happen here?

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:50.960
This is A times Ax,
which is A times--

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.370
Ax is lambda x--

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.150
and now what do I do now?

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.150
Because I'm shooting
for the answer yes.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.300
X is an eigenvector
of A squared also.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.250
So what do I do?

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.010
That number-- that
lambda is just a number.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.930
I can put it anywhere I like.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.210
So I can put it out front.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.170
And then I have Ax, which is?

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.395
AUDIENCE: Lambda x.

00:04:17.395 --> 00:04:18.000
GILBERT STRANG: Lambda x.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.500
Thanks.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.800
So I have another lambda x.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.200
So there's lambda squared x.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.870
So I learned the
crucial thing here--

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.270
that x is also an
eigenvector of A squared,

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.700
and the eigenvalue
is lambda squared.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.710
And of course, I can keep going.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.025
So A to the nth--

00:04:39.025 --> 00:04:42.580
x is lambda to the nth x.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.660
We have found the right vectors
for that particular matrix A.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.970
What about A inverse x?

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.230
That will be-- if
everything is good--

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.040
1 over lambda x.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.750
Well, yeah.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.420
So anytime I write
1 over lambda,

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:07.810
my mind says, you
gotta make some comment

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.680
on the special case where
it doesn't work, which is?

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.405
AUDIENCE: Lambda
is not equal to 0.

00:05:13.405 --> 00:05:14.280
GILBERT STRANG: Yeah.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.720
If lambda is not 0, I'm golden.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.590
If lambda is 0, it
doesn't look good.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.137
And what's happening
if lambda is 0?

00:05:26.137 --> 00:05:27.470
AUDIENCE: A inverse [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.428
GILBERT STRANG: A doesn't
even have an inverse.

00:05:29.428 --> 00:05:32.010
If lambda was 0--

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.620
which it could be--

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.710
no rule against it.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.520
If lambda was 0, this would
say, A times the eigenvector

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.860
is 0 times the eigenvector.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.900
So that would tell me
that the eigenvector

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.750
is in the null space.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.040
It would tell me the
matrix A isn't invertible.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.220
It's taking some vector x to 0.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.550
And so everything clicks.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.760
This works when it should work.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.950
And if we have other fun--
any function of the matrix,

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.590
we could define the
exponential of a matrix.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.570
18.03 would do that.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.340
Let's just write it down,
as if we know what it means.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.740
Does it have the
same eigenvector?

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.820
Well, sure.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.330
Because e to the At--

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.900
the exponential of a matrix--

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.120
if I see e to the something--

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.610
I think of that
long, infinite series

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.980
that gives the exponential.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.720
Those-- all the terms in
that series have powers of A.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.250
So everything is working.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.430
Every term in that series--

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.830
x is an eigenvector.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.830
And when I put it
all together, I

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:47.740
learn that the eigenvalue
is e to the lambda t.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:54.670
That's just a typical
and successful work use.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:55.660
OK.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.720
So that's eigenvectors
and eigenvalues,

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.810
and we'll find some in a minute.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.965
Now, so I'm claiming that this--

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.120
that from this first thing--
which was just about certain

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.950
vectors are special--

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.490
now we're beginning to
see why they're useful.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:22.720
So special is good.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.060
Useful is even better.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:37.810
So let me take any
vector, say v. And OK,

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.910
what do I want to do?

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:42.190
I want to use eigenvectors.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.280
This v is probably
not an eigenvector.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.330
But I'm supposing that
I've got n of them.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.400
You and I are agreed
that there are

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.760
some matrices for
which there are not

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.290
a full set of eigenvectors.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:02.480
That's really the main
sort of annoying point

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.440
in the whole subject
of linear algebra,

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.870
is some matrices don't
have enough eigenvectors.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:14.280
But almost all do,
and let's go forward

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.730
assuming our matrix has.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:17.820
OK.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:22.200
So if I've got n independent
eigenvectors, that's a basis.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.250
I can write any vector
v as a combination

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:30.620
of those eigenvectors.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.250
Right.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:40.090
And then I can find out
what A to any power.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.820
So that's the point.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:49.290
This is going to be the
simple and reason why

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:50.520
we like to have--

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.840
we like to know
the eigenvectors.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.470
Because if I choose those
as my basis vectors,

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.750
v is a combination of them.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:04.030
Now if I multiply by A, or A
squared, or A to the k power,

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:05.890
then it's linear.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.950
So I can multiply each
one by A to the k.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:15.300
And what do I get if I multiply
that guy by A to the kth power?

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.240
OK.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.580
Well, I'm just going
to use-- or, here

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.122
I said n, but let me say k.

00:09:21.122 --> 00:09:23.260
Because n-- I'm sorry.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.210
I'm using n for the
size of the matrix.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:31.870
So I better use k for
the typical case here.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:34.460
So what do I get?

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:39.140
Just help me through
this and we're happy.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:44.330
So what happens when I
multiply that by A to the k?

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.720
It's an eigenvector,
remember, so when I

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.670
multiply by A to the k, I get?

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:50.360
AUDIENCE: C1.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.610
GILBERT STRANG: C1.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.350
That's just a number.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:56.840
And A to the k times
that eigenvector gives?

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.650
AUDIENCE: Lambda 1.

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:00.653
GILBERT STRANG: Lambda 1 to
the k times the eigenvector.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.730
Right?

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.170
That's the whole point.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:11.340
And linearity says keep going.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:18.270
Cn, lambda n to
the kth power, Xn.

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:22.080
In other words, I can take--

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.820
I can apply any
power of a matrix.

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.250
I can apply the
exponential of a matrix.

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:33.380
I can do anything
quickly, because I've

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.210
got the eigenvector.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:38.630
So really, I'm
saying the first use

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.900
for eigenvectors-- maybe the
principle use for which they

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:47.660
were invented-- is to be able
to solve difference equations.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.560
So if I call that Vk--

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.790
the kth power-- then the
equation I'm solving here

00:10:55.790 --> 00:11:01.530
is a one step
difference equation.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.790
This is my difference equation.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.140
And if I wanted to
use exponentials,

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:12.090
the equation I would be solving
would be dv, dt equal Av.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:29.820
Solution to discrete steps, or
continuous time evolution comes

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.290
is trivial, if I know
the eigenvectors.

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:35.560
Because here is the
solution to this one.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:40.325
And the solution to this
one is the same thing, C1, e

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:43.480
to the lambda, 1, t, x1.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:49.180
Is that what you were expecting
for the solution here?

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.830
Because if I takes
the derivative,

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:52.810
it brings down a lambda.

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:56.680
If I multiply by A, it
brings down a lambda--

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.020
so, plus the other guys.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.020
OK.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:15.110
Not news, but important to
remember what eigenvectors

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:17.280
are for in the first place.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:17.780
Good.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:22.620
Yeah.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.220
Let me move ahead.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:34.270
Oh-- one matrix fact
is about something

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:35.800
called similar matrices.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.680
So I have on my
matrix A. Then I have

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.980
the idea of what it
means to be similar to A,

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:56.740
so B is similar to A.
What does that mean?

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.410
So here's what it
means, first of all.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:04.450
It means that B can
be found from A, by--

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.310
this is the key operation here--

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:10.930
multiplying by a matrix
M, and its inverse--

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:12.940
M inverse AM.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:18.550
When I see two
matrices, B and A,

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:24.620
that are connected by
that kind of a change,

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:28.160
M could be any
invertible matrix.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:34.410
Then I would say B was similar
to A. And that changed--

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:38.920
that appearance of
AM is pretty natural.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.770
If I change variables
here by M, then I get--

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:47.850
that similar matrix
will show up.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.110
So what's the key factor?

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:53.760
Do you remember the key
fact about similar matrices?

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.972
If B and A are
connected like that--

00:13:56.972 --> 00:13:58.680
AUDIENCE: They have
the same eigenvalues.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.380
GILBERT STRANG: They have
the same eigenvalues.

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.170
So this is just a useful
point to remember.

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:13.320
So I'll-- this is like
one fact in the discussion

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.780
of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:28.600
So similar matrices,
same eigenvalues.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.100
Yeah.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:42.810
So in some way in the
eigenvalue, eigenvector world,

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:45.090
they're in this--
they belong together.

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:54.503
They're connected by this
relation that just turns out

00:14:54.503 --> 00:14:55.420
to be the right thing.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:03.820
Actually, that is-- it gives
us a clue of how eigenvalues

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.950
are actually computed.

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:10.510
Well, they're actually
computed by typing eig of A,

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:14.080
with parentheses around
A. That's how they're--

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.890
in real life.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:22.000
But what happens when
you type eig of A?

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.010
Well, you could say
the eigenvalue shows up

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:26.080
on the screen.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.660
But something had
to happen in there.

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:33.250
And what happened
was that MATLAB--

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:40.540
or whoever-- took that matrix
A, started using good choices

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.140
of m--

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:44.610
better and better.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:50.550
Took a bunch of steps
with different m's.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:53.860
Because if I do another m, I
still have a similar matrix,

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:54.360
right?

00:15:54.360 --> 00:16:00.300
If I take B and do a
different m2 to B--

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.220
so I get something
similar to B, then

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.230
that's also similar
to A. I've got

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:07.020
a whole family of
similar things there.

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:13.410
And what does MATLAB do with
all these m's, m1 and m2 and m3

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:14.580
and so on?

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:22.140
It brings the matrix
to a triangular matrix.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.915
It gets the eigenvalues
showing up on the diagonal.

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:33.110
It's just tremendously-- it
was an inspiration when that--

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:35.990
when the good choice
of m appeared.

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:38.060
And let me just say--

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.120
because I'm going on
to symmetric matrices--

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:47.360
that for a symmetric matrices,
everything is sort of clean.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.770
You not only go to
a triangular matrix,

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:54.380
you go toward a diagonal matrix.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:57.380
They off-- you
choose m's that make

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:00.710
the off diagonal stuff smaller
and smaller and smaller.

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:03.230
And the eigenvalues
are not changing.

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:08.800
So there, shooting up on the
diagonal, are the eigenvalues.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:13.329
So I guess I should
verify that fact,

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:16.329
that similar matrices
have the same eigenvalues.

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:19.300
Can we-- there can't
be much to show.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:24.710
There can't be much in the
proof because that's all I know.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.400
And I want to know its
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:32.920
So let me say, suppose m
inverse Am has the eigenvector

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.125
y and the eigenvalue of lambda.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.610
And I want to show--

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:48.810
do I want to show that y is an
eigenvector also, of A itself?

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:50.010
No.

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.140
Eigenvectors are changing.

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:56.610
Do I want to show that lambda
is an eigenvalue of A itself?

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:57.150
Yes.

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:58.560
That's my point.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.656
So can we see that?

00:18:00.656 --> 00:18:01.650
Ha.

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:05.250
Can I see that lambda
is an eigenvector?

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.440
There's not a lot to do here.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.200
I mean, if I can't do it soon,
I'm never going to do it,

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.300
because--

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.845
so what am I going to do?

00:18:13.845 --> 00:18:15.930
AUDIENCE: Define the
vector x equals my--

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:17.530
GILBERT STRANG: Yeah, I could.

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.320
Yeah.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:24.120
X is-- m-y is going to be a
key, and I can see m-y coming.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.550
Just-- when I see m
inverse over there,

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:28.345
what am I going to do
with the darn thing?

00:18:28.345 --> 00:18:29.220
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.500
GILBERT STRANG: I'm going
to put it on the other side.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.020
I'm going to multiply
that equation by m.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:37.560
So I'll have-- that will
put the m over here.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:44.630
And I'll have A-M-y
equals lambda My, right?

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.520
And is that telling me
what I want to know?

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.790
Yes.

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:54.560
That's saying that My--

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:58.340
that you wisely suggested
to give a name x to--

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:01.025
is lambda times My.

00:19:01.025 --> 00:19:02.285
Do you see that?

00:19:02.285 --> 00:19:06.650
That the eigenvalue
lambda didn't change.

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:08.970
The eigenvector did change.

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:11.480
It changed from y to My.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.350
That's the x.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:14.930
The eigenvector of x.

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:18.530
This is lambda x.

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:19.910
Yeah.

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:24.110
So that's the role of M. It
just gives you a different basis

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:25.610
for eigenvectors.

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:28.010
But it does not
change eigenvalues.

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.880
Right.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.250
Yeah.

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:31.540
OK.

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:35.380
So those are similar matrices.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.180
Yeah, some other
good things happen.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.190
A lot of people
don't know-- in fact,

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:42.610
I wasn't very
conscious of the fact

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:48.500
that A times B has the same
eigenvalues as B times A. Well,

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.130
I should maybe write that down.

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:58.190
AB has the same eigenvalues--

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.300
the same non-zero ones--

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.720
you'll see.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:07.240
I have to-- as BA.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.690
This is any A and B same size.

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:13.390
I'm not talking
similar matrices here.

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:19.270
I'm talking any
two A and B. Yeah.

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:23.140
So that's a good
thing that happens.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:29.880
Now could we see y?

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:35.240
And then I'm going to be really
pretty happy with basic fact

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.870
about eigenvalues.

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:41.070
So if I want to show
that two things have

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:45.760
the same eigenvalues,
what do you propose?

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.660
Show that they are similar.

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.440
I already said, if
they are similar.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.540
So is there an m?

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:58.370
Is there an m that will
connect this matrix?

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:05.820
So is there an m that will
multiply this matrix that way?

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.880
So that would be similar to AB.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.950
And can I produce BA then?

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:19.110
So I'll just put the
word want up here.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:28.000
I want-- if I have
that, then I'm

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.140
done, because that's saying that
those two matrices, AB and BA,

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:33.160
are similar.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.930
And I know that then they
have the same eigenvalues.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:41.425
So what should m be?

00:21:41.425 --> 00:21:49.640
M should be-- so what is M here?

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:50.870
I want that to be true.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:57.890
Should M be B?

00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:58.660
Yeah.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.020
M equal B. Boy.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:05.710
Not the most hidden fact here.

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:11.110
Take M equal B.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:14.950
So then I have B times
A, times BB inverse--

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:16.130
which is the identity.

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:18.130
So I have B times A. Yes.

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:19.690
OK.

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:23.440
So AB and BA are fine.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:28.240
Now, what do you think
about this question?

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:31.610
Are the eigenvalues-- I
now know that AB and BA

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:33.230
have the same eigenvalues.

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:40.730
And the reason I had to be
careful about non-zero is that

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:45.065
if I had zero
eigenvalues, then--

00:22:45.065 --> 00:22:46.055
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:46.055 --> 00:22:46.930
GILBERT STRANG: Yeah.

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:49.370
I can't count on those inverses.

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:50.380
Right.

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:51.570
Right.

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:56.100
So that's why I put it
in that little qualifier.

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.190
But now I want to
ask this question.

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:02.070
If I know the eigenvalues of A--

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:05.570
separately, by
itself, A-- and of B--

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:09.850
now I'm talking about any
two matrices, A and B.

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:12.855
If I have two matrices, A--

00:23:12.855 --> 00:23:15.580
I have a matrix
A and a matrix B.

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:19.170
And I know their eigenvalues
and their eigenvalues.

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:21.790
What about AB?

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:25.510
A times B. Can I multiply
the eigenvalues of A times

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:27.640
the eigenvalues of B?

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.540
Don't do it.

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:29.080
Right.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:29.730
Yes.

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:30.230
Right.

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:33.340
The eigenvalues of A
times the eigenvalues of B

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:35.620
could be damn near anything.

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:36.680
Right.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:40.890
They're not connected to the
eigenvalues of AB specially.

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:45.800
And maybe something could
be discovered, but not much.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:50.920
And similarly, for
A plus B. So yeah.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:54.670
So let me just write
down this point.

00:23:54.670 --> 00:24:00.100
Eigenvalues of A plus
B are generally not

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:08.830
eigenvalues of A plus
eigenvalues of B.

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:09.670
Generally not.

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.200
Just-- there is no reason.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.580
And the reason that that's--

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:20.260
I get that no answer is,
that the eigenvectors can

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.040
be all different.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.770
If the eigenvectors
for A are totally

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:26.300
different from the
eigenvectors for B,

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:30.160
then A plus B will have probably
some other, totally different

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:34.360
eigenvectors, and there's
nothing happening there.

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:43.650
That's sort of thoughts
about eigenvalues in general.

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:50.230
And I could-- there'd be a
whole section on eigenvectors,

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:53.830
but I'm really interested
in eigenvectors

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:56.450
of symmetric matrices.

00:24:56.450 --> 00:25:02.550
So I'm going to move
on to that topic.

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:06.410
So now, having talked
about any matrix A,

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:09.710
I'm going to specialize
to symmetric matrices,

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:12.020
see what's special
about the eigenvalues

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.790
there, what's special
about eigenvectors there.

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:17.720
And I think we've
already said it in class.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.070
So let me-- let me
ask you to tell me

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:21.590
about it-- tell me again.

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:26.270
So I'll call that matrix
S now, as a reminder

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.970
always that I'm talking here
about symmetric matrices.

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:33.710
So what do I-- what are
the key facts to know?

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:44.360
Eigenvalues are real
numbers, if the matrix is.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:48.840
I'm thinking of real
symmetric matrices.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.060
Of course, other
real matrices could

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:55.400
have imaginary eigenvalues.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.620
Other real matrices-- so just--

00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:00.860
let's just think for a moment.

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:01.360
Yeah.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.620
Maybe I'll just put it here.

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:09.760
Can I back up, before I keep
going with symmetric matrices?

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:15.610
So you take a matrix like that.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:20.850
Q, yeah.

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:25.500
That would be a Q. But it's
not specially a Q. Maybe

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.320
the most remarkable
thing about that matrix

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.080
is that it's anti-symmetric.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.630
So I'll call it A. Right.

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:37.942
If I transpose that
matrix, what do I get?

00:26:37.942 --> 00:26:38.900
AUDIENCE: The negative.

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.108
GILBERT STRANG: The negative.

00:26:40.108 --> 00:26:42.400
So that's like anti-symmetric.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.430
And I claim that an
anti-symmetric matrix

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:47.830
has imaginary eigenvalues.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:51.010
So that's a 90 degree rotation.

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:57.040
And you might say, what
could be simpler than that?

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:01.050
A 90 degree rotation--
that's not a weird matrix.

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:03.740
But from the point of
view of eigenvectors,

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:07.620
something a little odd
has to happen, right?

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:11.010
Because if I have a
90 degree rotation--

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:12.720
if I take a vector x--

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:18.250
any vector x-- could it
possibly be an eigenvector?

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:20.910
Well, apply A to it.

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:24.510
You'd be off in
this direction, Ax.

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:30.390
And there is no way that
Ax can be a multiple of x.

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:34.950
So there's no real eigenvector
for that anti-symmetric matrix,

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:38.710
or any anti-symmetric matrix.

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:43.480
So you see that when we
say that the eigenvalues

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.090
of a symmetric matrix
are real, we're

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:48.180
saying that this
couldn't happen--

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:51.160
that this couldn't happen
if A were symmetric.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:54.010
And here, it's the very
opposite, it's anti-symmetric.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.820
Well, while that's on the board,
you might say, wait a minute.

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.160
How could that have any
eigenvector whatsoever?

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:09.300
So what is an eigenvector
of that matrix A?

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:13.080
How do you find the
eigenvectors of A?

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:19.850
When they're 2 by 2, that's a
calculation we know how to do.

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:21.950
You remember the steps there?

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:26.690
I'm looking for
Ax equal lambda x.

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:30.020
So right now I'm looking
for both lambda and x.

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.050
I've got 2.

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:35.900
It's not linear, but I'm going
to bring this over to this side

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:39.405
and write it as A minus
lambda I, x equals 0.

00:28:43.263 --> 00:28:44.680
And then I'm going
to look at that

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:48.850
and say, wow, A minus lambda
I must be not invertible,

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:52.690
b because it's got this
x in its null space.

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:56.680
So the determinant of
this matrix must be 0.

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:06.300
I couldn't have a null space
unless the determinant is 0.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:12.590
And then when I look at A
minus lambda I, for this A,

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:20.350
I've got minus
lambdas, minus A--

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:21.820
oh, A is just the 1.

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:23.700
And that's minus 1.

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.250
I'm going to take
the determinant.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:29.100
And what am I going to
get for the determinant?

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.732
Lambda squared--

00:29:30.732 --> 00:29:31.722
AUDIENCE: Plus 1.

00:29:31.722 --> 00:29:32.680
GILBERT STRANG: Plus 1.

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:38.156
And I set that to 0.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:48.020
So I'm just following
all the rules,

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:51.322
but it's showing me
that the lambda--

00:29:51.322 --> 00:29:55.150
the two lambdas-- there
are two lambdas here--

00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:58.300
but they're not real, because
that equation, the roots

00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.770
are i and minus i.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:04.250
So those are the eigenvalues.

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:08.710
And they have the nice--

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:10.180
they have all the--

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:11.530
well, they are the eigenvalues.

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:12.520
No doubt about it.

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:20.360
With 2 by 2 there are two quick
checks that tell you, yeah,

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.790
you did a calculation right.

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:31.970
If I add up the two
eigenvalues in this--

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:34.550
if I add up the two
eigenvalues for any matrix,

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:37.310
and I'm going to do
it for this one--

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:38.420
I get what answer?

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:39.500
AUDIENCE: The trace?

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:43.430
GILBERT STRANG: I get the
same answer from the adding--

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:48.410
add the lambdas gives
me the same answer

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:56.690
as add the diagonal
of the matrix--

00:30:56.690 --> 00:31:03.130
which I'm calling A. So if I
add the diagonal I get 0 and 0.

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:03.910
So it's 0 plus 0.

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:11.165
And this number adding the
diagonal is called the trace.

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:19.130
And we'll see it again
because it's so simple.

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:22.910
Just adding the diagonal
entries gives you

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:25.370
a key bit of information.

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:27.230
When you add down
the diagonal it

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:29.960
tells you the sum of
the eigenvalue-- some

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:32.670
of the lambdas.

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:35.970
Doesn't tell you each
lambda separately,

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:37.890
but it tells you the sum.

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:41.380
So it tells you one
fact by doing one thing.

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.210
Yeah.

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:45.170
That's pretty handy.

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:49.010
Gives you a quick
check if you've--

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:50.840
when you compute
this determinant

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.414
and solve for lambda--

00:31:54.414 --> 00:32:03.440
the thing you-- this is a way
to compute eigenvalues by hand.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.120
You could make a
mistake, because it's

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:10.770
a quadratic formula
for 2 by 2, but you can

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:13.270
check by adding the two roots.

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:17.640
Do you get the same
as the trace 0 plus 0?

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:25.370
Well, there's one other check,
equally quick, for 2 by 2,

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:26.690
so 2 by 2s--

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:28.940
you really get them right.

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:31.070
What's the other check to--

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:33.860
we add the eigenvalues,
we get the trace.

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:34.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:37.010
GILBERT STRANG: We
multiply the eigenvalues.

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:45.640
So we take-- so now
multiply the lambdas.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:50.600
So then I get i times minus i.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:54.550
And that should equal--
let's-- don't look yet.

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:58.060
What should it equal if I
multiply the eigenvalues

00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:59.870
I should get the?

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:00.810
AUDIENCE: Determinant.

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:02.700
GILBERT STRANG:
Determinant, right.

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:12.680
Of A. So that's
two handy checks.

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.900
Add the eigenvalues--
for any size--

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:18.230
3 by 3, 4 by 4-- but
it's only two checks.

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:21.080
So for 2 by 2, it's
kind of, you've got it.

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.300
3 by 3, 4 by 4--
you could still have

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:29.630
made an error and the two checks
could potentially still work.

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:30.920
Let's just check it out here.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.570
What's i times minus i?

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:36.030
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:37.230
GILBERT STRANG: 1.

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:40.290
Because it's minus i
squared, and that's plus 1.

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:44.950
And the determinant of
that matrix is 0 minus--

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:45.450
is 1.

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:47.170
Yeah.

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:47.820
OK.

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.150
So we got 1.

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:49.650
Good.

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:56.340
Those are really the key
fact about eigenvalues.

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:02.550
But of course they're
not-- it's not

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:06.360
as simple as solving Ax
equal B to find them,

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:13.980
but if you follow through on
this idea of similar matrices,

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:18.510
and sort of chop down the
off diagonal part, then

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:22.900
sure enough, the
eigenvalue's gotta show up.

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.790
OK.

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:25.449
Symmetric.

00:34:27.989 --> 00:34:28.905
Symmetric matrices.

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:38.830
So now we're going
to have symmetric,

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:42.639
and then we'll have the special,
even better than symmetric,

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:45.690
is symmetric positive definite.

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:46.190
OK.

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:56.330
Symmetric-- you told me the main
facts are the eigenvalues real,

00:34:56.330 --> 00:35:02.040
the eigenvectors orthogonal.

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:10.280
And I guess, actually--

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.420
yeah.

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:17.380
So I want to put those into
math symbols instead of words.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:26.500
So yeah.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:31.270
I guess-- shall I just jump in?

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:36.830
And the other thing hidden
there-- but very important is--

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:39.790
there's a full set
of eigenvectors,

00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:42.400
even if some eigenvalues
happen to be repeated,

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.650
like the identity matrix.

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:47.940
It's still got plenty
of eigenvectors.

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:51.150
So that's a added point
that I've not made there.

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:54.720
And I could prove
those two statements,

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:59.998
but why don't I ask you to
accept them and go onward?

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:05.240
What are we going
to do with them?

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:05.740
OK.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.430
Can you just-- let's
have an example.

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:18.690
Let me put an example here.

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:22.910
Suppose S-- now
I'm calling it S--

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:26.610
is 0s, 1 and 1.

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:29.960
So that's symmetric.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:33.080
What are its eigenvalues?

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:37.140
What are the eigenvalues of
that symmetric matrix, S?

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:38.370
AUDIENCE: Plus and minus 1.

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:40.878
GILBERT STRANG:
Plus and minus 1.

00:36:40.878 --> 00:36:43.660
Well, if you propose
two eigenvalues,

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:46.730
I'll write them
down, 1 and minus 1.

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:49.727
And then what will
I do to check them?

00:36:49.727 --> 00:36:51.060
AUDIENCE: Trace and determinant.

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.810
GILBERT STRANG: Trace
and determinant.

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:54.330
OK.

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:57.600
So are they-- is it true
that the eigenvalues

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:01.600
are 1 and minus 1?

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:02.370
OK.

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:04.020
How do I check the trace?

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:07.640
What is the trace
of that matrix?

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:08.350
0.

00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:10.630
And what's the sum
of the eigenvalues--

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:11.450
0.

00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:12.570
Good.

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:13.710
What about determinant?

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:15.380
What's the determinant of S?

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:16.290
AUDIENCE: Minus 1.

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:17.290
GILBERT STRANG: Minus 1.

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:19.290
The product of the
eigenvalues-- minus 1.

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:20.590
So we've got it.

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:21.480
OK.

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:24.820
What are the eigenvectors?

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:29.070
What vector can you
multiply by and it

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:32.010
doesn't change direction-- in
fact, doesn't change at all?

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:35.735
I'm looking for the eigenvector
that's a steady state?

00:37:35.735 --> 00:37:37.180
AUDIENCE: 0, 1?

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:38.115
GILBERT STRANG: 0, 1?

00:37:38.115 --> 00:37:41.090
AUDIENCE: 1, 1.

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:42.780
GILBERT STRANG: I
think it's 1, 1.

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:43.280
Yeah.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.380
So here is the lambdas.

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:47.420
And then the eigenvectors are--

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.800
I think 1, 1.

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:52.760
Is that right?

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:53.260
Yeah.

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:54.190
Sure.

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:57.010
S is just a permutation here.

00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:59.230
It's just exchanging
the two entries.

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:01.770
So 1 and 1 won't change.

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:04.378
And what's the
other eigenvector?

00:38:04.378 --> 00:38:05.940
AUDIENCE: Minus 1?

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:07.190
GILBERT STRANG: 1 and minus 1.

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:19.090
And then, I'm thinking--
remembering about this similar

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:20.140
stuff--

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:27.610
I'm thinking that S is
similar to a matrix that

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:29.710
just shows the eigenvalues.

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:31.690
So S is similar to--

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:34.410
I'm going to put in an M--

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:37.960
well, I'm going to
connect S-- that matrix--

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:45.160
with the eigenvalue matrix,
which has the eigenvalues.

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:48.430
So here is my--

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:53.770
everybody calls that
matrix capital lambda,

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:57.550
because everybody calls the
eigenvalues little lambda.

00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:02.330
So the matrix that has them
is called capital lambda.

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:06.610
And I-- my claim is that
these guys are similar--

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:09.650
that this matrix, S, that
you're seeing up there--

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:12.890
I believe there
is an M I believe

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:15.650
there is an M. So that S--

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:17.510
what did I put in here?

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:19.370
So I'm following this pattern.

00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:24.280
I believe that there would
be an M and an M inverse,

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:27.590
so that this would mean that.

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:29.870
And that's nice.

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:33.530
First of all, it would
confirm that the eigenvalues

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:38.210
stay the same, which
was certain to happen.

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:43.720
And then it would also mean that
I had got a diagonal matrix.

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.520
And of course, that's
a natural goal--

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.945
to get a diagonal matrix.

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:52.210
So we might hope that
the M that gets us there

00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:57.510
is like an important matrix.

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:59.520
So do you see what
I'm doing here?

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:04.350
It comes under the heading
of diagonalizing a matrix.

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:08.840
I start with a matrix, S.
I find it's eigenvalues.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.420
They go on into lambda.

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:19.980
And I believe I can find an M,
so that I see they're similar.

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:23.660
They have the same eigenvalues,
1 and minus 1, both sides.

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:27.650
So only remaining
question is, what's M?

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:33.262
What's the matrix
that diagonalizes S?

00:40:33.262 --> 00:40:35.745
The-- what have we
got left to use?

00:40:35.745 --> 00:40:36.870
AUDIENCE: The eigenvectors.

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:39.140
GILBERT STRANG:
The eigenvectors.

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:43.010
The matrix that-- so, can
I put the M over there?

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:46.460
Yeah.

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:48.590
I'll put-- that M
inverse is going

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:52.180
to go over to the other side.

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:52.680
Oh.

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:54.800
It goes here, doesn't it?

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.240
I was worried there.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.630
It didn't look good, but yeah.

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:02.192
So this is all going
to be right, if--

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:09.460
this is what I'd like to have--

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:11.980
SM equal M lambda.

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.810
SM equal M lambda.

00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:17.120
That's diagonalizing a matrix.

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:22.390
That's finding the M
using the eigenvectors.

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:25.850
That produces a
similar matrix lambda,

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:27.270
which has the eigenvalues.

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:35.810
That's the great fact
about diagonalizing.

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:38.160
That's how you use--
that's another way to say,

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.610
this is how the
eigenvectors pay off.

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:43.880
You put them into M. You
take the similar matrix

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.830
and it's nice and diagonal.

00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:47.970
And do you see that
this will happen?

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:51.410
S times-- so M has
the first eigenvector

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:53.870
and the second eigenvector.

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:59.690
And I believe that first
eigenvector times the second--

00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:03.660
and the second eigenvector--
that's M again, on this side.

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:08.375
Let me just write
in 1, 0, 0, minus 1.

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:17.620
I believe is has got to
be confirming that we've

00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:19.510
done the thing right--

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:22.030
confirming that the
eigenvectors work here.

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:27.410
Please make sense out
of that last line.

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:33.180
When you see that
last line, what do I

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:35.460
mean to make sense out of it?

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:37.860
I want to see that that's true.

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:39.180
How do I see that--

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:40.770
how do I do this--

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:43.050
so what's the left side
and what's the right side?

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:50.910
So what-- if I
multiply S by a couple

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:54.013
of columns, what's the answer?

00:42:54.013 --> 00:42:55.615
AUDIENCE: Sx1 and Sx2.

00:42:55.615 --> 00:42:56.920
GILBERT STRANG: Sx1 and Sx2.

00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:59.590
That's the beauty of
matrix multiplication.

00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:02.090
If I multiply a matrix
by another matrix,

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:05.400
I can do it a column at a time.

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:07.690
There are four great ways
to multiply matrices,

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:10.900
so this is another one--

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:12.010
a column at a time.

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:16.810
So this left hand
side is Sx1, Sx2.

00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:19.810
I just do each column.

00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:23.030
And what about the
right hand side?

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:25.404
I can do that multiplication.

00:43:25.404 --> 00:43:26.730
AUDIENCE: X1 minus x2.

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:29.860
GILBERT STRANG: X1 minus
x2 did somebody say?

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:31.840
Death.

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:32.340
No.

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:33.520
I don't want-- Oh, x1--

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:34.020
sorry.

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:35.360
You said it right.

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:36.330
OK.

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:39.120
When you said x1 minus
x2, I was subtracting.

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:42.660
But you meant that that's--
the first column is x1,

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:44.820
and the second
column is minus x2.

00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:45.758
Correct.

00:43:45.758 --> 00:43:46.734
Sorry about that.

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.170
And did we come out right?

00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:54.310
Yes.

00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:56.140
Of course, now I compare.

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:59.990
Sx1 is lambda one x1.

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:02.860
Sx2 is lambda two x2.

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:03.520
And I'm golden.

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:12.310
So what was the
point of this board?

00:44:12.310 --> 00:44:15.640
What did we learn?

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:20.750
We learned-- well, we kind of
expected that the original S

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:26.690
would be similar to the lambdas,
because the eigenvalues match.

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:28.790
S has eigenvalues lambda.

00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:30.860
And this diagonal
matrix certainly

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:33.260
has eigenvalues 1n minus 1.

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:35.210
A diagonal matrix--
the eigenvalues

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:37.050
are right in front of you.

00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:38.280
So they're similar.

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.560
S is similar to the lambda.

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:44.310
And there should be an M. And
then somebody suggested, maybe

00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:46.260
the M is the eigenvectors.

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:48.550
And that's the right answer.

00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:53.070
So finally, let me write
that conclusion here--

00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:59.650
which isn't just for
symmetric matrices.

00:44:59.650 --> 00:45:04.710
So maybe I should
put it for matrix A.

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:12.480
So if it has lambdas
and eigenvectors,

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:22.300
and the claim is that A
times the eigenvector matrix

00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:28.793
is the eigenvector matrix
times the eigenvalues.

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:39.750
And I would shorten that
to Ax equals x lambda.

00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:44.200
And I could rewrite
that, and then I'll

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:49.270
slow down, as A equal
x lambda x inverse.

00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:00.040
Really, this is
bringing it all together

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:02.740
in a simple, small formula.

00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:07.360
It's telling us that A
is similar to lambda.

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:10.360
It's telling us the matrix
M, that does the job--

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.390
it's a matrix of eigenvectors.

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:21.580
And so it's like a shorthand
way to write the main fact

00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:24.390
about eigenvalues
and eigenvectors.

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:26.470
What about A squared?

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:28.840
Can I go back to
the very first--

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:31.510
I see time is close
to the end here.

00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:33.850
What about A squared?

00:46:33.850 --> 00:46:36.810
What are the eigenvectors
of A squared?

00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:39.410
What are the eigenvalues
of A squared?

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:42.700
That's like the whole
point of eigenvalues.

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:45.160
Well, or I could just
square that stupid thing.

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:50.140
X lambda, x inverse,
x lambda, x inverse.

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:52.600
And what have I got?

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.730
X inverse, x in the middle is--

00:46:54.730 --> 00:46:55.570
AUDIENCE: Identity.

00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:58.220
GILBERT STRANG: Identity.

00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:03.010
So I have x, lambda
squared, x inverse.

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:06.910
And to me and to you that
says, the eigenvalues

00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:07.810
have been squared.

00:47:07.810 --> 00:47:10.840
The eigenvectors didn't change.

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:11.740
Yeah.

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:12.300
OK.

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:15.250
And now finally,
last breath is, what

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:18.280
if the matrix is symmetric?

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:19.870
Then we have different letters.

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:23.850
That's the only-- that's
the significant change.

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:30.310
The eigenvector matrix is
now an orthogonal matrix.

00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:34.850
I'm coming back to the key
fact of what makes symmetric--

00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:35.930
how do I read--

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:39.350
how do I see symmetric
helping me in the eigenvector

00:47:39.350 --> 00:47:41.180
and eigenvalue world?

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:46.960
Well, it tells me that the
eigenvectors are orthogonal.

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:53.140
So the x is Q. The
eigenvalues are real.

00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:56.880
And the eigenvectors
is x inverse.

00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:00.910
But now I'm going to make those
eigenvectors unit vectors.

00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:02.230
I'm going to normalize it.

00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:04.330
So I'm really allowing--

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:08.020
I have an orthogonal matrix
Q. So I have a different way

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:10.780
to write this, and this
is the end of the--

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:12.370
today's class.

00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:15.430
Q lambda.

00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:18.355
And what can you tell
me about Q inverse?

00:48:18.355 --> 00:48:19.480
AUDIENCE: It's Q transpose.

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:20.630
GILBERT STRANG:
It's Q transpose.

00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:21.130
Thanks.

00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:23.240
So that was the last lecture.

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:27.490
So now the orthogonal
lecture is coming up

00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:31.600
at the last second of the
symmetric matrices lecture.

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:35.380
And this has the name
spectral theorem,

00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:36.730
which I'll just put there.

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:46.640
And the whole point
is that it tells you

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:50.430
what every symmetric
matrix looks like--

00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:54.965
orthogonal eigenvectors,
real eigenvalues.
