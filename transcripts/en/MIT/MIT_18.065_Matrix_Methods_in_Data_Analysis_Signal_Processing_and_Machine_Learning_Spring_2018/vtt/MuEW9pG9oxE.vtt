00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.230
GILBERT STRANG: Well, so
three things to mention.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:33.520
One was you remember last time
I made a list of six or seven

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.080
different situations where
Ax equal b and problems

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.850
that could arise?

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.980
The last one was when A was just
way too big to fit into core.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.220
But in the middle
were other methods.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.030
So other issues,
like the columns

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.900
being nearly dependent when
Gram-Schmidt will come up.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.390
First, I want to say
that I know there

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.310
are typos in the two pages.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.710
I thought you might just like to
see the very first draft of two

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.000
pages of the book.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.710
People sometimes
ask me, how long

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.020
does the book take to write?

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.930
So I started when 18.065
started a year ago.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.790
So I'm into the second year,
and it usually takes two years.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.450
And the system is
I write by hand so.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.030
I wrote those opening pages that
you saw, two pages, by hand.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.210
Then I scan them
to Mumbai, where

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.160
my best friend in the world
types them with typos.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.370
No problem, because I'm
going to make so many changes

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.430
that a few typos are nothing.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.360
Anyway, so he scans
them back to me typed.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.270
And then I start making changes.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.440
If I'm lucky I'd have the
chance to talk about it in here.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.060
Then I realize
better things to do.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.600
Then I scan back to him and back
to me and back to him and back

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.330
to me.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.540
So that's where the
two years disappear.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.300
Anyway, I'm quite happy
with those two pages,

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.300
until I start improving them.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.165
And one other topic from the
past that came out in class.

00:02:27.165 --> 00:02:30.420
It wasn't in the notes yet.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.260
Do you remember the day that
we minimized different norms?

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:45.450
L1 or L2 or max, L infinity
norm with the condition

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.220
of solving with a constraint
that this equation was

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.000
satisfied.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.240
I'm in 2D to be able
to draw a picture.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.520
And the constraint is one line.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.580
And that's about what
the line looks like.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.470
So I'm going to
draw here again--

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:11.640
what I'm doing is putting some
numbers in to that insight

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.235
I drew about a week ago.

00:03:16.235 --> 00:03:17.110
Do you remember that?

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:23.020
Because I thought that really
illustrates how L1 and L2 and L

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.280
infinity are different.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.610
Let me draw the L2 one here.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.590
So where's the
point on this line--

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.060
so x has to lie on this line.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.780
And where is the point
that has the smallest

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.860
sum of squares norm,
standard L2 norm?

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.290
So geometrically
where is that point?

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.510
Well, what does the set
of points with norm 1

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.460
look like for L2?

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.260
It's a circle, right.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.860
So we just blow that
circle up or shrink it down

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.290
until it touches this thing.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.500
And where it touches,
it'll touch where

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.260
the radius is perpendicular.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:16.350
So there's our best point
in L2, because if we picked

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.269
another point, the norm
would have to be bigger

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.860
to go through that point.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.960
So that's clearly the first one.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.060
And actually, we
can probably see

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.950
what it is, because if we
know those are perpendicular,

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.990
I know the slope
of this line. so I

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.750
think that the slope of this
line is something like 3/4,

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.320
probably coming from
there, or maybe 4/3.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.902
We'll figure it out.

00:04:48.902 --> 00:04:49.610
I think it's 4/3.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.840
I'll find that point.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.640
Then the most interesting
one was the L1 norm,

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.644
because what was the shape
of the unit ball for L1?

00:05:02.644 --> 00:05:03.505
AUDIENCE: A diamond.

00:05:03.505 --> 00:05:04.880
GILBERT STRANG:
A diamond, right.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:05.580
A diamond.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.350
So the diamond that first
touches the line is here.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.370
That's the winning point.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.120
And if the line is
3x1 plus 4x2 equal 1,

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.000
then I know that that point is--

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.550
x1 will be 0 and x2 will be 1/4.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.335
So that's the
winning point in L1.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.440
And I think I calculated
this right that the winning

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.430
point in L2 I think will be--

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.240
let's see, this goes up to--

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.190
I'm moving down the line.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:53.400
I think this would
have 3/25, 4/25.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.470
I won't stop to derive that.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.730
But at least-- yeah, the
slope is looking like 4/3.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:04.560
It goes up 4 when it crosses 3.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.110
And the 4 and the
3 came from there.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:12.030
And, of course, you notice that
I've scaled it to fit the line.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:20.730
3 times 3/25 is 9/25
plus 16/25, 25/25 is 1.

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.280
And finally, what
about L infinity?

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.560
What was the picture there?

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:31.050
What's the unit ball look
like in 2D for the max norm?

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.550
It's a--

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.450
AUDIENCE: Square.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.190
GILBERT STRANG: Square, right.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.250
So the square will hit there.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.610
These two on the square are--

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.350
this is a 45 degree
line now on that square.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.600
It hits it at that sharp point.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.510
And so the x1 and x2 are equal.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.510
And I think they're probably--

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:59.390
let's see, if they're
equal, if we made them 1/7,

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.900
then I'd have 3/7
plus 4/7 equals 7/7.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.260
Yeah, I think we
make some 1/7, 1/7.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.300
So that would be the
x infinity point.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.700
3/7 plus 4/7 give 1.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.970
So why do I mention this?

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.820
First, because when I did it
before I just drew pictures

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.960
without really
solving the problem.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.181
And secondly, because in
thinking ahead about projects,

00:07:30.181 --> 00:07:33.880
this is the kind of
project that I would

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.470
think is quite interesting.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.650
Obviously, as this is p equal 1.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.780
This is p equal 2.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.400
This is p equal infinity.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.030
And I guess it's pretty
clear from the pictures

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:50.750
that as p increases, this
point starts up here.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:54.670
And moves down the
line and ends up here.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:59.770
And I've no idea like what the
solution is for a different p

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:01.180
and how it moves.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:09.940
And to make it more of a
project, what happens in 3D?

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.260
What happens in 3D?

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:17.020
In 3D, if I have one equation
in 3D, then I have a plane.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.610
And this would become a
diamond, a 3D diamond.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:23.560
This would be a 3D sphere.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.050
This would be a 3D cube.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:30.110
They would expand
to hit that plane.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:35.190
And I don't know how many
zeros you get in that case.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.299
So that would be the
case of one equation.

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:45.630
So there would be a plane that
these diamond, sphere, and cube

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.790
expand until they hit it.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:51.580
Or you could have two
constraints, two equations.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.480
So if we had two equations
and three unknowns,

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.840
that would be a line again.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:01.250
But how many zeros would we
get in these different cases?

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:06.100
How sparse is L1 going to be?

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.480
That's like a recapture
of what we did.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.420
It's nice occasionally
to have pictures

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:20.390
showing where the solution is.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:28.280
Now, I'm coming to the topic of
the day, which is Gram-Schmidt.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.710
And so Gram-Schmidt, number
one, is the standard way

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:41.580
that would be taught in 18.06.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.530
So what's Gram-Schmidt about?

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:49.240
I'll just put down here
general facts of Gram-Schmidt.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:53.780
We start with a matrix
A. It's got n columns.

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:00.900
But they're not orthogonal.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:04.560
And, in fact, they may
be badly conditioned.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.320
Columns might be nearly
dependent on the others.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.020
I'm going to assume the
columns are independent,

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.540
but they might be
barely independent.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.410
So those lines then would
be sort of like pointing

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.450
very nearly parallel.

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:25.390
But Gram-Schmidt
opens up the picture

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:33.850
to get a matrix Q, an orthogonal
matrix with columns Q1 to Qn,

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:36.050
which our ortho-normal.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:40.550
So it gets a
perfect basis of Qs.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:44.650
And so that's what
Gram-Schmidt does.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.740
And these are different ways
to do it, different ways

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:51.910
to organize the computation.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:55.150
I really only put
the standard way in.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.150
What is this mysterious R?

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:07.530
So the Qs are
combinations of the As.

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:11.850
So there's some matrix to tell
me what those combinations are.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:16.980
Or if I go back go backwards
and say, well, the As

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.670
are combinations of the Qs,
that's what I'm about to do.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:24.330
If I say each A is
a combination of Qs,

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:28.410
that means that my
A matrix is my Q

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:31.410
matrix times some
R matrix, which

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:35.130
tells me the combinations.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.680
When I multiply
by R on the right,

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.830
I'm taking combinations
of the columns of Q

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.170
and getting the columns of A.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:48.300
So just like LU, you go
forward with the algorithm

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:53.730
to reach U. Here, we go forward
where the algorithm to reach Q.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:12:00.000
But then when we want to put
it in one simple equation,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.300
it turns out to be
better to go backwards

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:08.340
and say how is the original
A related to the final Q,

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:12.020
there has to be some R.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:15.050
OK, I always feel when I
talk about Gram-Schmidt--

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:18.050
I usually end with
that A equal QR.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.350
And, of course, the Matlab
command is exactly QR.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:30.830
So in Matlab, the command would
be QR of A, instead of LU of A.

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:35.750
So it would give you Q and R.
That's what Matlab will output.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:41.510
Now, as I say, Q is the
saying we're constructing.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:48.960
R is the combinations that
we need to get what we want.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:53.720
And so it comes at the
end, what the heck was R.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.050
But actually, R is
really a simple idea.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:00.570
So I want to show that at the
beginning instead of the end.

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:07.460
OK, so I'm going to move
Q over here, as Q inverse.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.289
But what is Q inverse?

00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:11.572
AUDIENCE: Q transpose.

00:13:11.572 --> 00:13:13.030
GILBERT STRANG: Q
transpose, right,

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:15.590
because I've created
an orthogonal matrix.

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:21.382
So this mysterious
R is Q transpose A.

00:13:21.382 --> 00:13:29.450
And let me just sort of make
it grow out into matrices.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:34.590
That has the Qs along the
rows, Q transpose, of course.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:39.260
Qn transpose, Q1 transpose.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.780
I'm transposing the
matrix above it.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.060
So these columns become rows.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.540
Times the As, A1 to An.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:56.790
So what is a typical entry in R?

00:13:56.790 --> 00:14:00.750
That's really why I want to say
nothing mysterious about this.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.930
You can see what
you end up with.

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:04.500
It will be right in
front of us here.

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:14.270
What is the entry in
row i, column j of R?

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:21.370
OK, this says that
all those entries in R

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:27.140
are Qi transpose times Aj.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.740
That's the old way
to multiply matrices.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:36.140
And it's the best way for
this, a row times a column.

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:40.960
In other words, the Rs are
just the inner products,

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:46.530
the dot products of the Qs with
the As, of the Qs with the As.

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:50.380
That's sort of like
nothing mysterious about R.

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.200
Because Q is an
orthogonal matrix,

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:58.260
we were able to put
it over here, get

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:02.640
a nice expression for R,
and see what it really is.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:09.270
So you can do R at the
end or on the root.

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:13.740
But that's just the inner
product of the Qs with the A's.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.980
Now, what's Gram-Schmidt?

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:20.310
I'm sort of thinking
you've seen the basic ideas

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:23.340
of Gram-Schmidt,
but let's review.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:32.230
So I start with a.

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:35.950
So what does
Gram-Schmidt begin with?

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:37.000
a1.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.410
It takes that first column.

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:47.170
So these a's are not
orthogonal generally.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:50.070
But the first direction is OK.

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:52.290
I have no complaints
about the first direction,

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:58.150
except that a1 might
not be a unit vector.

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:05.980
So q1 will just be a1 over its
norm to have a unit vector.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:10.100
The whole idea of
Gram-Schmidt is in q2.

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.490
So what is q2?

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:15.040
The whole idea is coming here.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.930
It's the only thing
you need to know.

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:18.760
And the picture shows it.

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.560
So q2, I start with a2.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.240
But it's not orthogonal to a1.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.020
So what do I do?

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:37.690
I figure out the component
of a2 in the a1 direction

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:39.190
and I remove it.

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:42.605
So I take that vector away
and I'm left with this vector.

00:16:42.605 --> 00:16:43.480
So there is a vector.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:44.440
I'll call that A2.

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:57.010
So A2 is the original little a2
with the a1 direction removed.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:03.610
So what what's the formula
for what I just did?

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:08.230
This is the whole, the key
step that Gram-Schmidt repeats

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:09.910
over and over and over again.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:12.670
It's truly boring.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:18.010
So it subtracts-- well,
remember that this

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:20.530
is in the same direction as Q1.

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:26.960
And it's better to work with Q1,
because we've found that guy.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.130
We've got it.

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.710
And we know it's a unit vector.

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:35.180
So here's my linear
algebra question.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:40.630
What's the component of a2
that I want to subtract off?

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.880
It's the component in
the direction of q1.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:48.230
It's this in the
direction of q1.

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:51.520
And let me just
remember, so obviously,

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.560
that angle is coming into it.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:18:02.010
So that will be a2
transpose q1 times q1.

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.460
That's it.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.310
That's the component
that we remove.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:18.220
And maybe I'd prefer to
write it as q1 transpose a2.

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:19.560
I don't know.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.060
It doesn't matter of course.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.320
The two dot products
are the same.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:27.420
Maybe I will just--

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.480
yeah-- well, maybe not.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:30.980
Fine.

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:39.700
Now what is that vector
supposed to achieve?

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:44.170
It's supposed to be this vector.

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:45.850
This vector I'm
really going to call

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:52.390
A2, because it's in the
right direction for Q2,

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:55.060
but it is not yet?

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:56.350
AUDIENCE: Normal.

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:57.710
GILBERT STRANG: Normal.

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:00.550
So what is Q2 then?

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:03.860
So I'm saying this guy
got the direction right.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.280
They're saying subtract
it off this vector.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.600
Got that direction right.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.190
Got it as A2.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:12.850
What is Q2 now that
I want to finish?

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:13.860
I've got the direction.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:18.060
All I want to do is get
it to be a unit vector.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:21.720
So I just take A2 over its norm.

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:31.640
That double step is the
whole thing in Gram-Schmidt,

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.760
the whole thing.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:40.220
Subtract off the components
in the directions already set.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:43.340
Then you get something in a
totally new direction, called

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:48.290
A, capital A. And then
you divide by its length

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:49.720
to make it a unit vector.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.570
And that gives you the new Q.

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:56.620
Just to show that
we've got a point, what

00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:01.860
about the next
step, aiming for Q3.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.890
So tell me what A3 should be?

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:07.580
A3, I'm going to
start with this.

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:11.920
And I'm going to
subtract off some stuff.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.460
What am I going to subtract off?

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:15.930
AUDIENCE: The transpose.

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:20.220
GILBERT STRANG: The component,
a3 transpose, right.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:24.180
Times q1 q1.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:30.190
And I didn't yet check so that
this came out orthogonal to q1,

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:32.260
but I'll come back to that.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:37.910
Now, have I done everything
I should do here with a3?

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:40.350
No, I've got one
more step to take.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:43.360
And I should take the
two steps separately.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.360
It's called modified
Gram-Schmidt.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:51.500
And what I want to do is
subtract off the q2 component.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:55.340
So what multiple
of q2 do I need?

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:59.240
Because q2 has been set
by the time I get to a3,

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:03.120
so what goes here?

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.960
AUDIENCE: a3 transpose

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.230
GILBERT STRANG: a3 transpose--

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:07.930
AUDIENCE: q2

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:08.722
GILBERT STRANG: q2.

00:21:08.722 --> 00:21:09.290
Thanks.

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:09.790
Thanks.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:16.370
If you look at a code,
say a Matlab code

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:23.060
to do Gram-Schmidt-- oh,
what's the final q3 then?

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.252
AUDIENCE: Normalize it.

00:21:24.252 --> 00:21:25.460
GILBERT STRANG: Normalize it.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:29.570
So you take A3, which is
in the right direction,

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:33.050
and you divide by its
length to get a unit vector.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:41.170
Let me just come back and
check that I did it right,

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:42.790
that I got the right direction.

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:44.870
So what do I mean by
the right direction?

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:49.360
What should I check
about that guy?

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:54.515
I should check that it's
inner product with q1 is?

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:02.420
If this is the right
direction to go,

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.930
that way, then I should check--

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:07.550
I have to check--

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:10.250
hopefully, I've got
the formula right--

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:14.840
that it's dot product,
inner product with q1 is--

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:15.530
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:16.280
GILBERT STRANG: 0.

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.110
Thank you.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:20.090
So is it obvious that it is?

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:24.453
Take the inner product of the
dot product of that with q1,

00:22:24.453 --> 00:22:25.120
what do you get?

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:32.370
You get the same number
q1 a2 transpose q1.

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:33.780
You get that number.

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:39.690
And over here, you're
getting q1 transpose with q1.

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:42.365
So do you see what I'm doing?

00:22:42.365 --> 00:22:45.750
Probably it looks like it
would have been better.

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:51.940
I'm checking that q1
transpose a2 is 0.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.650
Yeah, it is.

00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:02.930
q1 transpose a2 here, q1
transpose a2, or a2 transpose

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:04.690
q1, I don't mind.

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:08.840
And I have another
q1 transpose q1 here.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.550
And what is that?

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:12.680
What is q1 transpose q1?

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.450
It is?

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:13.950
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:15.200
GILBERT STRANG: 1.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.010
So check.

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:25.460
OK, that's Gram-Schmidt,
standard Gram-Schmidt,

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:29.885
which you have met before.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:37.350
Now, I'm ready for a
better Gram-Schmidt.

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:42.250
You could say a better
Gram-Schmidt, because here--

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:45.480
so what's it going
to be the difference?

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:50.010
Here, I took the a's in
their original order.

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:57.390
Now, suppose I did
that with elimination.

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:00.330
Elimination, usually we
write as acting on the row.

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:04.820
So thinking about elimination,
I'm thinking I'm the rows.

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:10.340
What would be the danger in
taking the rows in order, doing

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:17.140
no row exchanges, just figure
out the pivot each time,

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:20.420
and kill the rest of the
column and then move on?

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:23.350
So taking the rows in
the order they came,

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:26.140
whatever it might
be, what's the risk?

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:30.770
And why would
Matlab not do that?

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:34.550
Because something can be
very small and totally

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:37.100
blow up your calculations.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.770
And that's that pivot number.

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:45.620
Sort of the question is,
if a2 is very near a1--

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:50.510
so let me draw a new picture.

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:52.150
So here's the risk.

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:55.110
So a1 was whatever it was.

00:24:55.110 --> 00:25:00.510
If a2 is really close
to the same direction,

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:03.500
then I'm subtracting
off almost all of it,

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:08.780
and I've got some tiny little
bit for the new direction.

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:12.020
That's like the
pivot in elimination.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:16.670
It's the number that
sort of measures what's

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:20.030
new, what the new
row in elimination

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:26.960
or the new column in
Gram-Schmidt gives you.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.850
And if that's too small--

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:31.070
I mean, like in
elimination, as I say,

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:35.210
we would never use
an elimination code

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:39.170
on a general matrix that didn't
check the size of the pivot

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:42.380
and exchange rows
when necessary.

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:45.810
Well, similarly,
with Gram-Schmidt, it

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:48.780
can take the columns in order.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:52.770
That's the standard Gram-Schmidt
taking the columns in order.

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:57.960
But only if it checks each
time that the little bit--

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:06.600
well, that the new part,
what would be the new part,

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:15.910
is big enough to be able to--
we have to divide by the thing.

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:19.180
And if that A2 is
tiny is a tiny vector.

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:23.380
This is dividing
by A2 and onwards

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:29.330
is building in round-off error
that we can't remove again.

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:31.150
We're stuck with it.

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:40.320
So that's the column exchange,
column pivoting idea in sort

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:45.870
of a more professional
Gram-Schmidt.

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:50.340
And to do it--

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:56.100
so I have to be able to
compare this little bit,

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.650
if it is little, with what?

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:02.210
What am I going to compare with?

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:04.720
In elimination, I looked
down the rest of the column

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.560
for a bigger number.

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:15.400
I guess what I have to do is
I have to find this component,

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:20.860
not just from a2, but from
all the remaining a's.

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.330
And I'll pick the biggest.

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:26.630
So there, in that
sentence, I said

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:29.780
the main idea of
column exchangers

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:36.850
is once you get q1 set, which
certainly q1 was the easiest

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:41.920
one in the world,
but maybe even for q1

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.980
I guess it could even happen.

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.410
That would be like
starting with a zero

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:51.040
up in the upper left corner
for elimination, like what

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:54.290
a way to start the day.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:28:01.180
Here, if my matrix A
had a tiny little a1,

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:04.000
then I should look
for a bigger one

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.780
to get the very first q chosen.

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:12.640
Let's suppose-- give ourselves
a reasonable chance here--

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:19.840
let's suppose a1 was a decent
size, so as I've drawn.

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:28.380
The next step might not
be, if I use a2, as I say,

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:31.810
it could be same
direction as a1 virtually,

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:35.280
and then I'm just working
with that little piece.

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:39.460
So what do I have
to do differently?

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:44.220
I have to be able to compare
this little piece with all

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:49.020
the other potential
possibilities.

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.930
So let me just write
down what you have

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:55.180
to do in a different order.

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:59.730
So this is now with column
pivoting, column exchange,

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:06.880
column pivoting allowed,
or it's possible.

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:17.500
So to make it possible, I
have to find not only A2,

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:25.480
the piece of little a2, I
have to find a2, the piece.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.160
I'm just going to copy that.

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:34.840
I have to take my second column,
subtract off the q1 part.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.330
And that could be small.

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:39.790
So I have to compare it with--

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:43.000
oh, I haven't
written this page up.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.080
So I haven't got a
notation in mind yet.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.520
I won't give it a name.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:58.050
I have to also compute at
this step before deciding q2--

00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:07.290
now I'm describing how to
decide q2, the second vector.

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:13.530
And I'm saying that
the way to decide q2

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:20.370
is not only to take a piece of
a2 but also the piece of a3.

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:22.050
Look at this piece.

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:26.245
And look at all
the other pieces.

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:39.420
And now, what will be my policy?

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:46.980
Standard Gram-Schmidt
accepted this one,

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.060
and didn't look at these.

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.850
But, now, I'm going
to look at them all.

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:54.500
And I'm going to
take the largest.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.590
I'm going to take the largest.

00:30:56.590 --> 00:31:00.130
And that will be
the A2 that I want.

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:03.360
So it might not be this one.

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:08.310
If this guy is largest, then
I'm taking column 3 first.

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:11.220
And that will be my A2.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:12.720
And then I'll say fine.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:17.170
And then q2 will be
that A2 over its norm.

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:21.680
You see the difference?

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.832
It's not exciting.

00:31:23.832 --> 00:31:25.290
And you might think,
wait a minute,

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:27.810
this is a heck of
a lot more work.

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:30.850
But it isn't.

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:33.430
It isn't actually more
work, because these

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:34.870
are all the things--

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:37.930
these ones that look like
we're paying a price,

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:41.260
we're computing all
these alternatives--

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:44.530
but we had to do that
eventually anyway.

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:45.670
Do you see that?

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:46.750
Let me just say it again.

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:59.310
The standard way took all the
components, like for here.

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:03.760
The standard way waited
until you got to column 3

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:07.180
and then subtracted
off both pieces,

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:11.590
waited until you got to column
4, subtracted off three pieces.

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:14.880
This way, you're subtracting
off the first piece

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.140
as soon as you know
what it should be.

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:21.700
As soon as you know
q1, you remove it

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:24.220
from all the remaining vectors.

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.050
And you look to see
what's the biggest.

00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:27.950
You pick the biggest one.

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:30.220
I said maybe it's this guy.

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:31.590
So you move that one.

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:34.420
Or some permutation
matrix is going to move it

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:36.220
to the second column.

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.615
See, it started in
the third column,

00:32:38.615 --> 00:32:40.240
but I'm going to move
it to the second,

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.220
because it's the biggest.

00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:45.520
Then I do the right thing.

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.560
I find q2.

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:59.230
And now I go on toward q3.

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:00.460
And how will I find q3?

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:07.200
I'd want to pick the
biggest column to work with.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:11.230
So I subtract off
the q2 components.

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:13.770
This is like easy to
say, but I had never

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:15.940
like figured it out before.

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:17.440
So let me just say it again.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.260
And then I'll leave
that with you.

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.350
How do I get q3?

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:28.220
I've fixed two columns.

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:33.590
They happened to be,
maybe not necessarily

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:36.530
the first two, but two
columns, two q's are set,

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:39.170
and I'm looking
for the next one.

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:43.190
I go on and I look at all the
remaining columns, all of which

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:49.230
have had subtracted off
their q1 and q2 parts.

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:52.950
So I've orthogonalized
with respect to q1 and q2.

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:55.080
I look at all the
remaining things

00:33:55.080 --> 00:34:00.140
that I have to work with
and pick the biggest.

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:03.450
Just like picking the biggest
number to go into the pivot.

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:08.330
OK, I don't think I
can say it anymore

00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:12.469
without just repeating myself.

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:16.650
And I bring it here to
class, because I had not

00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:21.440
sort of appreciated the
point that no extra work was

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.489
involved.

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:29.810
You just did these subtractions
for all the remaining columns

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:35.060
of A before you started
on the next job.

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:36.860
Is that OK?

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:40.480
Eventually the notes
will describe that.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:41.770
Maybe they even do.

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:43.190
Yeah, I think they even do.

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:45.920
I wrote it but I
didn't understand it.

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:49.130
Now, little improvement.

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:50.961
So yes?

00:34:50.961 --> 00:34:52.650
AUDIENCE: So are we
permuting every time

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:53.730
to get the biggest pivot?

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:54.409
GILBERT STRANG: Yeah.

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:54.989
Yeah.

00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:56.489
Only we don't call them pivots.

00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:57.600
Or maybe we should.

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:00.600
I don't know what word is
used to get the biggest

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.950
column remaining or something.

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:05.370
Yeah, yeah, each time.

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:11.070
You know, if the columns
were in a stupid order,

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:13.320
this puts them in
the right order.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:19.345
OK, finally, come these
weird names, Krylov, Russian.

00:35:19.345 --> 00:35:22.380
Arnoldi, actually, I
don't know what he is.

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:23.940
And I shouldn't
admit that on tape.

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:31.920
So what's the idea there?

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.850
So again, we're
solving Ax equal b.

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:37.680
So this is going to be Krylov.

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:40.400
What was his idea?

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.300
Well, I want to
solve Ax equal b.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:49.980
A is a big matrix, pretty big.

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:51.810
Of course, I don't
plan to invert it.

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:53.130
That would be insane.

00:35:55.660 --> 00:36:00.640
What I can do with a the matrix
A, especially if it's sparse--

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:07.330
so a large sparse A would be
a good candidate for Krylov.

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:17.920
So what is it that you could
do cheap and fast with a large,

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:23.144
I mean really large, but
really sparse matrix A?

00:36:23.144 --> 00:36:24.500
AUDIENCE: Matrix times a vector.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.600
GILBERT STRANG: You can do
a matrix times a vector.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:28.710
And here's our matrix.

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:31.740
And there is our vector.

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:35.640
So we could start
with a vector b.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:38.850
We can multiply A times b.

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:42.930
We can multiply A
times A times b.

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:44.430
And, of course, I
write it that way.

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:50.320
I never-- I mean, like if you
multiply A times A first, then

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:59.590
like you turn in
your Matlab account,

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:02.510
because you just have
to do it that way.

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:05.840
And then you keep going, which
of course is A squared b,

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.730
but you didn't form A squared.

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:09.380
And then on up to--

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:16.010
in the end, you get to some
A to say k, k minus 1 b.

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:20.210
But, of course, that's
computed as A times

00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:23.360
the previous one, which was
A times the previous one.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:29.050
So there is a bunch
of vectors, which

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:30.400
are likely to be independent.

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:35.330
So they span a space.

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:38.520
And it's called
the Krylov space.

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:39.730
So these span.

00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:42.230
They're combinations.

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:48.650
Combinations give--
oh, I don't like

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:50.930
that letter k, because
that's also Krylov,

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:54.300
so what shall I say? j.

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:56.300
So I have j vectors.

00:37:56.300 --> 00:38:00.780
The original b, Ab, A
squared b, up to that.

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:12.890
So combinations give the
Krylov space, say, we'll

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:17.450
name it after Krylov and
we need a subscript j

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:22.750
to show how big it
is, its dimension.

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:27.640
So that will be the idea.

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:30.610
Well, let me complete the idea.

00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:32.760
The idea will be--

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:33.980
there are combinations.

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:41.890
So that's a space, a subspace,
pretty big if j is big.

00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:48.046
And I'm going to look for the
best solution in that space.

00:38:48.046 --> 00:38:53.780
So I'm not going to solve
of Ax equals b exactly.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:57.140
I'm going to find the
best solution, the closest

00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:01.790
solution, the least squares
solution in this Krylov space.

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:04.190
I'm going to let
j be pretty big.

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:08.550
So this space has got
plenty of vectors in it.

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:10.240
I have a basis for this space.

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:19.910
And some combination of these
basis vectors will be my xj.

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:34.300
So, again, xj will be the best
vector, or the closest vector

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:39.830
in this Krylov space, j,
It will be the best vector

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:43.070
in that space, the closest one.

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:45.710
So I know what the space is.

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:48.830
I've reduced the
dimension down to j.

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:51.650
And I can find this best vector.

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:55.960
There's just one catch.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:00.960
And it's the same
catch that Gram-Schmidt

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:07.900
were aiming to help to remove.

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:10.570
That is this basis that I'm--

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:15.130
right now, I'm working with
all combinations of these guys.

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:20.510
And those could be
very, very dependent.

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:22.500
That might be a terrible basis.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:26.090
Anytime you want to
do big computations,

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:28.020
what kind of a
basis do you want?

00:40:30.942 --> 00:40:31.920
Yes?

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:37.300
So what sort of a basis
is good to project onto

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:41.720
to find the best solution
within that subspace?

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:45.920
So we're sort of
finding a projection.

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:50.040
And you've got vectors
that span the space.

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:55.300
So you know what
you're projecting onto.

00:40:55.300 --> 00:41:01.210
But those vectors, they
might be nearly dependent.

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:05.170
They might all be pointing
almost the same direction.

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:08.710
In which case, your
calculations are terrible.

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:10.950
So what do you do?

00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:15.910
Orth-- Orthogonalize.

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:18.250
And that's where
Arnoldi comes in.

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:21.280
And there's also a
Hungarian guy named Lanczos.

00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:30.160
So that's what they
contribute is how

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.750
to orthogonalize that basis.

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:38.900
And then, once you've done that,
you have an orthogonal basis.

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:40.750
And, of course, an
orthogonal basis

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:44.860
is perfect to do a projection.

00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:49.550
Everybody has to know that.

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:51.890
Why is a orthogonal
basis so great?

00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:53.510
Ortho-normal even.

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:55.040
Let's just remember.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.740
Suppose I have a vector x.

00:42:00.146 --> 00:42:01.280
It's unknown here.

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:03.590
But suppose I have it.

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:06.470
And I want to write
it as a combination

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:08.750
of these ortho-normal guys.

00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:14.750
say, n.

00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:21.940
What is it about all
ortho-normal q's that

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:25.420
makes this easy to
do, which it would not

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:28.390
be with an arbitrary basis?

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:33.010
So this is really
Q times c, right?

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:36.590
Q times this vector of C's.

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:41.270
The q's are in the columns of
Q. The c's were multiplying

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:44.040
a matrix by a vector.

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:45.750
It's a combination
of the columns.

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:47.540
That's what we get.

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:54.200
And when the q's are
orthogonal, what's the answer?

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:57.990
We can get the
answer straight away.

00:42:57.990 --> 00:43:03.870
So here, we're trying to find
the coefficients with respect

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:10.470
to the basis vectors
Q of a given vector x.

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:13.770
And what's the answer
to that question?

00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:18.900
The point is, usually, to
find the coefficients, c would

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:21.300
have to be Q inverse x.

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:24.510
We'd have to solve that
system of equations.

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:27.240
We do have to solve that
system of equations.

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:32.735
But where's the payoff
from ortho-normal basis?

00:43:32.735 --> 00:43:33.610
AUDIENCE: Q inverse--

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:36.910
GILBERT STRANG: Q
inverse is Q transpose.

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:38.590
That's the payoff.

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:45.410
So it's just telling
me that to find c1--

00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:47.280
how do I find c1?

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:52.010
This says take the first
q1, transpose with x.

00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:53.720
I'll say the same thing here.

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:58.090
Take the first vector with x.

00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:01.780
That will be about
cq, q1, transpose q1.

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:05.990
I'm just taking the dot product
of everything there with q1.

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:11.510
And then a c2, q1
transpose, q2 and so on.

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:12.836
But what's good?

00:44:12.836 --> 00:44:14.460
AUDIENCE: You have zeros.

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:15.710
GILBERT STRANG: Tell me again.

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:17.240
AUDIENCE: The other
ones are zeros.

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:18.698
GILBERT STRANG:
These are all zero.

00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:25.530
And the q1 transpose q1 is?

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:26.140
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:26.890
GILBERT STRANG: 1.

00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:28.170
So it's perfect.

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:30.450
c1 is q1 transpose x.

00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:35.160
And that's exactly
what that tells us.

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.470
The first component
is the first row

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:46.760
of q transpose, which
is q1 transpose with x.

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:48.420
So that's the idea.

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:52.260
So that's the idea here.

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:56.790
That's the reason for
Arnoldi and Lanczos

00:44:56.790 --> 00:45:01.140
being famous is that they
figured out a good way

00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:04.070
to orthogonalize that basis.

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:13.500
Do we want to see what they did?

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:16.910
Or those would be in the notes.

00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:20.070
Well, how do you do it?

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:21.420
So this is the basis.

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:24.630
This is our not good basis.

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:28.712
And then our good basis
is going to be q's.

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:34.740
So I'll take b to
be-- q1 will be what?

00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:36.725
What would be the
right choice for q1?

00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:42.520
Well, I'll take that first
vector and normalize it.

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:48.010
We're just doing Gram-Schmidt.

00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:50.950
What would q2 be?

00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:56.730
How would I find q2 following
the Gram-Schmidt idea?

00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:58.950
I take Ab.

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:05.140
I subtract off its component
in this q1 direction

00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:07.120
and I normalize.

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:10.510
And all the Arnoldi
Lanczos algorithm

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:16.000
is is that same
Gram-Schmidt idea applied

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.480
to these Krylov vectors.

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:24.430
So Arnoldi-Lanczos-- Arnoldi
is for any matrix and Lanczos

00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:28.120
is for a symmetric matrix where
you get some special benefit.

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:34.260
So what they did,
you could say now,

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:40.350
they just wrote
down Gram-Schmidt,

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:42.960
in fact, probably the
standard Gram-Schmidt,

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.570
because this is a
case where we really

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:47.910
don't want to exchange columns.

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:53.460
I don't want suddenly to
be pushed into this one.

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:55.740
I'd rather take them in
order, because it just

00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:56.760
turns out right.

00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.650
And this is in the notes.

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:01.150
So let me tell
you where this is.

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:02.990
It will be Section II.1.

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:08.500
So Part 2 of the book,
which is where we are,

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.690
and the first section.

00:47:10.690 --> 00:47:15.010
So what all together is
in this first section when

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:17.470
you look at it?

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:21.160
That section is standard
numerical linear algebra,

00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:28.270
what any course in
MIT offers, 18.3--

00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:36.910
I'm not sure of the number, 330
maybe, which is, of all things

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:38.610
like this.

00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:41.600
Krylov would be there,
Arnoldi, Lanczos.

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:44.480
Of course, Gram and
Schmidt would be there.

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:48.960
That's five people who've
thought of the same thing.

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:53.190
And so that Section
II.1 summarizes

00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:56.370
what's in really good,
well, a lot of textbooks.

00:47:56.370 --> 00:48:04.560
And let me mention a favorite,
a book by Trefethen and Bau.

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:10.150
Or the "Bible."

00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:12.130
So this is maybe a
moment to tell you

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:17.680
about two books on classical
numerical linear algebra, what

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:21.050
do you do for matrices
of order 1,000,

00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:22.856
not for matrices
of order millions.

00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:28.210
That you have to rethink.

00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:31.810
So Trefethen-Bau isn't called
numerical linear algebra.

00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:35.860
And do you know the
authors of the Bible

00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:38.890
of numerical linear algebra?

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:45.190
So that's a textbook.

00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:48.730
And what I'm going to
write down now finally

00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:54.880
is 750 pages it's grown
to in its fourth edition.

00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:58.870
It's the Bible for all
numerical linear algebra people.

00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:03.440
And it's written by
Golub and VanLoan.

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:13.190
So Gene Golub was
a remarkable guy.

00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:18.050
He probably didn't write more
than about 11 pages of this.

00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:20.300
Charlie wrote most of it.

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:25.770
But Golub was an
amazing person who

00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:29.400
traveled the world
and connected people

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:32.900
and left behind
papers to be written

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:35.520
and books to be written.

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:40.530
And so this Golub-VanLoan
is now in the fourth volume.

00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:47.230
And it has so much good stuff
and references that it's

00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:49.690
like the good reference.

00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:52.000
And this is the
good textbook if you

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.695
were going to teach a course
on numerical linear algebra.

00:49:56.695 --> 00:50:02.350
So I think that I've come
to the point to finish.

00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:06.880
So I really have finished
along with the extra attraction

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:12.860
of this different problem,
I finished with Ax equal b.

00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:18.040
And, well, at least,
I now move onto what

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:21.158
to do with really,
really large matrices.
