00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.750
GILBERT STRANG: OK, let
me start one minute early.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:35.140
So this being MIT, I just came
from a terrific faculty member,

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.200
Andy Lo in the Sloan
School, and I have

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.070
to tell you what he told us.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.250
And then I had to leave before
he could explain why it's true,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.300
but this is like an amazing fact
which I don't want to forget,

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.730
so here you go.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.380
Everything will
be on that board.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:06.010
So it's an observation about us
or other people, maybe not us.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.730
So suppose you
have a biased coin.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.870
Maybe the people playing
this game don't know,

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.950
but it's 75% likely
to produce heads,

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.180
25% likely to produce tails.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.520
And then the player has
to guess for one flip

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:36.860
after another heads or tails,
and you get $1 if you're right,

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.530
you pay $1 if you're wrong.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.700
So you just want to get
as many right choices

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.510
as possible from this
coin flip that continues.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.120
So what should you do?

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:58.370
Well what I hope we
would do is we would not

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.740
know what the probabilities
were, so we would guess maybe

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.870
heads the first time,
tails the second time,

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.590
heads the third time, and so on.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.270
But the actual result
would be mostly heads,

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.520
so we would learn at some point
that-- maybe not quite as soon

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.330
as that.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.990
We would eventually
learn that we should

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.610
keep guessing heads, right?

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.430
And that would be
our optimal strategy,

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.500
to guess heads all the time.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.620
But what do people actually do?

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.950
They start like
this, the same way,

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.020
and then they're
beginning to learn

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.730
that heads is more common.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.460
So maybe they do more
heads than tails,

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.440
but sometimes tails is right,
and then after a little while,

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.430
they maybe see that it's-- yeah.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.970
Well maybe they're not
counting, they're just

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.060
operating like ordinary people.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.270
And what do ordinary people
actually do in the long run?

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.270
You would think guess
heads every time, right?

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.530
But they don't.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.130
In the long run, people
and maybe animals

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.740
and whatever guess heads three
quarters of the time and tails

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.300
one quarter of the time.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.310
Isn't that unbelievable?

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.040
They're guessing tails
a quarter of the time

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.130
when the odds are
never changing.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.000
Anyway, that's something that
economists and other people

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.080
have to explain, and if I had
been able to stay another hour,

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.230
I could tell you
about the explanation.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.890
Oh, I see I've written
that on a board

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.440
that I have no way to bury,
so it's going to be there,

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.880
and it's not the
subject of 18.065

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.060
but it's kind of amazing.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.930
All right, so there's good
math problems everywhere.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:13.650
OK.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:20.339
Can I just leave you with what
I know, and if I learn more,

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:22.510
I'll come back to that question.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.780
OK.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.630
Please turn attention
this way, right?

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.870
Norms.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.330
A few words on norms,
like that should

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.730
be a word in your language.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.740
And so you should
know what it means

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.610
and you should know a few
of the important norms.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.880
Again, a norm is
a way to measure

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.740
the size of a vector or the
size of a matrix or the size

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.200
of a tensor, whatever we have.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.100
Or a function.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.490
Very important.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.800
A norm would be a
function like sine x.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.760
From 0 to pi, what would be
the size of that function?

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.970
Well if it was 2 sine x, the
size would be twice as much,

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.420
so the norm should reflect that.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.610
So yesterday, or Wednesday,
I told you that--

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:25.050
so p equals 2, 1,
actually infinity,

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.490
and then I'm going to put in
the 0 norm with a question mark

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.270
because you'll see
that it has a problem.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.100
But let me just
recall from last time.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:43.110
So p equal to 2 is the usual
sum of squares square root.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.090
Usual length of a vector.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.850
p equal 1 is this
very important norm,

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.240
so I would call
that the l1 norm,

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.690
and we'll see a lot of that.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.200
I mentioned that it plays
a very significant part now

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.730
in compressed sensing.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:09.010
It really was a bombshell in
signal processing to discover--

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.290
and in other fields,
too-- to discover

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:17.220
that some things really
work best in the l1 norm.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.770
The maximum norm has a
natural part to play,

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:26.410
and we'll see that,
or its matrix analog.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.930
So I didn't mention the l0 norm.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.810
All this lp business.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:41.605
So the lp norm, for any p,
is you take the pth power--

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.380
to the pth power.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.630
Up here, p was 2.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.040
And you take the pth root.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.700
So maybe I should
write it to the 1/p.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.820
Then that way, taking
pth powers and pth

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.350
roots, we do get the
norm of 2v has a factor

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:08.050
2 compared to the norm of v.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.120
So p equal to 2, you see it.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.590
We've got it right there.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.320
p equal 1, you see it
here because it's just

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.290
the sum of the absolute values.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.830
p equal to infinity,
if I move p up

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.160
and up and up, it
will pick out--

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.490
as I increase p,
whichever one is biggest

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.740
is going to just
take over, and that's

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.450
why you get the max norm.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:37.330
Now the zero norm, where I'm
using that word improperly,

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.520
as you'll see.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.490
So what is the zero norm?

00:07:44.766 --> 00:07:50.200
So let me write it
[INAUDIBLE] It's

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:59.420
the number of
non-zero components.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:06.710
It's the thing that
you'd like to know

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:10.100
about in question of sparsity.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.890
Is there just one
non-zero component?

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:13.820
Are there 11?

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.880
Are there 101?

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:22.940
That you might want to minimize
that because sparse vectors

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.060
and sparse matrices are
much faster to compute with.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.500
You've got good stuff.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.200
But now I claim that's
not a norm, the number

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:38.640
of non-zero components,
because how does the norm of 2v

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.620
compare with the norm
of v, the zero norm?

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:43.850
It would be the same.

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:47.450
2v has the same number
of non-zeros as v.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:51.020
So it violates the
rule for a norm.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:09:00.290
So I think with these norms
and all the p's in between--

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:04.240
so actually, the math
papers are full of,

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.180
let p be between 1 and
infinity, because that's

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:12.800
the range where you do have a
proper norm, as we will see.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.760
I think the good thing
to do with these norms is

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.830
to have a picture in your mind.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.900
The geometry of a norm is good.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.690
So the picture I'm
going to suggest

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:29.050
is, plot all the
vectors, let's say in 2D.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:33.940
So two-dimensional space, R2.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:40.750
So I want to plot the
vectors that have v equal 1

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.060
in these different norms.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.680
So let me ask you--

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:50.350
so here's 2D space,
R2, and now I

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:56.590
want to plot all the vectors
that their ordinary l2 lengths

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:58.660
equal 1.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.900
So what does that
picture look like?

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.010
I just think a picture is
really worth something.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:04.770
It's a circle, thanks.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.340
It's a circle.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:07.290
It's a circle.

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:10.380
This circle has the
equation, of course,

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.560
v1 squared plus v2
squared equal 1.

00:10:18.006 --> 00:10:22.970
So I would call that the
unit ball for the norm

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:26.660
or whatever is a circle.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:30.230
OK, now here comes
more interesting.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.950
What about in the l1, though?

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:41.060
So again, tell me how to
plot all the points that

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:46.130
have v1 plus v2 equal 1.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:49.890
What's the boundary
going to look like now?

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:51.840
It's going to be, let's see.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.660
Well I can put down a
certain number of points.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:58.980
There up at 1 and there at 1
and there at minus 1 and there

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.300
at minus 1.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:04.920
That would reflect the
vector 1, 0 and this

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:09.510
would reflect the
vector 0, minus 1.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:10.860
So yeah.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:11.820
OK.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.240
So those are like four
points easy to plot.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.570
Easy to see the l1 norm.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:26.250
But what's the rest
of the boundary here?

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.720
It's a diamond, good.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.000
It's a diamond.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.580
We have linear set equal to 1.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.220
Up here in the
positive quadrant,

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.460
it's just v1 plus v2 equal
to 1, and the graph of that

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:42.520
is a straight line.

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:48.000
So all these guys--
this is all the points

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.520
with v1 plus v2 equal 1.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.300
And over here and over
here and over here.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:12:01.650
So the unit ball in the
l1 norm is a diamond.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:04.950
And that's a very
important picture.

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:09.060
It reflects in a very
simple way something

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.460
important about the
l1 norm and the reason

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:16.090
it's just exploded
in importance.

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:17.520
Let me continue, though.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.400
What about the max norm?

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.910
v max or v infinity equal to 1.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.700
So again, let me
plot these guys,

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:31.810
and these guys are certainly
going to be in it again

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:37.260
because 0 [INAUDIBLE] plus or
minus i and plus or minus j

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.420
are good friends.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.650
What's the rest of the
boundary look like now?

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:52.260
Now this means max of
the v's equal to 1.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.440
So what are the
rest of the points?

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.440
You see, it does take a little
thought, but then you get it

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.520
and you don't forget it.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.390
OK, so what's up?

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.550
I'm looking.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.880
So suppose the maximum is v1.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:26.100
I think it's going to look like
that, out to 1, 0 and up to 0,

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.690
1.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:36.380
And up here, the vector
would be 1.4 or something,

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.560
so the maximum would be 1.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.520
Is that OK?

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:45.920
So somehow, what really sees,
as you change this number p,

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:50.360
you start with p equal
to 1, or a diamond,

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:55.640
and it kind of swells out to
be a circle at p equal to 2,

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.780
and then it kind
of keeps swelling

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:03.200
to be a square and
p equal to infinity.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.490
That's an interesting thing.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:06.250
And yeah.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:12.960
Now what's the problem
with the zero norm?

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:17.075
This is the number of non-zeros.

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:23.440
OK, let me draw it.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.410
Where are the points
with one non-zero?

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:33.760
So I'm plotting the unit ball.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:39.850
Where are the vectors in this
thing that have one non-zero?

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.220
Not zero non-zero.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.960
So that's not included.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.260
So what do I have?

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.920
I'm not allowed
the vector 1/3, 2/3

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.860
because that has two
non-zeros, so where

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:01.020
are the points with
only one non-zero?

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.520
Yeah, on the axes, yeah.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.660
That tells you.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:08.250
So it can be there and there.

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:11.190
Oops, without that guy.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.950
And of course those
just keep going out.

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:17.025
So it totally violates the--

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:26.140
so maybe the point that I should
make about these figures--

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:27.690
so like, what's happening?

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:30.280
When I go down to zero--

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.930
and really, that figure should
be at the other end, right?

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:35.850
Oh no, shoot.

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:37.200
This guy's in the middle.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.860
This is a badly drawn figure.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.270
l2 is kind of the center guy.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:48.210
l1 is at one end, l infinity
is at the other end,

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:53.700
and this one has gone off
the end at the left there.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.810
The diamond has-- yeah,
what's happened here,

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:02.340
as that one goes down towards
zero, none of these will be OK.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:09.780
These balls or these
sets will lose weight.

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:15.080
So they'll always
have these points in,

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:19.910
but they'll be like this and
then like this and then finally

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:24.080
in the unacceptable
limit, but none of those--

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.720
this was not any good either.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.790
This was for people
equal 1/2, let's say.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:36.120
That's a p equal to 1/2
and that's not a good norm.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:36.660
Yeah.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:44.190
So maybe the property of
the circle, the diamond,

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:51.420
and the square, which is a nice
math property of those three

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:57.140
sets and is not
possessed by this.

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:01.530
As this thing loses weight,
I lose the property.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.650
And then of course it's
totally lost over there.

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:06.530
Do you know what that
property would be?

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:08.130
It's what?

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:09.390
Concave, convex.

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:10.900
Convex, I would say.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:11.400
Convex.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:21.970
This is a true norm
as the convex unit.

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:28.970
Well maybe for ball, I'm taking
all the v's less or equal to 1.

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:33.070
Yeah, so I'm allowing the
insides of these shapes.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:35.280
So this is not a convex set.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.910
That set, which I should maybe--

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:48.330
so not convex would
be this one like so.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:54.680
And that reflects the fact
that the rules for a norm

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.030
are broken in the triangle.

00:17:56.030 --> 00:18:00.230
Inequality is probably
broken in the--

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:02.510
other stuff, yeah.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:06.210
I think that's sort
of worth remembering.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:20.480
And then one more norm that's
natural to think about is--

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:24.180
so S, as in the
Piazza question, S

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:30.030
does always represent a
symmetric matrix in 18.065.

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:33.600
And now my norm is going to be--

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.840
so I'm going to
call it the S norm.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.610
So actually, it's a positive
definite symmetric matrix.

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:44.400
S is a positive definite
symmetric matrix.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.600
And what do I do?

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.340
I'll take v transpose Sv.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.730
OK, what's our word for that?

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:57.780
The energy.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.540
That's the energy in
the vector v. And I'll

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:10.270
take the square root so that
I now have the length of two

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:13.530
if I double v, from v to 2v.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.420
Then I got a 2
here and a 2 here,

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.880
and when I take the square
root, I get a overall 2

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.250
and that's what I want.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:24.960
I want the norm to grow
linearly with the two or three

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.610
or whatever I multiply by.

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:30.720
But what is the
shape of this thing?

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:36.540
So what is the shape of--

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.460
let me put it on this board.

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.510
I'm going to get a
picture like that.

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:51.960
So what is the shape of v
transpose Sv equal 1 or less

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.750
or equal 1?

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:59.630
This is a symmetric
positive definite.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:03.800
People use those three
letters to tell us.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.780
I'm claiming that we
get a bunch of norms.

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:10.280
When do we get the l2 norm?

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:15.290
What matrix S would this
give us the l2 norm?

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:17.240
The identity, certainly.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:21.260
Now what's going to happen if
I use some different matrix S?

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:26.060
This circle is going
to change shape.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.770
I might have a different
norm, depending on S.

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:33.970
And a typical case would
be S equal 2, 3, say.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.500
That's a positive
definite symmetric matrix.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:48.160
And now I would be drawing the
graph of 2v1 squared plus 3v2

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:48.660
squared.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:50.580
That would be the energy, right?

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:51.890
Equal 1.

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:56.190
And I just want you to
tell me what shape that is.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:59.550
So that's a perfectly
good norm that you

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:01.830
could check all its properties.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:03.930
They all come out easily.

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:06.480
But I get a new picture--

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.570
a new norm that's
kind of adjustable.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.400
You could say it's
a weighted norm.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.190
Weights mean that
you kind of have

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:16.440
picked some numbers
sort of appropriate

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.670
to the particular problem.

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:21.060
Well, suppose those
numbers are 2 and 3.

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:26.440
What shape is the unit
ball in this S norm?

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.270
It's an ellipse, right.

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:29.650
It's an ellipse.

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:32.050
And I guess it
will actually be--

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:34.900
so the larger
number, 3, will mean

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:39.180
you can't go as far as
the smaller number, 2.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:43.420
I think it would probably
be an ellipse like this,

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.690
and the axes length
of the ellipse

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:50.530
would probably have something
to do with the 2 and the 3.

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:56.940
OK, so now you know really
all the vector norms that

00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:01.380
are sort of naturally used.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.950
These come up in a natural way.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:10.040
As we said, the identity matrix
brings us back to the two norm.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:14.850
So these are all sort of
variations on the two norm.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:20.950
And these are variations
as p runs from 1 up to 2

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:26.660
on to infinity and is not
allowed to go below 1.

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:27.970
OK, that's norms.

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:34.740
And then maybe you can actually
see from this picture--

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:41.150
here is a, like,
somewhat hokey idea

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:49.310
of why it is that minimizing
the area in this norm--

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:52.600
so what do I mean by that?

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.700
Here would be a typical problem.

00:22:55.700 --> 00:23:05.460
Minimize, subject to
Ax equal b, the l2--

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:09.490
sorry, I'm using x now--

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:11.980
the l1 norm of x.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.560
So that would be an
important problem.

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.090
Actually, it has a name.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:24.120
People have spent a lot of
time thinking of a fast way

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.200
to solve it.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.900
It's almost like least squares.

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:31.500
What would make it more
like least squares would be,

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:32.947
change that to 2.

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:37.860
Yeah.

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:43.410
Can I just sort of sketch,
without making a big argument

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:49.480
here, the difference
between l equal 1 or 2 here.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.070
Yeah, I'll just draw a picture.

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:56.580
Now I'll erase this ellipse,
but you won't forget.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:59.055
OK.

00:23:59.055 --> 00:24:02.030
So this is our problem.

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:05.930
With l1, it has a famous
name, basis pursuit.

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:09.920
Well famous to people
who work in optimization.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.740
For l2, it has an
important name.

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:16.340
Well it's sort of
like least squares.

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:20.180
Ridge regression.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.000
This is like a
beautiful model problem.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.340
Among all solutions
to Ax, suppose

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:31.220
this is just one
equation, like c1x1 plus

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:35.970
c2x2 equals some right side, b.

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:43.500
So the constraint says that the
vectors x have to be on a line.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.560
Suppose that's a
graph of that line.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:51.510
So among all these
x's, which one--

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:56.880
oh, I'm realizing what I'm going
to say is going to be smart.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.500
I mean, it's going to be nice.

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:05.850
Not going to be difficult. Let's
do the one we know best, l2.

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:07.560
So here's a picture of the line.

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:11.380
Let me make it a little
more tilted so you--

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:19.470
yeah, like 2, 3.

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:21.030
OK.

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:22.500
This is the xy plane.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.320
Here's x1, here's x2.

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:29.040
Here are the points that
satisfy my condition.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:33.780
Which point on that
line minimizes--

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:37.570
has the smallest l2 norm?

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:43.920
Which point on the line
has the smallest l2 norm?

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:48.990
Yeah, you're drawing the
right figure with your hands.

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:50.640
The smallest l2 norm--

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:55.160
l2, remember, is just
how far out you go.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:59.450
It's circular here, so it
doesn't matter what direction.

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:02.740
They're all giving the same
l2 norm, it's just how far.

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:07.053
So we're looking for the
closest point on the line

00:26:07.053 --> 00:26:08.720
because we don't want
to go any further.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.880
We want to go a
minimum distance with--

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.460
I'm doing l2 now.

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:18.890
So where is the point
at minimum distance?

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:23.800
Yeah, just show me again once
more, with hands or whatever.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.420
It'll be that.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.840
I didn't want 45
degree angles there.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.350
I'm going to erase
it again and really--

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:36.200
this time, I'm
going to get angles

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:42.890
that are not 45 [INAUDIBLE]
All right, brilliant.

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:44.180
Got it.

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:45.880
OK, that's my line.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.430
OK, and what's the nearest
point in the l2 norm?

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:51.040
Here's the winner in l2, right?

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.870
The nearest point.

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:55.280
Everybody sees that picture?

00:26:55.280 --> 00:27:04.380
So that's a basic picture
for minimizing something

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:07.680
with a constraint, which
is the fundamental problem

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:12.600
of optimization, of neural
nets, of everything, really.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.530
Of life.

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:16.980
Well I'm getting philosophical.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:23.980
But the question always is,
and maybe it's true in life,

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:26.690
too, which norm are you using?

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:34.640
OK, now that was
the minimum in l2.

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.590
That's the shortest
distance, where

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:40.430
distance means what we usually
think of it as meaning.

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:44.120
But now, let's go
for the l1 norm.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:49.830
Which point on the line
has the smallest l1 norm?

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:53.180
So now I'm going to add the 2.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:28:00.050
So if this is some
point a, 0 and this

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:04.520
is some point 0, b right there.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:07.030
So those two points are
obviously important.

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:08.740
And that point, we
could figure out

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:14.560
the formula for because we
know what the geometry is.

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.230
But I've just put
those two points in.

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:19.160
So did I get a 0, b?

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:22.790
Yeah, that's a zero.

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:24.310
So let me just ask
you the question.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:28.590
What point on that line
has the smallest l1 norm?

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:30.714
Which has the smallest l1 norm?

00:28:33.482 --> 00:28:34.190
Somebody said it.

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:37.430
Just say it a little louder so
that you're on tape forever.

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:40.970
AUDIENCE: 0, b.

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:43.120
GILBERT STRANG:
0, b, this point.

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.500
That's the winner.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:51.440
This is the l1 winner and
this was the l2 winner.

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:58.800
And notice what I said earlier,
and I didn't see it coming,

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.540
but now I realize this is a
figure to put in the notes.

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:07.920
The winner has the most zeros.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.860
It's the [? sparsest ?] vector.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:14.500
Well out of two components,
it didn't have much freedom,

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.830
but it has a zero component.

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:23.950
It's on the axes.

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:26.700
It's the things on the
axes that have the smallest

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.490
number of components.

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:36.780
So yeah, this is the
picture in two dimensions.

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.240
So I'm in 2D.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.850
And you can see that the winner
has a zero component, yeah.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:51.040
And that's a fact that extends
into higher dimensions too

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:55.240
and that makes the l1 norm
special, as I've said.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:55.740
Yeah.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:30:00.130
Is there more to say
about that example?

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:07.040
For a simple 2D question,
that really makes the point

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.200
that the l1 winner is there.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.070
It's not further.

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:12.040
You don't go further
up the line, right?

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:17.530
Because that's bad in all ways.

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:20.420
When you go up
further, you're adding

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:23.960
some non-zero first
component and you're

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:27.000
increasing the non-zero
second component,

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.840
so that's a bad idea.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.870
That's a bad idea.

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:32.480
This is the winner.

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:38.570
And in a way,
here's the picture.

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:40.490
Oh yeah.

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:43.340
I should prepare these
lectures, but this one's

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:45.050
coming out all right anyway.

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:49.940
So the picture there is
the nearest ball hits

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:52.470
at that point.

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:53.640
And what is it?

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:54.540
Can you see that?

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:57.840
So that star is
outside the circle.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:07.260
This is the l1 winner and
that's the blow up the l1 norm

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:08.730
until it hits.

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:13.980
That's the point where
the l1 norm hits.

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:16.260
Do you see it?

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:20.970
Just give it a little thought,
that another geometric way

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:23.640
to see the answer
to this problem is,

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.080
you start at the
origin and you blow up

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:30.450
the norm until you get
a point on the line that

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:32.280
satisfies your constraint.

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:36.870
And because you were blowing up
the norm, when it hits first,

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:39.350
that's the smallest
blow-up possible.

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:42.970
That's the guy that minimizes.

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:44.820
Yeah, so just think
about that picture

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:49.760
and I'll draw it
better somewhere, too.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.810
Well that's vector norms.

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:59.420
And then I introduce some
matrix norms, and let me just

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:00.740
say a word about those.

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:08.410
OK, a word about matrix norms.

00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:16.720
So the matrix norms were the--

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:25.050
so now I have a matrix A and I
want to define those same three

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:27.870
norms again for a matrix.

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:34.340
And this was the
2 norm, and what

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:36.660
was the 2 norm of a matrix?

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:45.710
Well it was sigma 1,
it turned out to be.

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:47.900
So that doesn't define it.

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:49.220
Or we could define it.

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:51.800
Just say, OK, the
largest singular value

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.320
is the 2 norm of the matrix.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.350
But actually, it
comes from somewhere.

00:32:56.350 --> 00:33:04.670
So I want to speak about
this one first, the 2 norm.

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:09.070
So it's the 2 norm of
a matrix, and one way

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:19.500
to see the 2 norm of a
matrix is to connect it

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:21.150
to the 2 norm of vectors.

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:26.220
I'd like to connect
the 2 norm of matrices

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:29.400
to the 2 norm of vectors.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.400
And how shall I do that?

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:39.020
I think I'm going to
look at the 2 norm of Ax

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:43.420
over the 2 norm of x.

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:49.370
So in a way, to me, that ratio
is like the blow-up factor.

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:51.880
If A was seven
times the identity,

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.690
to take an easy case--

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:55.880
if A is seven
times the identity,

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.140
what will that ratio be?

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.760
Say it, yeah.

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.340
Seven.

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:09.580
If A is 7i, this will be 7x
and this will be x, and norms,

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:14.662
the factor seven comes out,
so that ratio will be seven.

00:34:14.662 --> 00:34:16.600
OK.

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.989
For me, the norm is--

00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:21.174
that's the blow-up factor.

00:34:23.995 --> 00:34:29.130
So here's the idea
of a matrix norm.

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:31.159
Now I'm doing matrix.

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:34.998
Matrix norm from vector norm.

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:42.770
And the answer will be
the maximum blow-up.

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:48.770
The maximum of this ratio.

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:50.909
I call that ratio
the blow-up factor.

00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:53.210
That's just a made-up name.

00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:57.731
The maximum over all x.

00:34:57.731 --> 00:34:58.760
All of x.

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:02.590
I look to see which vector
gets blown up the most

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:09.670
and that is the
norm of the matrix.

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:12.460
I've settled on
norms of vectors.

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:15.520
That's done upstairs there.

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.580
Now I'm looking at
norms of matrices.

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:22.660
And this is one way to get
a good norm of a matrix that

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:24.760
kind of comes from the 2 norm.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:27.520
So there would be other
norms for matrices coming

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:31.300
from other vector norms,
and those, we haven't seen,

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:35.600
but the 2 norm is a
very important one.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:40.030
So what is the
maximum value of this?

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:43.433
Of that ratio for a matrix A?

00:35:43.433 --> 00:35:47.890
The claim is that it's sigma 1.

00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:49.880
I'll just put a
big equality there.

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:58.372
Now, can we see, why is sigma
1 the answer to this problem?

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.400
I can see a couple of
ways to think about that

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.220
but that's a very
important fact.

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:14.850
In fact, this is a way to
discover what sigma 1 is

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:16.650
without all the other sigmas.

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:19.860
If I look for the x that has
the biggest blow-up factor--

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.260
and by the way,
which x will it be?

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:27.630
Which x will win the max
competition here and be sigma

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:30.300
1 times as large as--

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:34.920
the ratio will be sigma 1.

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.090
That will be sigma 1.

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:39.540
When is this thing sigma
1 times as large as that?

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:42.220
For which x?

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:45.120
Not for an eigenvector.

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:50.070
If x was an eigenvector,
what would that ratio be?

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:50.570
Lambda.

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.680
But if A is not a
symmetric matrix,

00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:03.170
maybe the eigenvectors don't
tell you the exact way they go.

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:06.090
So what vector
would you now guess?

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:10.460
It's not an eigenvector,
it is a singular vector.

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:14.180
And which singular vector
is it probably going to be?

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:16.140
v1.

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:17.550
Yeah, v1 makes sense.

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:18.370
Winner.

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:21.240
So the winner of
this competition

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:29.468
is x equal v1, the first
right singular vector.

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.700
And we better be
able to check that.

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:42.410
So again, this maximization
problem, the answer

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:46.440
is in terms of the
singular vector.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.590
So that's a way to find
this first singular vector

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:52.130
without finding them all.

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:55.850
And let's just plug in
the first singular vector

00:37:55.850 --> 00:38:02.600
and see that the
ratio is sigma 1.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.890
So now let me plug it in.

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:06.290
So what do I have?

00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:12.910
I want Av1 over length of v1.

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:14.750
OK.

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:17.990
And I'm hoping to
get that answer.

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:20.450
Well what's the
denominator here?

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:23.835
The length of v1 is one.

00:38:23.835 --> 00:38:25.690
So no big deal there.

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:27.350
That's one.

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:29.605
What's the length
of the top one?

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:34.360
Now what is Av1?

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:40.060
If v1 is the first right
singular vector, than Av1

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:45.558
is sigma 1 times u1.

00:38:45.558 --> 00:38:52.560
Remember, the singular vector
deals were Av equals sigma u.

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:58.740
Avk equals sigma k uk.

00:38:58.740 --> 00:38:59.890
You remember that.

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:01.940
So they're not eigenvectors.

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:03.120
They're singular vectors.

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:13.110
So Av1 is the length of sigma
1 u1 and it's divided by 1.

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:19.086
And of course, u1 is also a unit
vector, so I just get sigma 1.

00:39:19.086 --> 00:39:19.586
OK.

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:25.290
So that's another
way to say that you

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:30.420
can find sigma 1 by solving
this maximum problem.

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:33.030
And you get that sigma 1.

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:35.200
OK.

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.960
And I could get
other matrix norms

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:44.770
by maximizing that blow-up
factor in that vector norm.

00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:50.750
I won't do that now, just to
keep control of what we've got.

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:55.970
Now what was the next matrix
norm that came in last time?

00:39:55.970 --> 00:40:01.070
Very, very important one for
deep learning and neural nets.

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:04.680
Somehow it's a little
simpler than this guy.

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:07.860
And what was that matrix norm?

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:12.490
What letter whose
name goes here?

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:13.960
Frobenius.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:17.200
So capital F for Frobenius.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.060
And what was that?

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:23.410
That was the square root
of the sum of all the--

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:33.670
add all the aij squares,
for all over the matrix,

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:36.600
and then take the square root.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:40.160
And then somebody asked a
good question after class

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:44.690
on Wednesday, what has that
got to do with the sigmas?

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:52.040
Because my point was that
these norms are the guys that

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:56.930
go with the sigmas, that have
nice formulas for the sigmas,

00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:58.220
and here it is.

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:01.665
It's the square root of the
sum of the squares of all

00:41:01.665 --> 00:41:02.165
the sigmas.

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:09.890
So let me write Frobenius again.

00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:20.450
But this notation with an
F is now pretty standard,

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:25.280
and we should be able to
see why that number is

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.701
the same as that number.

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:35.440
Yeah.

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:41.408
I could give you a
reason or I could put it

00:41:41.408 --> 00:41:42.200
on the problem set.

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:48.510
Yeah, I think that's
better on the problem

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:51.570
set, because first of
all, I get off the hook

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:56.910
right away, and secondly,
this connection between--

00:41:56.910 --> 00:42:00.820
in Frobenius, that's a beautiful
fact about Frobenius norm

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:03.415
that you add up all
the sigma squares--

00:42:03.415 --> 00:42:09.630
it's just m times n of them
because it's a filled matrix.

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:12.990
So another way to say it
is, we haven't written down

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:16.604
the SVD today, A equal
u sigma v transposed.

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:26.530
And the point is that,
for the Frobenius norm--

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:29.300
actually, for all these norms--

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:30.790
I can change u.

00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:35.240
It doesn't change the norm,
so I can make u the identity.

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:38.070
u, as we all know, is
an orthogonal matrix,

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:41.220
and what I'm saying
is, orthogonal matrix u

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:43.980
doesn't change any of
these particular norms.

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:46.530
So suppose it was the identity.

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:47.580
Same here.

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:50.580
That could be the identity
without changing the norm.

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:55.110
So we're down to the
norm of Frobenius.

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:58.480
So what's the Frobenius
norm of that guy?

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:06.440
What's the Frobenius norm
of that diagonal matrix?

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.660
Well you're supposed
to add up the squares

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:13.410
of all the numbers in the
matrix and what do you get?

00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:15.970
You get that, right?

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:18.690
So that's why this
is the same as this

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:22.360
because the orthogonal guy there
and the orthogonal guy there

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.220
make no difference in the norm.

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:27.630
But that takes checking, right?

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:28.880
Yeah.

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.820
But that's another
way to see why

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:32.810
the Frobenius norm gives this.

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:35.330
And then finally, this
was the nuclear norm.

00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:41.350
And actually, just
before my lunch

00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:43.440
lecture on the subject
of probability--

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:47.350
I've had a learning morning.

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:52.030
The lunch lecture was about this
crazy way that humans behave.

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:58.000
Not us but other humans.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.310
Other actual-- well, no,
I don't want to say that.

00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:06.090
Take that out of the tape.

00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:06.970
Yeah, OK.

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:09.370
Anyway, that was that
lecture, but before that

00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:16.240
was a lecture for an hour plus
about deep learning by somebody

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:19.600
who really, really has
begun to understand

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.820
what is happening inside.

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:25.510
How does that gradient
descent optimization

00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:31.660
algorithm pick out, what
does it pick out as the thing

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:33.550
it learns.

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:38.200
This is going to be our
goal in this course.

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.550
We're not there yet.

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:43.870
But his conjecture is that--

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:45.290
yeah, so it's a conjecture.

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:46.390
He doesn't have a proof.

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:49.720
He's got proofs
of some nice cases

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:52.720
where things commute but he
hasn't got the whole thing yet,

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:55.840
but it's pretty terrific work.

00:44:55.840 --> 00:45:03.430
So this was Professor
Srebro who's in Chicago.

00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:05.610
So he just announced
his conjecture,

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:11.700
and his conjecture is that, in a
modeled case, the deep learning

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:14.910
that we'll learn about
with the gradient descent

00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:19.210
that we'll learn about to
find the best weights--

00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:24.880
the point is that, in
a typical deep learning

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:30.050
problem these days, there are
many more weights than samples

00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:34.170
and so there are a lot
of possible minima.

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:37.230
Many different weights
give the same minimum loss

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:40.050
because there are
so many weights.

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:44.010
The problem is, like,
got too many variables,

00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:46.440
but it turns out to be
a very, very good thing.

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:48.310
That's part of the success.

00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:54.780
And he believes that
in a model situation,

00:45:54.780 --> 00:46:00.090
that optimization
by gradient descent

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:06.970
picks out the weights that
minimize the nuclear norm.

00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:10.650
So this would be a norm
of a lot of weights.

00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:15.120
And he thinks that's
where the system goes.

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:16.155
We'll see this.

00:46:16.155 --> 00:46:18.510
This comes up in
compressed sensing,

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:21.420
as I mentioned last time.

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:26.840
But now I have to remember
what was the definition.

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:30.580
Do you remember what
the nuclear norm?

00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:35.060
He often used a little
star instead of an N.

00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:37.020
I'll put that in the notes.

00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:39.790
Other people call
it the trace norm.

00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:47.730
But I think this N kind of gives
it a notation you can remember.

00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:49.733
So let's call it
the nuclear norm.

00:46:49.733 --> 00:46:51.150
Do you remember
what that one was?

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.570
Yeah, somebody's
saying it right.

00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:58.070
Add the sigmas, yeah.

00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:05.620
Just the sum of the sigmas,
like the l1 norm, in a way.

00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:07.950
So that's the idea,
is that this is

00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:14.210
the natural sort of l1
type of norm for matrices.

00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:17.353
It's the l1 norm for
that sigma vector.

00:47:17.353 --> 00:47:19.270
This would be the l2
norm of the sigma vector.

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:21.870
That would be the
l infinity norm.

00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:28.010
Notice that the vector numbers,
infinity, 2, and 1, get

00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:35.300
changed around when you
look at the matrix guy.

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:42.460
So that's an exciting idea
and it remains to be proved.

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:45.170
And expert people are
experimenting to see,

00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:47.080
is it true?

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:47.910
Yeah.

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:50.820
So that's a big thing
for their future.

00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:51.780
Yes.

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:55.560
OK, so today, we've
talked about norms

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:59.730
and this section of the notes
will be all about norms.

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:09.930
We've taken a big leap into
a comment about deep learning

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:14.880
and this is what I
want to say the most.

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:18.120
And I say it to
every class I teach

00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:22.050
near the start of the semester.

00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:26.410
My feeling about what my
job is to teach you things,

00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:30.880
or to join with you in learning
things, as happened today.

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.260
It's not to grade you.

00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:37.810
I don't spend any time
losing sleep-- you know,

00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:42.550
should that person take a
one point or epsilon penalty

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:47.461
for turning it in
four minutes late?

00:48:47.461 --> 00:48:49.390
To Hell with that, right?

00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:52.780
We've got a lot to do here.

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:55.150
So anyway, we'll
get on with the job.

00:48:55.150 --> 00:49:00.760
So homework three
coming up, and you'll

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:02.950
be using the notes
that you already

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:07.410
have posted in Stellar for
those sections eight and nine

00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:09.130
and so on.

00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:11.270
And we'll keep going on Monday.

00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:14.580
OK, see you on Monday
and have a great weekend.
