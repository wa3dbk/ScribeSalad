GILBERT STRANG: So
let me use the mic

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.000
to introduce Alex Townsend,
who taught here at MIT--

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.570
taught Linear Algebra
18.06 very successfully.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.980
And then now he's at
Cornell on the faculty,

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.870
still teaching
very successfully.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.690
And he was invited
here yesterday

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.260
for a big event
over in Engineering.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:54.820
And he agreed to give a talk
about a section of the book--

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.520
section 4.3--

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.790
which, if you look at it, you'll
see is all about his work.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.500
And now you get to hear
from the creator himself.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.000
OK.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.200
ALEX TOWNSEND: OK.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.830
Thanks.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:12.710
Thank you, Gil.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.442
Thank you for inviting me here.

00:01:14.442 --> 00:01:15.990
I hope you're
enjoying the course.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.990
Today I want to tell
you a little about why

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.440
there so many matrices that
are low rank in the world.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.480
So as computational
mathematicians--

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.700
Gil and myself-- we come across
low-rank matrices all the time.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.650
And we started wondering,
as a community, why?

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.290
What is it about the problems
that we are looking at?

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.320
What makes low-rank
matrices appear?

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.690
And today I want to
give you that story--

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.510
or at least an
overview of that story.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:57.600
So for this class, x is going
to be n by n real matrix.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.680
So nice and square.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.410
And you already know, or
are very comfortable with,

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.500
the singular values of a matrix.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.220
So the singular values
of a matrix, as you know,

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.360
are a sequence of numbers
that are monotonically

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.030
non-increasing that tell
us all kinds of things

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.290
about the matrix x.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.090
For example, the number
of nonzero singular values

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.840
tell us the rank
of the matrix x.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.830
And they also, you probably
know, tell us how well a matrix

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.600
x can be approximated
by a low-rank matrix.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.900
So let me just write two
facts down that you already

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.740
are familiar with.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.940
So here's a fact--

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.210
that, if I look at the number of
non-zero singular values in x--

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.105
so I'm imagining there's going
to be k non-zero singular

00:03:01.105 --> 00:03:01.605
values--

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.480
then we can say a
few things about x.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.350
For example, the rank
of x, as we know, is k--

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.980
the number of non-zero
singular values.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.770
But we also know from the
SVD that we can decompose x

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.670
into a sum of rank 1 matrices--

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.120
in fact, the sum of k of them.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.770
So because x is rank
k, we can write down

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:45.150
a low-rank representation for
x, and it involves k terms,

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.830
like this.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.350
Each one of these vectors
here is a column vector.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.390
So if I draw this
pictorially, this guy

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.800
looks like this, right?

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.240
And we have k of them.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.390
So because x is rank k, we
can write x as a sum of k

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.580
rank 1 matrices.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.880
And we also have an initial
fact that we already know--

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.740
that the dimension of
the column space of x

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.730
is equal to k, and the
same with the row space.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:27.620
So the column space of x
equals the row space of x--

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:35.190
the dimension-- and
they all equal k.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.650
And so there are three
facts we can determine

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:44.100
from looking at this sequence of
singular values of a matrix x.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.460
Of course, the singular
value sequence is unique.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.880
X defines its own
singular values.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.520
What we're interested in
here is, what makes x?

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.780
What are the properties
of x that make

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.970
sure that the singular
values have a lot

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.250
of zeros in that sequence?

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.750
Can we try to understand what
kind of x makes that happen?

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.530
And we really like matrices
that have a lot of zeros

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.630
here, for the following reason--

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:30.330
we say x is low rank if
the following holds, right?

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.120
Because if we wanted to
send x to our friend--

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.810
we're imagining x as
picture where each entry

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.170
is a pixel of that image.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.710
If that matrix-- that
image-- was low rank,

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.870
we could send the picture
to our friend in two ways.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.310
We could send one every
single entry of x.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.140
And for us to do
that, we would have

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.410
to send n squared
pieces of information,

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.010
because we'd have
to send every entry.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.300
But if x is
sufficiently low rank,

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.250
we could also send our
friend the vectors--

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.240
u, u1, v1, uk, up to vk.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.570
And how much pieces
of data would we

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.240
have to send our
friend to get x to them

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.730
if we sent in the low-rank form?

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:27.390
Well, there's 2n
here, 2n here numbers.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.530
There's k of them.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.750
So we'd have to
send 2kn numbers.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.210
And we strictly
say a matrix is low

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.700
rank if it's more efficient
to send x to our friend

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.650
in low-rank form then
in full-rank form.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.800
So this, of course, by
a little calculation,

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.880
just shows us that,
provided the rank is

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.640
less than half the
size of the matrix,

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.450
we are calling the
matrix low rank.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:05.960
Now, often, in practice,
we demand more.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:15.260
We demand that k is much
smaller than this number,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.850
so that it's far more efficient
to send our friend the matrix x

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.750
in low-rank form than
in full-rank form.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.810
So the colloquial use
of the word low rank

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.540
is kind of this situation.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.480
But this is the strict
definition of it.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:39.600
So what do low-rank
matrices look like?

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.580
And to do that, I have
some pictures for you.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.990
I have some flags--

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.990
the world flags.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.430
So these are all matrices x--

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:54.690
these examples-- because their
flags happen to not be square.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.610
I hope you can all see this.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:01.380
But the top row here
are all matrices

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.360
that are extremely low rank.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.610
For example, the Austria flag--

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.350
if you want to send
that to your friend,

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.020
that matrix is of rank 1.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.740
So all you have to do is
send your friend two vectors.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.250
You have to tell your friend the
column space and the row space.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.190
And there's only the
dimensions of one of both.

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:24.790
For the English flag, you
need to send them two column

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.640
vectors and two row vectors--

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.900
u1, v1, u2 and v2.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.440
And as we go down this row, they
get slowly fuller and fuller

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.289
rank.

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:38.440
So the Japanese
flag, for example,

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.059
is low rank but not that small.

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:45.880
The Scottish flag is
essentially full rank.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.350
So it's very inefficient to send
your friend the Scottish flag

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:51.340
in low-rank form.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:55.190
You're better off sending
almost every single entry.

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:58.430
So what do low-rank
matrices look like?

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.250
Well, if the matrix
is extremely low rank,

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:18.340
like rank 1, then when
you look at that matrix--

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.900
like here, like the flag--

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:25.420
it's highly aligned
with the coordinates--

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.440
with the rows and columns.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:33.590
So if it's rank 1, the
matrix is highly aligned--

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.780
like the Austria flag.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.690
And of course, as we add
in more and more rank here,

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:46.300
the situation gets a bit blurry.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.450
For example, once we get into
the medium rank situation,

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:51.550
which is a circle,
it's very hard

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:56.800
to see that the circle is
actually, in fact, low rank.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.960
But what I'm going to
do was try to understand

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.750
why the Scottish flag
or diagonal patterns--

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:07.990
particularly a bad
example for low rank.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:12.040
So I'm going to take
the triangular flag

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.980
to examine that more carefully.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.600
So the triangular
flag looks like--

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:27.110
I'll take a square matrix and
I'll color in the bottom half.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:31.055
So this matrix is the matrix
of ones below the diagonal.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:41.560
And I'm interested in this
matrix and, in particular,

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.360
its singular values,
to try to understand

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.740
why diagonal patterns
are not particularly

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:51.760
useful for low-rank compression.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:57.340
And this matrix of all ones has
a really nice property that,

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:01.750
if I take its inverse,
it looks a lot like--

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.850
getting close to
Gil's favorite matrix.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:08.550
So if I take the
inverse of this matrix--

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:12.100
it has an inverse because it's
got ones on the diagonal--

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:21.220
then its inverse is
the following matrix,

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.220
which people familiar with
finite difference schemes

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.400
will notice the
familiarity between that

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:32.770
and the first order finite
difference approximation.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:35.500
In particular, if I go
a bit further and times

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:39.130
two of these
together, and do this,

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:45.370
then this is essentially
Gil's favorite matrix,

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:49.355
except one entry happens
to be different--

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.570
ends up being this
matrix, which is

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:59.800
very close to the second order,
central, finite difference

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.210
matrix.

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:02.950
And people have
very well studied

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:06.430
that matrix and know
its eigenvalues,

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:07.930
its singular values--

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.300
they know everything
about that matrix.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.310
And you'll remember
that if we know

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:18.010
the eigenvalues of a
matrix, like x transpose x,

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:21.610
we know the singular
values of x.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:25.810
So this allows us
to show, by the fact

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:32.590
that we know that, that the
singular values of this matrix

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.990
are not very
amenable to low rank.

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:39.400
They're all non-zero, and
they don't even decay.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.920
So I'm getting this from--

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.430
I rang up Gil, and Gil
tells me these numbers.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:57.300
That allows us to work out
exactly what the singular

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.760
values of this matrix
are, from the connection

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.130
to finite differences.

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.260
And so we can understand
why this is not

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.700
good by looking at
the singular values.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:10.410
So the first singular value
of x from this expression

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:15.960
is going to be
approximately 2n over pi.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.110
And from this expression,
again, for the last guy--

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:23.260
the last singular
value of x is going

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.430
to be approximately a half.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.890
So these singular
values are all large.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:31.110
They're not getting
close to zero.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:37.070
If I plotted these singular
values on a graph--

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:40.680
so here's the first
singular value, the second,

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.040
and the n-th--

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.210
then what would the
graph look like?

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.885
Well, plot these numbers.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.190
Divide by this guy
so that they all

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:59.800
are bounded between 1 and 0
because of the normalization,

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.190
because I divided
by sigma 1 of x.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.230
And so we can plot
them, and they will

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:11.520
look like this kind of thing.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.830
This number happens
to be here where

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:21.780
they come to be
pi over 4n, which

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:27.540
is me dividing this number by
this number, approximately.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:32.071
So triangular patterns are
extremely bad for low rank.

00:14:32.071 --> 00:14:35.040
We need things-- or we at
least intuitively think

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.120
that we need things-- aligned
with the rows and columns,

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:45.570
but the circle case happens
to also be low rank.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:49.410
And so what happened
to the Japanese flag?

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:59.970
Why is the Japanese flag
convenient for low rank?

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:03.420
Well it's the fact
that it's a circle,

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.340
and there's lots of
symmetry in a circle.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:13.740
So if I try to look at the rank
of a circle, the Japanese flag,

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:21.870
then I can bound this rank by
decomposing the Japanese flag

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.130
into two things.

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:29.460
So this is going to be less
than or equal to the rank of sum

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:33.480
of two matrices, and I'll do it
so that the decomposition works

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.050
out.

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:35.430
I have the circle.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:40.252
I'm going to cut out a
rank one piece that lives

00:15:40.252 --> 00:15:41.460
in the middle of this circle.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:47.940
OK?

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.360
And I'm going to cut out
a square from the interior

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.650
of that circle.

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:55.490
OK?

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:58.110
And I can figure out-- of
course the rank is just bounded

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:00.630
by the sum of those two ranks.

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:04.320
This guy is bounded by rank
one because it's highly

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.370
aligned with the grid.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.800
So this guy is
bounded by rank one.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:23.360
So this thing here plus 1.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:29.280
And now I have to
try to understand

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.820
the rank of this piece.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.910
Now this piece has
lots of symmetry.

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:39.690
For example, we know that
the rank of that matrix

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:43.320
is the dimension
of the column space

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.360
and the dimension
of the row space.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.650
So when we look at this
matrix, because of symmetry,

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:55.230
if I divide this matrix
in half along the columns,

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:58.320
all the columns on the
left appear on the right.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.920
So for example, the
rank of this matrix

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.589
is the same as the
rank of that matrix

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:07.880
because I didn't change
the column space.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.430
OK?

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:13.650
Now I go again and
divide along the rows,

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:17.819
and now the row
dimension of this matrix

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:20.880
is the same as the top half,
because as I wipe out those,

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.130
I didn't change the
dimension of the row space

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:26.079
because the rows are
the same top-bottom.

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:30.650
And so this becomes the rank of
that tiny little matrix there.

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:35.840
And because it's small, it
won't have too large a rank.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:42.978
So this is definitely less
than-- if I divide that up,

00:17:42.978 --> 00:17:50.330
a little guy here looks like
that plus the other guy that

00:17:50.330 --> 00:18:00.450
looks like that plus 1.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:07.900
And so of course the row space
of this matrix cannot be very

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.030
high because this is
a very thin matrix.

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:13.800
There's lots of zeros in
that matrix, only a few ones.

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.520
And so you can go
along and do a bit

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:19.570
of trig to try to figure
out how many rows are

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:22.420
non-zero in this matrix.

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:25.660
And a bit of trig tells you--

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:29.630
well it depends on the radius
of this original circle.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:34.120
So if I make the original
radius r of this Japanese flag,

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:38.110
then the bound that you
end up getting will be,

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:43.710
for this matrix, r 1
minus square root 2 over 2

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:44.570
for this guy.

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:46.020
That's a bit of trig.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.220
I've got to make sure
that's an integer.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:52.160
And then again, here it's the
same but for the column space.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.430
So this is me just doing trig.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:56.640
OK?

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.870
And that's bound on the rank.

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:59.650
It happens to be extremely good.

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:03.540
And if you work out what that
rank is and try to look back,

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.170
you will find it's
extremely efficient

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:10.513
to send the Japanese flag to
your friend in low rank form,

00:19:10.513 --> 00:19:12.680
because it's not full rank
because these numbers are

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.760
so small.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:21.080
So this comes out to be, like,
approximately 1/2 r plus 1.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.750
So much smaller than
what you would expect,

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:27.350
because remember, a circle is
almost the anti-version version

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:32.860
of a line with the grid, but
yet, it's still low rank.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.050
OK.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:39.350
Now most matrices
that we come up

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:44.600
with in computational math are
not exactly of finite rank.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:48.860
They are of numerical rank.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:51.390
And so I'll just define that.

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:58.060
So the numerical
rank of a matrix

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:01.190
is very similar to the rank,
except we allow ourselves

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:04.310
a little bit of wiggle
room when we define it,

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:09.110
and so that amount of wiggle
room will be of parameter

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:12.140
called tol called epsilon.

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:13.010
That's a tolerance.

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:16.436
I'm thinking of
epsilon as a tolerance.

00:20:16.436 --> 00:20:21.110
That's the amount of wiggle
room I'm going to give myself.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:22.140
OK.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:27.240
And we say that the
numerical rank--

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:31.350
I'll put an epsilon there
to denote numerical rank--

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:34.170
is k.

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:37.650
k is the first singular value,
or the last singular value,

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:39.120
above epsilon.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.370
In the following sense, I'm
copying the definition above

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:45.090
but with epsilons
instead of zeros.

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:52.960
If this singular value is
less than epsilon, relatively,

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.220
and the kth one was not below.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:21:00.880
So k plus 1 is the first
singular value below epsilon

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.130
in this relative sense.

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:10.480
So of course the rank of
0x, if that was defined,

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.480
is the same as the rank of x.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.290
OK?

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:17.540
So this is just allowing
ourselves some wiggle room.

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:20.870
But this is actually what we're
interested more in practice.

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:21.370
All right?

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:23.560
I don't want to
necessarily send my friend

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:26.145
the flag to exact precision.

00:21:26.145 --> 00:21:27.520
I would actually
be happy to send

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.550
my friend the flag up to
16 digits of precision,

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:32.273
for example.

00:21:32.273 --> 00:21:34.690
They're not going to tell the
difference between those two

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:35.830
flags.

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:39.550
And if I can get away with
compressing the matrix

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.220
a lot more once I have a
little bit of wiggle room,

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.270
that would be a good thing.

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:58.250
So we know from the
Eckart and Young

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:02.540
that the singular values tell
us how well we can approximate

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:05.900
x by a low-rank matrix.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:13.460
In particular, we know that the
k plus 1 singular value of x

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:18.350
tells us how well x can be
approximated by a rank k

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:19.390
matrix.

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:20.570
OK?

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:26.180
For example, when the rank was
exactly k, the sigma k plus 1

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:29.570
was 0, and then this
came out to be 0

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:33.260
and we found that x was
exactly a rank k matrix.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:36.170
Here, because we have the
wiggle room, the epsilon,

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:39.180
we get an approximation,
not an exact.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:44.330
So this is telling us how
well we can approximate

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:47.330
x by a rank k matrix.

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:51.290
OK?

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:54.170
That's what the singular
values are telling us.

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:59.480
And so this allows us to try
our best to compress matrices

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:03.470
but use low-rank
approximation rather

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:05.315
than doing things exactly.

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:11.100
And of course, on a computer,
when we're using floating point

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:16.350
arithmetic, or on a computer
because we always round numbers

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:21.450
to the nearest 16-digit number,
if epsilon was 16 digits,

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:23.310
your computer wouldn't
be able to tell

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:29.640
the difference between
x or x the rank k

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:35.040
approximation if this number
satisfied this expression.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:38.190
Your computer would think of
x and xk as the same matrix

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:42.240
because it would
inevitably round both

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.410
to epsilon, within epsilon.

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:46.150
OK.

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:49.400
So what kind of matrices
are numerically of low rank?

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:08.620
Of course all low-rank matrices
are numerically of low rank

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:16.410
because the wiggle
room can only help you

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:19.230
but it's far more than that.

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:21.060
There are many
full-rank matrices--

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:24.570
matrices that don't have any
singular values that are zero--

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:27.700
but the singular values
decay rapidly to zero.

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:32.370
That are full-rank matrices
with low numerical rank because

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:33.780
of the wiggle room.

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:38.880
So for example, here
is the classic matrix

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:43.140
that fits this regime.

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:45.570
If I give you this, this is
called the Hilbert matrix.

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:53.200
This is a matrix
that happens to have

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:57.860
extremely low numerical
rank but it's actually

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:05.560
full rank, which means that I
can approximate H by a rank k

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.620
matrix where k is
quite small very well,

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:10.880
provided you give
me some wiggle room,

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.750
but it's not a low-rank
matrix in the sense

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:16.300
that if epsilon was zero
here, you didn't allow me

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.220
the wriggle room, all
the singular values

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.500
of this matrix are positive.

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:28.920
So it's of low numerical rank
but it's not a low-rank matrix.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:32.550
The other classical
example which

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:35.370
motivated a lot of the
research in this area

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:37.780
was the Vandermonde matrix.

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:39.285
So here is the
Vandermonde matrix.

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:50.580
An n by n version of it.

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.110
Think of the xi's as real.

00:25:55.838 --> 00:25:57.578
And this is Vandermonde.

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.680
This is the matrix
that comes up when

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:08.450
you try to do polynomial
interpolation at real points.

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:13.820
This is an extremely bad matrix
to deal with because it's

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:17.090
numerically low rank,
and often, you actually

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:21.050
want to solve a linear
system with this matrix.

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:24.530
And numerical low rank implies
that it's extremely hard

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:32.120
to invert, so numerical low
rank is not always good for you.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.020
OK?

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:42.620
Often, we want the
inverse, which exists,

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:56.030
but it's difficult because
V has low numerical rank.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:04.300
OK.

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.280
So people have been
trying to understand

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:09.400
why these matrices
are numerically

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:12.220
of low rank for a
number of years,

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:16.450
and the classic
reason why there are

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:21.040
so many low-rank matrices is
because the world is smooth,

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.240
as people say.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.630
They say, the world is smooth.

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:32.570
That's why matrices are
of numerical low rank.

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:38.710
And to illustrate that
point, I will do an example.

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:41.140
So this is
classically understood

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:50.150
by a man called Reade
in 1983, and this

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:51.740
is what his reason was.

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.090
I have a picture of John Reade.

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:56.780
He's not very famous,
so I try to make

00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.492
sure his picture gets around.

00:28:00.492 --> 00:28:01.450
He's playing the piano.

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:04.400
It's, like, one of the only
pictures I could find of him.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.830
So what is in this reason?

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:08.520
Why do people say this?

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.830
Well here's an example
that illustrates it.

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:19.930
If I take a polynomial
in two variables and I--

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:23.050
for example, this is a
polynomial of two variables--

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:27.340
and my x matrix
comes from sampling

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:30.580
that polynomial integers--

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:38.940
for example, this matrix--

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:41.730
then that matrix happens
to be of low rank--

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:50.250
mathematically of low rank,
with epsilon equals zero.

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:50.790
Why is that?

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:54.480
Well if I write down x
in terms of matrices,

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.220
you could easily see it.

00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:00.120
So this is made up of
a matrix of all ones

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:11.160
plus a matrix of j-- so that's
1, 2, up to n, 1, 2, up to n,

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.750
because every entry
of that matrix

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:15.500
just depends on the row index.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.730
And then this guy
depends on both j and k.

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:21.330
So this is a multiplication
table, right?

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:31.635
So this is n, 2, 4, up
to 2n, n, 2n, n squared.

00:29:31.635 --> 00:29:34.050
OK.

00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:38.130
Clearly, the matrix of all
ones is a rank one matrix.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:43.560
The same with this guy.

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:47.220
The column space is
just of dimension one.

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:51.960
And the last guy also
happens to be of rank one

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:58.365
because I can write this
matrix in rank one form, which

00:29:58.365 --> 00:30:03.250
is a column vector
times a row vector.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:04.090
OK.

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:07.280
So this matrix x
is of rank three.

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:16.620
I guess at lowest rank three
is what I've actually shown.

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:17.120
OK.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.480
Now of course this hasn't got
to numerical low rank yet,

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.820
so let's get ourselves there.

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:32.160
So Reade knew this, and
he said to himself, OK,

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.590
well if I can approximate--

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:38.800
if x is actually coming
from sampling a function,

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.890
and I approximate that
function by polynomial,

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:45.670
then I'm going to get myself
a low-rank approximation

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:48.920
and get a bound on
the numerical rank.

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:56.620
So in general, if I give you
a polynomial of two variables,

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:58.630
which can be written down--

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:04.000
it's degree n in both x and y.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.375
Let's just keep these indexes
away from the matrix index.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:14.170
I give you this such
polynomial, and I go away

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:22.150
and I sample it and
make a matrix X, then X,

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:24.220
by looking at each term
individually like I

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:30.520
did there, will have
low rank mathematically,

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.830
with epsilon equals zero.

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:35.590
This will have, at
most, m squared rank,

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:39.160
and if m is 3 or 4
or 10, it possibly

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:43.570
could be low because this
X could be a large matrix.

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:44.320
OK.

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.020
So what Reade did for the
Hilbert matrix was said,

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.270
OK, well look at that guy.

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:52.193
That guy looks like it's
sampling a function.

00:31:52.193 --> 00:31:53.860
It looks like it's
sampling the function

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:57.170
1 over x plus y minus 1.

00:31:57.170 --> 00:32:02.650
So he said to
himself, well, that x,

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:07.540
if I look at the Hilbert
matrix, then that

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:09.600
is sampling a function.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.270
It happens to not
be a polynomial.

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:16.480
It happens to be this function.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:20.950
But that's OK because sampling
polynomials, integers,

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:22.970
gives me low rank exactly.

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:27.670
Maybe sampling smooth
functions, functions like this,

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:29.770
can be well approximated
by polynomials

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:32.680
and therefore have
low numerical rank.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.900
And that's what he
did in this case.

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:42.790
So he tried to find a p, a
polynomial approximation to f.

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:45.610
In particular, he looked
at exactly this kind

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:46.994
of approximation.

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:54.320
So he has some numbers
here so that things

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.805
get dissolved later.

00:32:55.805 --> 00:33:01.220
And he tried to find a p that
did this kind of approximation.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:03.200
So this approximates f.

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:14.080
And then he would develop a
low-rank approximation to X

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.780
by sampling p.

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:26.260
So he would say, OK, well if I
let y be a sampling of p, then

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:29.620
from the fact that f is a
good approximation to p,

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:34.590
y is a good approximation to
X. And so this has finite rank.

00:33:38.198 --> 00:33:43.100
He wrote down that
this must hold.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:49.500
And the epsilon comes out
here because these factors

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.390
were chosen just right.

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:54.910
The divide by n was chosen so
that the epsilon came out just

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:55.960
there.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:56.460
OK?

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:59.340
So, for many years, that was
kind of the canonical reason

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:01.600
that people would
give, that, well,

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:05.920
if the matrix X is sampled
from a smooth function,

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:10.440
then we can approximate our
function by a polynomial

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:15.060
and get polynomial
rank approximations.

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:18.929
And therefore, the matrix X
will be of low numerical rank.

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:26.630
There's an issue
with this reasoning,

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:28.489
especially for the
Hilbert matrix,

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:31.710
that it doesn't
actually work that well.

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:38.710
So for example, if I take the
1,000 by 1,000 Hilbert matrix

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:41.072
and I look at its rank--

00:34:41.072 --> 00:34:45.040
OK, well I've already told
you this is full rank.

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.650
You'll get 1,000.

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:50.929
All the singular
values are positive.

00:34:50.929 --> 00:34:55.980
If I look at the numerical
rank of this 1,000

00:34:55.980 --> 00:35:00.480
by 1,000 Hilbert matrix and I
compute it, I compute the SVD

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:06.600
and I look at how many are above
epsilon where epsilon is 10

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:10.620
to the minus 15,
so that means I can

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:13.650
approximate the 1,000
by 1,000 Hilbert matrix

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:18.750
by a rank 28 matrix
and only give up

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:24.450
15-- there will be exact 15
digits, which is a huge amount.

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:27.030
So this is what we
get in practice,

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:42.670
but Reade's argument here shows
that the rank of this matrix,

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:45.980
the numerical rank, is at most.

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:53.210
So it doesn't do a very good
job on the Hilbert matrix

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:57.220
for bounding the rank, right?

00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:00.100
So Reade comes along,
takes this function.

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:02.520
He tries to find a polynomial
that does this, where

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.480
epsilon is 10 to the minus 15.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:07.240
He finds that the
number of terms

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:13.570
that he needs in this
expression here is around 719,

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:16.580
and therefore, that's
the rank that he gets.

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:19.300
The bound on the numerical rank.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:25.120
The trouble is that 719
tells us that this is not

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:27.820
of low numerical
rank, but we know

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:32.450
it is, so it's an
unsatisfactory reason.

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:36.690
So there's been
several people trying

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:39.900
to come up with more
appropriate reasons that

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:44.190
explain the 28 here.

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:50.220
And so one reason that
I've started to use

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:52.710
is another slightly
different way

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:57.990
of looking at things, which is
to say the world is Sylvester.

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:10.420
Now Sylvester, what
does that mean?

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:13.010
What does the word
"Sylvester" mean in this case?

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:14.950
It means that the
matrices satisfy

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:20.080
a certain type of equation
called the Sylvester equation,

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:25.420
and so the reason is really,
many of these matrices

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:30.220
satisfy a Sylvester equation,
and that takes the form--

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:44.190
for sum A, B, and C.

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:44.690
OK.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:46.580
So X is your matrix of interest.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:50.690
You want to show X is
of numerical low rank.

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:54.770
And the task at hand is
to find an A, B, and C so

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:58.880
that X satisfies that equation.

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.030
OK.

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:05.450
For example, the two matrices
I've had on the board

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:09.360
satisfy a Sylvester equation--

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.780
a Sylvester matrix equation.

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:14.490
There is an A, a B, and a
C for which they do this.

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:17.677
For example, remember
the Hilbert matrix,

00:38:17.677 --> 00:38:20.010
which we have there still,
but I'll write it down again.

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:26.770
Has these entries.

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:28.770
So all we need to do
is to try to figure out

00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:32.760
an A, a B, and then a
C so that we can make

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:34.230
it fit a Sylvester equation.

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:36.820
There's many different
ways of doing this.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:41.050
The one that I like
is the following,

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:45.660
where if I put 1/2
here and 3/2 here,

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:51.245
all the way down to n minus
1/2, times this matrix--

00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:59.080
so this is timesing the
top of this matrix by 1/2

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:02.050
and then 3/2 and then 5/2.

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:05.620
So we're basically timesing
each entry of this matrix

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:07.435
by j minus 1/2.

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:12.040
And then I do
something on the right

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.582
here, which I'm allowed to do
because I've got the B freedom,

00:39:14.582 --> 00:39:19.280
and I choose this to be the
same up to a minus sign.

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:26.830
Then when you think about
this, what is it doing?

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:30.460
It's timing the jk entry--

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:33.370
this is-- by j minus 1/2.

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:34.840
That's what this is doing.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.570
And what's this doing
is timesing the jk entry

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:40.420
by k minus 1/2.

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:44.590
So this is, in total,
timesing the jk entry

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:49.700
by j plus k minus 1/2 minus
1/2, which is minus 1,

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:54.810
so this is timesing the jk
entry by j plus k minus 1.

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:57.690
So it knocks out
the denominator.

00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:02.260
And what we get from this
equation is a bunch of ones.

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:14.080
So in this case, A
and B are diagonal,

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:17.250
and C is the matrix of all ones.

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:17.920
OK?

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:20.590
We can also do this
for Vandermonde.

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:25.960
So Vandermonde, you'll
remember, looks like this.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:35.610
And then over here,
we have this guy,

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:40.910
the matrix that appears with
polynomial interpolation.

00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:41.410
OK.

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:44.530
So if I think about
this, I could also

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:50.200
come up with an A, B, and
C, and for example, here's

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.180
one that works.

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:55.360
I can stick the x's
on the diagonal.

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:03.850
So if you imagine what that
matrix on the left is doing,

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:08.090
it's timesing each
column by the vector x.

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:08.590
OK?

00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:12.940
So the first column of this
matrix becomes x, the vector x.

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:16.630
The second becomes
the vector x squared,

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:18.670
where squared is
done entry-wise.

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:21.140
And then the third
entry is now x cubed,

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:24.420
and when we get to the
last, it's x to the n.

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:24.920
OK?

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:30.080
So that's like, multiply
each column by the vector x.

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:32.480
So if I want to try to
come up with a matrix--

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:36.680
so what's left is of low
rank, is like of this form.

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:40.520
What I can do is
shift the columns.

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.580
So I've noticed that
this product here,

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:46.688
this diagonal matrix, has
made the first column x.

00:41:46.688 --> 00:41:48.230
So if I want to kill
off that column,

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:52.187
I can take the second column and
permute it to the first column.

00:41:52.187 --> 00:41:54.020
I could take the third
column and permute it

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:56.810
to the second, the last
column and permute it

00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:58.910
to the penultimate column here.

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:00.590
And that will actually
kill off a lot

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:03.710
of what I've created in
this matrix right here.

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:05.300
So let me write that down.

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:08.510
This is a circumshift matrix.

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:10.280
This does that permutation.

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:18.393
I've put a minus 1 there.

00:42:18.393 --> 00:42:19.810
I could have put
any number there.

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:22.440
It doesn't make any difference.

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:25.120
But this is the one that
works out extremely nicely.

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:29.170
Now this zeros out lots of
things because of the way

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:32.005
I've done the multiplication
by x and the circumshift

00:42:32.005 --> 00:42:33.790
of the columns.

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:39.010
And so the first column is zero
because this first column is x,

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:43.240
this first column is x,
so I've got x minus x.

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:47.170
This column was x squared
minus x squared, so I got zero,

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:51.430
and I just keep going along
until that last column.

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:54.040
That last column is a problem
because the last column

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:57.280
of this guy is x
to the n, whereas I

00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:02.240
don't have x to the n in V, so
there are some numbers here.

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:02.740
OK.

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.550
You'll notice that
C in both cases

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:11.070
happens to be a low-rank matrix.

00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:14.661
In these cases, it
happens to be of rank one.

00:43:14.661 --> 00:43:19.290
And so people were
wondering, maybe it's

00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:23.040
something to do with satisfying
these kind of equations that

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:27.180
makes these matrices
that appear in practice

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:29.850
numerically of low rank.

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:33.630
And after a lot of
work in this area,

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:37.740
people have come up
with a bound that

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:42.360
demonstrates that
these kind of equations

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:46.470
are key to understanding
numerical low rank.

00:43:46.470 --> 00:44:04.750
So if X satisfies a Sylvester
equation, like this, and A

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:06.993
is normal, B is normal--

00:44:06.993 --> 00:44:08.410
I don't really
want to concentrate

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:12.590
on those two conditions.

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:17.230
It's a little bit academic.

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:21.430
Then-- people have found
a bound on the singular

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:24.010
values of any matrix
that satisfies

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:27.970
this kind of
expression, and they

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:30.460
found this following bound.

00:44:41.829 --> 00:44:49.240
OK, so here, the rank of C is r.

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:50.180
So that goes there.

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:52.360
So in our cases, the
two examples we have,

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:55.990
r is 1, so we can
forget about r.

00:44:55.990 --> 00:45:02.930
This nasty guy here is
called the Zolotarev number.

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:12.814
E is a set that contains
the eigenvalues of A,

00:45:12.814 --> 00:45:23.270
and F is a set that contains
the eigenvalues of B. OK.

00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:26.480
Now it looks like we have
gained absolutely nothing

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:30.260
by this bound, because I've
just told you singular values

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:32.540
are bound by Zolotarev numbers.

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:35.450
That doesn't mean
anything to anyone.

00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:38.960
It means a little bit
to me but not that much.

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:42.020
So the key to this bound--

00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:43.970
the reason this is useful--

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:49.220
is that so many people have
worked out what these Zolotarev

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:52.190
numbers actually mean.

00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.700
OK?

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:57.620
So these are two key
people that worked out

00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:59.360
what this bound means.

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:02.600
And we have gained
a lot because people

00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:04.880
have been studying this number.

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.740
This is, like, a
number that people

00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:11.600
cared about from 1870
onwards to the present day,

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:14.870
and people have studied
this number extremely well.

00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:17.510
So we've gained
something by turning it

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:21.290
into a more abstract problem
that people have thought

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:23.990
about previously,
and now we can go

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:26.450
to the literature on
Zolotarev numbers,

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:30.980
whatever they are, and discover
this whole literature of work

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:32.900
on this Zolotarev number.

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:34.433
And the key part--

00:46:34.433 --> 00:46:35.600
I'll just tell you the key--

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:44.690
is that the sets E
and F are separated.

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:57.905
So for example, in the Hilbert
matrix, the eigenvalues of A

00:46:57.905 --> 00:46:59.135
can be read off the diagonal.

00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:06.155
What are they?

00:47:06.155 --> 00:47:13.550
They are between minus
1/2 and n minus 1/2.

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:20.540
And the eigenvalues of B
lie in the set minus 1/2

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:23.524
minus n plus 1/2.

00:47:23.524 --> 00:47:27.610
And the key reason
why the Hilbert matrix

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:30.610
is of low numerical
rank is the fact

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:33.470
that these two
sets are separated,

00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:36.580
and that makes this Zolotarev
number gets small extremely

00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:38.950
quickly with k.

00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:41.080
Now you might wonder
why there is a question

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:44.980
mark on Penzl's name.

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:49.690
There is an unofficial
curse that's

00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:51.430
been going on for a while.

00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:54.730
Both these men died while
working on the Zolotarev

00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:55.870
problem.

00:47:55.870 --> 00:48:00.270
They both died at the age of 31.

00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:03.990
One died by being hit
by a train, Zolotarev.

00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:08.660
It's unclear whether he was
suicidal or it was accidental.

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:13.440
Penzl died at the age of 31
in the Canadian mountains

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:16.030
by an avalanche.

00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:21.130
I am currently not yet 31
but going to be 31 very soon,

00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:23.830
and I'm scared that
I may join this list.

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:29.020
OK.

00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:32.770
But for the Hilbert matrix,
what you get from this analysis,

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:36.520
based on these
two peoples' work,

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:39.700
is a bound on the
numerical rank.

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:43.150
And the rank that you
get is, let's say,

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:45.820
a world record bound.

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:56.260
For the Hilbert matrix is 34,
which is not quite 28, not yet,

00:48:56.260 --> 00:49:02.860
but it's far more
descriptive of 28 than 719.

00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:07.420
And so this technique of
bounding singular values

00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:11.530
by using these Zolotarev numbers
is starting to gain popularity

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:15.940
because we can finally answer
to ourselves why there are so

00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:20.420
many low-rank matrices that
appear in computational math.

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:27.440
And it's all based on two
31-year-olds that died.

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:30.710
And so if you ever
wonder when you're

00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:33.830
doing computational science
when a low rank appears

00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:36.710
and the smoothness argument
does not work for you,

00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:40.990
you might like to think about
Zolotarev and the curse.

00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:42.721
OK, thank you very much.

00:49:42.721 --> 00:49:44.605
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:47.431 --> 00:49:49.790
GILBERT STRANG: Thank you
[INAUDIBLE] Excellent.

00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:51.880
ALEX TOWNSEND: How
does it work now?

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.680
GILBERT STRANG: We're good.

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:54.180
Yeah.

00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:55.930
ALEX TOWNSEND: I'm
happy to take questions

00:49:55.930 --> 00:49:57.920
if we have a minute, if
you have any questions.

00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:59.545
GILBERT STRANG: How
near of 31 are you?

00:50:02.085 --> 00:50:03.960
ALEX TOWNSEND: [INAUDIBLE]
I get a spotlight.

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:05.490
I'm 31 in December.

00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:06.330
GILBERT STRANG: Wow.

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:07.170
OK.

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:10.920
ALEX TOWNSEND: So they died
at the age of 31, so you know,

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:14.640
next year is the
scary year for me.

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:16.550
So I'm not driving anywhere.

00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:20.898
I'm not leaving my
house until I become 32.

00:50:20.898 --> 00:50:22.690
GILBERT STRANG: Well,
thank you [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:24.190
ALEX TOWNSEND: OK, thanks.

00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:26.640
[APPLAUSE]
