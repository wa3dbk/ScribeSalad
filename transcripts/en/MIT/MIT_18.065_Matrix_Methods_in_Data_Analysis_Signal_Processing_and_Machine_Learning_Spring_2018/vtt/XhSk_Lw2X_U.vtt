GILBERT STRANG: So just
to orient where we are,

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.840
today starts a new chapter
about low-rank matrices.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.830
So that's an important
bunch of matrices.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.620
They can be truly low-rank,
like uv transpose.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.720
That's a rank 1.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.560
And we have some
questions about those.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.230
And then later in
the chapter, we'll

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.096
meet matrices that are
approximately low-rank, where

00:00:59.096 --> 00:01:02.850
the singular values
drop off like crazy.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.340
And those are quite
remarkable matrices.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.910
So this is my topic
at the beginning--

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.970
and if it doesn't
take the whole hour,

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:24.210
I want to go back to
a topic in chapter 2--

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.200
that should be 2.4--

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.520
where we were last time.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.020
Good.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.640
So that's for later in the hour.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.080
This is for now.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.580
Let's focus on this.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.080
So what's the question there?

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.870
I start with the
identity matrix.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.750
I perturb it by a
matrix of rank 1.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.720
And I ask what the inverse is.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.830
So I'm making a small
change in the matrix.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.080
When I say small
change, I don't mean

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.760
that the numbers are small.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:13.150
In fact, uv transpose could
be the all 1's matrix,

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.940
or the all millions
matrix, even.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.330
But its rank is small.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.110
That's the idea of small
that's important here.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.100
And I would like to know
what the inverse is.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.410
So that's the
question here in 4.1.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.220
And there's a famous formula
that has at least three names,

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.140
and probably more, and it's
also called the matrix inversion

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:48.350
formula in signal processing.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.630
And let me write
down the example.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.200
So I start with the
identity matrix.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.760
I do a rank 1 perturbation.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.610
And I want to know,
what's the inverse?

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.800
And I'll write down the answer
and check that it's correct.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.680
So I'm perturbing
the identity matrix

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.480
in this case, whose inverse
is also the identity matrix.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.980
So I'm going to write the
answer as a perturbation of I.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.220
And the question is, what
is that perturbation?

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.040
And it's a famous formula.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.870
There is a uv transpose
that comes in,

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.870
copied from there, divided
by 1 minus v transpose u.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.270
Now, let's first of
all just see that this

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.930
is a reasonable formula.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.020
So u a column-- u and v are
column vectors, as always.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.910
So uv transpose is a
matrix, column times row.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.900
And it's being subtracted
from the identity.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.450
And over here on this side,
I have uv transpose-- again,

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.740
a rank 1 matrix--

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.220
divided by a number.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.109
So that's the point.

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:17.859
This is a number--

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.650
a 1 by 1 matrix, you could say.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.690
So the point of this formula
is to find the inverse of an n

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.320
by n matrix in terms
of the inverse of a 1

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.780
by 1 matrix, which is a lot
simpler and easier to do.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.650
I mean, that right-hand
side is clearly easy.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.160
And let's see what other
things it tells us.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.380
So this was a rank 1
perturbation in the identity.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.200
Then when I invert, I get--

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.860
look at this.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.600
This is also a rank 1.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.150
That's a number.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.160
In fact, it's the
very same rank 1

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.990
that we had there
in this nice case.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:20.320
So conclusion-- if I
change a matrix by rank 1,

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.290
I change its inverse by rank 1.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.860
That doesn't seem
completely obvious

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.210
until you go to figure it out.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.240
When you figure it out, you
get a formula that tells you.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.830
Well, so far what I'm perturbing
is the identity matrix.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.985
When I get here, I'm going
to perturb any matrix.

00:05:41.985 --> 00:05:44.620
And I'm going to reach
the same conclusion.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:52.150
If this is rank 1, then
the change in the inverse

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.800
is also rank 1.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.380
But let's see it first for
a equal to the identity.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.480
So I guess I have two
or three questions.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.405
One would be, how do you
check that this is correct?

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.520
Again, remember what it's doing.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.775
It's pretty neat.

00:06:14.775 --> 00:06:21.630
It's computing an n by n inverse
in terms of a 1 by 1 inverse.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:22.350
It's a number.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.490
And that's certainly
a favorable exchange.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.060
So it's a formula that
you want and a formula

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.900
that's quite useful.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.350
Let me just check
the formula before I

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.930
talk about how it's useful.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.230
So how shall I check it?

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.190
I guess, if this is
claimed to be the inverse,

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.170
then let's just che--

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.660
so this will be the check.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:07:00.930
I'll multiply by that, I
plus uv transpose over 1

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.400
minus v transpose u,
the claimed inverse.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.610
And what am I hoping to get
from this multiplication?

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:10.110
AUDIENCE: I.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:14.360
GILBERT STRANG: I. I'm
hoping that, that result is

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.990
the identity matrix.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.950
So I'm just going to
do it out, and we'll

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.020
see the identity appear.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.910
So that times I-- so let me
just write that part first,

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.700
I minus uv transpose.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.030
And now I minus uv
transpose times this--

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:38.720
so that's I minus
uv transpose times

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:46.040
uv transpose over 1
minus v transpose u.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:51.440
It's just multiplying
it out and seeing

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.530
that we get the identity.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.630
I see the identity there.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:03.230
So I guess, I hope that
all this part reduces to--

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:04.490
what does it reduce to?

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.980
Let me do that numerator there.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:17.490
So that's uv transpose minus u--

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:22.740
ooh-- minus u times
v transpose u--

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.410
do you see what's
happening here--

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:26.310
v transpose.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:33.600
The key is that when I
multiplied that times

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.900
that, I've got four
things in a row.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.570
And I do the middle pair first.

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.270
Because that's a
number, v transpose u.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:49.300
So I had uv transpose from
that and uv transpose times

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.590
that number minus--

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.170
do you see-- what
have I got here?

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.170
I've got--

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:58.245
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:58.245 --> 00:08:59.120
GILBERT STRANG: Yeah.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.230
I've got uv transpose.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:04.830
Now I factor out a 1
minus v transpose u,

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.390
which is just what I want.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.540
I factor the 1 minus v
transpose u out of here.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:12.930
It's there.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.280
Cancel those.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.330
And then I'm left with a
uv transpose, which cancels

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:22.200
that and leaves the identity.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.900
It's kind of magic.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:30.130
Of course, somebody had
to figure out that formula

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:33.160
in the first place.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:43.510
I could do the next one, if
you like, since I'm on a roll.

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:47.800
Suppose I take this second one,
now what's the difference in--

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:52.120
it's uv transpose, but those
are larger letters, the u

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.980
and the v. So what am
I meaning by those?

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.650
Those are matrices.

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:00.200
This is a bigger rank.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.230
u has k columns.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:06.380
v transpose has k rows.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:11.960
That product uv
transpose is k by k.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.830
So let me see what I think
the formula would be.

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:21.260
So now, I minus uv
transpose inverse--

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:28.810
so this is n by k times k by n.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:31.000
So it's n by n matrix.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.320
And this is the ide--

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.730
identity of this.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.670
But its rank is--

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.763
what is the rank of that now?

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:39.430
AUDIENCE: k.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:40.180
GILBERT STRANG: k.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.170
Right.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:47.200
So I have here, the whole
thing is the inverse

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.520
of an n by n matrix.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.130
So I have an n by n matrix.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:56.290
Let me put that up here,
n by n matrix to invert.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.890
There it is.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:05.660
I'm going to write
down the formula.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.535
And you're going to be
able to write it down,

00:11:07.535 --> 00:11:10.880
because it's just
copied from that one.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:16.470
And you'll see that it
involves a k by k inverse.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.910
So I have an n by
n matrix to invert,

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.000
but I don't have to do that.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.870
I can switch it to
a k by k matrix.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:27.300
That's pretty nice.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.370
So let's do it.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:37.090
So I'm basically gonna
copy that I plus u--

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:40.070
now, I've matrices.

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:42.890
So that's an inverse,
but I can't leave it

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:43.980
as a denominator.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.835
Because through here, we're
talking about a k by k matrix.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:12:00.070
So I have to put it like any
matrix inverse, Ik minus v

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:06.040
transpose u inverse.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.170
So I'm just copying
this formula,

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:12.220
wisely taking the u
first, then this part,

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.800
then finally, the v transpose.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.230
I put this one up.

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.620
This one now has made
that one obsolete.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.900
This was the case k
equal to 1 over here.

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:30.990
But I think it helps to see it.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:33.640
It certainly helps me
to see the formula first

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:41.860
for a rank 1 perturbation, which
is a very likely possibility,

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:45.610
and then see that we have a
totally analogous formula.

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:48.940
It's sort of fun to check it.

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.710
So I plan to do the same check.

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:55.690
But I'll just notice here
that I have a k by k inverse.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:06.390
So I'm exchanging something
that's a perturbation of n

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:11.880
by n identity, an n
by n matrix, to have

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.260
to invert something
that's a k by k matrix,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:21.840
perturbing the k by k
identity, much smaller.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.200
In that case, k was 1.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.620
So are you good for
checking it now?

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:32.010
So I want to
multiply that by this

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:35.830
and hopefully get
In, the identity.

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.155
This is the n by n identity.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:47.480
I haven't given credit to
the two or three or four,

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.560
or possibly 11 people,
who found this formula.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:57.200
And I'm not see-- oh,
yeah, here are their names.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.720
Is it OK to make them famous
by putting their names up here?

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.430
Yes.

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:10.440
Sherman-- and I couldn't
tell you who did what.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:22.840
Morrison, Woodbury, and
then no doubt others--

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.470
maybe one of them
did this rank 1 case,

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:28.450
and then another generalized it.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:34.690
And then you could see from the
outline there that eventually

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:37.460
we'll-- we can perturb
a matrix A. Of course,

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:41.770
that's not going to be much
harder than the identity.

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:44.560
Let's do just one
more check, and then

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.865
show how it could be used.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:51.260
I multiply that by that.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.080
Can we do that--

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.680
this thing times this, and
hope to get the identity?

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.130
So first, I'll write
down this thing.

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:07.630
So I won't put equal, because
I'm multiplying that by that.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:11.680
So I get In minus uv transpose.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:18.840
On the left side, of course,
I'm getting the identity,

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.860
and hoping I'm getting
the identity on the right.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.780
So I'm multiplying by this.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.010
I did it there.

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:30.440
Now I have to put I
minus uv transposed.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:39.110
It takes faith here. u I
minus v transpose u inverse v

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.920
transpose--

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:46.600
gulp.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:52.380
Shall I just leave it there?

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:56.860
Or you're-- had
lunch, you're strong.

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.930
Let's see what we can do.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.540
This part-- fine.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:05.470
This part-- oh, boy.

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:08.010
What do I do here?

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:17.120
That trick is going to be that
this dopey-looking thing there

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.460
can be written differently.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.590
Well, just tell
me what it equals.

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:29.520
It equals u minus
uv transpose u.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.740
Everybody sees that.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:36.050
But now what am I going to do?

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:43.640
I'm going to put the
parentheses differently.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.670
I'm bringing u, the u that
was on the right up there--

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:49.020
I'm going to put it on the left.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:50.610
You see that?

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:55.330
So this is obviously u
minus uv transpose u.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.410
And now I'm going to
write it another time.

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:03.490
It's u times I
minus v transpose u.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.300
I'm going to factor the
u out on the left side

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:11.780
instead of where it originally
came on the right side of this.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.640
You see the great news there?

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:19.619
This was actually well-organized
by your professor--

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:21.540
by accident.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.390
So what do I do now?

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:25.920
This thing-- look.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:30.900
I've got exactly here what
I've got inverted there.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:36.600
So altogether, I have I minus
uv transpose plus this u,

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.070
this cancelled,
times v transpose.

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:45.650
So I get I. So it was just
this little sleight of hand,

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:49.150
where u came in on the right
and came out on the left side.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:58.020
And there'd be a similar
formula with A in there.

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:01.170
So now, it's a
fair question, how

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:03.770
did anybody come up
with these formulas?

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:08.190
We're proving them correct
just by checking that they

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:11.820
give the identity matrix.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:15.780
We should really
think how to find

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.750
the formula in the first place.

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:22.070
I could go back to this one.

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:24.768
How could you find that
formula in the first place?

00:18:24.768 --> 00:18:26.060
Well, here is one way to do it.

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:36.780
This is then about "to
discover the formula."

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:56.130
And then, over here, let me put
over here "to use the formula,"

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:57.860
while I think of it.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:02.020
And actually, I have
two uses in mind.

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:04.995
Use one would be to solve--

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:15.410
I'm just doing I.
Suppose I want to--

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:20.750
so this is my new
matrix uv transpose x

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:25.120
equals some right-hand side b.

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:31.150
Solve a linear system that
has that coefficient matrix.

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:44.790
The use two would be, in least
squares, a new measurement

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:48.760
or observation or data
point in these squares.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.250
So what do I mean by this?

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:05.250
The old problem was Ax equal b.

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:13.150
And I'm thinking, when I'm
talking about least squares

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:17.830
here, I'm imagining
that A is rectangular.

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:19.620
Too many equations--

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.330
A is a tall, thin
matrix, just the kind

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:23.890
we've been talking about.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:27.190
So that equation becomes--

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:32.720
of course, we know we go
to the normal equations--

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:39.200
A transpose Ax, the good
x, is A transpose b.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.928
Now we get a new measurement.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.710
So a new measurement, how
does a new measurement

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:52.150
change the problem?

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:55.210
So this is the old problem
before the measurement

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:56.470
comes in.

00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:58.060
Now a new measurement arrives.

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:02.610
So that's another
b, a b M plus 1.

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:05.800
And we get another equation.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.360
We get another equation.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.150
That's the new
measurement, new point

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:14.360
to get this straight line
it's trying to stay close to.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.500
So we'll call this equation--

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.000
I don't know what
we should call it.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.440
Maybe it'll be one more row.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:29.510
So now, old now is becoming new.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:33.440
I'm sort of more excited about
this than proving the formula.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.840
So I'll just keep going.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:42.470
So there is our M
measurements, M being large,

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:44.927
A being a tall, thin matrix.

00:21:44.927 --> 00:21:46.760
And now we're going to
give it one more row.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.560
We're going to make
it even taller,

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:57.320
say maybe, v transpose
times this same x is some b

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.980
new, or something like that.

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:04.970
So there's one more row,
one more measurement.

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:09.192
So what happens to
the normal equation?

00:22:09.192 --> 00:22:11.640
This makes it even more likely.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.630
There's another point, hoping
that a straight line will

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:15.230
go through.

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:16.960
But if we give it
one more point,

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:21.500
there is even less chance of
a straight line going exactly

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.310
through.

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:24.680
But still, so what do I--

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.420
this is my new matrix.

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.080
So what's my new
normal equation?

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:41.110
The new normal equation,
the A, or transpose--

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:44.420
the A has got a new row.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.280
A has got a new row.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.590
So a transpose will
have a new column.

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:51.020
I'm just copying
the normal equation,

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:54.030
but I'm giving it its new thing.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:56.000
It's got a new column.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.520
That is my A with a new row.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:09.320
This is my x hat, my
least squares answer, new.

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:13.400
And A transpose is this.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:22.280
A transpose with a new, now,
column times b, so b and b new.

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:28.930
Pretty OK with this.

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:31.580
Do you see that this is
the new normal equation?

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:35.210
I'm using the new matrix
and the new right-hand side.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:42.146
And just one more
data point has come

00:23:42.146 --> 00:23:47.650
into the system from the sensor.

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:49.640
And what's the key point here?

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:54.880
The key point is I
don't want to recompute.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:59.170
I don't want to multiply
that matrix again.

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:02.080
I don't want to start over.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:08.650
I don't want to compute this A
transpose times that A. I want

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:09.910
to use what I've already done.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.400
If I multiply
those two together,

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.510
what do I actually get?

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:26.900
So this is, I'm adding a new
column here and a new row here.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.850
Tell me what you think
the answer is, and then

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:30.290
let's just see why.

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:32.650
I'm asking you what
that matrix is.

00:24:35.947 --> 00:24:39.250
What do you think?

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:42.940
Start me out, anyway.

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:46.450
I'm just asking for ordinary
matrix multiplication.

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:49.880
Well, I guess I'm
asking you to do it

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:57.220
columns times rows since that's
what 18 and 6.5 specializes in.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:04.120
So I think I have that
times that, A transpose A,

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.540
plus one new column
times one new row.

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:15.520
vv transpose is
multiplying this x hat new.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.190
And over on the right
side, I get whatever I had,

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:25.280
the A transpose b
old and the v b new.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:29.320
But let me come back to that,
because that really shows you

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.250
why you must understand
matrix multiplication,

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:36.930
both the usual
row times column--

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:41.200
but that would not be
so attractive here--

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:47.080
and also the new way
as columns times rows.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:50.200
Because when I see it
as columns times rows,

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:54.160
I see that I have the same
columns and same rows there.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.740
So that's just what
I already knew.

00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:59.470
And then I have one new
column times one new row.

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:03.850
Of course, that's column n plus
1, and that's a row n plus 1.

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.580
And they give that rank 1.

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:10.890
It's a rank 1 change in A
transpose A. It's a rank 1

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:13.280
change in A transpose A.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:18.140
So this is like part
of least squares.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:24.050
I mean, you can see the
relevance in a real problem.

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:27.940
You maybe have a
missile flying along.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:31.210
You've sent up a
satellite, GPS satellite.

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:32.690
You're tracking it.

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:34.790
More data comes in.

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:39.170
The data is just
one more position.

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:41.490
The tracker isn't perfect.

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:42.590
So we're going to fit--

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:47.770
well, here I'm fitting
a straight line, maybe.

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:51.410
But we're fitting to the data.

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:57.160
And the only change in the
left-hand, the big problem,

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:01.390
the big part of the computation
is the A transpose A part.

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:06.740
And it's just changed
by rank 1, or by rank k,

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:10.190
if we had k new data points.

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:13.010
If we had k new data
points, then this

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:16.040
would be a rank k matrix.

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.840
So you see, then
I go back here--

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:20.990
well, OK.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:23.150
Now I'm perturbing
A transpose A.

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:28.370
And I haven't given a
formula for that one yet.

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:30.950
I've only perturbed up
to, now, the identity.

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:34.370
But you can believe, since all
these formulas are working,

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:37.520
that Sherman or
Morrison or Woodbury

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:44.130
came up with the correct
perturbation for A transpose A.

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:51.560
So I'm sort of happy that,
that application, so natural,

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:55.565
came out so simply.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:02.090
While I'm on that
sort of subject,

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:05.700
have you ever heard
of the Kalman filter?

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:11.010
So that Kalman filter,
what's that about?

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:13.430
It's about exactly this.

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:15.590
It's about dynamic
least squares.

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:17.270
It's about least
squares problems

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:20.130
in which new data is coming in.

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:22.900
That's what the Kalman
filter-- or in other words,

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:26.170
let me just write a
couple of words up here.

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:31.210
This is really
recursive least squares.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:36.700
Recursive least squares--
what I mean by recursive

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:39.600
is new data comes in.

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:45.650
It changes the answer, but
it doesn't change our method.

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:56.120
And then the Kalman filter
is a very, very big deal

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.585
in guidance.

00:28:57.585 --> 00:29:05.230
If you're sending up a missile,
a satellite, you track it.

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:09.880
You do just what I've
been discussing here.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.860
But the Kalman filter is--

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:16.630
it's got more possibilities
built in than this one.

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:20.980
This is the simplest
update possible.

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:25.800
And it would go
in this category.

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:31.810
Kalman went beyond
a standard update.

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:33.620
How did he go beyond?

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:36.030
Let's see.

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:38.500
If I've used the
words Kalman filter,

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:42.730
I should tell you what
it is that Kalman does

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:45.460
and what is that
least squares problem.

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:49.150
It's just part of general
knowledge, it seems to me.

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.560
So what is it, more gen--

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.610
what are the additional pieces?

00:29:56.610 --> 00:30:03.010
You've seen the main idea here
of getting a simple recursive

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:06.130
step that doesn't
require recomputing all

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:08.110
that you did before.

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:13.780
And of course, to
this inverse, I'm

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:16.190
going to apply the
Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:17.140
formula.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:20.730
So I'll use the inverse
that I had before.

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:23.340
And this will be a rank 1--

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:27.270
this is a rank 1
perturbation of that.

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:30.270
I'm looking here at A
transpose A. Over there,

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:33.330
I was looking at,
I just called it A.

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:35.850
Or I even called it
the identity matrix.

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:38.490
But it's whatever
matrix you have here

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:40.620
with a rank 1 perturbation.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:44.220
And the whole thing
has to be inverted.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:48.480
And so I was going to
say what is additional,

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.970
just so you know
about Kalman filters.

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:53.880
So two things are additional.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:59.320
The point is Kalman filters
are for dynamic least squares.

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.080
I would say dynamic squares.

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:07.430
And so there are two ingredients
that you haven't seen here.

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:13.770
One ingredient is
the idea of using

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:16.980
the covariance matrix,
which tells you

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:20.010
how errors are correlated.

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:23.010
So that would be
weighted least squares,

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:25.485
or correlated least squares.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:36.210
So these squares-- let
me just remind you,

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:37.930
if I can write it here.

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:42.325
So least squares-- standard.

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:53.970
Standard meaning that
data is not correlated.

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:57.900
It all has the same variance.

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.750
These are the statistics
words that I'm

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:08.770
using last time and this, but
that I'll talk about properly.

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:12.370
So the standard
one is the covari--

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:20.530
the standard means covariance
equal the identity matrix.

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:28.090
You're doing Gaussian
normal probability

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:35.300
but with just standard
Gaussians, standard Gaussians.

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:42.370
So that's one aspect, which
in the work of the Draper lab,

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:47.320
let's say, they
have to think, OK,

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:50.500
they're getting sensors,
different kinds of sensors,

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:53.680
with different accuracies,
different reliability.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:57.980
So they have to take account
of the covariance matrix.

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:00.920
Then the other point is--

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:04.130
and also-- so that
was point one.

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:07.055
Point two is the dynamic part.

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:12.530
There is a state equation.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.290
So I'm really into the
edge of control theory.

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:22.970
So let me just use some
words here that you've seen,

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:23.960
if you've--

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:28.550
so control theory
has state equation.

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:29.960
What's a state equation?

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.610
What is the state?

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:35.900
This is the position,
in my example,

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:38.526
is the position
of the satellite.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:50.580
So are we looking for
a fixed satellite?

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:51.450
Certainly not.

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:53.340
The satellite is moving.

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:59.700
So this state equation tells
me how much the satellite--

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:04.080
it's Newton's law-- tells me
where the satellite should be.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.090
Where am I looking?

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:10.469
And then the least
squares tells me, it says,

00:34:10.469 --> 00:34:15.929
look around that sort
of median position

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:21.239
for the actual position
that the data is giving.

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:24.750
So just to say--

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:28.230
let me-- let me summarize this.

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:34.040
The Kalman filter is a
significantly improved version

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.929
of recursive least squares.

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:38.270
That's recursive least squares.

00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:43.679
New measurement comes
in, changes things

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:48.270
but leaves a big part unchanged.

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:54.510
And you find that new x hat.

00:34:54.510 --> 00:35:02.520
With a Kalman filter, there's an
covariance matrix in the middle

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:03.360
here.

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.980
That's where
covariance matrices go.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:11.520
That's matrix covariance, or
inverse covariance, times that.

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:19.060
And oh, why don't we see the
covariances at the right time?

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:22.650
So maybe those minutes
that I've occupied

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:32.500
were just really to get you to
hear that name for the simplest

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:33.580
update.

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:38.510
And Kalman's name for
a more general update.

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:40.680
Done.

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.530
Oh, this is also to be done.

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:45.810
Where is-- yeah.

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:46.930
No-- up at the top.

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:53.800
I seem to be into the
applications here.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:58.270
I promised how to
discover the formula.

00:35:58.270 --> 00:35:59.320
Maybe I'll never know.

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:05.530
Because I'm really
more interested in,

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:06.650
what's it good for?

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:16.400
Use number one, now, I'm backing
up to the easy, easy question.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:23.645
Suppose I had-- and let me even
change the matrix to A here.

00:36:23.645 --> 00:36:27.680
It makes it more realistic.

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.350
I'm going to copy
that here, fully

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:34.040
on discovering the formula.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:37.880
For the moment,
let's just use it.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:56.360
So I suppose that Au
is b is solved for u.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:04.075
Now, now solve A plus--

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:14.470
or minus a rank-- let me do the
rank 1, A minus uv transpose b.

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:20.990
What's-- x.

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:24.080
This is the problem that I
really would like to solve.

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:28.360
Let me just be sure
I'm doing this right.

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:51.190
It's similar to what we had
in the Kalman situation.

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:54.490
Suppose I've solved one problem.

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:59.500
But now I perturb
the matrix by rank 1.

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:02.760
So I have a new problem
with a new answer.

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.550
And I want to get
that answer quickly.

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:05.050
Yeah?

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:07.300
AUDIENCE: Are the u's
related in those two lines?

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:08.650
GILBERT STRANG: Oh, no.

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:10.000
Thank you.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.560
Thank you very much.

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:18.175
Let's call this guy
z, or w, maybe w.

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.180
So thank you.

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:24.620
That's great.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:27.500
So that's what
I've solved for w.

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:33.520
In other words, I have
found A inverse b.

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:38.380
And I want to find the
answer to that new question.

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.310
So I've perturbed the matrix.

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:44.290
It's the coefficient
matrix in a linear system.

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:48.030
And I just want to solve
that linear system.

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:52.080
Now, so if I didn't know
anything about the formulas,

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:55.540
I would have a new matrix here.

00:38:55.540 --> 00:39:05.190
It would take n cube steps
to do elimination and get

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:07.920
the new answer.

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:12.820
But the point is to
use the old answer.

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:15.090
The point is to
use the old answer.

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:17.680
And now let me just
say what this is.

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:22.030
And it's problem
three in this section.

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:40.730
So in other words, we know
about A. We've solved that one.

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:44.607
So what I'm going to do, instead
of solving a whole new problem,

00:39:44.607 --> 00:39:45.190
I'm going to--

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:49.510
so quickly is the idea.

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:55.720
And here's the idea.

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:56.650
I've solved that one.

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:59.560
And I'm going to solve
a second problem,

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:06.190
also solve, A with
the same matrix A--

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:10.210
oops-- A times what
shall I call the unknown?

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:12.940
There's z equal u.

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:18.880
So this is my problem.

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.190
I know the u and v transpose.

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:25.360
But I don't really want to
find the inverse of this matrix

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.130
from scratch.

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:29.920
So the idea is
that if I suitably

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:33.790
combine the solutions
to the original problem,

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:37.120
the original solution
w, and the solution

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:43.240
to this problem with the new
guy u there, that somehow,

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:49.200
by combining the w and the z,
I'm going to get this answer x.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.130
That's where I'm headed.

00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:56.410
That's where I'm headed, that
by figuring out w and z-- so

00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:59.030
do you see what I've done?

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:01.355
With the matrix A, I've
solved two problems.

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:07.210
Does that take twice as long?

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:13.695
If I have the same matrix A but
different right-hand sides, b

00:41:13.695 --> 00:41:18.170
and u, if I factor A into
Lu, all the hard work

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:21.570
is done there on the left side.

00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:24.200
All the work is
done in finding Lu.

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:29.440
And then I just back substitute
to find the second solution.

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:33.315
This is so fundamental
that I'm emphasizing it,

00:41:33.315 --> 00:41:36.800
that if you have multiple
right-hand sides,

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:40.580
you don't every time go back
and work on the left side.

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:43.670
The left side with
the same matrix A,

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:45.560
just would do the same stuff.

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:49.070
The same rows and pivots
and all that stuff

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:53.620
will happen because it's the
same A. You just attach--

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:57.270
you really just stick
a second column--

00:41:57.270 --> 00:42:03.980
really, the fast way
to do it is A wz.

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:10.280
The two solutions come
from the b and the u.

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.920
I've just put the
two problems together

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:18.290
to emphasize that the
matrix A is the same.

00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:20.450
This is where most
of the work goes.

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:22.630
But it only goes there once.

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:24.260
That's the point.

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:28.060
Then finally, I'm supposed to--

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:30.160
the notes are
supposed to tell me

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:37.040
how to combine the two answers
w and z to get the answer x.

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.160
So let me write that down.

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:47.930
And that will be
use number one of

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:51.140
the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury
formula.

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:53.570
So I'm planning to
just write it down.

00:42:53.570 --> 00:43:00.620
According to this, step
two is the answer we want,

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:02.120
here written x--

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:05.600
so I haven't used the same
letters as in the notes--

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.660
is the original w--

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:12.590
good-- and then a change.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:16.490
Because I've
changed the problem.

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:18.770
So I'm going to
change the answer.

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:23.240
But the thing is,
to get this answer,

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:29.060
I have to divide by that
determinant wherever it was,

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:30.050
the--

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:34.826
oh, yeah, the--

00:43:34.826 --> 00:43:35.840
I'm sorry.

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:40.040
I'm using an A here, and I
haven't given you the formula

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:46.360
for A. So that'll have to wait.

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:52.240
So I'll put determinant here.

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:56.150
And Sherman, Morrison,
Woodbury figured that out.

00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:58.150
And then-- oh, I'm sorry.

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:05.210
We know what that is.

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:10.360
We want 1 minus v transpose z.

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:15.130
So it's the v from here,
1 minus v transpose.

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:17.290
And it's the z there.

00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:18.610
Oh, yeah.

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:20.740
This is good.

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:25.270
So I'm going to get a formula
that changes the solution

00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:30.880
w by a term that we recognize is
coming from Sherman, Morrison,

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:31.510
Woodbury.

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:36.480
And that term in the
numerator is a multiple of zx.

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:47.790
So I'm using w--

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:50.746
yes-- w times--

00:44:54.950 --> 00:45:01.830
sorry-- times x, which was--

00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:02.820
I'm sorry.

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:05.870
w is xv.

00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:08.620
So the v here, I'm just using--

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:15.930
the v is the same
v. So v transpose z,

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:18.030
I think that's got it.

00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:19.390
I think that's got it.

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:23.990
So again, the point was to--

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:27.380
x doesn't appear here, because
that's what I'm after--

00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:31.820
is to use the w and
the z, the w and the z.

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:36.740
And I have to use, of course,
the v. And I have to use the u.

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:40.020
And that got used here.

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:43.070
So everything that had
to be used got used.

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:44.840
And that was the answer.

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:51.860
So that's the basic
use, is, if I perturb

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:57.500
the problem, the
left-hand side, what's

00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:59.750
the change in the solution?

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:03.290
Over here with least
squares, it was the same.

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:05.460
I perturbed the left-hand side.

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:07.070
But because it
was least squares,

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:10.200
there was an A transpose
A to deal with.

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:13.130
So this was one
level more difficult,

00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:15.500
because it involved
A transpose A's.

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:21.220
And here, it was just
straightforward A. So, yes?

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:21.720
Thanks.

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:23.387
AUDIENCE: Would it
be also a good idea--

00:46:23.387 --> 00:46:29.040
so you have A minus uv transpose
x plus b-- to write A minus Az

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.992
b transpose x equals b?

00:46:30.992 --> 00:46:32.470
I'm backtracking on the left.

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:34.250
GILBERT STRANG: I could
probably do this other ways.

00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:34.650
Yeah.

00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:35.080
Yeah.

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:35.580
Yeah.

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:40.090
I hope you follow up on
that and write it down.

00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:48.640
So maybe what I've done is what
my goal was for today, first,

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:53.790
to show you the formula
for the inverse; second,

00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:58.470
to recognize that it has
interesting importance

00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:01.260
that a rank k
change in the matrix

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:05.910
brings a rank k change in the
inverse, and that we can--

00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:09.210
the formula says to
invert an n by n matrix,

00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:12.480
you can switch an
inverted k by k matrix.

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:15.610
And then I spoke about a
couple of the applications.

00:47:15.610 --> 00:47:17.220
So the only thing
I have not done

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:21.150
is to give you the full
Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury

00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:24.900
formula, the one with an A,
the one that's up on the right.

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:27.600
Can I do that finally?

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:30.210
You can probably guess
what it's going to be.

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:37.710
Where is-- there's got to
be one more blackboard.

00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:43.500
So here
Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury.

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.180
And what's the complete thing?

00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:49.050
It's A minus uv
transpose inverse.

00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:52.390
So this is n by n.

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:55.210
And it's an A now instead
of an identity matrix.

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:57.350
That's the difference.

00:47:57.350 --> 00:48:01.270
And this is n by k, k by n.

00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:04.150
So it's rank k perturbation.

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:10.880
And start me out on the formula.

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:13.260
What's the first
thing I have to write?

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:14.520
AUDIENCE: A inverse.

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:16.450
GILBERT STRANG: A inverse.

00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:18.680
So I start with A inverse.

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:20.770
And then I subtract something.

00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:26.380
And it's going to be a
copy of this, except--

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:29.860
well, maybe it's
just a perfect copy.

00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:33.280
Maybe I just need the u.

00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.170
I'm going from that left board.

00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:39.230
Now, Ik, what do
I put it in there?

00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:44.980
I am going to have to look.

00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:51.300
So we're writing down now
the formula, the full scale--

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:52.090
OK.

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:52.840
Oh, all right.

00:48:58.300 --> 00:48:59.840
Here it is.

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:03.800
There is an A inverse u.

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:06.800
Now comes that
whole thing inverted

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:12.770
that you'll expect, I minus
v transpose A inverse u,

00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:14.780
all inverse.

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:19.560
And then there's another two
pieces, v transpose A inverse.

00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:24.600
So I didn't look ahead to
get it at all on one line.

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.310
But do you see what--

00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:30.020
this is the-- oh, that's
probably-- is that--

00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:30.520
yeah.

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:32.460
That's the identity.

00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:35.220
Because we've got
enough A inverses.

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:39.900
I believe that's the final,
ultimate formula of life

00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:45.850
here, that we've
changed it by rank k.

00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:47.910
Here's the original inverse.

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:51.325
And presumably, this
is a rank k change.

00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:57.250
That will be a rank k change.

00:49:57.250 --> 00:50:03.100
And it only requires us to
compute that inverse, where

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:06.280
that's a k by k matrix.

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:13.990
Thank you for allowing this,
our 50 minutes of formulas.

00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:17.650
So that's really
what that comes to.

00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:23.710
So that's section 4.1 of the
notes with some applications.

00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:29.440
And we will move on to other
circumstances of low rank.

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:29.950
Good.

00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:31.820
Thank you.
