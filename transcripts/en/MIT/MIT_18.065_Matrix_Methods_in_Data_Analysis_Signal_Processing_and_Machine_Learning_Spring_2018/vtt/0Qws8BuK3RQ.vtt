00:00:22.218 --> 00:00:23.010
GILBERT STRANG: OK.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.070
Just as we're getting
started, I thought

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.450
I'd add a few words
about a question that

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.550
came up after class.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.710
Suppose, in that
discussion last time,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.430
where you were given three--

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.220
you were given a
distance matrix--

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.420
you were given the
distance between x1 and x2,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.630
between x2 and x3,
and between x1 and x3,

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.330
and you wanted to find
points that satisfied that.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.260
Well, we're going to
fail on this example,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.150
because if the distance here
is 1, the distance here is 1,

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.850
then by the triangle inequality,
the distance from x1 to x3

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.980
could not be more than 2.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.890
And when we square it, it
could not be more than 4.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.690
And here it's 6.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.800
So what's going to happen?

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.060
What goes wrong in that case?

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.560
Yeah.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.660
I hadn't commented on
that, and I'm not sure

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:38.460
that the paper that
I referenced does so.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.760
So I had to do a little
search back in the literature,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.430
because people couldn't
overlook this problem.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:52.230
So this is the triangle
inequality fails.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.670
And it's not going to help
to go into 10 dimensions,

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.700
because the triangle
inequalities doesn't change.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.900
And it's still there
in 10 dimensions.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.170
And we're still failing.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.160
So what happens?

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.410
Well, what could happen?

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.250
Do you remember?

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.360
And you'll have to remind
me, the key equation.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:29.680
You remember, we had an
equation connecting the--

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.500
so what is the matrix
D for this problem?

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.410
So D is-- this is
a 3 by 3 matrix

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.630
with these distances squared.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.150
And it was convenient
to use distances

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.340
squared, because that's what
comes into the next steps.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.450
So of course, the distance
from each x to itself is zero.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.970
The distance from x
distance squared was that.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.980
This one was that.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.630
But this one is 6.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.260
OK.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.570
So that's the distance matrix.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.030
And we would like to find--

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.430
the job was to find--

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:20.360
and I'm just going to write
down, we cannot find x1, x2,

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.760
and x3 to match those distances.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.650
So what goes wrong?

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.320
Well, there's only one
thing that could go wrong.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.720
When you connect this distance
matrix D to the matrix X

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.780
transpose X-- you remember
the position matrix--

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.210
maybe I called it G?

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:51.720
This is giving-- so Gij is
the dot product of xi with xj.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.270
Make that into a j.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.960
Thank you.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.340
So Gij is the matrix
of dot product.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:15.070
And the great thing was that we
can discover what that matrix--

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.320
that matrix G comes
directly from D--

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.820
comes directly from
D. And of course,

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.950
what do we know about this
matrix of cross products?

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.779
We know that is
positive semidefinite.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.270
So what goes wrong?

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.250
Well, just in a word, when
we write out that equation

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.690
and discover what G is, if
the triangle inequality fails,

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.650
we learn that G doesn't
come out positive definite.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.760
That's really all I want to say.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.670
And I could push
through the example.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.820
G will not come out
positive definite if D--

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.110
if that's D because it can't.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.420
If it came out
positive definite,

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.350
then we could find an X.
So if we had the G, then

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.140
the final step, you
remember, is to find

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.360
an X. Well we know that if
G is positive semidefinite,

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.970
there are multiple
ways to find an X.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.320
This is positive semidefinite
matrices is what you get out

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.420
of X transpose X's.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.160
And we can find an x given a
G. We can find G given an x.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:48.390
So it has to be that
this won't be true--

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.580
that the matrix G that
comes out of that equation

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.370
will turn out not to
be positive definite.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.350
So it's really quite nice.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.290
It's a beautiful little
bit of mathematics,

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:04.270
that if, and only if,
the triangle inequality

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.140
is satisfied by these numbers--

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.730
if and only if--

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.300
then the matrix
in the D matrix--

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.300
then the G matrix that
comes out of this equation--

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.730
which I haven't written--

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.360
is positive semidefinite.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.160
If the triangle inequality is
OK, we can find the points.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.600
If the triangle inequality
is violated-- like here--

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.260
then the matrix G is not
positive semidefinite,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.070
has negative eigenvalues,
and we cannot find the point.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.060
Yeah.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.120
I could recall
the G matrix but--

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:54.000
the G equation, but it's coming
to you in the two page section

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.250
that does distance matrices.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:00.480
OK.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:06.740
That's just-- I should
have made a point.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.000
It's nice to have
specific numbers.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.820
And I could get the
specific numbers for G,

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.380
and we would see, no way.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.960
It's not positive definite.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.840
OK.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.990
So that's just
tidying up last time.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.670
I have another small
problem to talk about,

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:29.610
and then a big question of
whether deep learning actually

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:30.510
works.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.600
I had an email from
an expert last night,

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:39.930
which changed my view of the
world about that question,

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.390
as you can imagine.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:49.170
The change in my world was, I
had thought the answer was yes,

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:52.140
and I now think
the answer is no.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:56.820
So that's like rather
a big issue for 18.065.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.095
But we'll-- let's
see about that later.

00:07:59.095 --> 00:07:59.595
OK.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.380
Now Procrustes' problem.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:10.920
So Procrustes-- and it's
included in the notes--

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.930
that name comes
from a Greek myth.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.800
Are you guys into Greek myths?

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.102
So what was the
story of Procrustes?

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:30.540
Was it Procrustes who
adjusted the length of his--

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.179
so he had a special bed.

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:36.850
Procrustes' bed--
certain length.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.950
And then, he had
visitors coming.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:42.730
And instead of adjusting
the length of the bed

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:47.380
to fit the visitor,
Procrustes adjusted the length

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.350
of the visitor to fit the bed.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:55.330
So either stretched the
visitor or chopped off

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:56.290
part of the visitor.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:09:01.380
So anyway-- the Greeks
like this sort of thing.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.050
OK.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:06.970
So anyway, that's a
Greek myth for 18.065.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:07.750
OK.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:12.340
So the whole idea, the
Procrustes problem,

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.860
is to make something
fit something else.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.165
So the two things are--

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.360
so suppose I'm just
in three dimensions

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.140
and I have two vectors here.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.780
So I have a basis for a
two dimensional space.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:34.905
And over here I have--

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:44.880
people-- space scientists
might have one computation

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.150
of the positions of satellites.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.480
Then, of course, they
wouldn't be off by as much

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.070
as this figure shows.

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:55.830
But then they have
another computation

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:58.170
using different coordinates.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:03.400
So it partly rotated
from this picture,

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.230
but also it's partly got
round off errors and error

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.000
in it between the two.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.160
So the question is, what's the
best orthogonal transformation?

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:22.100
So this is a bunch of vectors,
x1, x2, to xn, let's say.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.460
And I want to modify them
by an orthogonal matrix--

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.260
maybe I'd do it
on the other side.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.010
I think I do.

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:29.510
Yeah.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:41.340
Q, to be as close as possible
to this other set, y1,

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.640
y2 up to yn.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.330
So let me just say it again.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.100
I have two sets of vectors.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.430
And I'm looking, and they're
different-- like those two

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.390
sets.

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:58.060
And I'm looking for the
orthogonality matrix

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:02.490
that, as well as possible,
takes this set into this one.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:06.150
Of course, if this was
an orthogonal basis,

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.760
and this was an
orthogonal basis, then

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.910
we would be home free.

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.590
Q-- we could get equality.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.800
We could take an
orthogonal basis directly

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.390
into an orthogonal basis
with a orthogonal matrix Q.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:24.240
In other words, if x was
an orthogonal matrix,

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.640
and y was an
orthogonal matrix, we

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:34.010
would get the exact correct
Q. But that's not the case.

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:35.900
So we're looking for
the best possible.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.010
So that's the problem there--

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:46.610
minimize over
orthogonal matrix--

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:50.870
matrices Q. And I just
want to get my notation

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:52.220
to be consistent here.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:55.450
OK.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:04.980
So I've-- I see that starting
with the y's and mapping them

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.200
to x's--

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.790
so let me ask the question.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:15.810
What orthogonal matrix Q
multiplies the y's to come

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.270
as close as possible to the x's?

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:22.740
So over all
orthogonal Q's I want

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:30.420
to minimize YQ minus X
in the Frobenius norm.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:33.100
And I might as well square it.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:37.560
So Frobenius-- we're
into the Frobenius norm.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.120
Remember the-- of a matrix?

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:50.930
This is a very convenient
norm in data science,

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:52.700
to measure the size of a matrix.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.030
And we have several
possible formulas for it.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:13:02.900
So let me call the matrix A.
And the Frobenius norm squared--

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.570
so what's one
expression, in terms

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.350
of the entries of the matrix--

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.470
the numbers Aij in the matrix?

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:16.370
The Frobenius norm just
treats it like a long vector.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:20.300
So it's a11 squared,
plus a12 squared,

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:27.440
of all the way along the
first plus second row, just--

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.460
I'll say nn squared.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.650
OK.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:39.730
Sum of all the squares--

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:42.370
just treating it
like a long vector.

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:43.450
OK.

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:47.860
This-- but that's a awkward
expression to write down.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.900
So what other ways
do we have to find

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:56.485
the Frobenius norm of a matrix?

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:01.030
Let's see.

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:08.560
I could look at this as A
transpose A. Is that right?

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:13.870
A transpose A. So what
what's happening there?

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:19.690
Remind me what-- yeah.

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:21.400
I would get all that.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:28.750
I would get all these by taking
the matrix A transpose times

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:31.200
A. But what--

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:31.700
sorry.

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:38.110
I'm not-- I haven't--

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:44.060
I've lost my thread
of talk here.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.960
So here's-- oh, and then I
take the trace, of course.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.320
So that first row--

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:58.250
first column of A times
that one will give me the--

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:00.650
one set of squares.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:03.950
And then, that one times
the other, and the next one,

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:07.310
will give me the next
set of squares, right?

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:08.870
So this is going to--

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.490
if I look at the trace--

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:13.350
so now, let me.

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:17.090
So I just want to look
at the diagonal here.

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:20.240
So it's the trace.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.950
You remember, the
trace of a matrix--

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:30.220
of a matrix M is the sum
down the diagonal M11,

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:34.430
M22, down to Mnn.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:38.800
It's the diagonal sum.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.880
And-- everybody
with me here now?

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.600
So that term on the diagonal--

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.860
A transpose A--
gives me all of that.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:16:00.020
Then-- or maybe I should
be doing AA transpose.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.520
The point is, it doesn't matter.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:06.700
Or the trace of AA transpose.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:12.020
That would be-- those would
both give the correct Frobenius

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:12.665
norm squared.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:20.010
So traces are going to come
into this little problem.

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:22.560
Now there's another formula
for the Frobenius norm--

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.180
even shorter--

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.940
well, certainly
shorter than this one--

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.800
involving a sum of squares.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.380
And what's that one?

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:36.170
What's the other way
to get the same answer?

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.760
If I look at the SVD--

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.070
look at singular values.

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:46.040
I think that this is also
equal to the sum square of all

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:46.895
the singular values.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:59.140
So it's three nice expressions
for the Frobenius norm.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:03.190
The nice ones involve A
transpose A, or AA transpose.

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:06.089
And of course, that connects
to the singular values,

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:09.390
because what are-- what's the
connection between singular

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:10.800
values and those--

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.089
and these guys--

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:15.069
A transpose A, or AA transpose?

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:19.140
The singular values are the--

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:23.606
or the singular values
squared are the--

00:17:23.606 --> 00:17:24.560
AUDIENCE: Eigenvalues.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.020
GILBERT STRANG: Eigenvalues
of A transpose A.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:30.110
And then when I
add up the trace,

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:34.370
I'm adding up the
eigenvalues and that's the--

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:39.080
that gives me the
Frobenius norm squared.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:39.940
So this is a--

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:46.370
that tells us
something important,

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:49.870
which we can see in
different ways, that the--

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:52.640
so to solve this
problem, we're going

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:59.410
to need various facts, like
the QA in the Frobenius norm

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:03.200
is the same as A in
the Frobenius norm.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.480
Why is that?

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:05.980
Why?

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.290
So here I'm multiplying
every column

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:18.840
by the matrix Q. What happens
to the length of the column

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.210
when I multiply it by q?

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:21.377
AUDIENCE: It doesn't change.

00:18:21.377 --> 00:18:22.700
GILBERT STRANG: Doesn't change.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:26.450
So I could add up the length
of the columns all squared.

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:29.130
Here I wrote it
in terms of rows.

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:33.530
But I could have reordered that,
and got it in terms of columns.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:44.420
That's because the length of
Q times any vector squared

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:48.890
is the same as the
vector squared.

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:56.600
And these-- take these
to be the columns of A.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:01.500
So for column by column,
the multiplication by Q

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.480
doesn't change the length.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:07.800
And then when I add up
all the columns squared,

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.860
I get the Frobenius
norm squared.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.440
And another way to say it--

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:17.070
let's make that connection
between this fact--

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:20.460
that Q didn't change
the Frobenius norm--

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:24.240
and this fact, that the
Frobenius norm is expressed

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.580
in terms of the sigmas.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:30.520
So what does Q do to the sigmas?

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:35.260
I want to see in another
way the answer to why.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:38.590
So if I have a matrix
A with singular values,

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.000
I multiply by Q--

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.832
what happens to the
singular values?

00:19:42.832 --> 00:19:43.790
AUDIENCE: Don't change.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:45.140
GILBERT STRANG: Don't change.

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.010
Don't change.

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:49.760
That's the key point
about singular values.

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:57.530
If I multiply-- so A has a
SVD, U sigma V transpose.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:04.800
And QA will have the SVD
QU sigma V transpose.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.160
So all I've changed
when I multiply by Q--

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:10.670
all I changed was
the first factor--

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:14.930
the first orthogonal
factor in the SVD.

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:17.190
I didn't change the sigmas.

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:19.130
They're still sitting there.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:22.220
So-- and of course, I could
do also A on the other side--

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:25.970
different Q. Same Q or a
different Q on the other side

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:29.360
would show up here, and
would not change the sigmas,

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.420
and therefore would not
change the Frobenius norm.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:36.590
So these are
important properties

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.480
of this Frobenius norm.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:44.240
It's a-- it looks messy to
write down in that form,

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:49.480
but it's much nicer in these
forms and in that form.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.860
OK.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.310
So now, if I can just--

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:58.370
then we saw that
it involves traces.

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:02.345
So let me make a few
observations about traces.

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:15.090
So I'll just-- we want to
be able to play with traces,

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:18.310
and that's something
we really haven't done.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:24.450
Here's a fact-- that the
trace of A transpose B

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:33.210
is equal to the trace
of B transpose A.

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:38.700
Of course, if B
is A, it's clear,

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:45.120
and it's equal to the
trace of BA transpose.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.340
So even do little
changes in your matrix

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.530
without changing the trace.

00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:59.900
Let's see why one
of these is true.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.420
Why is that first
statement true?

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:13.166
How is that matrix
related to this matrix?

00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:14.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] transpose.

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:16.940
GILBERT STRANG: It's
just a transpose.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.730
If I take the transpose of
that matrix, I get that.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:22.120
So what happens to the trace?

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.760
I'm adding down the diagonal.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.300
The transpose has no effect.

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:32.840
Clearly, this is just a fact
that the trace doesn't change--

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.780
is not changed when
you transpose a matrix,

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:38.060
because the diagonal
is not changed.

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:41.060
Now what about this guy?

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:44.210
I guess we're getting back
to old fashioned 18.065,

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:47.390
remembering facts
about linear algebra,

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:49.580
because this is a
pure linear algebra.

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:51.170
So what's this one about?

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:55.570
This says that I can reverse
the order of two matrices.

00:22:55.570 --> 00:23:00.510
So I'm now looking at the
connection between those two.

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:05.870
And so let me just-- to
use different letters--

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:11.560
CD equals the trace of DC.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.540
I can flip the order.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.130
That's all I've done here is.

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:18.980
I've reversed B
with A transpose.

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:23.450
I reversed C with D.
So why is that true?

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:24.800
Why is that true?

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:33.100
Well, how shall we see
the truth of that fact?

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.560
So these are really
convenient facts,

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:40.180
that make a lot of people use
the trace more often than we

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:41.770
have in 18.065.

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:45.910
I'm not a big user of
arguments based on trace,

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:52.430
but these are identities that go
a long way with many problems.

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:55.850
So let's see why that's true.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:57.640
Any time you think
about trace, you've

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:01.090
got two languages to use.

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:02.680
You can use the eigenvalues.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.320
It's the sum of the eigenvalues.

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.480
Or you can use the
diagonal entries,

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.760
because it's the sum of
the diagonal entries.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.980
Let's use eigenvalues.

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.740
How are the eigenvalues
of CD related

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:17.550
to the eigenvalues of DC?

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:19.800
They're the same.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.720
If these matrices
are rectangular,

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.240
then there might be some
extra zero eigenvalues,

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.880
because they would
have different shapes.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.060
But zeros are not going
to affect the trace.

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:35.590
So this is the same
nonzero eigenvalues.

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:43.730
OK.

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:44.990
And so on.

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.960
Yeah.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:46.910
OK.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:54.930
Let me just-- let me try
to tell you the steps

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:59.770
now to get the correct Q. And
let me tell you the answer

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:00.270
first.

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:11.240
And I'm realizing that all
important question four--

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.030
does deep learning
actually work?

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:15.740
We're going to run
out of time today,

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.170
because we only have
a few minutes left.

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:21.320
I suggest we bring
that question back up,

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:26.870
because it's pretty
important to a lot of people.

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:32.270
There's-- I had lunch with
Professor Edelman, and he said,

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:37.160
you know, deep learning and
neural nets have had a record

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:44.390
amount of publicity and hype
for sort of computational

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:45.830
algorithm.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:49.950
And-- but I had--

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:55.860
I've had people now tell
me that typical first--

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:59.300
if you create a network--

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:04.690
using Alex's design,
for example--

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:09.590
the chances are that it
won't be successful--

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:15.620
that the successful networks
have been worked on,

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:17.310
and experimented with.

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:22.220
And a good structure has
emerged, but didn't--

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.520
wasn't there at the start.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:27.350
So I think that's
a topic for Monday.

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:31.370
And I'm really just
realizing, from talking

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:37.190
to people in the field, that
it's by no means automatic.

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:42.840
That structure-- even if you
put in a whole bunch of layers--

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.350
it may not be what you want.

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:46.160
OK.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:50.790
So I'm-- let me finish
this argument today.

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:52.310
Let me give you the answer.

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:54.140
So what's the good Q?

00:26:54.140 --> 00:27:04.140
I have matrices Y and X. And
the idea is that I take it--

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:07.310
I look at Y transpose
X. So that'll

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:10.370
be all the dot products
of one set of vectors

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:11.630
or the other set of vectors.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:12.860
That's a matrix.

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:14.470
And I do its SVD--

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:16.520
U sigma V transpose.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:21.450
So multiply this.

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:27.840
Multiply Y-- the two
bases that you're given.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.650
Of course, if Y
was the same as X--

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:32.750
if it was an orthogonal basis--

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:36.050
you'd have the
identity, no questions.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:37.970
But generally, we have--

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:39.980
it has an SVD.

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:44.840
And we're looking for
a orthogonal matrix

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:49.055
of the best Q is--

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:52.510
Da dun da duh.

00:27:52.510 --> 00:28:01.830
I mean, it's the right time
for expressions of amazement.

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:03.690
It is UV transpose.

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:08.130
OK.

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:12.270
So that gives us the answer.

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:17.140
We're given X and Y. We're
looking for the best Q.

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:21.280
And the answer comes in
the simplest possible way.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.880
Compute Y transpose
X. Compute its SVD,

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:29.340
and use the orthogonal
matrices from the SVD.

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:29.840
Yeah.

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:33.590
And I'm out of time so proof--

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:41.520
it's [INAUDIBLE] line later--

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.180
either to just send
you the section online,

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:47.430
or to discuss it
in class Monday.

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:53.730
But I'm really planning Monday
to start with question 4.

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:56.910
And meanwhile to ask a
whole lot of people--

00:28:56.910 --> 00:29:00.810
everybody I can find--

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:04.560
about that important
question, is--

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.550
does deep learning usually work?

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:09.375
How-- what can you do
to make sure it works,

00:29:09.375 --> 00:29:13.080
or give yourself a better
chance to have it work?

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.560
So let's-- that's
up for Monday then.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.110
Good.
