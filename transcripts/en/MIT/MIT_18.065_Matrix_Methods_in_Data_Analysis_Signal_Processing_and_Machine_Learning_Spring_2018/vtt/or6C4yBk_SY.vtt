00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.680
PROFESSOR: So, are
we ready to go?

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.810
Any questions on 18065?

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.540
So it will be, as I said before,
a mixture of linear algebra

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:42.430
and math questions, along with
online using the material.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.240
OK.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.890
So I'm, in this
first week or two,

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.880
reviewing the highlights
of linear algebra.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:59.240
And I've reached this
point, to remember--

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.560
well, so we--

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:07.430
I just said two words
about multiplying matrices

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.770
by using column times
row as a way to do it.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.040
And now, I want
to illustrate that

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.480
by the five key
factorizations of matrices.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.320
OK.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.620
So what are they?

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.070
And do you recognize them?

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.780
Everybody uses those letters.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.710
In fact, some of those
letters, like LU or QR,

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.450
would be the most used MATLAB
commands in linear algebra.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.020
So a A equal LU of, maybe--

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.360
say something I'll
develop today--

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.310
but it's about elimination.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.300
Solving linear systems.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.080
So that's always the start
of a linear algebra course.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.260
But it will go fast here.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.510
I just want to show
you a different way

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.289
they get to L times
U-- lower triangular

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.450
times upper triangular.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.880
Probably you've seen that--

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.610
those triangular matrices.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.330
So do you know what QR is?

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.482
What's QR about?

00:02:21.482 --> 00:02:23.300
AUDIENCE: Least squares?

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.462
PROFESSOR: Least squares
is the big application,

00:02:26.462 --> 00:02:28.110
the factorization.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.335
So what kind of a matrix
gets that letter Q?

00:02:31.335 --> 00:02:32.210
AUDIENCE: Orthogonal?

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.127
PROFESSOR: Orthogonal.

00:02:33.127 --> 00:02:35.190
The columns are orthogonal.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.220
Often orthonormal.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.320
So orthogonal means they're
perpendicular to each other.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.090
And orthonormal means
they're unit vectors.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:52.710
So that is-- so Q often
represents a matrix

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.830
with orthonormal columns.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.950
So you-- we could
say Gram-Schmidt,

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:06.300
if you want to remember
a couple of old timers

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:13.440
whose algorithm
produces Q and R.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.640
How about this one?

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.360
This is really a
central one in math--

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.750
pure math, applied math,
everywhere-- applications.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.030
So S stands for symmetric.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.970
So this is a special
factorization

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.340
for symmetric matrices.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.020
And you can see
that it's symmetric.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.460
This lambda is the diagonal
eigenvalue matrix--

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.850
always lambda for eigenvalues.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.010
Q is like that Q--

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.220
different Q, of course.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.920
That Q you can find
just straight forward

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.690
from Gram-Schmidt.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.110
This Q has the eigenvectors.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.630
So you don't find eigenvectors
without some extra work.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.130
OK.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.270
So that's eigenvectors.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.770
Yeah.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.380
So that would be
worth expanding.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.670
So here are the eigenvectors
of the matrix S--

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.340
n of them, normalized.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.540
Here are the eigenvalues
lambda 1 to lambda n.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.170
And here are the
eigenvectors now transposed.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.170
So remind me of the
great fact about--

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.560
two facts, I guess-- one
fact about the eigenvalues

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.570
and one fact about eigenvectors.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:41.650
This is an important fact
statement in linear algebra.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.120
What do we know about
the eigenvectors?

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.780
Oh well, I guess
I've given it away.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.310
The eigenvectors are orthogonal.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.230
That's very important.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.310
Makes some matrices-- well,
they're beautiful matrices.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.110
They're the kings
of linear algebra.

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.320
Qs are the queens,
in my opinion.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.210
Orthogonal matrices
are the queens,

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.270
and symmetric matrices
are the kings.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:12.630
So these are orthonormal
eigenvectors.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.400
And the key point--

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.860
an important point
that's implicit

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.140
here-- is, there are n of them.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.430
There is a complete set.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.280
The matrix can be diagonalized.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.050
And those-- well, what's
special about the eigenvalues?

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.250
Other matrices could be
Q lambda Q transpose.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.730
But symmetric matrices
are something additional

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:36.375
about lambda.

00:05:36.375 --> 00:05:37.500
AUDIENCE: They're all real?

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.330
PROFESSOR: They're all real.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.530
So eigenvalues are real.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.330
And eigenvectors
are orthonormal--

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.150
can be chosen orthonormal--
can be chosen,

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.380
I guess I have to say.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.040
OK.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.610
Good.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:51.110
Good.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.630
Good.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.960
Oh, now maybe I'll
use that as an example

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.340
of matrix multiplication.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.160
So let me just do that here.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.350
Simple matrix multiplication,
but it makes the point.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.100
So Q lambda Q transpose.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:11.950
OK.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.730
Well, what was my point
about matrix multiplication?

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:20.140
Let me-- it really
involved two matrices.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.800
Here, I unfortunately
have three.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.240
So I'm going to have to squeeze
lambda in with one of the Qs,

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.840
to see it nicely
as two matrices.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.560
Shall I just do that?

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.050
Yeah.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.880
Now I've made it two matrices.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.350
That was easy.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:36.160
OK.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.590
Now what's the rule?

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.000
In the first notes, this
was A and this was B.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.100
And when you multiply
two matrices,

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:54.430
the rule is, this is
columns of Q lambda times

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:59.610
rows of Q transpose.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.060
I'm multiplying columns by rows.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.330
And so it's a column
vector times a row vector,

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.820
and that gives us a matrix.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.450
So each-- and it's
a special matrix.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.750
So this is our column.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.330
This is a row.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:22.510
And when I multiply n by 1 times
1 by n, I get an n by n matrix.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.340
And it's pretty special.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.250
And what is the
special fact about I'm

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.530
sort of recalling
from last time.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.890
What's special about
a column times a row?

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.630
It's rank is special.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.440
It's rank is 1.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:42.910
It's column space-- well, the
only column around is this one.

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:46.630
So all columns are
multiples of this guy.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:50.410
All rows are
multiples of this guy,

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.450
as we could see from an example.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.160
Shall I just do an example?

00:07:54.160 --> 00:08:00.490
1, 2 times 3, 4, to
take a random example.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:05.020
So that would give
us 3, 4, 6, 8.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:10.630
And sure enough, the columns
are multiples of 1, 2.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.270
The rows are multiples of 3, 4.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.610
And the rank is 1.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:17.110
OK.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.360
So those are the
building blocks.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.850
Now I want to build something.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:22.720
So here we go.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.310
So this is a sum of rank 1.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:33.100
Sum of rank 1.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.970
Sum of column times row.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:40.210
So I take column 1 times row 1.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.460
That's my first
thing in the sum.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:43.840
So column 1 of that.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.000
So you see I had
to sneak the lambda

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.660
to have just two factors.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.840
So what's column 1 of Q lambda?

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.830
That's a good question.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:59.080
So column 1 of Q is Q1--

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.120
the first eigenvector.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.400
But now, I am multiplying
by this diagonal matrix.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.360
Do you see in your mind what's
the first column of Q lambda?

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:15.290
Just think about that a second.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:23.200
So here's-- we can steal any
little corner for a matrix.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.910
So here's q1, and the
rest of the columns.

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:31.210
And then here is lambda 1.

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:32.440
And that's Q lambda.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.600
So I'm putting those together.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.480
And I'm asking, what's the
first column of the answer?

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.510
Can you see how that works?

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:42.880
AUDIENCE: q1 lambda 1?

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:43.983
PROFESSOR: It's... sorry?.

00:09:43.983 --> 00:09:44.900
AUDIENCE: q1 lambda 1?

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:45.940
PROFESSOR: q1 lambda 1.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:46.900
Exactly.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.660
That lambda 1 will multiply q1.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.250
These other lambdas
multiplied later columns.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:54.980
So the first column
is lambda 1 times q1.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:55.480
Right.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.880
So it's the first
guy, lambda 1, q1.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:06.820
And then the first row of
this will be q1 transpose.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:11.770
That's the first guy
in our sum of n things.

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:14.710
And let me put the next
one and the last one.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:20.200
Lambda 2, q2, q2 transpose.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:25.960
And lambda n, qn, qn transpose.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:33.320
That's really a nice
right way to write

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:39.300
to breakup the product,
q lambda q transpose.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.650
This is called the
spectral theorem.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:47.700
So that's the symmetric-- that's
S. That's S there, is that.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:53.370
So that's-- we've broken
up S into rank 1 pieces.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:57.750
That's like a constant theme.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.290
And these rank 1 pieces are
quite special because they're

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:02.700
symmetric.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.790
Q1q1 transpose
will be symmetric.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.780
And oh, so can we--

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:14.280
so let's just-- I follow the
rule for multiplying matrices.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:19.350
But maybe I could just check
that it's the right thing--

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.350
that it came out right.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:23.940
So what do I mean by checking?

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:28.350
I guess I'll just
check about S times q1.

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:33.810
So look at S--

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:38.760
this thing-- times the first
eigenvector, and what do I get?

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.990
OK.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:43.170
So you'll like this.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:47.400
I've split up S into a
sum of rank 1 pieces.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.870
And that splitting is--

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:52.620
you see it all over.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:56.370
It's really showing you what the
pieces of the symmetric matrix

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:57.150
are.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.010
And now I'm just going
to check that that's

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:04.530
a correct formula for S,
so I'll multiply it by q1.

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.780
And I'm hoping to
get the right thing.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.790
And what do I actually get?

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:14.160
If I multiply this
whole business times q1,

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:20.310
I get lambda 1,
q1, q1 transpose--

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:23.400
that's the first
guy times my q1--

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.980
plus-- right?

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:31.260
I'm multiplying S by q1, and
this first term gave me that.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.010
And what does the
next term give me?

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:37.010
Put me out of my misery here.

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:40.310
I'm looking for this thing
to simplify like mad.

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.830
OK.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.150
So what's the second term?

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:47.833
When I multiply this guy
by q1, what do I get?

00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:48.760
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.470
PROFESSOR: Zero.

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:50.580
That's right.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.000
That's what we want.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.640
And when I multiply
the last guy by q1,

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:01.090
I get zero, because
the qs are orthogonal.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.060
So this is all I get.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.790
And then-- so, I don't
need this plus anymore.

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.020
That's it.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:10.290
And then what can
I do to improve

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:18.060
that little somewhat repetitive
formula for the answer?

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.920
What do I want to do finally?

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.430
I want to remember that
the qs are normalized.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.090
They're unit vectors.

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:26.652
So what does that tell me here?

00:13:26.652 --> 00:13:27.610
AUDIENCE: Q1 transpose.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:30.180
PROFESSOR: Q1
transpose times q1.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:34.170
This is just 1.

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:38.210
It's-- that's what
normalized means--

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:41.630
that the length
squared is the length--

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:44.880
the length of the
vector squared.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.900
And it's 1.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.750
So I can cancel that term.

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.370
And I'm getting
the right answer.

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:53.850
That's all-- that's
all this was about.

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:59.600
I was just checking and wanted
to see how it would fall out.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:05.100
And it falls right
out that this formula

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.250
is the correct matrix
S, because it's

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:11.210
got the right eigenvectors, qs.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:13.460
And it's got the right
eigenvalues lambdas.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:18.390
So it's gotta be the right
matrix S. Is that OK?

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:24.830
That's like a first
example to see how this--

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:31.680
splitting into rank 1s--

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.400
gives you back what you
expect easily enough.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.200
It gives you the
information you expect.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:38.700
OK.

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:43.940
So that's the symmetric
eigenvalue picture

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:45.470
for symmetric matrices.

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.360
And we'll see it again.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:54.410
It's-- well, all five of
these are big, are important.

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:56.660
I don't know if
you know this one,

00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:02.090
but it's going to be a
foundational factorization

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:05.220
for this course and for
all of data science.

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.130
Do you know its name?

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.920
So, what does it
mean, first of all?

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.950
Just a comment on
this, and then we'll

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:15.450
save it for a couple of weeks.

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:19.130
So this view is actually
an orthogonal matrix.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:23.870
And so is V. So it has
two orthogonal matrices.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:27.230
So that's why people
call them U and V

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:33.470
rather than Q1 and Q2, which
was too much to get subscript.

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:37.210
So orthogonal times
diagonal times orthogonal.

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:45.880
And we'd say, orthogonal,
diagonal, orthogonal.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:51.860
And 18.06 would, as of
now, reach this topic

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.710
because it's jumped
up in importance.

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:55.640
And it's called?

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.265
AUDIENCE: Singular
value decomposition.

00:15:57.265 --> 00:16:00.210
PROFESSOR: Singular
value decomposition.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:04.910
Well, those are long words, so
everybody calls it the SVD--

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:07.470
the singular value
decomposition.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:15.210
The point is it works
for every matrix--

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:16.650
rectangular matrices.

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:18.690
There's no issue
of, does it have

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:21.630
enough eigenvectors or not?

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:23.730
That's an issue here.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.320
Well, it's an issue here.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:29.910
Not every matrix has got enough
eigenvectors to make that work.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:35.820
Every matrix that one
works because instead

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:39.780
of one set of
vectors it's got two

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:45.330
matrices-- two different
sets of singular vectors.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:47.470
Oh, we'll see that.

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.900
That's important.

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:51.420
OK.

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:55.490
So that's really
a quick overview

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:59.210
of fundamental factorizations.

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:03.970
And I'd like to say just
another word about elimination,

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:09.540
A equal LU, and then
we'll leave it alone.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.609
So elimination.

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:12.109
Yeah.

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:20.079
Do you remember that first
beginning of linear algebra,

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:22.290
when you're solving ax equal b?

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:24.460
You do these row operations.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:28.990
Can I just-- what I want to say
is, all those row operations

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:35.330
that you do are perfectly
expressed by L times U.

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:40.000
And so that's a
key point in 18.06,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.670
but I have a different
way to look at it.

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:44.170
So that's what I
wanted to show you.

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:45.050
I have a--

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:51.430
I want to show you a sum of
rank 1's, or row times column.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:53.020
It fits in today.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:18:02.230
So I'd just like to see, why
does a matrix invertible--

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:05.780
this is a square
matrix, now invertible.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:11.260
And it factors-- if all
goes well with elimination

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.270
and the pivots are non-zero--

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:17.140
it factors into lower triangular
times upper triangular.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.260
So that's a key step that is--

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.500
that MATLAB would
do with a lu of A--

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:24.970
would produce those two factors.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.890
Now I want to do them
in a column times row

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:39.760
way, which I just realized
late, was a neat way to do it.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:47.850
So can I take a matrix
and do elimination?

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:51.690
How big a matrix shall I take?

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:55.140
2 by 2 [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:59.250
3 by 3 Somebody's not
convinced totally by 2 by 2

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.860
Let me do it 2 by 2 and then
if you want-- if you really

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:05.140
want a 3 by 3 do it.

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:05.640
OK.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:11.930
Here's 2 by 2 2, 4, 3, 7.

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:13.760
How's that?

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:14.260
OK.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:18.650
So what is-- yeah.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:23.900
So let's remember
what elimination does.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:31.430
It subtracts a multiple
of that row from that one,

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:34.420
to get to 2, 3.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:35.780
And the multiple is 2.

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.910
So it knocks out the 4.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:39.140
Two 3's are 6.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.820
So it leaves a 1.

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.590
And we're-- oh, yeah.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.930
Thanks for allowing
me to do 2 by 2.

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:46.520
I've already done it now.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:50.720
I've reached U. So
here's A. And here's U--

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.290
the upper triangular guy with
the pivots on the diagonal.

00:19:56.810 --> 00:20:01.920
And then the
question is, express

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.910
that step in matrix language.

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:10.440
And the right answer is l
times U. So the right answer

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:14.970
is that this A is--

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:18.660
so I'll just erase
that letter U--

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:23.430
is l times U. So what is l?

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:26.130
L is the lower triangular guy.

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:31.470
And it has there the
number that you used here.

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:32.490
And what was that?

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:35.790
I subtracted 2 of
that row from this.

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:37.450
So I want a 2 there.

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:46.170
So that would be--

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.090
I would call that a multiplier.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.850
I multiplied row 1 by 2.

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:53.280
Subtracted to get that 0.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:57.410
And for a 2 by 2
example, I was finished.

00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:57.910
OK.

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:00.810
Now I want to see this--

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:02.770
so there is l times
U. It happened.

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:04.770
Right.

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:10.470
I would like to see how l
times U comes out of this row--

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:12.590
column times row.

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:14.370
So let me start--

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:15.980
let me think again.

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:23.490
So really the point
of elimination--

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:26.220
why did we do this
in the first place?

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:30.313
Because here we had
two coupled equations.

00:21:30.313 --> 00:21:31.480
There were coupled together.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.660
We couldn't solve
them instantly.

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:38.250
That step of elimination
reduced me to--

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:39.840
down here in this corner--

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:44.820
one equation, that I've
eliminated the first unknown x

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.440
from the second equation.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:52.140
So the second equation is 0x
plus 1y equal right hand side.

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:54.800
And I solve it immediately.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:55.800
OK.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:01.680
So how did I get to
that 1 by 1 problem,

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.480
with these guys removed?

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.822
Well-- yeah.

00:22:06.822 --> 00:22:09.130
I'll just write-- can
I write here the--

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:13.500
my parallel way to think of it?

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.960
2 by 2 is pretty small, I admit.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:16.620
OK.

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:19.260
So I start with 2, 3, 4, 7.

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:24.790
I want to split it into--

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:30.770
I want to get the first row
and column in one piece.

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:32.780
Something goes there.

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:38.610
And the other piece
is something there.

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:40.350
OK.

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:42.750
That's what
elimination has done.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:45.210
It's taken the original matrix.

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:47.440
It's split-- these
are both rank 1.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.030
So let's just--
first of all, you

00:22:56.030 --> 00:23:01.280
could tell me what goes in that
blank space in the first rank 1

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:01.790
matrix.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:05.120
So what-- can I
say this in words?

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:11.630
The first stage of
elimination pulls off from A--

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:14.090
so A is some big matrix.

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:19.070
It pulls off from A. It takes
account of the first column

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:20.540
and row.

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:25.910
So it writes A as--

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:33.560
here we go-- as a first
column, say column

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:40.100
1, row 1, plus the easy part.

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:45.740
The easy part will be a
matrix with all zeros there--

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.090
all zeros there.

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:49.100
And here I have a 2.

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.740
Can I call it a 2?

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:56.690
This is my way now
to think about what

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:58.670
elimination is really doing.

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:01.400
It's starting with
an n by n matrix.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.580
It's pulling off
a rank 1 matrix,

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:09.140
which gets that column
and that row correct.

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:11.660
And it gets whatever
it has in here.

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:16.400
And then the rest of
what's in there is A2.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.520
Do you see that
we've done that here?

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.270
The first step got the first
row and column correct.

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:25.400
And if it's rank 1,
what number goes there?

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.140
AUDIENCE: 6.

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.928
PROFESSOR: 6.

00:24:27.928 --> 00:24:29.269
6 for there.

00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:31.340
And then this is the rest.

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:35.900
This is what we have, one
size smaller to work on.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.380
And it looks like it was 7.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:39.600
6 has been used.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.340
So it's a 1.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:52.130
That's really-- I want to
think of this rank 1 matrix

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:58.610
as the first column of l
times the first row of u.

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:01.670
And then this guy
is the second column

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:05.110
of l times the second row of u.

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:13.270
OK.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:17.820
I haven't presented as
proof in a class before.

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:23.560
And for 2 by 2, it's
looking like overkill to me.

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:24.610
I mean, why?

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:26.710
You don't have to do
all that deep thinking

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:29.540
to get the pieces.

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:35.230
But my idea is that it
gives the breakdown.

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:39.370
And this, of course,
is, by our column times

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:43.140
row rule, that's LU.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:48.510
So we're starting with A, and
we're breaking it up into LU,

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:49.890
where lu--

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:52.140
the first piece of lu--

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:55.920
is the first column times row.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:01.710
And then the next pieces
are the rest of the matrix.

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:06.240
And those get broken down-- the
next stage of elimination would

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.020
break--

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:10.650
if I had a 3 by 3,
this stage peeled off

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:12.540
the first column and row--

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:15.790
then the next stage would
peel off the second--

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.970
the new second column and row.

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:21.370
And the third stage would have
the third column and row--

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:25.500
just the last pivot does
this make any sense to you?

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:30.000
You could email me and
say it's not that great.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.420
But I think it's--

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:39.410
to see that the final result of
elimination is l times u is--

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:45.720
there's a little magic in
seeing what you're doing.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.380
And I think this is a way
to see what you're doing--

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:52.970
that you're peeling
off a first part

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:55.790
to leave a second
part like that.

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:58.250
Then the second part,
you would peel off

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:01.970
the second column
times the second row,

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:05.030
maybe divide by the
pivot to make it correct.

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:09.020
And that would put something
in the rest of the box.

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:14.640
And then A3 would be
the rest of that box.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.420
OK.

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:17.430
I'm stopping here.

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:23.040
I'm glad you let me do 2 by
2, since I see that 3 by 3

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.840
would have ruined the day.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:25.370
Yeah.

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:26.245
OK.

00:27:26.245 --> 00:27:30.450
A question, or let me
pause for a minute.

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:35.770
So I've talked about
these factorizations.

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:38.200
This one we won't see again.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.440
This one we will see, big time.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.510
And this one we will.

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:44.770
And this one we will.

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:46.270
Yeah.

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:49.510
2, 3 and 5 are the
ones that we're really

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:51.820
going to see a lot of.

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:54.250
Questions or thoughts or--

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:55.450
OK.

00:27:55.450 --> 00:28:00.760
I guess I want to tell you
now to complete today's--

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.100
moving forward in this subject--

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.070
the fundamental theorem
of linear algebra--

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:08.420
the fundamental theorem
of linear algebra.

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:08.920
OK.

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.890
Ready for that?

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:13.590
Or you may have seen it
already, because it's

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:17.970
like the highlight
of this subject--

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:21.510
of the basic ideas
in this subject.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:22.010
Right.

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:23.300
And then maybe I can--

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:25.010
after I tell you that theorem--

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:32.560
people around the world send
me homework problems to do.

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.680
Now, you would think any
sensible professor would never

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.000
do those problems.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.190
He would say, it's your problem.

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:43.990
But I get carried away and
I solve them sometimes.

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:47.110
So one came from
India last week,

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:50.290
and it involved the fundamental
theorem of linear algebra.

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:53.970
Whoever teaching it there
really was on the ball.

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:56.560
And well, I'll tell
you that problem

00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:00.160
after the fundamental theorem.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:00.760
OK.

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:01.600
Fundamental theorem.

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:09.410
It's about four sub spaces.

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:13.720
So I invented the name four
fundamental sub spaces.

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:16.390
So can I list the
four sub places?

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:20.830
Fundamental sub spaces.

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:23.980
Well, we know one
of them already.

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:29.670
The column space--
so, for a matrix.

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:32.060
We are given a matrix A--

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:35.090
that's m by n of rank r.

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:39.600
That's our normal
starting point.

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:45.220
So what are those
four sub spaces,

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:46.540
and how are they related?

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:47.860
And what's their dimension?

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:51.830
And what-- those are key facts.

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:52.330
OK.

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:54.010
We already know
the column space--

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.780
column space of a matrix.

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:07.760
And actually, we already know
the row space of a matrix.

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.770
And we have the
notation for that,

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:13.430
column space of A transpose.

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:16.010
And what is the dimension--

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:18.410
so that was the key point
in the first lecture.

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:20.300
Anybody who missed
the first lecture,

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:28.880
should go back to
the notes of 1.1

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:36.950
for the thinking that goes
into the dimension equals what?

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:39.580
Which of those three
numbers do I want to--

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:42.530
is the dimension of
the column space?

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:46.990
R. And what can I say
about r, right away,

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:47.950
compared to m and n?

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:49.733
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:49.733 --> 00:30:50.400
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.320
Less or equal.

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:57.120
r couldn't-- I couldn't have
more independent columns than I

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.760
have columns.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.260
So I've got n columns.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:04.890
So r of them are independent.

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:09.120
So r is somewhere, less or
equal-- hopefully equal to n.

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.440
What about the dimension
of the row space?

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:15.116
How many independent
rows has the matrix got?

00:31:15.116 --> 00:31:15.616
AUDIENCE: R.

00:31:15.616 --> 00:31:16.710
PROFESSOR: R. Thank you.

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:23.910
That's the great fact
with a new proof last time

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:26.910
in section 1.1--

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:30.670
that those have the same
dimension, same dimension.

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:33.700
Which is-- you think, oh, OK.

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.680
You look at a simple example.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:36.760
It's true.

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:42.760
But if you're given a
matrix that's 50 by 100,

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:46.580
really the fact that
those 100 columns

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:50.450
have the same number of
independent ones as those 50

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:51.110
row--

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:53.840
that's like great.

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:54.470
OK.

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:59.700
Now the other spaces
are the null space

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:03.820
of the matrix, N of A.

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:07.250
And just to make everything
naturally symmetric,

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:11.650
the null space of A transpose.

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:16.600
Those are the last two.

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:21.020
Those are the four fundamental
sub spaces, which you've seen.

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:25.150
And they're even on the cover
of the linear algebra textbook.

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:26.680
OK.

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.822
So what's the null space?

00:32:28.822 --> 00:32:30.640
AUDIENCE: It's the
set of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.920
PROFESSOR: It's the
set of solutions to Ax

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.510
equals 0, right.

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:48.130
Null space is all
solutions to Ax equal 0.

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:50.050
So the null space has vector--

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:51.720
these vectors in it-- the x's.

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:57.410
The null space isn't
taken from the matrix.

00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:01.100
The row space and the
column space-- those numbers

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:03.170
are sitting in the matrix.

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:07.100
The null space, and the
null space of A transpose,

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:09.930
are solutions to--

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:14.670
the word null is reflecting
the fact that that's a 0.

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:16.710
And that's what
makes it a space.

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:18.210
Now can you just--

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:20.890
let me just ask
you to think again.

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:23.580
What's implied when I say--

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:25.480
when I use the word space--

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.645
a space of vectors?

00:33:27.645 --> 00:33:29.020
AUDIENCE: Closed
under addition--

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:30.040
PROFESSOR: I can add--

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.020
yeah.

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:37.930
So I can do the most important
operations of linear algebra

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:39.460
in that space.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.120
I can add two vectors.

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.970
Here, let me just add them.

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:45.760
So here I'll have
a vector x, and let

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:49.960
me say another one, a vector y.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:53.140
Then, I do addition.

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:54.970
I follow the rules.

00:33:54.970 --> 00:34:00.830
I see that this can be written
as Ax plus y is 0 plus 0.

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:03.340
So what have I learned?

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:07.090
I've learned that if x
is in the null space,

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:10.750
and y is in the null
space, then x plus y.

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:13.659
So the null space is,
as you said, closed,

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:16.449
meaning I don't go outside it.

00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:19.929
If x is in it, and y is in
it, then the sum is in it.

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:27.429
And similarly, from Ax equals
0, I get to A times cx equals 0.

00:34:27.429 --> 00:34:31.420
Just multiply by
c-- by a number c.

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:33.460
So those two facts--

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:37.210
that means I can
do linear algebra.

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:39.760
I can multiply by numbers.

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:40.960
And I can add.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.199
In other words, I can
take linear combinations.

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:46.480
That's what you do with vectors.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.550
And the point is, if I do it--

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:52.719
if I take combinations
of two null space guys,

00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:55.310
I'm still in the null space.

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:56.300
OK.

00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:01.350
So that's the point
of the null space.

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:06.800
And-- well now-- so now part
of the fundamental theorem

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:11.630
is to figure out how many
independent vectors are

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:12.680
in the null space.

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:16.490
How many solutions--
independent solutions--

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:19.260
does that system
of equations have?

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.380
So that would be the dimension.

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:25.070
And I have to ask
you what it is.

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:27.080
Let me draw a
picture, while you're

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:29.180
thinking about those spaces.

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:35.710
It's fantastic to have these
beautiful clean boards.

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:36.210
OK.

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:39.870
So here's my picture
of the row space.

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:48.680
Row-- that's the column
space of A transpose.

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:58.265
And here's my picture of
the null space, N of A.

00:35:58.265 --> 00:36:01.085
And that's the solutions
to Ax equals 0.

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.650
And why have I put
these two together,

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:08.910
and these two together?

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:17.120
So-- and the other pair will
be the column space, C of A.

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:26.172
and the null space
of A transpose.

00:36:26.172 --> 00:36:27.380
So there are the four spaces.

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:33.380
Their relationship is
the fundamental theorem

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:35.630
of linear algebra.

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:40.800
So first of all, what--

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.285
so I have an m by n matrix.

00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:48.360
So that tells me that my row--

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:51.550
a typical row has n
components, right?

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:53.250
I look at an m by n matrix.

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:55.805
Let's do a 2 by 3 matrix.

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:04.890
So if I look at the
row space, this is m.

00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:06.380
And this is n.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.270
So I see three--

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:12.280
the rows have length three.

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.950
And of course, they
multiply the x's,

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:19.030
which also have the
length three, x1, x2, x3.

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:21.220
That's why these are
together, because they're

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:23.650
both in n dimensional space.

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:31.250
Then why are these together?

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:36.540
Because the columns are
in two dimensional space,

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:38.050
for this example.

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:41.350
And the null space
of A transpose

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:49.390
would be just two components,
like y1 and y2, to give 0s.

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:51.580
So do you see that this is R--

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:54.730
these guys are in Rn?

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:56.980
So that's the first--

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:58.930
get things straight.

00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:02.770
Two spaces in Rn,
two spaces in Rm.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:12.570
Now, what am I going to
ask about these spaces?

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:14.430
I guess I've already
started asking

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:16.610
and didn't wait for an answer.

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:18.270
Their dimension.

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:24.690
So this has dimension R.
And what's the dimension--

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:31.450
how many-- this is
really such a key fact.

00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:37.880
If I have m equations,
Ax equals 0.

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:41.630
And if R of those
equations are independent,

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:43.730
how many solutions?

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:45.500
So the dimension
of this space is

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:48.950
going to tell me
how many solutions

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:53.360
to Ax in two m
equations, but really

00:38:53.360 --> 00:39:02.610
only are genuine independent
equations in this system Ax

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:03.870
equals 0.

00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:04.840
How many?

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.650
So can I ask the question again?

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:12.570
And I want the answer in terms
of m, and n, and R. So I have--

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:15.610
I really have R equations.

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:17.680
If I look at Ax
equals 0, it looks

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.660
like m separate equations.

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:23.020
But m minus R--

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:27.210
of those-- are just copies
or combinations of others.

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:30.180
So there are
independent equations.

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:32.648
So what's-- how many have I got?

00:39:32.648 --> 00:39:35.483
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:35.483 --> 00:39:37.900
PROFESSOR: And And that's what
I'm going to write in here.

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:41.740
So-- yeah.

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:45.970
So x has n components.

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:51.490
And there are real
active equations

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:53.680
that they have to satisfy.

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:58.282
And that leaves n minus
R. That's the key point.

00:39:58.282 --> 00:40:04.790
That's the key point that
there are n components of x--

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:07.610
n unknowns-- n unknowns.

00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:11.020
And there are R constraints--

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:13.170
independent constraints.

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:16.270
So those n get--

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:19.960
if I want to satisfy those
constraints that knocks out

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:23.050
dimension R, and leaves
n minus R. So that's

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:23.920
the dimension here.

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:31.960
And the beauty of the count is
that those two numbers add up

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.070
to n.

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:35.110
Everybody's accounted for.

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:39.590
Every vector has a
piece in the row space

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:41.450
and a piece and the null space.

00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:47.680
And that's-- those two pieces
give you back the vector.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:48.650
Do you see that?

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:51.300
That's just nice, that the
numbers come out right.

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:54.560
And of course, they come
out right here, too.

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:57.200
You could say, just
transpose the matrix

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.660
and write it-- write
the same thing again.

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:01.580
What's the dimension
of the column space?

00:41:05.537 --> 00:41:06.130
Equals?

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:08.370
The other column space in
the matrix has dimension--

00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:09.360
AUDIENCE: R.

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.190
PROFESSOR: R. Right.

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:15.870
And the row-- this guy is left
out of some linear algebra

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:18.660
books, as if it doesn't belong.

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:23.610
But isn't it clear that
without it, everything

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:28.050
is only three quarters done?

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:29.820
We have to have this guy.

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:32.526
And its dimension is

00:41:32.526 --> 00:41:34.280
AUDIENCE: M minus R.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:37.580
PROFESSOR: M minus R. Yeah.

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:41.780
That count is just,
for A transpose, what

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:44.390
this count was for A. Yeah.

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:50.120
So we've got those dimensions,
R and n minus R, R and m

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.830
minus R. Yeah.

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:57.780
You'll have known
this, but we need

00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:05.070
to see it once again in 2018,
before we start using it.

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:06.980
Now is that the
fundamental theorem?

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:10.040
Is that all to it there is?

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:12.330
No.

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:14.910
There is another piece to
the fundamental theorem,

00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:19.170
which is, sort of you
could say, the geometry.

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:20.890
Here I have a sub space.

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:26.630
Here I have a subspace of
this big n dimensional space.

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:31.010
So I visualize those sub spaces
as some kind of a plane--

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:36.840
an R dimensional plane- and an
n minus R dimensional plane.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:41.970
And I want to see how are
those two planes connected.

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:45.050
How are those two
planes connected?

00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:49.240
And let me get a piece of the--

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:52.460
blank piece of the board
to remember the final step.

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:53.350
Right.

00:42:53.350 --> 00:43:02.860
So we've got dimensions r and n
minus r, and then over here r,

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:05.470
and m minus r.

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:05.970
OK.

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:09.310
And this is for the rows.

00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:12.590
This is for the null space.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:15.400
So this has the rows in it.

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:16.540
This has the null--

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:19.210
the solutions to Ax equals 0.

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:23.850
What is the beautiful geometry--

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:30.005
how do you visualize
those two spaces?

00:43:30.005 --> 00:43:30.880
How do you visualize?

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.445
Let me take an example.

00:43:32.445 --> 00:43:39.250
Let A be 1, 2, 4, 2, 4, 8.

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:40.380
Sorry about that.

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:41.980
That's kind of a--

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:43.765
you see it hoked up example.

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:49.480
So this is 2 by 3.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:52.250
So there n is 3.

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:54.440
What's in the null
space of this matrix?

00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:04.660
Can you see a vector
that solves Ax equals 0?

00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:06.780
And in fact, how
many will there be?

00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:09.150
What's-- yeah, what's
r for this matrix?

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:11.910
Just tell me all the good stuff.

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:20.110
For that example, m is
2, n is 3, and r is--

00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:21.010
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:22.260
PROFESSOR: 1.

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:24.780
Everybody sees 1 for the rank?

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:28.060
The rows are dependent.

00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:30.300
There's only one
independent row.

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:31.980
The columns are dependent.

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:35.910
There's only-- every column
is a multiple of 1, 2.

00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:38.120
It's a rank 1 matrix.

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:38.700
OK.

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:45.640
What about its-- so its
row space has dimension--

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:46.140
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:47.250
PROFESSOR: 1.

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:51.760
And it's null space
has dimension--

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:53.030
AUDIENCE: 2.

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:57.390
PROFESSOR: 2 So, cause
n minus r will be 2.

00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:01.950
So I'm looking for a couple
of vectors that both give 0.

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:02.910
I believe there--

00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:07.670
I think I've only got one
independent row there.

00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:10.910
So I should be able to
find two different vectors

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:17.180
that solve Ax equals 0.

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:20.630
So what what's the
solution to Ax equals 0?

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:22.010
AUDIENCE: 0 minus 2, 1.

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:27.020
PROFESSOR: 0 minus 2, 1.

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:29.070
Yeah, that works.

00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:31.280
And what's an
independent solution?

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.700
AUDIENCE: 4, 0, negative 1?

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:36.180
PROFESSOR: 4, 0--
don't throw me off--

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:38.290
4, 0 and--

00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:39.040
AUDIENCE: Minus 1.

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:39.480
PROFESSOR: Minus 1.

00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:40.140
Yeah.

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:42.080
That looks good.

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:44.220
That looks good.

00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:46.980
And then the claim is
that every solution would

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.390
be a combination of those two.

00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:51.930
And this is how many there are.

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:56.240
And now, it's the
geometry I'm completing.

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:58.700
So we have two minutes
left in this lecture.

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:01.380
You just have to tell me how--

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:06.060
what's the relation between
these guys in the row space,

00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:08.780
and that guy in the null space?

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:12.350
What's the relation
between the rows of A,

00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:15.200
the solutions to Ax equals 0?

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.960
Between-- if you see it-- if
you saw that vector and that

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:18.710
vector--

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:23.070
well, A times x is 0.

00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:24.470
So what does that tell us?

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:29.570
What do we see for the
relation between 1, 2, 4, and 0

00:46:29.570 --> 00:46:30.627
minus 2, 1.

00:46:30.627 --> 00:46:31.460
AUDIENCE: Orthogonal

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:32.752
PROFESSOR: They are orthogonal.

00:46:32.752 --> 00:46:33.560
Terrific.

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:34.550
Yes.

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:37.985
Orthogonal I test by the
dot product, 0 minus 4,

00:46:37.985 --> 00:46:39.840
4, add to 0.

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:40.340
Yes.

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:46.280
So the-- and that's a
completely general fact.

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:50.420
When I look at Ax equals
0, it's telling me

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:53.250
that x is orthogonal
to the rows.

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:54.450
Do you see that?

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:57.380
Just to put it in again here.

00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:03.080
If I look at Ax, A
has a bunch of rows.

00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:05.480
X has one column.

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:06.590
And I get 0.

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:08.135
That's the point
of the null space.

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:17.600
And that equation is just
saying that row 1 is orthogonal,

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.750
because that's the dot
product of row 1 with x.

00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:24.550
So here is row 1, row 2,
row 3, and row 4 with x.

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:26.360
The rows with x--

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:27.920
and I get 0s.

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:36.310
So the point is then, these two
spaces are at 90 degree angles.

00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:41.380
That's really a neat picture
of the four sub spaces.

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:43.990
And these two are
for the same reason--

00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:45.550
at 90 degree angles--

00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:49.900
off in m dimensional space.

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:54.220
So this is the fundamental
theorem of linear algebra--

00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:57.670
to see that the
dimensions come out right,

00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:00.160
and the geometry
comes out right.

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:00.670
Yeah.

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:02.950
And then, now, next time--

00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:06.140
following the notes-- and
I have a few more copies

00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:11.810
of the one hand out.

00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:18.610
We'll move on quickly next week
to eigenvalues and positive

00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:20.980
definite matrices.

00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:25.650
Good this is really
linear algebra moving on.
