00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.590
GILBERT STRANG: OK, here we go.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.250
All set, and two
topics for today--

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.800
one is to go back to
Professor Sra's lecture.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.410
That was last Friday.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.110
And he promised a
theorem and proof.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.180
And this morning,
he sent it to me.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.660
So it's proving the convergence
of stochastic gradient descent.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.240
And really, what's
important, maybe,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.590
and useful is not so much
the details of the proof,

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.700
which I'm just learning,
but the assumptions--

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.580
what's the logic
here, what do you

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.740
have to assume about
the gradient and about

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.970
the algorithm to get the answer?

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.920
But now I actually look back
at the video of his lecture.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.860
And it was excellent.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.970
And as I looked at it, there
were a couple of things

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.420
later in the lecture
that I thought

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.340
would make good projects.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.590
So I don't know if
anybody is still

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.920
open to what to do on a project.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.220
But here are my two ideas.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.280
And if you've already
finished your project,

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.640
well, you get an A-plus by
considering one of these.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.010
So you remember-- and
this will remind you

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.170
of the lecture, which
is a good thing.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.630
So do you remember that
question 1 was whether,

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.289
in the stochastic part, after
you've sampled one or some mini

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.170
batch-- but let's just say
one of the lost functions,

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.800
coming from one sample--

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.860
you remember, the whole point
is that if we do all zillion

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.400
samples at every iteration,
we're really, really slow.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.170
So the stochastic idea
is to randomly pick

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.900
one or a mini batch
of the samples

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.790
and just reduce their loss,
just deal with the loss--

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.440
say, the square loss.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.980
Or later we'll see
cross-entropy loss.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.240
But whatever the cost
is, just do a few or one.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.490
And then the question was,
after you've done that one,

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.350
do you put it back
in the pot every time

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.380
you sample over the
whole collection?

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.810
But that's expensive.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:15.060
Or do you just make a list of
random order of all the samples

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.290
and go through them?

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.350
Which is then without
replacement, which

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.840
is a sort of semi-illegal.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:31.780
That is, the logic
in the randomization

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.360
asks you to replace every time.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.620
But nobody does it.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.020
It costs a lot--

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.670
probably not worth it.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.870
So the project would be,
suppose you take 1,000--

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.290
or, say, just 100.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:54.305
100 random numbers--
say you use MATLAB, just

00:03:54.305 --> 00:03:56.240
the command "rand."

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.540
So you get numbers whose
average is a half from rand.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.750
They're between 0 and 1.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:03.250
OK.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.320
So we know what the average is.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.880
So let's compute it two ways.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.130
One is by not replacing.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.800
And that's the interesting one.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.700
So take 100 samples.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.280
Well, I guess we know
that, after we've

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.790
got through the full
100, we're going to get

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.740
exactly the right answer.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:34.460
But anyway, my question would
be, how much difference do you

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.220
see in the eventual approach--
so the law of large numbers,

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.160
I guess, would tell
us we get a average

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:50.820
of a half for these numbers
with uniform distribution

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:51.930
between 0 and 1.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.000
Should I be writing
anything here?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.540
Maybe I should.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.370
OK.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.740
So this is project 1.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:13.110
You pick numbers ak,
which is from rand--

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:22.470
so uniformly on 0,1.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.350
And then my question is,
what about convergence

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.310
to the final--

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.080
the average is a half.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.100
So this may be too
simple an example.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.330
But could we see what
happens for the convergence

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:46.590
of the average as you either
do replacements or don't

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.030
do replacements?

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:53.010
And in fact, I would like
to see a figure that looks

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.405
like those in his lecture.

00:05:54.405 --> 00:05:55.880
Do you remember?

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.470
He started it somewhere--

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.095
start-- and then
here's the finish.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.500
But you remember, the
stochastic gradient descent

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.620
was kind of pretty
effective at the beginning.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.410
Well, the beginning,
those might be 100

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:20.960
iterations each-- one epoch,
one run through the full number.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.830
But then when it got
to here, got closer,

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.180
it started oscillating.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.930
You remember, he identified
the region of confusion

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.790
around the thing.

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.010
Well, my suggestion
is just, I think

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.920
those videos should be
accessible to you on--

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.140
are they on Stellar?

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.710
Yeah.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:54.270
So I'd love to see that
behavior and some good examples

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.510
of that behavior and
some pictures to you.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.730
So that would be one
idea with and with--

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.840
oh, yeah, that's also idea 2.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.830
Idea 2 is the good
start and then

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.560
the bad finish for a
stochastic gradient descent.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.970
And of course,
even without this,

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:25.170
the magic words in computations
is "early stopping."

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:29.360
We don't over-fit.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.810
So we wanted to
stop early, anyway.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:44.850
And early stopping
just is a good idea

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:51.230
if that's what the
approach to the x

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.400
star that you're looking for.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.170
This would be the
place where the--

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:05.040
that's x star where
grad f at x star is 0.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.280
That's the minimum point.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:14.900
That's ARG MIN-- exactly
what we're looking for.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.450
And we don't find it very well.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.090
But we get close to it fast.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.800
OK.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.520
Two ideas on projects--

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:31.630
so maybe I'll go to the
main topic of today--

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:35.299
the topic I promised--

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:39.100
the idea of back propagation.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:48.600
This is all to compute grad f--

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.130
the gradient.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:09:02.460
All the derivatives-- this
is the df dx1 to df dxm,

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:14.730
maybe, I'll say, where I have
m features for the sample.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:15.690
OK.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:17.645
So that's back propagation.

00:09:17.645 --> 00:09:25.050
And that's the thing whose
discovery, or rediscovery,

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:29.270
put neural nets on the map.

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:32.510
That's the key calculation, of
course, to find the gradient.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.610
In the steepest
descent algorithm,

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:38.030
every step needs a gradient.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:45.620
And if you can't compute it
quickly, you're in bad shape.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.200
But you can compute
it quickly by

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:54.140
this automatic differentiation
in reverse mode, which

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.780
is otherwise known--

00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:09.090
I don't think the people--
maybe Hinton was the leader

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.620
in developing deep neural net--

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:13.340
deep learning.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.200
So I give him big
credit for that--

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.040
that back propagation would
work and would give him

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.810
fast gradients.

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:30.650
But it actually had been studied
before under the name AD--

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:32.280
Automatic Differentiation.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.840
So may I just tell
you that idea?

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.590
Some of you may know
it, may know about it,

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:47.040
may know more than I, and
might know a good website

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.720
to see this description.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:56.300
There will be, of course,
a section of the notes,

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.630
you already have it.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:02.770
This is section 7.2.

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:06.630
So this is the chapter
on deep learning.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:11.040
And the first section was
about the structure of F of x.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.710
And you remember the key
point about the structure

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:19.920
of F of x is that I start with
x and apply some function, F1

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.090
of x.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:24.550
And to that, I apply
some function, F2 of x.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.970
And to that, I
apply some function

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:30.930
of F3 of F2 of F1 of x.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:35.320
And that's the thing
whose derivative I need.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.110
So I'll just take
ordinary derivative--

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:40.950
well, partial
derivatives, really.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.890
Yeah, I better say
partial derivatives.

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:45.910
So suppose x is a pair, xy.

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:57.880
Example-- so here, let
me show you my example.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.610
So suppose F of x is--

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:04.650
let me take a simple example--

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.720
x cubed times x plus 2y.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.980
OK.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:18.010
So I want to think of that
function the way anybody would,

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:20.740
as the product of two functions.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:26.170
So there is a product rule
to get into the derivative.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:30.290
And then we need the
derivatives of each piece.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:36.880
So there's a power rule and
a linear combination rule.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.360
So it's got a few of
the rules that we use.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:45.160
And the point is to think
about the computation

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:51.400
of F of x and the
computation of dF dx

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.970
and the computation of dF dy.

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.370
Those are the
derivatives that we need.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:01.110
This is the function
we need and how

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:03.640
to do those
computations quickly.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.810
OK.

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:15.100
And this is section 7.2, which
benefited a lot from a blog.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.010
I'm not a blog reader
or a blog writer.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:21.325
But somehow I found this blog.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:35.670
It's Christopher
Olah, is his name.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:38.490
And he really
writes clear things.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.890
He works for one of
the big companies

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:47.850
and does the deeper research.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:51.610
But he's also a
really good expositor.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:55.950
And the website
that he now uses is

00:13:55.950 --> 00:14:00.530
called Distill dot something.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:04.620
But I think maybe this
blog was earlier than

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.300
before the start of Distill.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.790
But it might be
loaded onto Distill.

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:14.190
Anyway, that's where I got
this simple description

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:16.890
of back propagation.

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:21.160
And let's just do
calculus, first of all.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.553
If I just have a function
of maybe even one variable,

00:14:24.553 --> 00:14:25.470
what's the derivative?

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:29.610
What is dF dx here,
just to remember

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:32.970
what calculation we have to do?

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:38.410
So dF dx, this is
with n equal one--

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.110
one variable.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:47.340
So I use ordinary derivative
and not partial derivative.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:53.160
But that's what
really has to be done.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.530
But just, what's the
derivative of that--

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:58.560
of a chain of functions?

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.300
Well, of course, the chain rule.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.110
So what does the chain rule say?

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:05.690
I differentiate dF.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.670
I don't know.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:15.950
What do I put that it's
differentiated with respect to?

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.630
dF3, dF2-- is that
what I should put?

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:22.130
OK.

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:28.790
And where do I evaluate
that derivative?

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:37.880
So yeah, I don't
evaluate it at x.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.860
I'm differentiated to F2.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:45.500
So do I evaluate it
at F2 of F1 of x?

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:54.390
This is where the chain rule
gets sort of a little chain-ey.

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:54.890
OK.

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:57.260
Then we know that dF2 dF1.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:05.960
And again, that's now
evaluated at F1 of x.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:14.470
And then the final factor
is dF1 dx evaluated at x.

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:17.780
That's somehow
what we have to do.

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:22.010
And that's just for an
ordinary one-variable function.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.890
And I have here a
two-variable function.

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:27.485
And deep learning has a
million-variable function.

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:33.550
So I think we won't
go to a million.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:35.570
But two, we could manage.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:42.070
So let's compute the
function, first of all.

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:58.760
Compute F. So I'm
given x equals, say, 2,

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.490
and y equals, say, 3.

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:09.869
And I'm going to create
a computational graph.

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:27.480
So I'm actually going to
draw the computational graph

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:37.140
to compute for F. And then it'll
be a variation of that graph

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:40.000
to find the derivatives.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.360
So let's just start with
the graph, first of all,

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:46.600
for the function, because
we're going to need that.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.870
So again, it's x cubed plus--

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:54.250
so can I write that function
again? x cubed times x plus 2y.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:06.561
So I think the first step will
be to find x plus x cubed--

00:18:06.561 --> 00:18:08.530
that factor, which will be 8.

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:16.110
And we have to find the
other factor, x plus 2y.

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:19.410
So then that uses y and x.

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:23.610
So it's a directed
graph in going forward

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:26.100
with this computation.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.390
So x plus 2y equals
whatever it is--

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:31.620
2 and 6-- oh, 8 again.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.750
Not brilliant.

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:36.600
What shall I change here?

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.410
Make it 3y?

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:47.540
3y, just to get a
different number here.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.280
So now x is 2.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.270
y is 3.

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:50.960
I get 11.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.797
That's a good number.

00:18:52.797 --> 00:18:53.297
11.

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:59.760
OK.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.500
So far, so good?

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:05.480
And now the next step
on this graph will be,

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.560
I have a product of those.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.230
So that will go to the product.

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:18.835
F equals 8 times 11--

00:19:18.835 --> 00:19:19.335
88.

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:22.600
OK.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:28.810
So we've got the answer,
88, which, normally, I

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:31.480
wouldn't take that
much of a book

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:41.710
to compute F. I would have said,
2 cubed times 2 plus 3 times 3.

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:47.170
And I'd have simplified
that to 8 times 11.

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:50.530
And I would have got 88.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:54.190
So if we were just writing
normally, that would do it.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:59.110
But this is the picture of
the computational graph.

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:00.040
OK.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:00.550
Good.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:01.050
Good.

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:02.440
Good.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.200
Now it's the derivatives--

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.650
two derivatives to
find-- dF dx and dF dy.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:12.810
Suppose we go forward first.

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:15.360
My point is going to
be-- or the great point

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.520
is that backward is better.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.770
Reverse mode is better.

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:22.650
But we don't know what that
means until we've gone forward.

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:24.443
So let me go forward.

00:20:24.443 --> 00:20:25.735
So now I'm going to go forward.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.590
Let's do dF dx.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:44.170
Everybody is up for dF
dx-- the partial derivative

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.300
with respect to x?

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:54.980
So here we have x
equal 2 and y equal 3.

00:21:01.168 --> 00:21:04.030
OK.

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:11.750
And then I take the
derivative of that step.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:15.040
The first step was x 2x cubed.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.330
So I need the derivative.

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:23.710
The whole point of AD is
that every computation

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:30.400
of a derivative breaks down like
this into very simple pieces.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.710
And the derivatives
of those simple pieces

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.660
are also simple pieces.

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:44.190
So the whole point is
to replace appropriately

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:50.020
those intermediate
steps with derivatives,

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.920
so as to compute
the x derivative.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:22:00.070
So I have to use the fact
that the derivative of x

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.040
cubed, with respect to x--

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.650
oh, I better do partial
derivative-- partial

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:09.950
derivatives of x cube, with
respect to x, is 3x squared.

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:14.340
I'll put maybe a formula
and then a number.

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:21.860
So that gives 3 times 4--

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:22.360
12.

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:31.750
And the derivative of x
cubed, with respect to y,

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:34.385
gives 0, clearly.

00:22:34.385 --> 00:22:35.780
So that's 0.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:44.350
So I'm doing the x derivative.

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:51.170
So the derivative of y,
with respect to x, is--

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:54.250
you get to tell me.

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:58.560
If I'm computing partial
derivatives, it is 0.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.955
It is 0.

00:22:59.955 --> 00:23:03.030
y and x are independent.

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:06.810
And this is the
reason, in my view,

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:10.080
that the forward
method is wasteful,

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:15.630
because I'm going to have to do
another whole graph for the y

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:16.990
derivative.

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:21.630
In other words, tracking
the x derivatives,

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:25.650
a whole lot of stuff
never got off the ground.

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:28.140
So we never should
have looked at it.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:41.812
So anyway, I have
this x plus 3y, maybe.

00:23:41.812 --> 00:23:43.270
I don't know whether
to erase that.

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:45.970
I think I will,
just because I don't

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:49.010
know what to do with it there.

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:49.510
Yeah.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:56.130
So now let me take the
ones that I really need,

00:23:56.130 --> 00:24:08.400
is the derivative, with respect
to x, of x plus 3y, which is 1.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:14.520
And so that gives me the
answer 1 for any x actually.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.040
OK.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.250
And now what?

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.440
Oh, yeah, I don't need these.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.410
This is a waste of time.

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:26.330
Isn't it?

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:33.120
Is it only x derivatives I want?

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.640
Anyway, let's just keep going.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.170
You can see, this takes
a little organization.

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:42.750
And I'm not practiced with it.

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:44.170
So what am I going to do?

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:47.700
I'm looking for the
x derivative of--

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.160
I've got to use our
product rule now.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:54.750
I found the x derivative
of that factor was 12.

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:58.600
The x derivative of
this factor is 1.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:03.950
And now the x derivative
of the product--

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:10.590
so now I'm going to do,
somehow, a product rule--

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:15.440
the x derivative
of this product.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:20.460
I should have given
these two terms a name.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:25.910
Let me call that first term x
cubed, and the second term x

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:26.810
plus 3y--

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:27.870
call it s.

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:32.090
So I'll call the
two terms c and s.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.210
So that's dc ds.

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:43.850
This is dc dx.

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:46.820
This is dc dx.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:56.390
And this one is ds dx and dc dy.

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:57.620
Do I need to know that?

00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:02.690
I'm sorry, this computational
graph has thrown me.

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:07.080
But now I want to
use the product rule.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.860
And I'm taking x derivatives.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:13.580
So I should have
computed c and s.

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:16.580
Yes, I see I need those
in the product rule.

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:30.037
So I should have computed c
as being 8 and s as being 5.

00:26:30.037 --> 00:26:30.620
Is that right?

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:35.940
2 plus 3-- so 11.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:37.800
Yeah, I needed the 8.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:43.040
Oh, is that-- what's up?

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.440
I've just been
running along here

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:49.730
without getting myself
in the whole picture.

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:51.440
Yeah, 8 and 11 is right.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.990
But now I'm looking
for the derivatives.

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:55.760
So I don't multiply those.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.250
That's not the product rule.

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:01.810
So the product rule is what?

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:13.120
So this product rule, I have
to do this combination of--

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.810
this is now the product rule--

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:25.240
for the derivative of c times s.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:30.640
So I want c ds dx plus s dc dx.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.940
I think I'm on track now.

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:36.640
And now I want to
put it in numbers.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.900
So c is 8.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:45.370
ds dx-- have we computed ds dx?

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:48.680
Yes, ds dx is 1.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:53.590
And now s itself
is computed as 11.

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:58.840
And dc dx, we computed as 12.

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.250
I don't dare look.

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:08.120
I don't think I'm going to get--

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.830
oh, no, I don't
know the answer yet.

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:12.020
Sorry, I'm not trying to get 88.

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:16.575
You guys are not helping.

00:28:16.575 --> 00:28:18.700
[LAUGHS]

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.210
You see I'm in trouble.

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:24.880
But what I imagine here is,
that's 8 and that's 132.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:28.000
So I'm getting 140.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.830
Is there any
possibility that that's

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:34.330
the right answer for dF dx?

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:36.660
This is dF dx I computed.

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:44.920
By watching me struggle
here, you're seeing the idea.

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:52.170
Every step, I take the
derivative of each step.

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:55.050
So it was a power step, x cubed.

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:57.000
So I had a 3x squared.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.480
And a sum step, so I had a 1.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:04.900
Then the next step
was a multiplication.

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:08.730
So I needed the
product rule for that.

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:11.040
I have these separate numbers.

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.570
So I put them in.

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:18.140
And so it's the
computational graph finished.

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:21.710
We only needed two levels.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:23.840
And we got 8 and 132--

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.180
140.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:26.540
OK.

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.120
But we didn't get dF dy yet.

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:37.190
And for that, I'd need
to redo this again.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.330
And I don't want to do that.

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:48.160
I would rather do the reverse
mode and do them both at once.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.090
That's the point of
the reverse mode.

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:51.230
It's very efficient.

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:55.140
It's very efficient, actually.

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:59.490
Computing the
gradient after you've

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:03.270
done the work for the function,
computing first derivatives--

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:05.970
you could compute
n first derivatives

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:10.800
with about four or five
times the cost, not n times.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.330
That's amazing to me.

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:17.490
That is amazing that I can
compute the gradient very

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:23.290
efficiently by the back prop.

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:25.730
So I have to show you
the backwards way.

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.250
Yeah.

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:35.090
I'm just going to follow all
the paths backwards so that I

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:38.960
get both dF dx and dF dy.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:43.280
You see, the idea is to take
the derivative of each step--

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:45.020
each small step.

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:48.080
That's really what
we do in calculus.

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:51.050
If you think about the
start of a calculus course,

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:53.600
what derivatives do
we actually know?

00:30:53.600 --> 00:31:00.020
Do we actually use F at
x plus delta x minus F?

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:02.150
What derivatives
do we grind out?

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:10.440
We do the derivatives
of x to the n.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:14.080
Every calculus book starts
with x squared and finds

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.930
the derivative of x to the n.

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:18.480
Then you do sine x and cos x.

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:22.590
Then what others?

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:25.390
Are there any more?

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:28.450
e to the x-- good, e to the x.

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:31.600
And it's the inverse
function log.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:35.920
In freshman calculus,
you always write ln, just

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:37.640
to be out of date.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.330
OK.

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:39.920
And now that may be the list.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.420
Is it?

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:43.460
And then the chain rule.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:50.040
Are there others that you
actually do a computation of?

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:53.820
Actually, e to the x is
defined by the property

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:57.170
that its derivative
is e to the x.

00:31:57.170 --> 00:32:00.270
And then you discover
what log x has to be.

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:04.500
And sine x-- how do you
do sine of x plus delta x?

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.260
Well, compare minus sine of x.

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:12.030
How do you find the hard
way, once-and-for-all way?

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:17.970
You draw a little unit circle
and mess with some angles.

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:21.480
And you discover that the
derivative of the sine

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:24.140
is the cosine.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:30.180
That's if you've defined
the sine as a ratio of sides

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:31.350
in a right triangle.

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:34.050
Of course, you could define
it as an infinite series.

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:37.600
And then you would be
back to just using that.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.100
OK.

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:44.160
So calculus does exactly
what we're doing here--

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:48.030
finds all derivatives
by the chain rule

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:56.030
applied to a few ones that
it has worked out in detail.

00:32:56.030 --> 00:33:02.060
But tangent of x, we would
use the quotient rule.

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:06.970
Secant of x, we would use the
quotient rule, 1 over cosine.

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:09.370
And the products, we
use the product rule.

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:17.010
So really, calculus tends
to seem fairly simple

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:22.750
when you look back to see
what, actually, you did.

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:26.520
And then integration-- what
is integral calculus about?

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:29.240
More or less
guessing the answer.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:34.230
You have to integrate f of x dx.

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:38.130
So really, what you have
to do is sort of think, OK,

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:40.290
what had this derivative?

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:42.550
What function had
that derivative?

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:46.230
And mess around and get it.

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:54.210
So really, it's a
freshman course, I guess.

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:54.960
OK.

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.740
So where am I?

00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:58.400
Backward.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.410
Right.

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:01.690
That's the thing still to do.

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:04.330
How does the
backward system work?

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:07.280
OK, I'll try my best.

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:07.780
OK.

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:10.679
So here is the big goal.

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:14.750
Back-- so reverse mode AD.

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:21.750
Right.

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:25.489
And let me make
myself a little note.

00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:30.710
The little note is to give
you another example where

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:34.219
the order that you
do the computations

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:37.190
makes a big difference.

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:39.699
And that's not
obvious that it will.

00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:41.770
There are many things
in math that you

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:44.050
could do in either order.

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:48.730
And it seems like, logically,
you've done the same things.

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:53.980
So another, and
simpler, example which

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:58.660
shows how one way could be
way faster than another way

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:04.870
is when I'm multiplying
three matrices.

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:06.790
So I'm multiplying
three matrices--

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:08.740
A times B times C.

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:14.110
And the question is, do I do BC
first and then multiply by A?

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:20.230
Or do I do AB first and
then multiply that by C?

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:22.840
And of course, I
kept them in order--

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.370
in the order ABC.

00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:31.790
But the order of computations
can be different.

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:33.530
You get the right
answer both ways.

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:36.710
But those can be completely,
completely different.

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:40.720
One can be 1,000 times
faster than the other.

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:42.950
So that's just to show--

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:45.990
actually, it kind
of connects to this.

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:49.630
And there is also another--

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:53.120
so I'll do that, too.

00:35:53.120 --> 00:36:01.580
So this is example 2, where
this is meant to be example 1.

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:09.860
And example 3 leads to something
called the adjoint method

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:17.530
in differential equations
or in optimization--

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:23.880
in computing optimum
and maximizing it.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:24.380
Yeah.

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:32.450
Really, the underlying
reason it gives us speed-up

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:38.030
is, it makes the right choice
in a product of three things.

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:39.170
Yeah.

00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:43.110
So it'll be enough to do
example 1 and example 2.

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:48.540
OK, let me go with example 1.

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.520
This is now back propagation.

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:52.220
Finally, we got to it.

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:52.720
OK.

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:03.230
Well, I look at my
notes is how I do it.

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:10.410
So the notes-- this
is section 7.2--

00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:12.720
does these computational graphs.

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:15.450
And then here is reverse mode.

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:20.840
So it starts over
here with the--

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.810
so I'm going to
use the chain rule.

00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:26.040
So dF dF is 1.

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.410
And then I'm going backwards.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:38.970
And of course, I have
to use the right rule.

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:41.250
So I have to use
the product rule.

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:43.920
And then soon I'll
have to use these power

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.150
rule and linear rules.

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:47.830
So of course, no change there.

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:52.220
The change is that
by going backwards--

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:55.330
oh, I don't know if I
completed that sentence,

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:59.650
that I could find 100
partial derivatives,

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:02.800
if the function depended
on 100 variables,

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:07.870
in about five times the
cost of one variable--

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:10.060
three to five times
the cost of one.

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:16.480
So you would expect 100 chain
rules would cost 100 times.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:22.240
But you see, we're reusing
the pieces in the chain

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:26.530
and just having a larger--

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:28.190
our chain is wider.

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:29.400
But it's not longer.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.630
And it's not repeated.

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:36.400
Anyway, so here I'm going
to use whatever it is--

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:43.080
dF dc and dF ds.

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.710
And I'm remembering that--

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:49.360
yeah, OK.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:54.880
So dF dc is s, and dF ds is c.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:39:01.090
That was because F
started out as c times s.

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:02.650
It was the product.

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:03.220
OK.

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:06.900
Then we've got to
evaluate those.

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:10.270
And I'll look again to see
that I'm hopefully writing down

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:11.395
some of the correct things.

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:16.250
OK.

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:21.350
So now what I've written
down next is dF dc is 5.

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:24.770
Or no, 5 on that example.

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:30.960
What is it here? dF dc is--

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:35.490
c is x cubed.

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:40.410
So dF-- oh, sorry, dF dc--

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:42.120
yeah, I want s.

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:43.400
I'm looking for s here.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.502
Yeah.

00:39:44.502 --> 00:39:45.474
I'm looking for s.

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:53.210
So I'm looking for s.

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:58.460
And that's x plus 3y.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:39:59.638
Am I doing this well?

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:08.210
I want, in the end, to get
the derivatives with respect

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:10.880
to x and y-- the whole gradient.

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:11.380
OK.

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:13.580
I think we started right.

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:16.650
The first derivatives
is to write c and s.

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:20.190
And then let me leave
these boxes open,

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:21.360
just to get the picture.

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:43.220
Then I'll need dc dx,
dc dy, ds dx, and ds dy.

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:44.140
I think that's right.

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:49.400
Here, I had a
product of c and s.

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:52.700
So I had two derivatives.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:57.710
Here I have c and s,
each to differentiate.

00:40:57.710 --> 00:41:01.760
So have an x and a y derivative
of x and a y derivative.

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:05.330
And now it's just a matter
of putting in those numbers

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:07.640
and following the
chain backwards.

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:15.730
Maybe I'm not going to
put those numbers in,

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:19.510
because if I didn't
reach 140, you wouldn't

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:21.830
believe in back propagation.

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:25.285
And that would be
an unhappy outcome.

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:31.520
So I'll leave you to
put them in maybe.

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:35.840
Or the notes have a separate
example that you can see.

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:37.760
But do you see the point--

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:47.305
that in the end, I'm
going to find dF dx and dF

00:41:47.305 --> 00:41:53.650
dy from the chain--

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:59.200
from one chain and not
from a separate chain for x

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:02.470
and a separate chain for y.

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:06.070
To me, that's the
point of reverse mode.

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:09.400
It's a little bit of magic.

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:12.190
But you see the steps--

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:13.330
the ingredient.

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:17.470
And some of you have seen
this before and maybe

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:19.700
know a better exposition.

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:24.100
I found this blog by
Christopher Olah clear.

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:26.110
And these very simple
things, you'll see,

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:28.420
are clear in the notes.

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:36.730
But maybe another blog brings
out other points to make here.

00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:41.660
It's not obvious, maybe, that
I could have 100 variables

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:48.570
and do the calculation in
four or five times the cost--

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:52.740
four or five times
being instead of 100.

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:53.740
Yeah.

00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:55.450
But it's possible.

00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:56.850
OK.

00:42:56.850 --> 00:43:00.262
So could I close
today with this one?

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.370
How could those be different?

00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:12.940
You're computing the same
numbers, the same AIJ, BJKs,

00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:17.470
CKLs, and doing these sums.

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:19.390
But it certainly is different.

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:21.370
So let's just do that.

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:21.903
OK.

00:43:21.903 --> 00:43:22.570
I'll do it here.

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:31.980
And then at the
right time-- and I

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:36.030
guess it'll be after Professor
Rao on Friday and Monday,

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:42.950
I'll come back to
Professor Sra's short proof

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:48.470
of the convergence of
stochastic gradient descent.

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:52.560
The whole point is to show you
what assumptions do you need.

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:56.660
You need some assumptions on
the gradient, some assumptions

00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:58.190
on the step size.

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:02.810
And for a good proof, all
the assumptions fit together,

00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:06.270
and, dong, out comes
the conclusion.

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:10.010
And the conclusion would
be how fast it converges--

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:11.600
stochastic gradient descent.

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:18.230
So there's some expected
things, because it's stochastic.

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:25.060
We expect some assumptions
about the mean and the variance

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:28.390
to go into the proof.

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:29.620
So you'll see that.

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:33.960
But maybe it's too
much for today.

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.690
So I'll come back to that.

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:45.130
I might even put it on Stellar
and just close with this.

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:56.320
So suppose A is m by n, B
is n by p, and C is p by q.

00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:57.930
OK.

00:44:57.930 --> 00:45:04.480
How many steps does it take
to find A times B times C--

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.970
the product of those
three matrices?

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:14.140
Well, if I go this way,
I have to do BC first.

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:18.160
So BC costs-- how
many operations

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.125
to multiply that times that?

00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:25.610
npq-- nice formula.

00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:26.110
npq.

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:30.540
Why is that?

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:36.280
Well, I could say that
the answer is n by q.

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:41.960
And every number in there
was an inner product

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:45.310
of a row and column of length p.

00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:50.350
So I have nq inner products.

00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:52.280
And each one costs p--

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:58.450
multiply, adds.

00:45:58.450 --> 00:46:04.280
So now I have BC,
which will be--

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.270
so now I have m by n.

00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:14.000
Then I have m by n,
which is the A times

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.360
B by C, which is now n by q.

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:18.110
That's BC.

00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:20.480
This is A, BC.

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:23.450
And this one costs--

00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:25.310
what's the cost here?

00:46:25.310 --> 00:46:28.340
m by n, m by q--

00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:30.035
by the same rule, it'll be mnq.

00:46:32.954 --> 00:46:34.450
Good.

00:46:34.450 --> 00:46:36.640
That's the first way--

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:38.590
A times BC.

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:44.530
Now, the second way is AB
times C. Let me write in again,

00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:47.455
m by n, n by p, p by q.

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:53.890
So now I'm doing this first--

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:56.680
so AB costs.

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:58.870
Tell me again now,
what's the rule

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:03.130
for the cost of a
matrix multiplication?

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:04.295
mnp.

00:47:04.295 --> 00:47:04.795
mnp.

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:16.410
And then I multiply m by p--

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:18.930
that's AB-- times p by q.

00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:20.580
That's C.

00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:22.650
So I have mpq.

00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:32.320
So I have that together
with that, or that

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:35.130
together with that.

00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:41.490
That sum-- those
two or these two.

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:43.450
And they're different.

00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:48.340
And let's just recognize
the most important example.

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:50.770
Suppose C is a column vector--

00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:52.540
C for column vector.

00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:54.280
So q is 1.

00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:56.050
There's only one column.

00:47:56.050 --> 00:48:00.170
So if q is 1, this way did np--

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:02.020
let's just specialize to that.

00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:16.340
So specialize to C
equal a column vector,

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:19.170
which means that q is 1.

00:48:19.170 --> 00:48:20.980
I only have one column.

00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:30.820
So then A times BC
is versus AB times C.

00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:33.580
So let's just figure
that out when q is 1.

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:37.840
So npq is just np.

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:48.595
And mnq is just mn,
where AB is m and p.

00:48:48.595 --> 00:48:51.190
Oh, that's a bad one.

00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:52.210
Disaster already.

00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:58.660
Those are potentially
two big matrices,

00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:01.160
multiplying a column vector.

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:03.340
So here I've done a
matrix multiplication.

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:04.990
I never should have done that.

00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:07.750
This is a matrix vector.

00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:09.250
It gives me a vector.

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:11.530
And then this is
a matrix vector.

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:14.320
So I get nice numbers here.

00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:17.380
But I get a terrible
number for AB.

00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:21.700
And then I multiply that
by C. So that's mpq.

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:26.180
mpq.

00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:31.760
So mp is factoring out.

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:42.340
So if I write it as n times
m plus p versus this one

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:50.190
is m that's factoring
out times m--

00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:51.570
no.

00:49:51.570 --> 00:49:53.240
Yeah.

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:54.160
What's up here?

00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:57.650
Yeah.

00:49:57.650 --> 00:49:58.760
Sorry.

00:49:58.760 --> 00:49:59.570
What am I doing?

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:06.320
Yeah.

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:09.540
Is it p that factors
out from this one?

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:11.520
OK.

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:15.820
p times m plus n, I guess.

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:16.320
Sorry.

00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:24.938
Anyway, the difference is--

00:50:24.938 --> 00:50:29.240
AUDIENCE: I think it's
mp times p plus q.

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:30.480
[INAUDIBLE]

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:34.080
GILBERT STRANG: Shall I go
over it again or write--?

00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.120
Let me do just this
thinking again.

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:39.810
If q is 1, if I go
this way, was that

00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:42.960
my final total when q was 1?

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.420
And that's this?

00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:46.440
No.

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:49.740
m factors out times n plus p.

00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:52.800
Let's just get that right.

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.690
Oh, no, n factors out.

00:50:54.690 --> 00:50:58.070
Sorry, n factors
out times m plus p.

00:50:58.070 --> 00:51:03.635
And this way was
all these things.

00:51:03.635 --> 00:51:07.520
AUDIENCE: Both the m
and the p factor out.

00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:10.340
GILBERT STRANG: Both the
m and the p factor out.

00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:11.790
OK.

00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:12.290
Thanks.

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:22.100
Times n plus q.

00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:24.120
n plus q was 1.

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:24.620
OK.

00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:32.520
The whole point is, we've got
this horrible multiplication

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:36.300
of three big numbers.

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:38.840
And this only had
two big numbers.

00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:42.990
So this is orders of
magnitude faster than that.

00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:45.480
And of course, you would
have done the calculation.

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:48.720
That way, you would have
multiplied the column vector

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:52.140
by a matrix to get
another column vector.

00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:54.090
And you would have
multiplied that by a matrix

00:51:54.090 --> 00:51:57.390
to get another column
vector, where here,

00:51:57.390 --> 00:52:02.100
you crazily multiplied two big
matrices together and then got

00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:02.940
a column vector.

00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:07.020
So there is a bad move.

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:08.440
OK, thanks.

00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:11.670
Oh, I'm past the
time on this ABC.

00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:16.230
It's just to show that on a
very familiar calculation,

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:18.510
you have to do it
in the right order.

00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:21.840
And back propagation
is the right order

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:24.130
for partial derivatives.

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:24.630
OK.

00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:25.260
Thank you.

00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:29.370
And so bring laptops Friday.

00:52:29.370 --> 00:52:35.490
And look forward
to Professor Rao.

00:52:35.490 --> 00:52:37.880
Give him a good welcome.
