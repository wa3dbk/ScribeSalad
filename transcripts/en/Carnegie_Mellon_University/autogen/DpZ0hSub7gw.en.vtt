yeah

02:15:28.570 --> 02:15:28.580 align:start position:0%
yeah
 

02:15:28.580 --> 02:15:30.010 align:start position:0%
yeah
so<02:15:28.850><c> I</c><02:15:28.880><c> think</c><02:15:29.210><c> hopefully</c><02:15:29.480><c> I</c><02:15:29.659><c> think</c><02:15:29.690><c> we've</c><02:15:29.870><c> got</c><02:15:29.989><c> a</c>

02:15:30.010 --> 02:15:30.020 align:start position:0%
so I think hopefully I think we've got a
