00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:00.450
E-voting is a terrible idea

00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.370
After Hurricane Sandy in 2012, election officials
in some parts of America decided that they'd

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.550
allow emergency e-voting from home. You'd
download a ballot paper, you'd fill it out,

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.429
and then you would email or fax it back to
them. And yes, some people still fax.

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:21.350
This was a terrible idea, and here's why.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.279
Physical voting is centuries old. In that
time, pretty much every conceivable method

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.910
of fraud has been tried, and has since been
defended against. Because of that, attacks

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.320
on physical voting don't scale well. It takes
so much effort, so many people and it only

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.940
takes one person to leak your conspiracy and
the whole thing falls apart.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.960
Electronic voting, though? You can attack
with one person. It can take about the same

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.879
effort to change one vote as it does to change
a million. And it can be done without even

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.610
setting foot in the country whose elections
you're trying to rig.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.430
There are two key parts of an election. Anonymity,
and trust. First of all, anonymity. You cannot

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.870
let anyone pay, bribe, or threaten in order
to change someone's vote. If you put any identifying

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.640
mark on your paper ballot, if you sign it,
if you write your name on it, if you do anything

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.220
that could, in theory, be used to check how
you voted, your vote is thrown out and ignored,

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.750
just so no-one can be forced or bribed to
vote a certain way.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.600
And yet, because you marked your vote, and
you put it into a sealed box, and that box

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.710
was only unsealed when it was surrounded by
everyone with a stake in the election, you

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.470
know that your vote has still been counted,
even though you'll never see it again.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.650
That's the other key: trust. You never, ever,
ever, trust any one individual. Ideally, you

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.770
don't trust any two, or three. People can
be bribed, can be threatened, can be incompetent.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.979
I mean, hell, people have been all three of
those things. But like I said: the more physical

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.790
votes you want to change, the more people
it takes and the less possible your attack

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.610
gets. Everyone can see what's happening and
keep an eye on each other, particularly if

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.020
they don't trust the other side.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.110
So let's talk about voting machines.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.750
Problem 1: Auditing the software and hardware

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.649
In theory, you could have open source software
that everyone has checked and everyone is

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.940
happy with and that's been used for years.
In theory. Never mind that you only actually

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.810
do a full-scale test of this software every
few years when there's actually an election,

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.640
let's say theoretically it can be done.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.099
But how do you make sure that software is
what's actually loaded on that voting machine

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.620
in front of you on the day of the election?

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.300
And I know that immediately, someone is going
to want to comment about checksums or crypto.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.750
Which is great, except now you have to trust
the software that's checking that hash. Or

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.780
more likely, the one person that's checking
it for you. You've just moved the problem.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.810
And if you're thinking "I could verify that",
then turn your brain the other way, and think

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.099
"how could I break that?" because there are
trillions of dollars -- that's not an exaggeration

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.110
-- riding on the result of big elections,
and that's an incredible motivation. If you're

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.470
coming up with sneaky ways to get around it...
believe me, so are lots of other people.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.640
It might be one angry techie, but it might
be an entire political party, or the huge

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.930
corporations who want one party to win, or
entire nation states who want one party to

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:05.230
win.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.590
And all that is assuming you're even allowed
to verify the software that's running, which

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.280
you never are, because plugging unknown USB
sticks into a voting machine is a bad idea.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.989
Not that that stops people plugging unknown
USB sticks into a voting machine. It has literally

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.450
happened. Let's remember, these machines have
to be left in a room with the voter and no-one

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.250
else in order for them to cast their vote
anonymously. Oh, by the way, the machines

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.560
are frequently programmed by sticking a USB
into each of them in turn, so if you compromise

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.519
the first one, jackpot.

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.780
In practice, you don't have open source software,
you have proprietary, unaudited software which

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.549
you just have to trust. This is real, by the
way, around the world, there are some elections

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.400
that run on this. And remember what I said?
This is an election. You don't trust.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.709
And maybe you're thinking, you could have
an audit trail, you could have a paper backup

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.269
that the machine prints out as you vote. In
which case, congratulations, you've just invented

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.360
the world's most expensive pencil. One of
the reasons Britain gives people pencils for

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.390
voting, by the way, is because we're worried
that pens might be switched by any voter to

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:11.390
contain disappearing ink. Erasing pencil ballots?
Takes time, and if you can do that, you can

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:15.849
just throw them away. Disappearing ink? It
might be an urban legend, but it might actually

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.570
be a plausible attack vector. This is the
level of paranoia we need to work at here.

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.130
And don't think you can get away with all
this by using a pile of paper ballots and

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.560
just counting them electronically, either:
an electronic counting machine is still a

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.770
black box that a pile of ballots goes into
and a mysterious number comes out of. They've

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.680
got exactly the same problems.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.290
Problem 2: Votes In Transit

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.220
There are three ways of moving the magic electronic
ballot numbers from the voting machines to

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.490
the final count.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.560
You could treat the machine like a regular
ballot box, you seal it in a plastic bag,

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.830
move the physical machine with two people
in the vehicle to the count, and then unseal

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.800
it there. No-one does this.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.850
You could copy the result onto a handy USB
stick and move that instead. Do I need to

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.310
run through how easily... no. Okay.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.139
Or, and this is what usually happens, you
could tell the voting machine to upload the

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.620
results over the internet, optionally through
a third central server, and potentially not

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:16.620
over a secure connection, and probably without
any checksums or tests. [exasperating]

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.110
Problem 3: Central Count Program

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.840
And right at the end, there's the program
that takes all these numbers, all these votes,

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.710
and produces a final count. Now you've got
all the same problems you have with the individual

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.530
voting machines, except now only a few people
can even see that machine, and it's been hidden

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.520
away in a private warehouse somewhere for
the last few years. Good luck verifying that.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.370
And all this -- all this -- is before we even
talk about online voting.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.610
I could talk about all the ways which you
could hijack ballots, block an email address

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.180
-- because after Hurricane Sandy, the ballots
were sent by email -- or any of the ways you

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.340
could do a man-in-the-middle attack on that.
All possible.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.460
And those are just if it's a well designed
system.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.620
There are reports of actual live elections
where there were cross-site scripting attacks

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.740
in the e-voting page, where they'd misspelled
one party's name, and where they'd put the

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.330
wrong party's logo next to a candidate. Sorry,
did I say elections? I meant election. That

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.430
was all the same election, it was in Hampshire
in 2007.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.289
But never mind all that.

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:25.289
Depending on which security company you believe,
somewhere around 5% and 50% of desktop computers

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.300
are infected with something. And that's just
the scammers trying to set up botnets and

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.080
minor extortions using private computers.
If you want to affect a load of votes, try

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.600
infecting the computers at the public library.
But never mind all that.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:41.150
We've seen what big scary countries and big
scary corporations can do when they put their

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:46.590
mind to it. Given that someone designed an
immensely complicated worm that spread around

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:52.039
the world just to break some Iranian centrifuges,
imagine what someone could do if they wanted

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:53.800
to throw an online election.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.740
Remember, again, when you hear "just trust
us", or "just trust me", or "it's a computer,

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:03.690
it doesn't go wrong" in an election, something
has already gone disastrously wrong.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.880
Imagine all this electronic voting, only without
computers. Would you be happy walking up to

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.750
someone anonymous in a ballot box, or worse,
calling a number on your phone, just telling

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.360
them your vote -- but they promise to keep
it secret -- and at the end of the election

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.000
all those people, who have been sitting on
their own, phone up one other person in private

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.169
and tell their results, and then that final
person -- who promises to count it all up

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:27.620
accurately -- announces who's won? Because
that's essentially what electronic voting

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:34.090
is. It is a terrible idea, and if a government
ever promises to use it, hope they don't manage

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.000
it before you get a chance to vote 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.400
them out.
