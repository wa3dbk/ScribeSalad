00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
So most people make their money from... uh

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.740
not writing boxed applications but actually writing

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.740
custom software and making kind of

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.060
improvements to software, and fixing software for other people.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.560
And actually free software is a wonderful place to do that kind of work.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.500
I've been doing free software for a long time.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.340
Previously I worked... uh... way, way back now... 10 years ago

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.420
in NHS IT. It's the National Health Service IT project

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.800
based in Leeds, in the UK.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.800
And my job there was really to maintain... um...

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.160
some free software we were using to power our website.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.940
So we had... um... a thing called Plone.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.360
And we were using Apache and Linux and GNU and Debian

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.440
And all these other things to kind of

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.160
make this thing happen.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.260
So my job was primarily to make sure that kept working

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.740
to add features to it, to add new functionality

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.140
and to kind of maintain it.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.000
And so I was paid to do that job

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.480
And I left there, went to the University of Manchester,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.280
And had a job that also paid me to make and maintain free software.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.800
And there's kind of an overriding pattern here, where I did that for a lot of my jobs.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.760
At the free software foundation, my job was more focused on campaigning.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.920
I was the masterhead behind some campaigns like

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.980
Defective by Design, Windows 7 Sins, PlayOgg for a coupla years.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.640
So I would write articles

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.460
and I would do a lot of editorial-type work

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.460
on those things.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.200
But at the same time, maintaining my own free software projects... uh...

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.200
in my spare time.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.100
And now I'm at Creative Commons,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.360
and Creative Commons - surprise, surprise -

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.220
pays me to uh... look after free software projects

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.460
and to maintain and write free software.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.220
And so, um,

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.220
if you would like to work in this kind of field,

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.940
I would suggest you... become reasonably good at programming,

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.520
you know your licenses, know your background

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.200
and kind of have a... strong desire to make free software a reality

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.280
and people need free software developers.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.940
Um, WordPress is a great example of a very, very

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.120
common piece of free software,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.860
that's not going away anytime soon.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.800
People will always need people to write plugins,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.640
help the people, be supportive

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.140
Um, write themes, write add-ons for WordPress

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.280
And if you're really good at free software development,

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.120
then you can even, y'know, work on WordPress itself!

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.620
Y'know WordPress is a community project, too, so people need...

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.420
The people who work on WordPress are volunteers, primarily

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.640
in their spare time.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.040
But, some of them also work for the company behind WordPress.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.040
And so I think... the very best WordPress developers  in the world

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.440
get the opportunity to work, full-time, as their paid job on WordPress.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.700
You have to start somewhere,

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.980
you don't just get a job in free software from nowhere, but you can uh...

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.080
If you already have a job writing programming, doing programming stuff

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160
you probably already use some free software tools.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.640
See if you can convince your boss

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.320
to allow you to release your changes

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.440
out to the world. And if you can, then

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.420
find the right community and give them the changes back

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.420
and you could very soon find yourself doing that for a living.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.960
[Sean] How does it work in terms of

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.360
organizing teams of developers to kind of maintain free software.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.660
[Matt] The way it really works is that, um...

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.740
If you are a developer and you enjoy a piece of software,

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.220
you can be part of its upkeep.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.160
So, generally speaking, most software that's free software

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.780
is developed in public, using sites like Sourceforge historically

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.480
or nowadays in things like Gitorious or Github.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.420
You can go along, get a copy of the code,

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.940
find bugs, fix bugs, add new features

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.640
and kind of push that code, that you've made,

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.700
back to the main development team.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.460
In general, what happens is there's kind of a process whereby

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.340
You send in a few bugfixes,

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.540
a few, like, suggestions

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.940
and then eventually, after a while,

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.760
they get kinda like, "This guy's okay

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.620
we'll let him into the team."

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.920
And then, you become part of that development team.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.520
If they use Git, for example,

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.400
go and check out a copy of the Git code

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.340
and, make your changes locally,

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.040
but also, as you make your changes, check those changes into Git.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.220
So that you have your own version of that code locally

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.720
You can kind of back-and-forth through it

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.560
and kinda see what you did along the way.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.020
And when you makes commits to that good Git project

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.400
make good comments, so you kind of remember what you did.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.540
Don't just leave a one-line, sarcastic response, which is what I often do.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.060
Try and leave good comments

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.120
and that way you'll kind of be able to go back in time

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.440
and see what you did.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.660
And then when ultimately,

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.240
when you eventually get those changes adopted by

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.080
the big community project,

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.860
they'll be able to see the same thing you can see

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:16.840
they'll be able to see what you did.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.600
And so, it's not so important to structure your code super-well

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.860
because, as long as you kind of make it work and you make good comments

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.740
then that can be cleaned up afterwards.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.280
Look at companies like MySQL

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.980
and redhat, and they've made lots and lots of money from doing free software stuff.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.380
So, you would definitely

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.380
[Sean] Canonical are one one of those are they as well?

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.720
[Matt] Canonical does have teams developing

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.360
certain pieces of free software.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.180
I think the difference between Canonical and redhat is that

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.320
redhat develops software that's generally widely used

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.840
by all the free software users,

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.740
like Gnome Desktop and other things

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.060
whereas I think what Canonical does is a different model

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.200
and they actually develop kinda their own free software.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.820
They release it as free software but it's mostly used for

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.260
the Ubuntu community and the Ubuntu users.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.960
It's not so widely used outside of Ubuntu.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.000
That's not an unreasonable thing

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.020
that's a, y'know, perfectly valid way to create software, y'know.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.860
And, of course, there's nothing stopping

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.040
the teams at redhat and other companies and other organizations

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.480
from taking the Canonical code and reusing it for other things.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.260
y'know, so...

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.560
If you are gonna

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.000
take code from other projects,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.340
and you can of course do that,

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.020
then you make sure that the code you take is under a license that works

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.160
with the license of the project you're taking things into.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.420
So, for example, if you're taking code from, um...

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.620
WordPress, you can't really take that code and put into a project that not under the GPL.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.320
You would have a hard time wrangling that

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.660
and you would have an even harder time getting your changes

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.780
taken in by another project

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.800
because that file would then be under

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.780
at least partially under the GPL.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.860
You should never let that kind of thing

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.540
dissuade you from taking stuff,

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.940
because it's free software, it's there to be taken

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.280
but, at the same time, you should just know the obligations

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.720
that you then have, um, as a developer

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.460
to kind of make your changes available to people.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.220
So that, y'know, when you take your widget

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.900
from something that's GPL

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.400
and you put it on the web,

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.840
you then have to make sure that people can get the source code

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.360
to your changes, too; you can't just uh...

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.200
[Sean] Is that the share-alike sign?

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.360
[Matt] That's the share-alike part of things, exactly, yeah.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.980
So if you have companies that for some reason don't want to use free software,

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.720
well then, take advantage of them

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.360
and sell them a copy for 2,000 dollars or 10,000 dollars

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.800
whatever you can get,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.380
but, the same product should be free software at the same time

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.060
for those of us who are in the community that want

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.120
to take it and improve it and share it.
