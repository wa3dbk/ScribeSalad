00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
It's quite clear from the first of these that we've put out that people love the Lego model

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.019
Or at least a lot of people do find it useful so yeah, we want to take it on a bit further today

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.259
We have this

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.559
pre-Prepared linked list of

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.470
barbecue items which are all in alphabetical order and last time we covered about

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.469
How would you insert a new item?

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.900
Into this list if it was something that you'd forgotten to buy and you bought it later

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:39.540
This thing called p is pointing at exactly the same structure at the head of the list as start is

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.980
So we now have got the problem of inserting burgers alphabetically into this thing list

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.040
Now doing that with conventional techniques

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.680
Well, we covered that before and it it's ok it works, but it's somewhat messy

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.640
I wasn't happy - never have been happy over the years with the way that that's done in the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.320
Conventional single level pointer technique is there anything you can do that's better?

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.180
Well yes, there is this came about or was made clear to me many years ago now in that...

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.520
I, as many of you know

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.019
originally did this in a language in the early 70s called ALGOL 68 and

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.349
The people who had done the ALGOL 68 compiler for the machine we were working on was the Royal Radar

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.530
Establishment in Malvern in the UK and

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:34.559
One or other people there who did that compiler could be Subhan Kuba Phillip would would just said

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.329
To me and my colleague Annie walker at the time. They said you're teaching this stuff now

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.220
You do realize that algol 68 can do the triple ref technique?

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.030
Which previously has only been available to Assembler programmers?

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.960
We said really can it yes?

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:58.600
And yes, it can so what on earth is this well despite that technical name it's actually a pointers to pointers technique

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.840
It's very powerful, and you might think well

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.040
If you've got pointers why on Earth would you want pointers to pointers?

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.060
well the strange thing about this and the really remarkable thing is that in the end it makes your

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.840
procedure for doing things

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.880
simpler not more complicated

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.950
So what do we do? Well,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.840
We've got Burgers here

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.720
And we're going to try and put it into the correct place just as before but instead of using a previous single level

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.850
pointer and then having to say well

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.210
It's all very well they can probe what the strings are

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.920
But what you had is the problem was you've forgotten the way you came from

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.689
And when you splice burgers into this list you need to know what's ahead of you

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.469
But you need to know where you came from it's the previous blue box

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:52.190
And if you're not careful you lose any way of getting on that, so if you look at my solution using traditional techniques

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.120
I carefully keep a second pointer to remember where it came from this will no longer be necessary here we go

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.660
We introduce a thing which I'm going to call tracer

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.100
Tracers contents are of type pointer to pointer to things

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:15.380
So the way you declare that in C, is it's a thing** because we declare things by their contents in C

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.350
So inside tracer is a thing **. It's a pointer to a pointer to a thing so therefore

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:28.860
It's absolutely right that you can make and look at this piece of chain here. That's to say that a pointer to a pointer

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.940
Although it's a pointer is not the same thing as a single-level pointer to a thing

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.920
It's perfectly okay for me to attach that to there

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.520
And saying that the contents of tracer is a pointer to a pointer to a thing

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:52.120
So I'm pointing to the address of a box which inside it has got a pointer to the thing which in this case is the head of the list.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.700
You basically use a technique known as casting of pointers, you can

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:05.200
take a jump you can dereference you can follow the link you can either do it once to get to here or

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:11.720
When you've got to there, you can jump the pointer again and get on to an actual thing at the head of the list

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.049
So it's two steps removed. Yeah, so starting here

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.029
You jump there you then you look along the black hose

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:26.659
And you say I'm looking at something called beer, and I want to put in my thing here

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.040
Which is burger and the idea of this is always that you insert ahead

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:38.180
Alphabetically of where you are if that's what fits. No burger isn't earlier than beer in the alphabet

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.459
It's later than beer so what you have to do now is to try and look ahead

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.909
At the next thing which we will discover is chips now

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.920
Here's the really cool thing about using the tracer pointer to pointer technique

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.150
Is that if inspecting beers had no we've not gone far enough yet?

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:04.669
What we now do instead of awkwardly moving our single level pointer down the list is take this blessed a great link and do

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.310
Wait for it folks. This is

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.909
Absolutely cool. Ok if I made tracer

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:18.199
Originally point at a blue box because type wise it was right then it follows that all of these blue boxes

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.920
In turn I can make it point through those to take a peek at the next one down in the list

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.139
It's as simple as that you see: Type

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:32.390
Theory by colors a green thing can point at the blue thing, but it can't point directly at a red thing

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.460
So you look at this and you think?

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:35.820
well

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.710
by the

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.469
Principle of colored Lego type theory if I can make the green thing point

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.780
It's any blue thing I can do that, and then you say, but what does that imply in the program?

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:56.119
It's implies in the program that you've got to be able to find the address of a blue box

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.929
That's embedded within a particular thing structure

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:05.570
And now look what you could then do is you start with tracer. You jump to that box

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:12.289
But then you jump down the firemen's hose and you can take a look and you see that the next thing is chips

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.150
You see wow

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.150
I've just seen beer I'm

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.630
Looking ahead by this sneaky technique, and I see chips. That's where I belong

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.619
I want the burger thing in there, so this is completely magic

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:31.460
But does it generalize? And does it work? And the answer is yes it does

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.479
because

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:35.379
by stepping

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:42.088
One step backwards and going through an intermediate blue box before you do anything the crucial advantage

00:06:42.088 --> 00:06:46.180
It gives you is that having decided that burgers does belong in here?

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:53.180
The problem we previously had of saying where the heck did I come from is solved because tracer is still pointing at it

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:59.669
So you say to tracer let me dereference you once and I've then got the address of the box

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:05.998
I want to alter so that it points at the burger thing and we end up just like we did I think last time

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:08.939
but using the tracer technique of saying

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.039
There goes burguer. We know we're in the right place, and if you remember

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.610
we constructed

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.199
Let's get this right do the long one first

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:21.789
That one

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:29.729
Goes here, and then finally you when you complete this splicing in operation by taking that

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:36.569
Pointer the previously came off the beer thing turning it round and putting it on the blue box

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.180
there, so

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:47.039
Job done, but the big point is that you were able to keep half a finger on where you came from?

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:53.818
That's the thing. At the same time as using that to look ahead and say yes, alphabetically I'm correct

00:07:53.820 --> 00:08:01.020
I'm after beer and before chips. It's like standing at a road sign and knowing that you're standing in London

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.740
Yeah. But the road sign says Bristol. Yes. You're standing at the point to where it's pointing

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.960
That we see both those things actually. 
Precisely so, that's right.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.820
So let's just take a quick look and honestly there's very daring of me

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:21.599
I've actually put out the routine that does this in C and will provide this for you if

00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:27.388
You don't believe that this works just compile the program. I give you and run it and say wow it does work
