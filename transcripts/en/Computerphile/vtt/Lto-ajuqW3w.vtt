00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600
Compression is reducing the amount of information

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.760
but without, in a sense, losing any of it.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.640
Trying to compress it and shorten it in such a way that you could in principle recover

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.260
the full information that you started with,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.380
but in terms of transmitting it over a network, it's going to cost you less

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.120
because you pay per bit or per byte or whatever.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.000
And if you could get the number of bytes down that you need to transmit

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.960
to get something across the wire, then that benefits everybody, generally.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.240
You do sometimes not compress because the following

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:46.040
drawback happens. If you compress something then you have to decompress it to get back the full story,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.040
that decompression takes time at the other end.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.200
You have to get a computer on it saying: "this was transmitted compressed,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.040
because it saved BT bandwidth cost,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.720
but now I'm at this end and I want to see the real picture, I've got to uncompress it."

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.860
So, the nice thing about not compressing, if you don't mind the amount of data,

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.860
is it's there at the other end and it's instantly processable.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.900
You compress data essentially by looking for repeated patterns and predictability.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.860
And I think, if you take an example, shall we say of a text file,

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.940
something that repeats itself over and over again

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.620
with the stock buzzphrases used over and over and over again is going to be pretty compressable.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.100
If somebody writes a report that's got the phrase

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.360
"meaningful and relevant scenarios at this point in time going forward",

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.060
then you take that out and it's being used a thousand times and it drives you mad

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.040
and you make one copy of it at the top of the file,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.360
and that's maybe, I don't know, 50 characters, 50 bites, and you say

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.560
"I'm NOT gonna spend 50 bites repeating that phrase everytime in this report,

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.900
I'm gonna compress it." You take one copy and take a note of where it occurs in the file.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.280
It occurs at &lt;start position&gt; 20, 800,1500 and so on.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.640
And you can save a huge amount because those numbers take three or four bytes each

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.680
not a hundred bytes every time.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.540
Pictures are harder, coming back to this idea of what makes things compressible

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.580
is predictability.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.760
Then, if you think about a photograph

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.380
some photographs, you could say, do have predictable areas.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.980
You could take, shall we say, a photograph of,

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.160
like on Microsoft Windows,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.180
there's a yellow desert island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.120
with one green tree.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.060
Now that's easy, because the Pacific is totally smooth,

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.060
you've got thousands of blue pixels,

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.340
you've got hundreds of yellow pixels for the desert island,

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.260
a few hundred more for the tree.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.540
So you can compress it, not by sending every single pixel individually,

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.420
but by saying: "There's the sea,

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.560
there's the color blue, there's a thousand of those, just replicate them,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.660
similarly for the desert island and the tree.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.720
So, that's what I mean about the element of predictability or common areas inside a picture.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.260
Now, the average photo you take

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.760
maybe fairly simple if it's an indoor photo with flat surfaces

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.840
but you imagine taking a photograph, for example,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:32.500
of a sports car race, or of an impressionist picture with blobs of painting all over,

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.220
all over the place, you know,

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.200
that's much more random and there isn't a pattern that you can pick up on to make it easily compressible.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.360
You best have to take a deep breath and say: "I'm gonna have to transmit the whole thing

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.200
because I can't see any patterns in here."

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.020
You were talking about these blue pixels, there may be a thousand blue pixels,

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.780
but the computer still has to know where to put every single one, so how are we saving time?

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.860
You still have to transmit some minimal information

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.880
as to where to start laying these pixels out on the screen.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.440
You say: "start at such and such a position, and the XY, you know how wide the picture is,

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.920
just spew out ten thousand blue pixels and see how it fits in."

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:19.300
What you don't have to say is "here is the spec of the blue pixel for position 1000, here is the same spec

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.680
for the blue pixel at position 1001", you don't need to do that.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.660
You just send the spec once and say "replicate it for hundred, or whatever times".

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.660
Well, I'm making it simpler than it is.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.480
Perhaps one good example would be the JPEG compression.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.160
It's very common, has to be done to be able to get photographs down for size

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.400
to uploading to sites like Picasa and Flickr, they're not going to be happy

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.840
having every single one of your photos taking up 20 MB and being utterly perfect.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.320
They want to compress it down to kilobytes.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:05:00.360
And the problem is that many, particularly scenery and so on, is inately random enough looking

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.060
that it's not easy to compress.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:09.260
So JPEG is an example of a compression that goes by the name of 'lossy'.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.620
When we discussed earlier about compression, in the text case,

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.280
I put it to you that you could always recover the exact file

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.300
because you had your buzzphrase, all the places it was replicated,

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.900
nothing to stop you at the far end undoing all that and building it back exactly as it was with no loss.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.500
In a photographic case, you could try and do that, but you wouldn't get much compression,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.720
because there's no predictability.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:42.220
So what JPEG does, is it basically says: "if you allow me to do some really clever things,

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.920
I will try and get more compression out of it

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:52.800
but I may make the edges of your picture look a bit blurry and fuzzy as you magnify them."

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.220
And it's doing it by all sorts of tricks, about

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:03.160
dividing the picture up in two, blocks and squares, and saying "well, this is almost the same green,

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.620
I'll use this as an approximation."

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.820
It's never recoverable exactly the way you started

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.380
but you get a lot more compression that way, if you don't mind an approximation.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:21.360
And for people in the human visual system looking at something that can often be pretty good.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.640
Particularly on a screen.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.780
What are the compressing geniuses in their compression HQ trying to do at the moment

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.620
or is it kind of, have they reached their limit? Surely, this has a limit?

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:38.200
There is a limit, this is something that's covered by fascinating topical information theory.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.040
Information theory will tell you

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.400
what is called the entropy limit.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.540
Now, many viewers of this video will have heard of entropy, and will freeze solid,

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.740
because they were taught it in physics and chemistry, right?

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:57.680
As a computer scientist, and an ex-chemist, let me tell you learning about entropy is a lot easier

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.580
from a computer science standpoint.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.280
No question about it.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.780
You can work out, for example,

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:12.100
what's the minimum number of bits I need to transmit a piece of information in a lossless way.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.560
Let's concentrate on that.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.320
What's the minimum number of bits I can get away with, and, I could,...

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.800
Let's get you a piece of paper.
