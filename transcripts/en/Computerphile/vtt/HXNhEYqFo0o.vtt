00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
[There's] a lot of interesting stuff both from the
point of view of the content but also

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.450
the historical context between, y' know
"When were `for' loops invented?". Well

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.250
that's what Algol called them but prior
to that FORTRAN called them DO loops.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.380
And prior to that they existed in assembler.
So, first of all, what's the history and

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.029
what does it get you when you can do
loops, but when do you run out of steam,

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:34.230
even with loops, and you have to use this
shock! horror! Pure Mathematicians thing -

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:42.510
that computer scientists have to learn
about - recursion?! It was a real culture

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.289
shock, it really was, in the roughly
1940s, 1950s to suddenly find

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.890
out that what the theoreticians had been
drivelling on about for years - about recursive

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.680
functions in mathematics - actually was of
massive, massive importance for computer

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.560
science. Back in the '40s and early
'50s it was all Assembler - or a

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.890
slightly dressed-up thing called a macro
assembler, where you can have little

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.659
routines full of, y' know, packaged
assembler instructions which could be

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.770
called up, as and when needed. So, that
sort of served people for quite some

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:31.070
time. But probably one of the first
high-level languages to introduce loops

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.140
was good old FORTRAN [shows textbook]. Even though 
that was published in '65 Fortran itself goes

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.560
back, I think, for almost ten years before
that. It was invented by John Backus and

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.409
a large team of people at IBM in the
1950s. Many of you will know it. It's an

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:56.909
excellent language for engineering and
scientific calculations. It is low level.

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:05.009
I mean, when you look at the nature of a
FORTRAN loop it's almost like doing it

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.660
in assembler - but not quite. They didn't
call them for loops - they called them DO loops.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.700
What I'm saying here is - you package all this
up - where you're saying

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.640
repeat the following sequence of
instructions, which I've done with my

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.310
wavy lines here. Keep doing them until
you hit the statement with a numeric

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:31.079
label on it of 180. The loop back from
the statement labelled 180, back up to

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:36.480
here to increment the loop counter, which
you're all familiar with in languages

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.569
like C. It wasn't done, as it would
be in C, by saying: "Here's my block of

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.040
stuff to be repeated it's inside these
curly braces". Here you can see it's a lot

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.299
more like assembler, a lot more low-level.
I mean there's nothing magic about "180"; it could

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:57.780
be "72"; it depended on your labelling
system. Implicitly here, in a simple

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.859
thing like this, you'd start off [with the counter] 
at one and every time I returned back here it would

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:08.459
reset [the counter] to be 2, 3, 4 and so on up to
and including 10. It's comforting for

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.120
those who were coming from assembler
into a higher-level language to see

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.530
something that was only slightly higher
level, in sophistication, than assembler was.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.459
How did loops become more "powerful",
if you like?

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.609
Well, again, even in assembler and even in
FORTRAN, there's no reason why you

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:33.840
couldn't have a loop within a loop. So I
might have, outside of all this code, yet

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:44.189
another layer of DO. What shall we say:
"DO 200 J = 1, 20". So, there might

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:49.620
be some more statements between 180 and
200, who knows, but again, you see, a

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.949
numeric label. And can see what's
happening is that for every setting of J,

00:03:55.949 --> 00:04:00.959
which will start at 1 and go up to 20,
for every single one of those J settings

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:06.120
the inner loop will be running through
the complete spectrum of settings of I

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.849
going from 1 to 10. So you will have 200
locations [that] are being affected here.

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.169
Basically going through the rows and
columns of a matrix. All sorts of

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.570
calculations in physics, chemistry and
particularly engineering just rely on

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.919
two-dimensional arrays full of numbers
- either integers or scientific numbers

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.010
with a decimal point. and so on. Even hard-core

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.550
assembly programmers had to admit if you were
doing heavy scientific programming it was

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.210
nice to be a little bit more abstract
and to have this sort of facility

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:42.979
available to you. Now you might say: "Well,
what came along to spoil the party then ?"

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:48.350
or "How did people realize that this was
wonderful but not quite enough?" 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.310
The compiler of course has got to be
tolerant and has got to be capable of

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:58.040
compiling nested DO loops correctly but
how deep would it let you nest them?

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.870
Well, I'm guessing, I would suspect that
the early FORTRAN compilers probably

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.970
wouldn't allow you to go more than about
10 deep, maximum. And I think you and I

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.260
Sean have just been looking up what are the
current limits in C?  I seem to remember

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:18.110
the earliest `gcc' was something like 32
But Ithink we looked up this ... some C++

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:24.650
nowadays allows you to do nested loops
256 deep! And, of course, there are

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.080
multi-dimensional problems that might
actually need that, because it it doesn't

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.760
take much knowledge of higher maths to
realize if you've got a loop within a loop

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.099
the outer loop goes around n times; the
inner loop is going around n times, you

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:45.410
are then coping with an n-squared
problem. If you put the third loop inside

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:51.080
the other two you're coping with a cubic,
three-dimensional, problem. So what we're

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:57.080
saying is all these multi-dimensional
polynomial-going-on-exponential problems,

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.820
that come up quite naturally, you can
cope with them in nested for-loops so

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:09.740
long as they don't need to be more than
power-32 or power-256 or whatever it is. 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.580
And you think, well, that should be enough for
anybody! There's these multi-dimensional

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.710
problems you can just do them by nesting
`for' loops and surely [a depth of] 256 is

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.500
enough for anybody? What kind of problem
wouldn't it be enough for? Well, a lot of

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:30.979
theoretical computer scientists of my
knowledge amused me greatly when - those of

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:37.880
them that will own up to this - back in
the 60s. People started going to lectures

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.210
from mathematicians, theoreticians, people concerned

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:48.840
with "Godel Computability" and so on. And
of course, those sort of people, were very

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:54.510
familiar indeed, at a mathematical level,
with Ackermann's function. Now, as you know -

00:06:54.510 --> 00:07:00.360
you and I - we've done that one: 
&gt;&gt; Sean: Was that "The most difficult ... ?"
&gt;&gt; DFB:  "The most difficult number to compute, question mark"

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:06.570
&lt;Ackermann video insert&gt;
"We set this going four weeks ago
nearly now the first few are vanished ..."
&lt;/Ackermann video insert&gt;

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:11.370
So what made it so difficult?
well you write down Ackermann's function and

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:19.620
it very clearly ends up with routines
calling themselves recursively in a very

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:24.840
very complicated way. Now I think your
average sort of engineer would be happy

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.160
to say that there's this thing called `factorial'
which is 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.780
or whatever. And you could do that in a
loop as well as doing this fancy

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:41.220
recursion thing, but a lot of
theoreticians admitted to me they saw a

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:49.170
Ackermann's function and said: "I could try that
out in FORTRAN !". Now what they perhaps

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:52.350
didn't realize - but it became famous by 1960 - is:

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:57.960
FORTRAN is wonderful, but original
FORTRAN did not do user-level recursion

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.640
You could write a thing called ACK.
You could actually get it to call itself

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:07.590
in FORTRAN. But you might have been
expecting that every time it called

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:12.900
itself it would lay out a data area for
each recursive call they're called "stack

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.800
frames" - we know that now. You get lots of
stack frames, one on top of another and

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.880
as you come back through the recursion
they're deleted and thrown away and you

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:26.040
climb back into your main program.
FORTRAN doesn't do that. It sets

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.660
aside one stack frame. You keep calling
yourself recursively it just tramples

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:35.610
in its muddy gumboots over all your
data area and you end up with total

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:40.380
garbage. It no more gives you values of the
Ackermann function than fly to the moon!

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:47.370
And people said: "I then realized the
importance of having user-level

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:52.140
recursion, in programming languages, to
cope with those really hard problems

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:56.430
that fell outside nested for-loops".
Algol was famous in that its routines

00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:01.440
could call themselves recursively and
could get the right answer and, for

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:07.470
limited low-order values of Ackermann's
function - very slow, very slow indeed - but

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:11.520
it would come out with the right answer.
&gt;&gt; Sean: Is there any need to think of an example of a

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.960
problem, or program, because Ackermann
feels to me like it's the test-bed.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.980
You know, when you're testing out a
motor-car you might take it on the track

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.490
and see how fast it can go.
But in day-to-day life that car might

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:29.070
only get half that speed. What's the
real-world kind of equivalent? Is there

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:34.230
such a thing?
&gt;&gt; DFB: Real world equivalent?
&gt;&gt; Sean: ... of something that might need to use

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:38.910
recursion ... ?
&gt;&gt; DFB: ... of that complexity? Not many things

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:44.640
is the answer to that. I mean, yes, it's
true that Ackermann, as you know, was David

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.930
Hilbert's research student. And the
challenge was on to find something that

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:55.590
was so innately recursive that - remember
it was "generally recursive", they called it -

00:09:55.590 --> 00:10:00.150
as opposed to "primitive recursive". And
simple things like factorial and indeed

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:05.640
indeed Fibonacci, are primitive recursive.
So I think you're right that you really

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.540
are just making the point that
eventually there are things that will

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:17.540
kill you. I think the question in the
middle is: "Is there something out there -

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:23.910
pieces of program you need to write -
where non-trivial recursion, in a sense,

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:29.640
is needed but not quite to the
horrendous degree that Ackermann did. And the

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:37.740
answer is:  "Yes, compilers is where it hit
people".  Because although early FORTRAN

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:43.080
did not provide user-level recursion, for
you and me, nevertheless John Backus and

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.560
his team implemented it in the middle
1950s I think at IBM.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:53.410
And Backus wrote articles afterwards
basically saying: "We didn't know enough

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:57.340
about recursion and even though we
didn't provide it for the users of our

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:02.080
language, boy did we need it in the
compiler! And

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:08.190
we ended up inventing it in all but name"
The syntactic structures of what is

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:13.150
legal, in a language, even at the level
just of arithmetic statements can be

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:17.500
quite recursive. Because you end up with
brackets within brackets within brackets

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:22.839
all with a multiplier outside. And which
order do you do the brackets in? And, you

00:11:22.839 --> 00:11:28.540
know, how how many levels of bracket
nesting can you have. And if you don't

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:34.660
get things sorted out correctly then
you'll get the wrong answer. But once again

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:40.960
the problem could be that your users
would come up to you and present you

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:46.390
with a problem just designed to test out
your compiler, and whether it was robust

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:50.410
enough to be able to cope with a high
degree of nesting even just in

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:58.540
arithmetic statements. So by 1960 in
Algol, yeah, the there were enough users, at

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:03.550
the user level, who could see that a
modicum of recursion, perhaps more

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:08.530
complicated than factorial but not quite
up to full Ackermann capabilities would be

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:15.940
very nice indeed to have within your language. 
&lt;trailer for EXTRA BITS video&gt;
Again referring back to that

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:21.310
original video, I had a lot of really
interesting mail from various people who

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:28.420
said to me: "OK, you said that this is an
innately recursive problem and it just

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:33.000
had to have general recursion capabilities? 
Well I .... "
&lt;/end of trailer&gt;
