00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.310
previously we look at how we can build a
simple memory circuit

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.189
from NOR gates. Today we're gonna look at
how we can take this further and see how

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.929
computer memory's built in a bit more
detail.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.179
So if you remember the previous video, and if you haven't seen it

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.020
well, click the link below. We had this
circuit here, which has got two

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.900
NOR gates in it, wired so that the output of
one NOR gate

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.050
feeds back to the input of the other and so
on with the other one.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.230
We had two inputs to the circuit S and
R which stood for 'set'

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.780
and 'reset' &amp; we had two outputs Q and Q bar which is the inverted Q.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.120
If we took the set input high

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.829
the output went high and it remained
high even if the set output went

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.230
low again and the same with the reset
thing. If we took that high

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.329
then it reset Q back to zero, or low

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.960
and so on. The circuit remembered what
state we put it in.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.360
So this is a useful circuit, it's referred
to as an SR latch

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.930
but often we want to store not just
setting a bit

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.479
and resetting it we actually want to store
whatever data is on this

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.080
line which we'll call D for 'data', So we're gonna have another input

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.229
which we'll call 'clock' and when that's
high,

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.590
we want that to remember whatever data
is on D. So let's have a look at how we

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.979
can map these inputs into the inputs

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.659
of our previous circuit to do that. So it helps if we actually have a look

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.259
at the truth table of what input we have
coming in. So we've got our data bit coming in

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.720
and we have our clock signal coming in
and we're going to produce

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.040
outputs S and R. Now we need to map these

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.130
to the outputs S &amp; R so whenever clock is
zero we don't want the values to

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.299
change so we want the output to S &amp; R

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.040
to be zero. Now if the data is 0 and clock
is 1

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.240
then we want the thing to be reset so we want the reset pin to be high

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.970
so we want S to have 0 output from it and we want R

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.649
to have a 1 output from it. If
D is 1

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.180
and clock is 1 then we want to change
the value 'cause our clock pin is high

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.140
D is 1 so we want to set it. So we want to take S to be 1 and R to be 0.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.360
So we now know for all
of our inputs, what we want the outputs to be

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.560
and so we need to build a set of logic
gates here

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.500
that will map these inputs to the

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.730
outputs here. So we need to think of some circuit that is true

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.040
for S when both D is 1 and clock is 1

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.960
If you remember your logic
gates the simple circuit that is true when both

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.130
of its inputs are true

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.160
is the AND gate so we can draw in

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.290
an AND gate that's connected to the S pin
and its inputs

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.490
are the clock signal and the D signal so when both of them

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.459
are 1, then the output is true so the set pin
is taken high

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.939
and the output of this sets the circuit.
Need to do the same to reset it

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.180
&amp; we want reset to be 1

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.300
when D is zero and clock is one

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.520
now an OR circuit's no good because if we
OR'd them then 1 &amp; 1 would also be true

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.970
and we wouldn't want reset and set to be
set at the same time

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.050
so what we do is we use another AND gate, connect that up to the

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.160
clock signal but we also need to have a
signal that is true

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.480
when data or D is 0 and so the
easiest way to do that

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.920
is to use a NOT gate like that and connect that into the circuit.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Normally when we're writing circuits, drawing that out

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.959
in full takes up a lot of space, so we
just reduce it down

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.880
to a simple rectangle and this is what's
referred to

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.260
as a 'D latch' and the reason why it's
called a latch is because

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.430
when clock is high then the output will
follow whatever

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.110
D is, it'll change as D changes
while the output is high. When clock is low

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.650
the output is frozen at whatever it
previously was. There is another type of circuit

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.970
which is called a flip flop, which is drawn in very similar

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.579
fashion the difference with this though
is that the data is only remembered

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.890
when this transitions from being low

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.140
to high. So when the signal on this
input goes from being low

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.260
to being high (this is at low and this is at high)

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.310
as it's changing it remembers whatever
the data is

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.560
at that point there and the rest of the time
it's fixed

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.090
so it keeps that going - until it goes high again

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.620
and it remembers at this point whatever it was when it changed from low

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.780
to high. Both these circuits are used in
building computers but this one in

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.260
particular can be used

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.489
to build memory circuits that store
things

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.760
so what we're going to do now is look at how we can put these together to build up

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.480
memory for our computer. With the D flip-flop we can store a single bit

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.040
of information but often on a computer
we want to store more than that.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.600
We want to store a byte, 32 bits worth and so on

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.120
or we'll want have to have several bits and we can choose which one

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.520
we want to select, so let's have a look at how we can store more than one bit

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.060
Now the simplest case to understand when you install something like a byte

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.230
or a 32-bit word or a 64-bit word or even a 128-bit word is something you get these days

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.910
now the way you do that is - if you remember how binary

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.190
numbers work, we store it as a series of bits.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.720
Inside a computer the data is stored along the various wires and each bit

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.290
is stored on its own individual wires. If
you look carefully

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.080
on the back of this motherboard you'll see
that coming off the processor here

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.810
you have lots and lots of wires, that go
together. Now some of these are used to tell it

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.680
where to store things but others
are actually carrying the data

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.520
We've got 16 lines on the motherboard with
which to transfer the data between the

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.800
various chips. Each wire stores one bit

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.919
So one wire stores 'bit 0' - one wire stores 'bit 1' and so on.

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.159
So our circuit uses several wires to
carry the data.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.460
Now if we wanted to store a 16- or
32-bit number it's very simple.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.940
We're gonna use four-bits here just because it saves on drawing

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:52.180
So our input would be one, two, three, four input wires,

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.620
and they'd be labelled something like that

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.479
and if we wanted to store, say, that four bit
number, what we'd do is we'd have

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:04.279
four flip-flops - and we connect each of the data pins,

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:09.100
up to a different flip-flop, but we now need it to store things when we want it to,

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.280
so remember we had this input here which when we took it from low to high

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:16.020
would store everything well we just
connect them altogether

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.330
like so, like that and then we have a
single signal

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.970
here which we can use to tell it to store
anything - so when we put the data on here

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.770
and transition this one from low to high
all four of these flip-flops will remember

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.770
that data and the outputs here will be the data that we wanted to store.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.800
So storing multiple bits is really easy,
we just have multiple flip flops

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.500
each flip-flop stores one particular bit of information

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.960
If we wanted 8, then we'd have 8 flip-flops - if we wanted to store a 32-bit word

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:44.289
we'd have 32

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:48.169
now you can actually buy these pre-made
so what we've got here

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:51.879
are 3 8-bit registers as they're called because they can store

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:55.250
8 bits but they're basically just 8 flip
flops

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.090
with 8 inputs and an input that we can
use to

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.150
tell it to store things and the eight outputs and then you've got the voltage supply &amp; the ground

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.700
to actually power the chip.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:13.759
So that's how we can store multiple bits that are stored in parallel, that make up, say, a byte or so on.

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:18.080
&amp; if we look at this SIM that we took out of
the Apple Macintosh

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.160
then we can see that there are 8 chips. Now you don't have to have them as separate chips

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.620
but often they are so we've got 8 chips here

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:28.280
and each one of these chips will be wired up to store a different bit of the byte.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.180
Doesn't have to be the case, if you look
at some other SIMs you'll find

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.080
that they perhaps only have 2 chips in
or perhaps even just one and so on

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.659
it doesn't make any difference 'cause the
implementation is the same

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:43.359
but in this case they actually used 8 chips
on the SIM to store things.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:48.360
So that's how we can
store 8 bits whether a byte or a word we just have 8

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.670
single bit 'things' in parallel.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.500
But, if you've done any programming with computers, you'll know that you can store

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:59.099
more than one thing's and you can
address them all separately

00:07:59.099 --> 00:08:01.239
and we'll look at that in another video

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.010
