00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880
So I've been watching back over some old Computerphile videos

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.260
as we all do

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.900
and I was watching a video by Tom Rodden on cookies

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.520
Rodden: How then do you do the little shopping carts?

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.600
Pound: And he talks a lot about tracking cookies, which are a big deal, alright.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.800
And just a side note, I would say everyone should install Ghostery

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.960
and stop people tracking their whereabouts and what they're up to

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.080
and what they're browsing online.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.280
But I'm not talking about tracking cookies today – or persistent cookies – I'm talking about cookie stealing

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.720
which is the idea of if I can get ahold of your cookie from your browser, in some way,

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.580
I can then pretend to be you on that website.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.560
Perhaps a bit of a recap on what it is that a cookie does

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.140
so that this puts it into context.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.380
Now of course if you want to know a lot more about cookies, you go back and look at Tom's video.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.720
HTTP and HTML are not persistent. I make a request to a website, it serves me HTML

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.900
– and maybe Javascript – and that's the end of the transaction, as far as it's concerned.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.580
I make another request, it's a brand new transaction.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.300
So there's no standard way in that mechanism of me persisting.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.240
Interviewer: So when you say you make a request, that means, for example, you click on a link or something?

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.900
Pound: Yeah. So I go into Google and I type www.google.co.uk, or I click on a link

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.160
in a webpage that takes me to another website.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.760
Or, indeed, my browser needs to request an image from a server

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.440
because I've clicked the plus icon on something and I'm trying to look at an image hi-res.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.720
Interviewer: So even if you're on the same site, you click on different links on that same site it […]

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.580
Pound: It will start a new connection, or use the existing connection to send off another HTTP request

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.900
which is basically just a string that says "I want this file, please send it back"

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.160
and the server will hopefully send it back.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.020
Because this isn't persistent, the obvious problem is  how do we do things like shopping baskets

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.560
and "I'm on stage 5 of 6 stages" in setting up my online banking or something

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.540
how do we remember what I've already typed in?

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.160
The way we do this is using cookies.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.620
So, the first ever time I visit a website, it might send me back a cookie that's maybe a unique identifier to me.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.700
So just let's say a string of numbers, alright?

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.080
And then I think, "well, I'm going to go back to that website and register"

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.260
so I type in my username that I want and I send off the username and the request for the next page.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.040
And I also send back this unique string of numbers.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.500
And the reason is because then the server can look in the database and go "oh yeah, I remember him,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.860
he was the one that was using this username, and I can now serve him this slightly different webpage

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.960
where the username is already typed in." or "I have already remembered what's in his shopping basket"

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.100
or something like this.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.520
That's what a cookie is for. Now, of course now as Tom rightly points out, they're also used for tracking what you're up to online.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.360
So banner ads and things will use tracking cookies to keep track of you between websites – which is kind of worrying.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.020
But, again, not going to talk about that anymore than to draw people's attention to how scary it is.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.300
The problem is that if I obtain a cookie off you, which is supposed to be secure,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:53.540
then I can send that to, let's say, Amazon or to a shop and say "I'm Sean please, you know, what's in his shopping basket"

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.700
"What's his address?", "What's his credit card details?"

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.720
"Can I change the address of this?"

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.860
If I do that halfway through your transaction, when you've typed in your details,

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.400
I can just override and change the shipping address and get stuff sent to my house instead.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.060
It's involved, but it could happen.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.320
If i can get ahold of that cookie.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.160
Now those cookies are stored by the browser, and they're on your computer

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.820
so that's quite difficult for me to do.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.140
But cross-site scripting is a very easy way of doing it.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.220
So that's what we're going to do today. We're gonna steal a cookie, and we're gonna do it using a cross-site scripting attack.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.380
Now this ties back into a different video that Tom Scott did on cross-site scripting.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.640
But what we're basically going to do is we're going to inject a script into a blog

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.840
– not a secure blog, I should say – and that is going to, when anyone else visits the site

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.660
obtain their session cookie and send it to me.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.340
And that I could theoretically use to take over their session.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.180
This is the world's best blog, of course. Alright, it looks good and it's got good content on it.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.260
Here's a picture of a kitten and some kind of banner and that's pretty much it.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.640
And some Lorem Ipsum. And then this blog has crucially got a comments feed at the bottom

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.760
So if we look at the comments: "Many thanks, love the blog" – That sort of stuff.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.420
It's all very positive – well nearly – and the point is I can type extra comments in here.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.540
So I can say: "Thanks!"  from Mike again. And I can post this in, and then when I scroll to the bottom

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.640
there it is. And the time that I did it on.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.400
This is just the kind of time where a cross-site scripting attack is possible if you haven't coded your website properly.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.020
ok so what I need to be doing when
someone types some some text in here is

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.190
making sure that's what it is and isn't
in fact valid HTML script my or

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.790
JavaScript because if it is then what
happens is this browser received it back

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.150
to the server and has no reason to think
that isn't just part of what the server

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.080
intended

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.530
I think because it's just a script tag
like any other the server will probably

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.460
be serving script tags anyway, right, for
doing other things and it just serves

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.150
another one that's fair enough i mean
they do that all the time so we run it

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.560
ok and then that's where is a problem so
it's a responsibility of the server and

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.490
the person programming the server to
make sure that when I submit data it

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.090
doesn't

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.080
it isn't actual script, or things that
can run

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.199
ok so this is a very similar to an SQL
injection

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:11.449
except we're putting us we are injecting
HTML instead of SQL ok

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.960
they're very similar kinds of attacks so
let's see if it works

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.139
the most obvious example be a really
simple one let's see if we can get a

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.340
pop-up to appear so I'm gonna opening
closing HTML tags and then we're going

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.940
to say alert "XSS !"

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.130
ok so theoretically what will happen is
this page will serve these comments to

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.540
me when I go to this website and they
will see this script and not think it's

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.120
a comment they will think it's part of
the actual webpage to be run and

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.950
executed and then off there we go...

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.740
so let's see if it works. I need to put
a name ok so i don't want to incriminate

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.260
myself so let's put in someone else so
like Sean

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.070
for example i could submit so I reload
this web page of someone else

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.060
I get a little pop-up that says
localhost XSS ok so the service

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.780
telling me XSS! this is where you
stop and then you go off and tell them

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.229
about it but you can go further than
this. To be absolutely clear, this is my own website

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:04.669
running on my laptop - it's not secure
on purpose and it doesn't matter if I

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:06.889
hack it because no one no harm is coming up this

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:10.550
ok I wouldn't ever do this on a public
website so i just loaded some files to

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.430
show you how the blog works behind the
scenes so you get an idea of what's

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.970
going on

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.710
so this is PHP right so it's going to be
a mixture of PHP code and HTML

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.580
right, some which is a result of PHP some
which is just put in

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.180
so here you can see that i called
something called session start now what

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.539
session starts going to do is PHP is
going to look to see if the cookie they

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:33.260
received is a valid session and if it is
it's going to resume my session its going

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.979
to remember who i am and any parameters
that this website has set for me will be

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:41.240
remembered in the database if there is
no cookie on file for me that means i'm

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.530
coming at it for the first time for my
session expired and it will make one and

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.820
send it back to me in the first response
right now that all happens within this

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.669
session start thing and is not something i need
to concern myself with as a developer

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:54.650
you can do it yourself

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.940
now I've got standard submit comments
okay so I output the blog text and then

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:04.340
I check if someone clicks "Submit comment"
button it will check the post values for

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.020
content and their name and then it will
put them into a database now as a side

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.480
note I am actually escaping these
mySQL strings

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:16.430
there we are so I'm not vulnerable here to a
mySQL injection because of these bits

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.880
so that's good but I'm not vulnerable to
SQL injection unfortunately I am vulnerable

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.960
to cross site scripting so I'm not doing
any kind of cross-site scripting

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.010
detection here

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:29.300
okay I'm just gonna serve back whatever
the person typed in now as an attacker

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.630
what I've done is I've created another
PHP file called submit cookie dot PHP

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:38.480
that is it just a file that takes as a
parameter, a string of a cookie stores in a

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.620
database on these two lines here and
then serves him back in image

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.530
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
write a cross-site scripting attack which is

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:50.660
basically a comment on this blog that
causes their website or their client to

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.260
visit this submit cookie dot PHP and
give them the cookie

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:59.030
ok so because this is this is one
question that I remember rising when we talked

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:01.790
about these sorts of things before is
the difference between client and server

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:06.470
side you know you're doing some code
that will cause the server to come and

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:07.430
find this code?

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.300
imagine that I've so imagine that there
is no PHP in there is no script right

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.190
All there is is a website with some images on
it

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:17.840
ok you're the server and I'm the client I
say can I get index.html?

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.400
you say yeah here it is

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.970
ok I read it and show on the screen and
then I realized that actually it's got

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:27.800
an image in it that has a source that's
like your-website / image1.jpg

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.460
right

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:33.080
so I say okay I need this too can i have
jpg this JPEG and you send it back so i

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.590
make multiple requests to you to get the
various bits of content just like that

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:37.820
and just like with a banner ad

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.330
I might come to a bit in the HTML that tells me to go to some other website or

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.570
something else and then and there is no
reason for me to think that is not a

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:45.710
reasonable request

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:49.040
maybe your images are stored on a
different server so i'm going to go

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:49.670
there

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:53.180
ok so i go i was an image and I need
that from over here so I go over there

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.410
and I get it right

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:58.340
the fact that it also bagged my cookie
is just an unfortunate side effect but

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.650
it's not something that was necessary
and it wasn't something was intended

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:03.740
when they developed the web but it's
unfortunately what happens now

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:09.500
so that's what's going to happen ok
maybe right so I'm gonna start with

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.770
script so we already know this blog is
vulnerable to cross-site scripting so

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:16.070
we don't need to worry specifically about it i don't
have to obfuscate it or do anything clever i'm

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.620
going to say document dot write

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.720
ok now that's just going to write
nothing to the screen right so my

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.270
comment on my blog is just going to be

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:26.240
a script that does nothing okay that's
not very interesting so let's do

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.260
something a bit more interesting

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.350
our PHP file takes the cookie and gives an image back so let's just show it on the

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:35.990
screen right? So image tag in HTML IMG is
the image tag the source of that is

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:42.110
HTTP code on / localhost now this could
obviously be a different website / submit

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:49.190
cookie dot PHP Question Mark - now this takes get
requests so I say submit a cookie . PHP

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:53.600
? and when I say cookie equals and then
that's what I'm gonna steal their cookie

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.740
and give it to myself

00:09:54.740 --> 00:10:00.520
all right to do that all I do is I say
plus document . cookie

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.580
- I escape this so

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:05.540
it passes nicely over HTML plus and then i'm
going to close my image tag because

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:08.840
otherwise it's going to malformed HTML and it might execute properly and

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.100
then a single quote

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.820
ok so let's break down what this is
doing the script here is telling the

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:18.560
website that this is a script to be run and not a standard piece of HTML then the

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.680
document.right function is just a
piece of JavaScript that says dump this

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.060
out as text

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:27.140
hey but it can also take parameters
rather than just text yeah and it's

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:31.160
going to output some valid HTML which is
a link to an image but that image is not

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.590
held on the server held theoretically
elsewhere

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:39.290
ok now the actual thing that is
returning an image is a PHP file not an

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:40.220
actual image

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.910
ok which also takes the parameter of the cookie which is a bit worrying

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:48.380
alright so when I first went to this
blog i requested index dot PHP server

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:52.550
started executing this and called the
session start function right which went

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:54.950
oh he needs a session cookie and sent me
one

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:57.860
okay in the response so I've then bagged
that session cookie and put it in my

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.470
browser then when i visit that blog
again

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.740
I've returned that session cookie to the
server to say it's me again yeah

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:07.250
and so if i had if I had some some
persistence on this blog like I was in the

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:11.630
middle of writing a document it was half
written it would remember who I was now

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:16.670
so this cookie is stored by my browser
and theoretically the attacker can't get to it

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.350
because on my browser and not theirs

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:23.240
alright so what you have to do is trick
the browser into sending it back so the order

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.920
that things happen are

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:29.600
I then send a index.php request to
his blog to look at it

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.520
ok it sends him back at a big website
with stuff on it including some comments

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.720
one of which has a script in it

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:41.060
it that says there's an image here you
need okay at this PHP file

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.449
ok so I go oh brilliant, and I get my
document.cookie and I send it off to

00:11:44.449 --> 00:11:48.199
that PHP file and I get back an image
and I think nothing's gone wrong but

00:11:48.199 --> 00:11:49.220
they've now got my cookie

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:54.050
&gt;&gt;But the cookie went off to the place
where the image was supposedly? and of course this

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.990
will return an image but in some cases
it would return nothing and there will

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.810
be no evidence that this happened at all, apart from if you actually looked at the

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:03.079
source code for the file which of course
you know someone's going to do but no

00:12:03.079 --> 00:12:06.920
one no one normally is going to do so if
this got onto a forum or something

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:10.639
lots of people could look at this before
they realize what was going on now it's

00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:14.180
not unusual for an image to be served by
script over by an actual hard link to an

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:18.439
image because for example &gt;&gt;might be an advert or? It might be an advert

00:12:18.439 --> 00:12:21.110
dynamically created it could be
different it could be a resolution

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:23.720
specified in there or you know a good
lots of different reasons why you do

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.050
that

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:27.649
ok so a lot of the time it's going to be
dynamically generated in some way

00:12:27.649 --> 00:12:31.579
so this is no different to that, except that this is also taking a parameter that it

00:12:31.579 --> 00:12:36.439
shouldn't be taking ok but I've got no
control over that and the the browser

00:12:36.439 --> 00:12:39.680
it's not that insecure it's just that
he's got no reason to doubt me

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:45.170
you know scripts using document dot
cookies legitimately you know exist and

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:48.470
if you block them then websites start
to fall down because they use cookies

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:49.490
for persistence

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:52.459
so it's a you know a real problem. Let's click Submit and see what happens

00:12:52.459 --> 00:12:56.089
&gt;&gt;so what have you done there you've refreshed it? Yeah &amp; it didn't work, cause I've done it wrong

00:12:56.089 --> 00:12:58.399
You know what I didn't type in my name that's
why it didn't work

00:12:58.399 --> 00:13:03.500
so Mike right I'll take credit for this
one so we can submit that and then we run it

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:08.029
ok and we scroll down and we got a Cookie Monster picture so kindly submit cookie

00:13:08.029 --> 00:13:11.779
dot PHP has taken my cookie and returned
an image

00:13:11.779 --> 00:13:16.040
ok now it's not unusual for people to
have images on comments or on forum

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.250
posts and things so people have seen
this image apart from the fact that it's the

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.730
cookie monster might not realize what
just happened

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:26.750
ok it's completely silent it's happened
behind the scenes. All that's happened is they

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.540
just quickly whipped their cookie off to someone
else and returned an image

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:33.379
ok these kind of request for images happen
all the time it's just this one's got a

00:13:33.379 --> 00:13:37.370
cookie on it and that's bad news. As an attacker, this is my database and I select

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:42.529
* from evil which is the name of my
table that's registering the cookie

00:13:42.529 --> 00:13:45.529
you can see what my session cookie now
phpsessid

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:51.290
it's stuck in here so that's the session
cookie for that session of PHP now in

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:54.470
this blog that doesn't have much effect
right firstly because i already have

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:58.130
this cookie but mostly because there
isn't anything on this blog that having a

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:01.640
cookie will help with right. It won't let
you get to my basket or get to my credit

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.900
card details or login

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:08.300
ok but if you did this on a website
where there was shopping involved or

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:12.080
money involved or banking website and if
not properly coded it getting that

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:16.220
session cookie could trick the bank into
thinking that you're resuming their session

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:19.880
you know they could get so much
distance into let's say a transaction

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.270
then you could steal their session go in
and just change the bank account details

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:24.800
to yours right

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:29.360
the bank doesn't really have any idea of
knowing that people's session cookies

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:35.060
are the only thing that really tie them
to that that thing to that website

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:39.680
I mean you can do more and complicated
things like you can you can pin IPs

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.250
to session cookies for example right but
people's IPs change

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:47.750
ok they might move from one Wi-Fi area
to another their IP changes do you

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.000
necessarily want them to have to re-authenticate

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.870
perhaps you do for security right but it
depends on the way website is developed

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:57.230
this is sort of a prime example of a
time of check to time of use issue

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:02.090
ok which is a security term which is
basically the idea of something changing

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.970
between when someone authenticates and
when they do something and causing a

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:09.410
security problem so i type in the
username password on Amazon right then

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:13.490
ten minutes later I've wandered off
someone else turns up and spends all my

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:13.820
money

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.820
shipping stuff to their address ok now
that would be a problem

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.510
so what Amazon does is, they force me to reauthenticate just before I actually

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.010
type in my details

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.190
ok right before you transact you can add loads of stuff to my basket

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:28.310
without having to authenticate myself

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.400
it's remember that from last time but as
soon as I actually have to do anything

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.890
proper like spending any money

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:37.160
it's going to ask me for my credentials
again same with online banking if i use

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:41.660
my bank if I log into my online banking
i use some kind of chip &amp; pin device to

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.540
authenticate myself that lets me the
first time

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:48.080
it lets me see my bank balances if i
want to send any money its going to ask

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.760
me again because they can't risk me
wandering off by mistake leaving that

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:53.710
browser open

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:56.710
or someone having stole my cookie

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:02.020
We keep carving away at this and what we'll end up with is something that looks nearly like a cube so

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.770
we probably may be a bit of extra there
and a bit of extra there and there but

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:07.270
we'll get it we're getting there

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:10.600
ok now some objects obviously a more
amenable to this than others but the more

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.650
images we get the better it is
