00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
In the old days cards from the
1960's had a magnetic strip right so that when

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.809
you did a transaction the terminal would
read the data on the card's magnetic strip

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.869
but from 2003 in the UK you started to
get chips as well. So the information is

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:22.090
kept in this semiconductor chip and that
makes it significantly more difficult to counterfeit.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.369
. To counterfeit a mag stripe card all you gotta do is copy it onto a new card

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.359
but to counterfeit a chip you've
got a drill into it with lasers and probing stations

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.620
and other expensive fiddly
equipment and get the keys out, and that

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.070
is a pain and it only works some of the
time and you just don't want to go there.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.770
But don't worry if you're a criminal
'cause there are lots and lots of easier ways of

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.650
cheating chip and pin systems.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.940
Chip &amp; PIN is fun. It was designed in the late

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.719
nineteen nineties on the basis of some
earlier experiments in the earlier

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.070
nineteen nineties in which we were
privileged to have some small role and

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:07.600
it was introduced first in Britain from
2003 to 2005 so we started off with an

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.330
idea of what the frauds would likely be. For example if you have got some means of

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.250
intercepting the transaction flow between a card and a terminal. Say you've got a false card

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.600
and you can wire it up to a false terminal elsewhere then when a sucker

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.750
puts his card into your terminal you
can teleport that to a dodgy card that

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.860
you then present at a jewelers shop - and we demonstrated this as a proof of concept

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:39.869
and these relay attacks work in theory
but you don't see them in practice then

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.430
once Chip and PIN got fielded we began
to see how things change in the real

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.290
world and fraud didn't in fact go down but it went up because first of all the bad guys

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.700
went online and although fraud
initially fell a little bit in shops, it

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.579
more than caught up for that by increasing online. Second although fraud from

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.840
counterfeit cards initially went down,
when they introduced chip and PIN

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.140
what happened was that after a period of
six months or so it shot up and what the

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.400
bad guys had realized is that now you've
got these chip and PIN devices

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.120
everywhere you could use them to harvest
chip and PIN details, card details and

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.090
you could then make up mag stripe card
forgeries and use them in ATMs that would

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.379
still accept mag stripe transactions.
So we found for example that there was a

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.410
dodgy chip and PIN terminal in the BP
garage (gas/petrol station) in Girton (Cambs) which caused a couple

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.209
of hundred people locally to have money
taken from their cash machines in

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.819
Thailand of all places and there was a
gang that got various people that

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.290
garages around the country to install
dodgy equipment that would capture

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.310
people's chip and PIN details so that
was one of the things that went wrong. It

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.390
was possible for example to remove part
of the back of a chip and pin terminal

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.410
and put electronics in there and drill in so
that you got into the serial link which

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.739
goes between the PIN-pad and the card and that gets the current details going one

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.069
direction and the PIN going in the other
direction and that's all that you need

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.720
to do mag stripe forgeries. After we
demonstrated this on TV the banks said

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.290
"Well you know that's a difficult attack
Cambridge students could do it but real

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.630
criminals couldn't" but only a few months
later they arrested a couple of guys in

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.359
Manchester what they've done was get
access to the warehouse in Dubai

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.450
where the chip and pin terminals stopped to catch breath on route from the factory in

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.030
China to the retail trade in Britain
and the Netherlands and in the back of

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.840
them they put little mobile phones so
that whenever you used this terminal it

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.380
would text your card and PIN details to
somebody in Karachi - and those guys

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.389
eventually got off because the banks
weren't prepared to offer evidence

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:48.340
against them it was just too
embarrassing more recently what we

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.400
discovered is that we got a number of
people came to us and they said look my

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.840
card was stolen it was then used in a
shop - the bank says it must be my fault

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.400
because the PIN was used and so I must
have been negligent but it couldn't

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.870
have happened I didn't use the card with the PIN. We went and we looked and we found that

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:13.060
it's actually easy to cheat because what
you can do, is you can put a device

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.790
between the card and the terminal

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.680
which tells the terminal that the pin was
accepted by the card but tells the card

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.490
that it was a chip and signature
transaction and this is an example of

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.880
the electronics that you can use you put
the stolen card into the device like

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:38.639
this and you then use the 'tame' card in
the chip and PIN device like this and

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.160
this means that the electronics can
modify the transaction as it flows from

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.530
your stolen smart card to the chip
and PIN terminal. The chip and PIN machine

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.570
is told that you entered the correct PIN
even although you didn't but the card

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.380
is told that a signature verified the
transaction and it's this kind of

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.440
sleight-of-hand this enables no-PIN fraud to be carried out and we've seen

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.690
that in the wild since, gosh, about 2010 2011

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.860
there're people in France who've been sent to jail for it

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.090
there're number of variants of it and now we're starting to see it in China because in

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.919
China you can buy tiny little two-sided
SIM cards that will go between your

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.330
phone and your SIM card to enable you
to do roaming more cheaply right, so that you

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.150
can roam among China's different
provinces and the problem with these

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:32.350
slim shims is that they're just what you
need to replace all this electronics

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.010
[Sorry, slim SIM is it?] or a SIM shim

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:41.940
['Shim' is it? Oh so it's like, shimmies inbetween] ...exactly so and so these devices
can enable you to replace all this

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.169
electronics with one tiny little chip that you can just slip in between the stolen card

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:52.370
and the chip &amp; PIN terminal. What we're
doing is getting a man in the middle as

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.560
we call it in between the card and the
chip and PIN machine so we can

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.289
manipulate those parts of the
transaction that aren't properly

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:03.919
cryptographically authenticated. So
that's the latest fraud technology.

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:11.260
The latest fraud methodology is simpler
because what you do is you take a chip

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.150
and PIN machine and you re-program it and we're now seeing 'evil' chip and pin machines

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.169
coming on the market in Europe in Spain, in Britain, in Portugal and in the Baltics

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:21.400
and elsewhere

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:27.520
and what these chip and PIN machines will do - is they'll display a small amount on the

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.930
screen, say your transaction is thirty
pounds for a meal or whatever

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:38.759
while putting a big transaction into the card - 3,000 pounds OK - and these are typically

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:43.199
used in places like night clubs and
strip clubs and so on. So there's various guys from

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:48.300
Britain have gone on stag nights in
Poland or in Lithuania or whatever and

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.150
they come back and find those a five
thousand-pound transaction on the chip

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.370
and PIN card. How did it happen? Well you used your chip and PIN card in a strip club

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:00.160
in Vilnius what do you expect? Or in
Barcelona, or now even in Bournemouth

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.410
this is now happening in Britain as well
and it's very very difficult for people

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:10.620
who go into a bad place and use a card
because if, if you complain to your bank

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.510
then the strip club owner will just say "He was with four girls all night and four...

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:20.099
...thousand pounds is what that costs at our place!" So you really are on a hiding to

00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:23.370
nothing when it comes to complaining. The thing about this is that the

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.300
average person just doesn't think that,
you know, if you pull your wallet out

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.349
of your pocket you've got what, two or three cards in there? If each of these cards

00:07:32.349 --> 00:07:37.110
is good for five or ten thousand pounds,
you know, with your overdraft limit and the

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:43.199
extra undocumented overdraft that the bank will give you and charge you extra for...

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:47.659
There's a total spending power in your pocket of maybe twenty thousand pounds.

00:07:47.659 --> 00:07:51.990
Now, you wouldn't dream of walking into a whore-house on a Saturday night with 20,000

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:56.810
pounds in cash in your pocket would you? But that's what people do when they walk

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.740
into dodgy businesses just carrying a
normal wallet with normal chip and PIN

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:08.630
cards in them and that's a new hazard
that people just aren't aware of yet

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:13.220
There's a classic example of the middle person attack which is John Conway's famous idea of how

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.470
to beat a Grandmaster at chess. Well it's easy just play two grand masters at chess

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:22.670
simultaneously by postal chess and you
relay the moves backwards and forwards from one to the other

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:26.520
playing games like this is what security
engineers are really really into when

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.450
it comes to designing protocols and
protocols are hard to design right

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:35.310
people usually get them wrong and again
and again we find protocol flaws with

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:40.410
EMV which can be exploited and are being exploited. EMV is the Sunday

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:44.390
afternoon name for chip &amp; PIN it's Europay / Mastercard / Visa protocol
