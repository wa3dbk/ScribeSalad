00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
Animated GIFs have been around for a very long time. We're talking, like, early days of mass use of the web,

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.160
so we're talking GeoCities, mid-90's technology here,

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.880
and yet, they're still popular. They're still on every damn BuzzFeed article and every Tumblr there is,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.940
and the reason is because they work pretty much everywhere,

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.020
and they're also a really good example of the tradeoff between space and time

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.200
or between memory and time in computing.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.780
Animated GIFs have been around so long that they're actually a verb now --

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.300
officially recognized, "GIF," or "jiff" if you wanna pronounce it the official way that's blatantly wrong.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.360
You can fight that one out in the comments.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.480
Um, they are a really inefficient way of storing video,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.960
'cause GIF wasn't designed as a format for storing what it's used for now, like actual videoclips.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.400
It was used for simple animations, and you can see that in the restrictions that it has.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.480
The whole gamut of colours that you can use on the web is actually the cube of the number of colours that you can use in a GIF.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:10.700
So a GIF will let you have 256 colours. The web, 256 values for red, for green, and for blue.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.620
Multiply those, you get 16,777,216 colours!

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.480
That's how many you find in a photo.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.200
The GIF will only let you have 256, which is why you get that kind of weird, compressed, grainy effect.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.980
More than that, the colours don't change for each frame, again with rare exceptions using really advanced GIF-makers,

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.480
but, generally, one palette for every frame.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.300
So if you go from a beautiful sunset with all those gorgeous yellows in it

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.280
and then go to the ocean with lots of blues,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.220
you're gonna run out of colours very, very quickly.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.700
The other restriction with GIFs is frame rate.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.420
Uh, this video you're watching will be either 25 or 30 frames a second -- I don't know which one you're using.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.460
Um, GIFs generally don't go above 20,

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.820
and, mm, rare to see anything above 10 or 15,

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.520
which is where you get that slightly shaky effect from, the kind of juddery effect you see in a lot of GIFs.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.060
The reason for that is they were designed for animation, not for video.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.540
I mean, GIF is wonderful if what you want to compress are simple line drawings.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.040
If you want to go beyond that, not really all that good.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.800
The reason for that is GIF uses, well, very limited inter-frame compression.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.440
There are two types of compression you can use in video.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.060
Uh, there is inter-frame compression, which is what most modern formats use,

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.560
and there is intra-frame compression, which is what GIF mainly uses.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.820
And these ones, "inter-" and "intra-," you'll have heard before for, like, "INTERgalactic space,"

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.820
where you have the space between galaxies,

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.220
and "INTRAgalactic," which is just the space within one galaxy,

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.140
and it's an important distinction, 'cause inter-frame compression is how all modern video formats work,

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.720
even back to the early MPEG ones and the, you know,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.460
that were being used at the same time as GIF was coming out.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.500
Uh, MPEG-2, which is what DVDs use,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.760
and MP4, which is almost certainly what you're watching right now,

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.760
they all use inter-frame compression.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.540
And the idea is this: you get the first picture,

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.960
which is, like, you know, regular photo compression, it's crushed down little,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:16.160
and then that picture isn't stored for about 25 frames more, until there's a major change.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.560
Until then, it just tracks the differences.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:29.140
So if I stay perfectly still, as still as I can, then all that the MPEG compression will do, pretty much, is my mouth.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.740
The rest of me, there'll be hardly any data compression there at all

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.960
because, well, hopefully the rest of me isn't moving.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.740
On the other hand, if I start flailing about a lot like this, then suddenly --

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.560
and, yeah, if you move the camera as well --

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.320
suddenly, everything here is having to move. It's having to work a lot harder,

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.140
and what it's doing, instead of changing every frame,

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.580
instead of storing every single frame, it's saying,

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.780
"Right. In here, that big block of pixels that's red, that's that T-shirt,

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.280
that's moved a bit that way and zoomed out a bit,

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.460
and this pinkish block here that's the hand, that's moved that way a bit and the fingers moved."

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.180
So it works out the differences between each frame.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.720
And occasionally it will store the entire image if that's more efficient,

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.920
particularly on a quick change, if you suddenly zoom -- thank you! --

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.360
um, then it will often go to a new keyframe there, as it's called.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.540
But generally, it will just track the differences between them.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.120
GIF isn't designed to do that. We're talking mid-90's here.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.620
Maybe it was possible to have a video stream going,

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.460
but at the same time as you're trying to display a webpage,

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.780
at the same time you're trying to track everything else going on in the system, no. You couldn't do that.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.060
So GIF was designed with mostly just intra-frame compression.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.800
Intra-frame compression is like storing a series of photographs.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.720
Each one is pretty much independent from the one before and the one after.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.720
Now, you can see why this is less efficient.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.600
You've got enormous space savings if you say that wall doesn't change at all.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.820
It has limited inter-frame compression.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.600
If nothing has changed in a pixel, you can just set it as transparent

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.760
and the one from the previous frame will sort of show through.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.680
But other than that, if something changes, you have to encode it completely all over again,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.960
and this is is one of the basic tradeoffs of computer science,

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.040
because in exchange for the extra file size, the extra  data that you're storing,

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.820
it is a lot easier to decompress.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.720
Instead of having to worry about storing one frame and another and then managing the differences between them

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.240
and all the little fiddly things that you have to do there,

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.700
you just show a picture, and then you show another picture, and then another.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:29.880
Simple as that.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:37.840
GIF, in exchange for that extra file size, that poor compression, is actually really, really easy.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.560
I mean, back in the GeoCities days, you could have, you know, flaming skulls rotating on your webpage,

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:49.420
an entire background of flames as many GeoCities sites including mine might well have done

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.960
I've just realised there are people watching this who aren't gonna remember GeoCities

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.240
because they were born after it, which is really weird.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.540
Um, GeoCities was, um, I was about to say the MySpace of its day but, no,

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.320
it was the Tumblr of its day.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.040
Um, they gave you free webspace and you wrote up the HTML code yourself and you uploaded it,

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.680
and it was wonderful, and then it was bought by Yahoo!, and it was not wonderful anymore. Anyway!

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.060
You see this tradeoff everywhere in computer science.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:20.680
Uh, if you have an app that has to do a really complicated calculation -- it might take a few seconds --

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.080
you can either let it do that calculation each time,

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.780
just send the formula to do that calculation off to the app,

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.060
so the user types in whatever number they need, they hit a button, it does the calculation,

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.620
three seconds later the response comes back to them,

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.280
or you can make the app much, much bigger.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:46.000
You could include the result for every number they could possibly type in, precalculated, just calculated once beforehand,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.720
and, instead of sending them a formula, you send them a lookup table.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.740
It might be megabytes or gigabytes in size, but instead of having to do that calculation,

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.700
you tradeoff the time for the space,

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.980
and, instead of three seconds, you waste 500 megabytes --

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.980
those are arbitrary numbers I pulled from anywhere --

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.460
but the tradeoff is there.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.960
And the tradeoff is there in cryptography -- I've mentioned rainbow tables before:

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.900
"... rainbow tables ... which tradeoff computation time for hard drive space.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:19.060
So, rather than having to calculate millions and millions of hashes for this one password,

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.060
someone has already done it for you."

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:25.600
So you can spend, ah, days or weeks or months or years or millennia brute forcing a password,

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:32.060
or you can use megabytes or gigabytes or terabytes of data to try and jump forward in the calculation.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.900
I'm summarizing here, and cryptography nuts will be extremely angry at me for doing that,

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.580
but essentially it's the same tradeoff.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.960
Rather than processor time, you've traded off for space.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:47.700
It's one of the fundamental principles of computer science and it's best explained with animated GIFs.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:57.620
The thing about GIFs is it's one of those weird things where the medium defines the message.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:02.860
Like, movies have to be between about 90 minutes and three hours, depending on the genre.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:07.440
Uh, Vines have to be six seconds, well six-and-a-half seconds, actually.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.560
This one was determined by technology,

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:14.920
by what bandwidth could support, by what file size was acceptable,

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.280
and it's interesting to see something where it's not been decreed,

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.280
it's not been agreed over time either.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.360
It's just whatever happens to fit into the technology.
