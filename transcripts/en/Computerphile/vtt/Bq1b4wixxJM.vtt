00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.020
We plan to put a lot of other JANET core equipment so as you can imagine

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:13.800
JANET supports research and education. A lot of students are using the network, not only for their studies

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:19.780
but, they live in halls of residence so
we move a lot of Netflix traffic around the network

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:26.660
so we'll be putting some netflix caches that help to manage that traffic more efficiently on the network.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.560
[Are there any other services like Netflix that you'll be doing that for? Like Google or anything like that?]

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:41.080
We have direct pairings with Google and
Amazon to manage their traffic directly on the network.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.420
[So if anyone's watching Amazon Prime video it's the same sort of thing]

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.030
it is yes, that'll go across JANET directly into the Amazon network

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.030
[So how much spare capacity is there here?]

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.290
We've got Terabits essentially of spare capacity

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.350
in the current system.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.360
This is where the JANET network enters the datacenter

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:17.800
The datacenter is actually on the core of the JANET network so we have diverse fibre, going out to two of our...

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.760
core points of presence one in East London, in Docklands, and one in West London

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:31.060
and that's how it connects to the JANET
network so we have our optical equipment

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.730
lighting that fiber. Which is Cienna optical equipment so at the moment we've got two 200 gig

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:45.910
wavelengths and we're about to add a second set of a hundred Gig wavelengths as well

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.510
and then we have the Juniper routing equipment

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:57.100
[If we were to look in the hole, where the cables come from all the universities what would we see?]

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:04.710
Well it's not that exciting its basically a pair of fibers in one side of the building and

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.479
then another pair of fibers coming to
the other side of the building and as I

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.850
say those fibers go to a location in
East London and then a location in West London.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.220
[and then they go into here and get distributed amongst all your...]

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.030
That's right, they go into the optical equipment and then into the IP switching equipment

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:35.550
and we either present one Gig connections or 10 Gig connections to each of the customers.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.100
The two fibers come in. They first of all come in

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:46.629
to the the optical equipment and that
does the de-multiplexing out of the light

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:53.340
signal and then that gets put into the
switching and routing equipment to which

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.720
each of the customers in the datacenter
connect so we have; out of the routing

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.080
equipment individual pairs of fiber that go into either data hall one or data hall two.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:13.080
It's fibre coming out of the
equipment and that goes to the the in-datacenter patching

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.760
Infrastructure. So the Ciena equipment there, that, on a single fiber

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:26.359
is essentially capable of carrying
8.8 Terabits of information. At the moment as

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:34.459
we're growing into the datacenter we've got two hundred Gigabits, soon to move up to four hundred Gigabits.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.460
This is the core equipment that powers the JANET network

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:45.850
so we have a national core that extends from Exeter in the south-west to Edinburgh &amp;

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.580
Glasgow in Scotland we have about six
and a half thousand kilometers of fiber

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:59.110
that connects all that core equipment - and that core connects to 17 regional

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.770
distribution networks that then connects to the universities and colleges and the public

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.050
research institutions

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.990
so the signals come in to the optical
equipment, the Ciena equipment and then get

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.400
patched into the Juniper IP
switching and routing equipment in this

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:25.410
rack here. This is taking the signal out of the optical equipment converting that light

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:35.060
into the Internet protocol signal and then
customers connect out on individual ports

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:43.490
signals come out of that Juniper IP equipment. Come in via the fiber patching, into

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:52.280
this patching rack and then that'll go off into the wiring infrastructure on this yellow overhead trunking. So we

00:04:52.280 --> 00:05:04.200
connect two ways out into the data hall so it's fully resilient so it'll come out into two

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.300
of the overhead raceways, and then be diversely

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.140
routed - take different routes
into the data hall that it's going into.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:22.260
So if one of these overhead raceways were to be damaged, the other raceway would carry the signal.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:31.200
[Have you had anything like that happen yet?] No we haven't, no not in the data centre. [and how long's this been in force, this system?]

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:41.060
It's nearly a year now it's been up and running. [and have you seen major differences using this system than before, how you had it before?]

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:47.820
Well this is our first data centre on the network so this is the first time we've done this!

00:05:48.560 --> 00:06:05.389
reader rather than just a traditional
fingerprint reader actually searching

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:09.020
for signs of life so as to make sure
that you have enough in your car from

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.360
someone who gets to use the power and
when that is a very important component

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.389
in the great which is what we call them
even wear
