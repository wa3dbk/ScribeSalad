00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
MARCO ARMENT:
I feel like one of the areas that independent people like me can have a little advantage over big companies

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.660
is that we can inject more personality into our apps

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.720
and we can not put up some façade that looks like we are a big company.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.220
We can do things that big companies can't do. Big companies can't have personality. They just can't.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.580
That's just not how people come together and work by committee.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.740
That doesn't -- Personality does not come out of committees.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.960
BRADY HARAN:
Do you like the idea that people identify your app as, like, one guy, like, homemade, this is Marco's app,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.400
or do you prefer the idea that people are getting Overcast

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.680
and maybe even think it's made by a big company?

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.160
MARCO ARMENT:
I used to care a lot about that. And you see a lot of independent developers do this,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.340
where they will do things like they'll say "we." In all the copy that mentions, you know, the author, it'll say,

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.260
"Well, this is what we believe," or "You can contact us,"

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.320
and with Overcast I decided to just drop all that and to just say "I" everywhere

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.500
and to inject some more personality into the app, because for so many years

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.820
computer software has been bland and devoid of personality

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.480
in order to be neutral and all-inclusive and make sure you don't offend or turn off anybody,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.040
and there's a place for that. In fact, most software should probably keep doing that.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.380
The reaction for Overcast having personality in it has been universally very positive.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.240
I did not -- Every time I do something, maybe I'll add some little copy in the app,

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.720
like, I recently added a setting to put the icon badge on the icon of how many episodes you have unplayed

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.000
and the description text of this is this "add[s] stress to your life,"

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.060
because I hate that option and everyone who asked me to add it, so I was like

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.960
"OK, fine. I'll add it, but I'll tell you it'll add stress to your life"

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.020
as this kind of tongue-in-cheek remark about why you shouldn't use this setting,

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.360
and that's on a screen called "Nitpicky Details,"

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.360
which is basically a collection of settings people have badgered me into adding to the app

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.900
that I don't think are necessary.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.840
Every time I do things like this, I think it's a risk, and I think maybe it'll turn off some people,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.080
and every time it's had the opposite effect. Every time, I'll get hundreds of tweets saying,

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.260
"Hey, look at this! This is so great! I'm so happy to see personality,"

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.340
because I think people are kind of starved for some kind of personality in software,

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.500
which is so rarely the actual case.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.760
BRADY HARAN:
Do you worry that if people know an app is made by one person, they might think it's less professional or reliable?

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.180
Does that ever enter your head or is that a silly question?

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.760
MARCO ARMENT:
That is a very valid concern for a lot of kinds of apps. I don't think it's true of a podcast player.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.180
You know, like, if I was making software for dentists to run their office from.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.500
-- which, by the way, if you've ever seen dental office software,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.080
it's... wow. That could use some interface help. --

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.220
but, you know, something like that, you would want a company behind that,

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.880
you would want that to seem official and conservative and, you know, have resources behind it,

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.940
but something like a podcast player made for people who like podcasts on their iPhones,

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.100
I don't think that really matters that much.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.660
I also think that, you know, the assumption that a big company's software would be more reliable

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.080
unfortunately has proven itself not to be the case very often recently!

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.780
I think the big companies keep showing us over and over again

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.140
that they actually might be less reliable than what independent people are producing.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.200
I was not always good at this, and I still often have misses,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.420
and, you know, not everything I do succeeds.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:29.680
What I'm able to do is I make things for myself, and when I step out of that, I don't do very well.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.340
As long as I just keep making things for myself, those tend to do pretty well,

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.520
and there are enough other people like me -- not a ton, but there are enough --

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.940
that it can support one person's salary pretty well.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:44.920
BRADY HARAN:
When you do it right...

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.420
MARCO ARMENT:
[CHUCKLES] Right.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.540
BRADY HARAN:
... which I know you don't always, but when you do it right, what do you do right?

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.780
MARCO ARMENT:
If I knew, I wouldn't have misses. [CHUCKLES]

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.080
BRADY HARAN:
Professionally, what's your problem?

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.960
MARCO ARMENT:
[CHUCKLES] I need to stop blogging. [LAUGHS]

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.800
BRADY HARAN:
What is it about blogging that causes you stress?

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.960
MARCO ARMENT:
I have a really hard time taking the criticism when I --

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.660
it isn't just criticism, a lot of it is just trolling, but some of it is legitimate criticism,

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:17.900
and I always just feel awful about it, and, I don't know, for whatever reason, I can say whatever I want in a podcast

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.560
and get almost no crap for it from anybody. It's amazing.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.780
If I write anything on my blog, it is put under such a massively higher level of scrutiny

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.040
that I just get the worst responses from people.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.100
And it takes a lot more time to write things for a blog.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.820
I haven't written a lot recently and that's part of the reason why,

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.100
that I know I can just get out my ideas in the podcast,

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.220
and not only will I be able to get more out with less effort,

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.640
and then it's also in a conversational format where my friends in the podcast will also, like,

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.980
they'll build on it and they'll disagree with me and we'll have a discussion, so I think it's better for everybody,

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.060
and then all of that will also then be greeted by a much better response from people,

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.100
where, if you write in a blog, you don't get that, you know,

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:09.260
if you write it in a blog, it feels more formal and permanent to the reader,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.720
and so the reader comes and looks at something --

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.180
if I say on a podcast, "Well, I kind of think maybe this might be the case,"

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.660
if I write on the blog, "This is the case. Period," then that's a very different environment.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.320
and so people there will attack it: "You didn't think about this!,"

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.240
and the people who are reading the blog, a lot of them are kind of like these drivebys,

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.240
that, these people who don't know me, they haven't been reading my stuff,

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.540
so they don't really have the context of who I am, how I talk, the kind of person I am,

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:43.120
and what I am probably really thinking if I didn't say things exactly right or in the best way,

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.620
whereas in the podcast, you have so much more context of, like, people's humanity.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.200
You have their voice. You hear all their imperfections. You hear them in a discussion with other people.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.020
You kind of feel like it's your friend talking.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.540
Every time I've started a controversy recently, I regretted starting it.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.600
I don't usually start controversies intentionally.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.660
And people who read my stuff probably, they probably think I'm just BSing about that,

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.960
because it seems, afterwards, looking back, it's like

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.420
"Yeah, that was probably going to stir up some controversy,"

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.480
but I don't usually intend for that to happen, and I don't feel good when it does,

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.640
so I try to avoid that now.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.900
BRADY HARAN:
Our thanks to Audible.com for supporting this video.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.800
I like to listen to audiobooks from Audible when I take the dogs for a walk,

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:36.800
and with over 180,000 titles in the Audible collection, I don't imagine I'll be running out of options anytime soon.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:45.120
Currently on my reading list and sitting on my phone here is "Pandora's Star" by Peter F. Hamilton.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.600
It's a science fiction book. It was recommended to me by a few listeners via Twitter.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:55.380
I'd rather not give away the plot, but I'm enjoying it so far. I think there's a fair chance you'd like it, too.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.740
But no matter what kind of books you're into, Audible is sure to have something you'll like.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.780
They've got a huge collection of spoken word material, you can put it on various devices,

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:12.120
and you can try a free one-month trial including your first book, by going to audible.com/computerphile.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.240
That's audible.com/computerphile so they'll know you came here from the channel.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.000
Give them a try. Audible are a great way to pass the time on your long commutes, at the gym,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.520
or, like me, out walking the dogs.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.840
And our thanks to Audible for making extra videos like this one possible.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.080
MARCO ARMENT:
"... or if I just have a really awesome idea of something else I want to do instead.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.160
That doesn't happen very often. Most of my ideas are terrible,

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.620
and I can recognise that early on that, you know what?

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.840
This idea that I thought was really cool, I should not do that."

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.180
BRADY HARAN:
"... do you write things on paper, or storyboard a game, or what's it, like, look like at this point?"

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.120
MARC TEN BOSCH:
"Start typing!"
