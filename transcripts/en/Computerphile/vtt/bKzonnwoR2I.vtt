00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
So, pipeline is basically a mechanism for
connecting the output of one program

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.690
directly - conveniently - into the input of
another program. So that you can do, in

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.590
effect, two stages of processing just by
saying "program-1, vertical bar - that's the

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.939
pipeline symbol - second program". And what
that does is to start both programs and

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.900
take the output quietly from the first
one and stick it into the input of the

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.540
second one and then of course you can
have multiple of those. 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.010
Before that, the way that people connected programs --
but first I think they often didn't think of

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.230
connecting programs at all; you thought
of each program as its own thing, and it

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.000
would produce some output.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
&gt;&gt;Sean: So you might put a few numbers into it
by punch card or whatever, it would sort them,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
you'd take that output, and then take that one
literally ... connect the next program.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.789
&gt;&gt;BWK: Right, yeah.

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.070
You do that, as it were manually. Unix had the
idea of file redirection, which made that

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.750
syntactically easy. The new invention was
to say, "Hey wait a minute, we could put an

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.960
operator to do that right in the shell," the
command line interpreter.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.290
And then that made it a lot easier to do,
and it also encouraged people to, if the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.729
mechanism wasn't clean already, retrofit
cleanliness into the implementation.

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.840
I think it is a new idea with UNIX as
far as I know.  I have somewhere in my

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.200
collection of historical documents a
page that Doug McIlroy wrote in 1964

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.680
saying what we want to do is a mechanism
for screwing programs together... connecting

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.170
programs together just like screwing
pieces of garden hose together, and that's

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.409
the model.  And then I think it was
probably three or four years later and I

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.119
don't know how it came about, but it just
got done, and literally in a very very short

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.710
period of time.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.500
&gt;&gt;Sean: So basically the pipe is like 
pumping water into a garden...

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.000
&gt;&gt;BWK: Yeah. And you just screw on another
length of garden hose if you want to do

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.810
further processing.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.000
Garden hose doesn't process
in that same sense,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.979
but it's a pipeline in the sense that you see in 
certain kinds of manufacturing processes,

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.900
or something like that, where there's just
stages of processing.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.000
&gt;&gt;Sean: What's the benefit of that
rather than just writing one big

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.640
massive program that just does everything
for you?

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.350
&gt;&gt;BWK: Well, first you don't have to write the
one big massive program.  You've got

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.959
existing smaller programs that may
already do parts of the job.  And having

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.630
smaller programs is better than having
massive programs, so that's one thing.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.459
Another is that it's possible that the
amount of data you're processing would not

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.560
fit if you stored it in a file, if you
took the output of one program and had

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.590
to store it totally before you put it
into the next program.  It might not fit

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.430
because remember we're back in the days
when discs on these things had, if you

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.150
were lucky, a megabyte or two of data, not
a gigabyte or a terabyte, but a megabyte. And so you

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.989
couldn't instantiate necessarily the
output of a program before passing it on

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.140
to the next program.  So the pipeline
never had to instantiate the whole

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.000
output.
&gt;&gt;Sean: So by "instantiate", that's "store," is it?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Yes, store it. A big word for storing.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.200
And so that meant so that you could kind of just

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.400
sneak things through without having to
do this

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.120
along the way.  So that would be another example.
And then it was just keeping track of the

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.000
intermediate files could be a nuisance,
cleaning up the mess afterwards -- all of

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
those things went away with the pipeline
mechanism where you just said,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.500
"Hey, this is what I want to do:
this, this, this, in order."

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.000
&gt;&gt;Sean: Give me one result at the end of it?
&gt;&gt;BWK: Give me one result at the end of it.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.750
&gt;&gt;Sean: Is that something that's still used today ...?
&gt;&gt;BWK: Oh, absolutely. It's still fundamental mechanism.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.470
You use it all the time. You don't even think
about it at this point.  It's just part of it.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.960
It took a while to get retrofitted I
think into let's say Windows but it's an absolutely

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.330
integral part of any UNIX-based system,
has been since, since the late sixties.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:52.240
Just by taking existing programs, tools
like grep and wc and sort, and somewhere

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.760
in there I could throw in AWK if I
wanted to do slightly more

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.820
complicated kind of processing.  So all of
these things are using UNIX tools with

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.280
glued-together pipelines in ways that
were not thought of in the original

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.260
design.  That's the critical
observation, and that's the reason why these

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.370
little programs are often much more
useful than the very big, monolithic

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.510
one which does whatever it does, but
nothing else.  It's definitely an instance

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.850
of "don't reinvent the wheel."

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.030
Other people have done a lot of useful things
for you, and the ingenuity and often a lot

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.860
of fun of just saying, "Hey, I don't have
to do anything here except glue

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.000
together things that somebody else did
for me already."

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
&gt;&gt; Sean: I may be getting the wrong end 
of the stick - or another cliche will come to me

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.870
in a minute - but is this where libraries come from then? 
&gt;&gt; BWK: So you can think of 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.730
programs like grep and wc and sort as in
effect libraries, but libraries of programs

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:48.280
that stand alone, rather than libraries
of code which is linked, more or less

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.890
permanently, with other pieces of code.
So it's a library mechanism but in

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:03.790
some ways at a higher level, and the programs 
are really independent of each other.
