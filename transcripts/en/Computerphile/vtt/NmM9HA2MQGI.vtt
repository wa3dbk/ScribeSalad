00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.195
We talked a bit about end-to-end encryption already, and

00:00:03.195 --> 00:00:05.625
a lot of the assumption is that

00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:08.515
we have some kind of symmetric key that we can use to talk privately.

00:00:08.515 --> 00:00:11.475
So you and me have some kind of secret key and we use that to talk securely.

00:00:11.475 --> 00:00:14.575
Diffie-Hellman is how we get that secret key.

00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:19.995
Diffie-Hellman was first published in

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:22.275
1976 and has become

00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:25.415
pretty much a staple for any kind of cryptography at all.

00:00:26.195 --> 00:00:29.095
Whenever we use cryptography, we usually need to have a symmetric key

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:30.745
and to get that, we often

00:00:31.095 --> 00:00:34.055
have to perform some kind of Diffie-Hellman. It's so prevalent

00:00:34.055 --> 00:00:35.795
that your phone is probably doing it right now.

00:00:35.795 --> 00:00:38.815
Right - when you logged on to the browser to watch this video,

00:00:38.815 --> 00:00:41.125
you performed a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:44.085
When you open up your phone and it connects to any server,

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:47.205
it'll almost certainly perform a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

00:00:47.205 --> 00:00:50.195
If not now, then in the next few minutes, right?

00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:53.075
It's unbelievably important and unbelievably common.
The problem with Diffie-Hellman

00:00:53.075 --> 00:00:55.285
is it's quite mathematically complex.

00:00:55.285 --> 00:00:58.075
It depends on your level of mathematics, so what I've thought we do is,

00:00:58.075 --> 00:01:00.825
I thought we cover the mathematics in the Extra Bits and then we'd

00:01:00.825 --> 00:01:03.765
look at a kind of example of what actually happens

00:01:03.765 --> 00:01:06.055
as an overview for those people who're just

00:01:06.055 --> 00:01:09.035
not interested in the mathematics because they don't need to implement it and they don't really

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:12.055
mind.
Ehm, so we'll do both and in that way, hopefully,

00:01:12.055 --> 00:01:14.825
there's something for everyone.
We shall see.

00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:17.705
So perhaps Diffie-Hellman key exchange is slightly misnamed in the sense that

00:01:17.705 --> 00:01:20.235
what we don't actually do is

00:01:20.235 --> 00:01:22.405
exchange a key.
Because then it would be out

00:01:22.405 --> 00:01:25.405
in the public and we'd see it.
What we actually do is exchange

00:01:25.405 --> 00:01:28.395
some public variables and we combine them with some private

00:01:28.395 --> 00:01:31.555
variables we've kept hidden, so that we can both create the same key.

00:01:31.555 --> 00:01:34.955
Right, so we're actually creating a key together, in some sense.

00:01:35.055 --> 00:01:38.135
So, as always, we'll go back to Alice and Bob for this.

00:01:38.225 --> 00:01:41.165
So, let's have Alice over here,

00:01:41.165 --> 00:01:43.695
and Bob over here.
I'm gonna sort of spread this out a bit because we're

00:01:43.695 --> 00:01:47.105
gonna be putting these in and I don't wanna run out of space.
So Alice and Bob are here,

00:01:47.155 --> 00:01:49.395
these are their own machines and this

00:01:49.895 --> 00:01:52.925
is a kind of public area.
So anything

00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:55.835
that Alice and Bob send to each other or agree on in public

00:01:55.835 --> 00:01:58.635
is gonna be in this area.
So as an attacker, if we

00:01:58.635 --> 00:02:01.635
want to break this key exchange, if we want to find out what the secret key is,

00:02:01.635 --> 00:02:04.475
we have to do these variables to do it, right?

00:02:04.475 --> 00:02:07.955
And that, hopefully, will explain why that's difficult to do.

00:02:08.235 --> 00:02:11.385
Okay. So, the first thing is

00:02:11.505 --> 00:02:14.825
right at the beginning of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, Alice and Bob

00:02:14.825 --> 00:02:17.635
will have to agree to some mathematical parameters that they're going to use.

00:02:17.635 --> 00:02:20.495
This is a value "g", or generator,

00:02:20.505 --> 00:02:23.835
and a big prime number "n", right. Now

00:02:23.845 --> 00:02:26.905
for this example I'm gonna try and use colour mixing to try and explain

00:02:26.905 --> 00:02:29.765
this. I'm gonna write the letters in as well.

00:02:29.765 --> 00:02:32.465
n won't have a colour, for the sake of this analogy.

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:35.525
g does. So g is gonna be, ehm, let's go

00:02:35.525 --> 00:02:38.385
with yellow.
Right now, I'm gonna sort of squirt this in and

00:02:38.385 --> 00:02:41.175
hope that it doesn't go everywhere.
In fact, we kinda need two copies of g, really.

00:02:41.175 --> 00:02:43.475
So let's just sort of fill it up here.

00:02:43.475 --> 00:02:46.355
Up to about... I wanna get them the same.

00:02:46.355 --> 00:02:49.225
So far so good, so far it's not all over my desk.

00:02:49.225 --> 00:02:50.225
Alright, close enough. Alright.

00:02:50.735 --> 00:02:54.025
Ehm, well it's kind of yellowy.

00:02:54.025 --> 00:02:57.015
Often, they're shared at the very beginning of the handshake.

00:02:57.015 --> 00:02:59.115
Sometimes, they're just embedded in the standard

00:02:59.115 --> 00:03:02.135
or everyone always uses the same one.
It depends on the

00:03:02.135 --> 00:03:04.925
situation. Ehm, it can take a little time

00:03:04.925 --> 00:03:07.975
and an extra message to send these things across, so sometimes having them

00:03:07.975 --> 00:03:11.035
stashed ahead of time is a good idea.
So we got g,

00:03:11.035 --> 00:03:14.095
right, this is g.
Now, Alice,

00:03:14.095 --> 00:03:16.755
to begin with, needs to calculate a private key,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.940
or private variable.
I'm gonna choose red for Alice.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.700
Here we go. I probably could have used more food colour than this kind of pale red.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.815
Is that red? Yeah, close enough.
(To Brady) What do you think?

00:03:25.815 --> 00:03:27.805
Brady: It's rose-coloured.

00:03:27.805 --> 00:03:30.525
Mike: Now Bob is gonna do the same thing, he's gonna have a private value that is going to be blue.

00:03:31.225 --> 00:03:34.155
Now, I haven't chosen very interesting colours.
That's simply because

00:03:34.155 --> 00:03:37.365
there aren't that many colours available in the shops for food colouring.

00:03:37.365 --> 00:03:40.665
Ehm, and I didn't go to that much effort.
There we go, that's blue.

00:03:41.205 --> 00:03:44.205
Now, these two colours are in their private area.

00:03:44.205 --> 00:03:47.165
This is "a" [red] and this is "b" [blue], so I'm gonna label these.

00:03:47.165 --> 00:03:50.245
This is little a, this is little b.
Now, the important thing is that these are never shared

00:03:50.245 --> 00:03:52.255
with anyone. Alice doesn't share this with the public;

00:03:52.255 --> 00:03:54.745
Alice doesn't share this with Bob.
Now the first thing that happens is

00:03:54.745 --> 00:03:57.835
that we need to combine the private key with the generator [g]

00:03:57.835 --> 00:04:00.755
to produce a public key.

00:04:00.755 --> 00:04:03.915
Now the point is that, once we combined them we can't

00:04:03.915 --> 00:04:05.405
unmix it, right, that's why

00:04:05.405 --> 00:04:08.795
people like to use this colour analogy - once we pour two colours together,

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:12.155
it's difficult to know what colours went in.

00:04:12.155 --> 00:04:15.075
Because, yes, so if I poor red into yellow it maybe makes

00:04:15.075 --> 00:04:18.355
orange, but it could be that it was a bit more yellow and a bit less red.

00:04:18.355 --> 00:04:21.055
Or, you know, it's difficult to know.
So there's kind of

00:04:21.055 --> 00:04:23.825
orange for Alice and Bob's gonna take

00:04:23.825 --> 00:04:27.045
his blue, we kinda need them to be the same level really,

00:04:28.185 --> 00:04:31.395
and it does kind of make green.
This is a bit orangy -

00:04:31.445 --> 00:04:34.485
let's not critique me too much.
So, yeah, they're very different to the originals

00:04:34.485 --> 00:04:37.295
and the important thing is that we don't know

00:04:37.295 --> 00:04:40.435
what went into here, right?
We know g,

00:04:40.555 --> 00:04:43.355
but we don't know a and we can't find out.

00:04:43.355 --> 00:04:46.345
So this is actually, this public key here

00:04:46.345 --> 00:04:49.395
is "ag", in some sense.
It's got an a in it, it's got a g in it.

00:04:49.395 --> 00:04:52.285
This one has got a b in it

00:04:52.285 --> 00:04:55.675
and it's got a g in it, and we can't extract

00:04:55.675 --> 00:04:59.155
the a's, we cannot reverse this process.

00:04:59.735 --> 00:05:02.535
Now, they then are gonna exchange these public variables,

00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:05.045
but keep the private ones back.

00:05:05.045 --> 00:05:08.225
So, we're gonna sort of draw an arrow over here

00:05:08.225 --> 00:05:11.305
and an arrow over here and they're gonna switch them like

00:05:11.305 --> 00:05:14.275
this.
So they get sent out in clear text-

00:05:14.275 --> 00:05:17.155
These are now in the public area because they've been

00:05:17.155 --> 00:05:20.215
sent in plain text, everyone's seen them.

00:05:20.215 --> 00:05:22.875
So now, as an attacker I know

00:05:23.055 --> 00:05:26.115
bg, or Bobs public part of this key,

00:05:26.115 --> 00:05:28.665
ag, Alices public component,

00:05:28.665 --> 00:05:31.745
and g and n, right?
I don't know anything else.

00:05:31.745 --> 00:05:33.065
I don't know what a and b are.

00:05:33.425 --> 00:05:36.205
Now, this is the final part of Diffie-Hellman.
It's not actually

00:05:36.205 --> 00:05:39.135
very long.
You can do all this in just three messages.

00:05:39.135 --> 00:05:42.365
Alice is going to take the public component that Bob sent her

00:05:42.365 --> 00:05:45.315
and add her private key.

00:05:45.315 --> 00:05:48.035
And Bob is gonna take Alices public component and add his

00:05:48.035 --> 00:05:51.055
private key, so we're going to get,

00:05:51.055 --> 00:05:52.995
in essence, a mixture of

00:05:52.995 --> 00:05:56.275
a and b and g, right?
That's the idea.

00:05:56.275 --> 00:05:59.335
So let's do that now.
Brady: So is that in the private domain?

00:05:59.475 --> 00:06:02.565
Mike: Uhm, yes, this will be done privately because these are never exchanged.

00:06:02.565 --> 00:06:05.695
So these go into the private domain now,
I mean I could make a copy of them,

00:06:05.695 --> 00:06:06.695
let's not.

00:06:07.025 --> 00:06:08.025
So Alice is gonna add her red in,

00:06:08.515 --> 00:06:11.645
so let's go, let's just add some red up to about there -

00:06:11.795 --> 00:06:14.775
doesn't really work because the red is really faint.
And then

00:06:14.775 --> 00:06:16.085
Bob adds in his blue

00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:18.335
which is gonna be like

00:06:18.855 --> 00:06:20.805
that.

00:06:21.505 --> 00:06:24.755
And hopefully, this is where it all doesn't work

00:06:24.755 --> 00:06:27.675
or does work, these two values are kind of the same.

00:06:27.675 --> 00:06:30.615
I mean they're not; they're pretty close.

00:06:30.615 --> 00:06:33.435
That's a little bit darker, perhaps because the blue is a little bit stronger.

00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:35.995
(Brady) Considering you've done that without actually measuring something -

00:06:36.055 --> 00:06:39.055
(Mike) Yeah. I mean obviously, you would do this normally with mathematical -

00:06:39.055 --> 00:06:40.185
err, mathematics -

00:06:40.705 --> 00:06:43.665
mathematical functions that are much more precise than my random squirting

00:06:43.665 --> 00:06:44.945
of liquids.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:48.415
Now, -
(Brady) So those two are now in the private -

00:06:48.415 --> 00:06:51.425
(Mike) These? Yeah, this is private.
So Alice has taken Bobs bg

00:06:51.425 --> 00:06:54.155
and added her a, so that gets

00:06:54.155 --> 00:06:57.205
"abg"; and Bob takes

00:06:57.225 --> 00:07:00.085
Alices ag and gets "abg"

00:07:00.085 --> 00:07:02.965
by putting his b in there.

00:07:02.965 --> 00:07:05.875
Right. Now the order doesn't matter.
Remember, just like mixing colours, the mathematics

00:07:05.875 --> 00:07:08.925
is such that adding b first to g and then

00:07:08.925 --> 00:07:11.915
we add in a is the same as adding a first.
So these two values

00:07:11.915 --> 00:07:14.775
are exactly the same.
If you wanted to try and

00:07:14.775 --> 00:07:16.225
re-create this as an attacker,

00:07:16.555 --> 00:07:18.495
you can't do it.
Because you have

00:07:19.115 --> 00:07:22.025
ag and bg and g.

00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:24.915
And, so you could mix these two together, and you'd

00:07:24.915 --> 00:07:27.925
get "abgg", in some sense.

00:07:27.925 --> 00:07:31.095
Mathematically, this is a little bit... tenuous

00:07:31.095 --> 00:07:34.095
but we'll talk about that in the Extra Bits.
The point is, nothing in this public area can be combined

00:07:34.095 --> 00:07:36.495
in any way to get

00:07:36.515 --> 00:07:39.545
this value or this value, which are the same.

00:07:39.545 --> 00:07:42.575
The only way to do that is to find out what a and b are,

00:07:42.655 --> 00:07:45.325
and the only way to do that is to split up one of these two

00:07:45.325 --> 00:07:48.405
public components, which is very, very difficult to do.

00:07:48.405 --> 00:07:51.375
Alright. And that's what's so cool about Diffie-Hellman.
In a few messages,

00:07:51.375 --> 00:07:53.675
we've sent some public

00:07:53.675 --> 00:07:56.155
numbers around and

00:07:56.155 --> 00:07:59.535
we've used our private numbers to get a shared secret that noone else can know.

00:07:59.845 --> 00:08:00.845
Ehm, now you'd

00:08:01.085 --> 00:08:03.655
generally do this at the beginning of every conversation,

00:08:03.655 --> 00:08:06.365
and you would use this number combined with

00:08:06.365 --> 00:08:09.695
perhaps some session variables or something like this to

00:08:10.055 --> 00:08:12.585
derive secret keys to use in things like AES.

00:08:12.585 --> 00:08:15.715
So this is actually just gonna be a number which will then hash

00:08:15.715 --> 00:08:18.245
to turn into an AES key or something like that.

00:08:19.875 --> 00:08:22.725
Now, the mathematics behind Diffie-Hellman is,

00:08:22.725 --> 00:08:25.065
usually, modular arithmetics.

00:08:25.065 --> 00:08:28.255
Recall that we have our public numbers g and n;

00:08:28.255 --> 00:08:31.015
g is often very small - it's usually a small prime number:

00:08:31.015 --> 00:08:34.105
n is often very big and needs to be big for the security

00:08:34.105 --> 00:08:36.795
of this to work.
n is often 2,000 bits long,

00:08:36.795 --> 00:08:39.475
or 4,000 bits is more common now.
