00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940
some of the earlier ideas at digital
money simply took the form of a public ledger.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.140
You  know you start off with money you have a list of who owns how many coins

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.820
and then people call in and say I hereby transfer so many coins to such-and-such

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.280
and you then update the ledger. Now of course in real life

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.369
proper money actually works like that
it's just that the banks don't keep an

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.970
infinite publicly visible history of all
the transactions but Bitcoin keeps

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.280
everything publicly visible forever.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.580
The basic idea behind Bitcoin is that you have got thousands of people called Bitcoin miners

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.600
who compete to find the next hash in something called a blockchain. and a new hash is found about every ten minutes.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.780
so what happens is that hundreds of people who want to do a transaction

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.800
- say I want to pay you a
tenth of a Bitcoin (which is about 25 pounds or so)

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.480
pay for lunch or a taxi ride or whatever. Then what I do is I sign a transaction

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.920
saying that I pay you 25 pounds and that
gets collected together with hundreds of

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.980
other transactions that people want to
do around the world and Bitcoin miners work on it.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.360
How they work on it is they
look for a random number which

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.820
together with the last hash of the blockchain

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.660
and the batch of pending transactions, will have a certain property

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:34.660
and this property is found only about one time every sixty million, million, million attempts

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.040
so you get thousands in fact millions of computers

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.710
around the world working to try and find
the next hash with this special property

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.060
by trying the existing blockchain plus
all the transactions in the queue that

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.960
are waiting to be processed and
eventually every 10 minutes or so,

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.759
some lucky person puts up his hand and says "Found it!" and when that happens he gets 25 Bitcoins

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.759
so that's the reward for that person for
finding that particular hash.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.160
The blockchain is a list of all the transactions
that have been done with Bitcoin back

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.550
since the first transaction in 2008 or
2009

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.090
and it's punctuated with hashes and each
hash binds together the transactions

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.960
that happened up to that point in time
and so anybody can look back over the

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.280
blockchain and can trace the origin of
any particular Bitcoin. When it was mined

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.080
right, when it was awarded as a prize
to a miner who found an appropriate hash

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.820
and everybody who spent it or subdivided it or did something else with it since then.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.700
So it's an open ledger and the history of every single coin is visible to all.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.680
What you basically do is you add to the block chain basically one hash at a time.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.320
So you start off
with the last hash plus all the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.180
transactions that you've swept together
into a pool to add to the chain and then

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.840
there's the hash that you find at the end.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.660
It's also worth saying that miners tend to work in pools and at present there are three large pools which

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.220
distribute the work to tens of thousands of people who then 'beaver away' happily trying to

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.050
find the next hash and when the reward
comes through right;

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.810
and each of these mining pools will win a reward about once every half hour or so; they then

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.440
share that out to the miners who work for
them so what you've ended up with is a

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.760
system whereby people can buy Bitcoin mining equipment, they can plug it in

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.670
they can sign up to a mining pool, and
they get a return on their investment

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.600
just as if they'd put money in the bank
although the return is at present slightly better.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.560
If you're actually paying for your
electricity, half of all the return that

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.060
you get on your investment is going to
have to go to pay the electricity bill.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.740
There's a significant problem coming down the line because next year. About a year from now (slightly under a year from now )

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.380
The reward for finding a Bitcoin &lt;&lt;for finding a successful hash &gt;SR&gt;&gt; is due to fall from 25 bitcoins

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.160
per successful hash to twelve and a half. Now when this was set up the inventor

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.650
decided that in order to prevent
inflation the number of bitcoins that

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.240
you would get would fall over time. So the amount of work that you had to do per Bitcoin

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.080
would increase until finally the amount of Bitcoin in circulation would be stable.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.580
Now this means, that from about October next year &lt;&lt;October 2016&gt;&gt; if you're doing Bitcoing mining

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.860
on a fully commercial basis then every dollar that you spend

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.000
on electricity will return only one
dollar in expectation and Bitcoins

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.600
rather than $2 at the present time so
there's no way for you to recoup the

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.919
capital cost of your equipment unless of
course you can place your equipment in

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.680
places where electricity is very cheap
or in college dorm rooms where it's free

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.120
and eventually college deans are gonna
start putting in electricity meters and what then happens to Bitcoin?

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.360
[SR] So is this part of the way that Bitcoin works is that these rules have been set up already

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.560
that over a certain amount of time these things happen?

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:04.560
Well at present the Bitcoin rules were set up by the anonymous guy who set the system up in 2008...

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.240
...and they are maintained by the people who

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.940
maintain the Bitcoin software and so long
as they agree on what the software

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.740
should do you have consensus, but if they
were to disagree and fork the system into

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.360
two separate universes then that would
have huge consequences just like -

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:27.180
for example if Greece had left the Euro.
There would have been all sorts of trouble to mop up.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.620
Nobody knows for sure who wrote Bitcoin. The person who

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:38.330
claimed authorship Satoshi Nakamoto
appears to be a pseudonym and various

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.450
people have been found who might have
been him what we do know is that the

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:47.419
first Bitcoin transaction was made with
Hal Finney who was a cipher-punk

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:50.720
a cryptographer and a coder who could definitely have invented this and come

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.570
up with it and he unfortunately died of
Motor Neurone Disease (MND/ALS) a while ago so we

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.039
can't now ask him whether it was his
handiwork - he did deny it at the time but

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:05.820
in any case, somebody unknown who may
have been Hal, gave us this amazing and

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:14.580
fascinating system and as for where it
goes in the long term the answer is I don't know.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:21.420
The blockchain is a truly wonderful technical innovation. It doesn't quite do

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:28.639
what people like cipher-punks originally
thought it would do namely create a

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:34.259
stable anonymous currency that was
beyond the reach of governments

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.380
My feeling is that it hasn't quite found a
killer application yet.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.719
If you think of the internet for example back in the mid-nineteen nineties people thought

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:48.689
that bringing the Internet to the home
would be absolutely great for basically

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:55.240
delivering video to the home so something like you get from your favorite video

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.919
rental service or from your PVR was reckoned to be what people would use the internet for

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:04.110
and of course that turned out to be not
its real application. The real application

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:08.110
of the internet as everybody knows is
disseminating photographs of cats.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:14.909
So what will be 'cats' for Bitcoin? We don't
know, and whoever figures that out might stand

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:20.020
to make quite a few shillings ($$!)

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.300
in the back of them,

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.320
they put little mobile phones. So that, whenever  you used this terminal it'll it would text your card and PIN details....

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.160
You start getting the voltage that represents a six drifting a little bit, and it looks like a seven....
