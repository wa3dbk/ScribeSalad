00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
You used to get a floppy disk on the cover of a magazine with some software on it

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.660
and if you were really lucky you'd get a really old game that no one wanted to play free

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.590
on the cover of the magazine. Now you can
walk into the shop and purchase a

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.230
magazine with a free computer on the
front.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.780
The Raspberry Pi was developed by the Raspberry Pi foundation as a sort of cheap general-purpose computer

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.240
that could be used to teach people how
computers worked.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.300
So the aim was to try &amp; recreate the home computer boom that was around in the early

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.990
eighties and they took the naming
convention from the BBC Micro

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.559
So they started with the model B and the model A and then just like the BBC micro went to

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.110
the model B plus we have here. They
brought out the model B plus of the

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.280
Raspberry Pi. Quite nice, had a USB port,
Ethernet port to connect to the network

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.360
HDMI-out so you could plug it into your telly and USB from a standard mobile phone charger.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.240
So last Thursday on Twitter [I] saw, as I was getting up in the morning that they'd released a

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.390
new one, the Raspberry Pi Zero and the first thing that immediately hit you was the price...

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.180
$5. Less than the price of a movie ticket at the local cinema. And then I looked down a bit further on Twitter.

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.969
and I realize that they were giving them away on the cover of a magazine.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.000
That's how small it is compared to the floppy disk.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.960
[SR&gt; What are  we giving up to have such a cheap piece of kit?]

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.460
It's at least as powerful as the original Raspberry Pi you can clock it up to 1Ghz

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.820
it comes with 512 Meg of RAM. Its about equivalent to a typical desktop or

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.160
laptop machine in the mid 2000's in terms
of CPU speed so what are we actually got here,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.500
what have we got on it? Well we've
got a microSD slot where we can put in

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.320
an operating system and I've burned one onto an SD card earlier so we should be able to boot it up

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.140
We've got mini HDMI-out to
connect it to your TV so you need a

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.620
mini-HDMI to normal HDMI connector. We
have a USB port so we can plug some peripherals in

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.040
and we have a power socket on a USB port and that's about it

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.240
the other thing we've got is a row of holes
where we can solder in connectors to

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.780
access the GPIO port so we can connect it up to other things like I did last year with the Christmas tree

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.460
So let's connect it up and see what happens I've got an HDMI connector to this screen here

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.020
[SR&gt; Is that a laptop we've got there? ]

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.130
No it's not a laptop this was developed by Motorola

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.209
for the Atrix line of mobile phones and
the idea was that you dock your mobile phone in the

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.720
back and then be able to use it as if it
was a little computer. Don't think it ever really took off

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.340
but they're great for connecting
things together you've got HDMI input

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.580
and USB connections to the keyboard and mouse. You need a few converters to make it

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.060
all work but it's great for hacking with
little things like Raspberry Pi's

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.019
So we've got an HDMI connected to it

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.660
to a mini HDMI socket and this is where
things get a little awkward the USB

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.580
connector's a micro USB connector. The sort you'd normally use to charge your mobile phone

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.390
but it's being used on this to connect peripherals

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.510
so you need to get hold of a converter
before you can use this.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.700
You're gonna spend more than 4 quid [$5] you're gonna need to buy the converters unless you've already got them

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:09.440
I sort of fashioned my own out a bit of an old motherboard, the cable off my digital camera and some paperclips

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.420
But anyway, it seems to - it serves the purpose.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.340
So we can connect up our, the keyboard and mouse built in to here.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.020
There we are, that's connected up. Only thing that's left is to connect the power.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.380
We should see it start to boot up and you'll see the flashing lights.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.820
There we go, and then on the actual screen we can see Linux booting up

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.360
and I've already configured this, so [it] should in a minute boot me to the desktop

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.640
and we can start using it as a normal computer.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.620
[SR&gt; There's got to be a drawback, there's gotta to be something - I don't mean to be overly negative but..?]

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.380
So in terms of using it I mean

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.319
Once you've got it started, we're up &amp; running the Raspbian environment you can use it like any

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.620
other Raspberry Pi. If you're a teacher you could get hold of one of these and for 4 quid [$5] give everyone in

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.040
your class their own computer to do some
computer science stuff on it.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.940
Relatively easy to setup. The instructions for setting up the SD cards are dead easy to set up and if they

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.739
destroy it, well at that price it's probably
not much more expensive than the exercise

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.059
books they're writing in any way or the
text books that they're working from so it's

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.200
effectively disposable I think.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.220
[SR&gt; So what sorts of things can we do with it then?]

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.720
Well it comes with some software built in, there're some programming environments

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.700
there's a C compiler in here as well as some Java stuff, Python, Scratch and so on...

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.820
The standard Raspberry Pi environment's all there.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:35.560
The major feature that's missing, and I haven't mentioned it yet, is networking. By default there is no connection to the Internet on there

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.050
you can't plug into an ethernet there's no wifi so if you wanna take it online then

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.660
you'll need some sort of adapter so I'm
using a USB to Ethernet adapter to

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.640
connect it to the network and so that works very well so if we run a web browser

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.980
hopefully that will start up in a second.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.960
These machines, they're roughly about the power of the early 2000's but they're good fun to play with

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.390
[SR&gt;So they might be slower than what you're used to day to day but...?]

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.410
Yeah, it's slower than your typical Mac or PC.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.380
[SR&gt; I suppose it'd be a bit churlish to say it's a bit slow considering it costs $5]

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.620
Well yeah, it depends what you need it for I mean it's fast enough to do some things but other

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.770
things you probably want something more powerful. I mean you can stick it behind

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.780
your TV and use it to watch movies if you put a wifi dongle on it and stream video to it.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.200
[SR&gt; So what's this, is this coming up with
YouTube is it? ]

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.960
Yep, 's coming up with YouTube. I think the reason it's slow is I have a very dodgy...

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.360
...adapter here which doesn't seem to work, the keyboard keeps

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.990
cutting out as well so don't take this as a view of the speed

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.600
So yeah, you are going to have to buy some adapters and if you haven't got a keyboard or a monitor you need one of them

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.820
but it is a fully functional machine &amp; if
you want to learn how to program

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.960
or perhaps learn how to do hardware
hacking; you've got the GPIO pins here

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.930
which you can solder on some adapters and then you can connect it up to devices like I did the

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.590
Christmas tree last year you could
create one using this and you could hide

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.050
this in the box of the Christmas tree
quite easily.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.479
You can get a case for this in fact that's how I actually first saw it was released - I saw the tweet about the case rather than the

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:03.019
actual device, so there are cases available. Probably cost more than the actual device

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.960
[SR&gt; Great! so I might go and get myself one!]

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.960
Ah you'll be lucky, they're all sold out!

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.560
[SR&gt; They've all gone?]

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.340
Yes, yes

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:13.410
It seems it was very, very popular. Seem to have sold out of all the ones they've made

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.670
I'm sure they'll be making more &amp; they'll be available again soon

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.200
and it's very very difficult for people
who go into a bad place and use a card

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:29.230
because if if you complain to your bank
then the strip club owner will just say.....
