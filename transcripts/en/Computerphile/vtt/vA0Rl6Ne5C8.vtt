00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.580
So the other week there was an interesting announcement from Google

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.080
they had to update YouTube because Psy's

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.420
popular music video, Gangnam Style had managed to amass so many views

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.660
that it overflowed the 32-bit integer that they were using to store

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.359
view counts and so I thought it would be interesting to just take a look and remind ourselves of how

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:23.750
computers store numbers

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.250
and to see exactly why it actually broke 
YouTube

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:37.000
so Psy managed to amass 2,147,483,647

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.760
views on YouTube for his video. So the computer stores this information

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.110
in binary and if we've got just one bit of
information one binary digit then we can

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.010
store two

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.530
values zero or one; on the other
hand,

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.090
if we have two bits of information and so I represent this

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.430
as two boxes and we can store

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.339
four different values because we can put
zero in both boxes we can put a zero

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.970
in the first box and the one in the
second we can put a one in the first box

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.750
a zero in the second box

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.650
and if we put a one in both boxes

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.200
so we've got four possible values that we can store. Now just like when we count

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.729
normally using decimal system we got
powers of 10, each of these boxes represents,

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:22.939
we've got the first one represents

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.100
ones or two to the power zero, and the
second one represents

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.350
the twos or two to the power of

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.630
one. And so if we add them together we've got no twos and no ones

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.290
we get zero. No twos and one, so we
get one

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.100
one two and no ones we get two

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.670
and one two and one one we get three. So we can store four possible values

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.740
from naught through to three. If we do the same

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.110
with three bits, zero fours plus zero twos plus zero ones which is zero

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.399
zero fours plus zero twos plus one one which is one

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.130
and so on two, three, four,

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.299
five, six, and seven

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:13.620
apologies for the handwriting. And it's
exactly the same thing we can do we can

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.790
extend this and every time we add an
extra bit we double the amount of

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.260
information we can store certain store
eight numbers

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.900
with three bits two to the power three we had four

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.950
two the power three give us eight

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.409
two to the power four would give us sixteen

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.760
numbers it doubles again store zero through fifteen

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.019
and two to the eight gives us 256

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.409
different values 0 through 255

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:45.230
and it extends up. Now YouTube, because their computers are probably when they  started

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.340
writing and implementing this

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.359
running 32-bit operating systems uses a
standard

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.500
32-bit integer to store the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.680
view count. Makes sense; it's the default on
many systems

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.250
and you think two billion or so views was unlikely to be amassed

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.450
when you if think about it that's a third of the planet perhaps watching

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.900
one video you'd think some of them have
actually something better to do with

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.790
their lives. So a 32 bit system two to the power of 32 gives us

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.780
4,294,967,296

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.900
possible numbers that we can store that's
zero

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:29.120
through to 4,294,967,295

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.900
they're all the values
that we can store

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:36.329
Why did YouTube break when it got past two billion but that's only half the amount

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:37.189
you can fit

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:41.870
in a 32-bit integer? Well computers can
also store negative numbers

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.780
and the way they do that is by using
some of the bit patterns

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.579
the zeros and ones that make up that 32-bit integer to mean

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.970
negative numbers and others to mean
positive numbers

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.620
so we get two billion positive numbers
and two billion negative numbers

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.739
either side of zero. We can see
this if we consider a slightly simpler

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.079
situation using only eight bits or a
single byte

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.019
now the way computers store negative
numbers they use what's called the two's

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.449
complement system and we'll

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:14.949
do another video some time that will go into exactly how that works and the other

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:16.700
systems that were used in the past

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.139
but the basic thing to remember is that
the top bit

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.900
bit 7 so if you number bit zero down here

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.110
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 so bit seven here

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.139
effectively stores the sign if it's zero, it's a
positive number

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.669
if it's one then it's a negative number.
If we have 127

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.659
in decimal on we add one we
obviously get

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:44.520
128 but 128 in binary would be

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.909
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:51.770
and if you remember what  I said the top bit, bit 7

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.969
says whether it is positive or negative and we've gone from being positive 127

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:02.039
to negative 128 this'll be what's called
an overflow error on the computer system

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.659
because we've overflowed the range we
can store positive integers

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:09.960
and gone back around into negative
integers and this is exactly the same that

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.139
would have happened on YouTube if they
added one

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.099
to Psy's hit count because it had gone from being positive

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:19.820
two billion et cetera which is the highest number that they could store in a signed

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.940
32-bit integer to negative

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.320
minus two billion et cetera which is the
lowest negative number they can store.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.229
So you might be asking well why didn't they just switch to using unsigned integers; why did they

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.599
decide to go up to using 64-bit number
which obviously gave them

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.139
a lot more space several quintillion

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:41.849
values to store why didn't they just use an unsigned number, that would double the number they

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:42.630
could store

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.870
One of the things you find which is why it's considered bad practice when writing

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.320
software is that certain simple
calculations

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.669
go wrong so for example say we
subtract

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.099
two numbers, say we were to subtract the numbers

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:58.240
5 and 3

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.250
and we wanted to find out what the difference is well we subtract one from the other

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.130
we get the number two say on the other
hand we define the difference between a

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.479
123

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:11.339
and 200 we do the same we subtract one
from the other

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:14.760
now in a signed system that's fine you get
a -77

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.449
and you can run that through a function
to get the absolute value in

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:21.240
C it would probably be called ABS or abs

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.780
and so we can find a difference
whichever way around quite easily

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.510
but if we're using unsigned integers

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.540
we can't store the value of minus
numbers so we'd end up getting random

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.510
very big

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.540
numbers appearing instead of the simple
difference that we'd expect

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.580
So the point of view YouTube might be
that they want to work out

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.060
how many views they've had between two points and they've had X views

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.340
on Tuesday and now have Y views on
Wednesday subtract

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.670
Y from X or X from Y, and suddenly if you do it one way it works and if you do the other way

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.450
it doesn't. And so it's considered bad
practice when you are writing software that you want to

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.370
be reliable and it's in Google's style guide
to programming

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.590
which we can link to that you shouldn't
use

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.310
unsigned numbers so what they've done is they've taken it from being

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:09.880
signed 32-bit numbers to signed 64-bit
numbers to get that range they need

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.770
17,432

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.790
years so that's how many years were
taken one person to watch Gangnam style

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:23.570
to break YouTube.
