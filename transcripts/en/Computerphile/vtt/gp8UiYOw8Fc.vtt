00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320
*clap* Ah, there we are.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.180
So we have diagnostic information here, but we can also get a

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.620
3D view of what the Hololens actually sees.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.020
So this is the point cloud and or rather mesh that it's creating in real-time.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.080
As you can see that's the room was standing in.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.660
There's the table.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.700
That's the point of view of the Hololens in real time.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.140
First-person view.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.660
There is a bit of a delay.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.060
The Hololens does not need a cable of any sort. 
It's all on board.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.640
This is just to give a preview,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.900
otherwise it's really laggy over Wi-Fi.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.900
*BLIP*BLIP*DIT*DIT*DIT*DIT*DIT*DIT*DIT*

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.860
Point it at me. Let's have a look at what I look like with this.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.920
So, can you be seen? Because it might...

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.020
Because you're effectively a dynamic mesh,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.660
it might not be tracking you.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.760
-Are you actually showing up?
-Eh..something's there.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.360
Maybe. Let's see if I update it...

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.280
And uh, give it a...

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.860
-Ah! Is there...
-Yes, something is there.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.860
Okay.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.040
Yep, and that is enough information for the Hololens to say

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.720
-"Right, there is some sort of object there."
-I can sort of see my camera there...

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.480
-Yep.
-Because I'm pointing at the laptop

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.240
-that's on the table.
-Alright

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.160
Do we have a...?

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.960
-Hold on, let's...
-Trying to stay still

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.900
Okay, and I'll just tell it to update the mesh.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.380
-Ah!
-There we are.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.660
So this is basically a depth map of me is it?

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.220
Pretty much, yeah.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.640
Well from this angle only.
I'll have to walk around otherwise.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.120
I'm seeing some blinking red lights on you.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.080
That is the depth camera array that's on the top of the Hololens, very similar to a Kinect's,

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.020
so the exact cocktail of sensors 
is not very well known.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.800
Talking to you now,
I can sort of just see your eyes,

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.500
but it feels like I've walked 
a bit into the future here.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.380
Indeed it is.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.800
Of all the various head mounts we have,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.180
this one is probably 
the more Star Treky of the lot.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.260
-Haha
-Yeah

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.960
Just like the Kinect or 
the Tango and all those devices,

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.780
What it's doing is
reading the environment around it,

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.920
which is different from what, say
normal optical AR does.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.400
And by creating a measure to understand the environment around it.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.520
And we can start placing content there

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.160
So, as you can see that's

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.820
the example of the mesh,
what it's seeing.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.820
The mesh it's creating in real time.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.480
-Is it constantly updating that?
-All the time.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.060
It's reading the environment
all the time,

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.800
and now this is a view,
exactly what I see.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.740
So I can populate the world

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.440
around me with any
visual contact I want.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.400
So this is the menu, basically.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.180
You should be able to it.
There we are.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.120
So that is a hologram in space.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.300
So let's go play some other stuff.
For example, my settings.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.840
I can either place it in space,
just leave it there,

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.040
or I can go find a nice flat surface

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.580
like say, side of this printer,
and place it.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.140
And that is now locked that that's where it

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.250
belongs

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.950
So, that is now a normal Windows 10 menu,

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.560
many of you will probably
have seen it before.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.180
There we are.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.960
Or we can start placing 
other stuff.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.620
Let's place a...

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.560
It's a theme we put around
three lines.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.020
-These demos usually.
-So that is now locked onto

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.860
the table.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.020
It won't however, it won't move.
It is there.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.440
Now the key thing here unlike most

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.280
of the other AR solutions
 we have seen is

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.599
as soon as these sensors have an

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.430
understanding of depth,
 they can deal

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.040
with the occlusion problem.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.240
So the occlusion problem is where 
the...any AR solution

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.540
doesn't exactly know what it's looking at.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.080
Now, so, and in which case it
draws the digital content above

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.520
everything,
so if you've used any AR,

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.040
any mobile phone-based AR
with a marker,

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.020
you have probably tried putting your 
hand in front of the marker

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.240
to see if it occludes
the virtual content or

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.000
if anybody tries to
pick stuff up.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.420
Normally, with marker-based AR, 
that simply won't work.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.700
All it can really do is tie
content that marker,

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.780
but in this case it,
does have a sense of depth,

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.420
so it can effectively read
your hand

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.420
and stop drawing content over it,
so if I put my

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.940
hand over the cat, right
you can see now

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.240
it is not working
because it hasn't

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.420
triggered from my hand just yet,
but it will eventually catch on.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.920
If you went and kinda looked
behind this laptop,

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.570
- will the cat disappear behind this laptop?
- Uh, it should.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.580
Assuming the the device has actually
read the laptop.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.100
Let's have a go.
Oh, that is stuck.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.080
- Does the stickiness
happen quite often or is it..?

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.940
- No, it's only for the preview
really.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.060
- Oh so basically it's
because we're looking on the laptop

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.460
- Indeed, it's a little bit of a debug view.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.460
As far as my experience goes
on the Hololens,

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.320
everything is smooth.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.260
Oh, there we are.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.840
So, let's have a look.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.240
So it looks like we don't have a lot of
occlusions here.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.780
No, my laptop doesn't seem to
want to hide it.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.860
The problem with the room here

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.240
is there's not a lot of stuff
to hide behind.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.240
So let's try something else.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.800
So, if I was to take a another
hologram and place it

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.740
behind something like sit on the floor
over here.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.620
Right.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.700
There we are, I can see the dog

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.760
and now the table's in the way.
Can't see it.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.600
- Yeah, ok.
- Yep so, this is a case where the geometry

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.150
has been correctly read,
so the Hololens is sure

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.560
that that is a static feature
in my environment.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.280
So it now has built geometry.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.600
As we saw before actually,
we can switch back to

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.580
the previous view.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.280
There we are.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.780
So, this is the geometry
that it is using for the occlusion.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.980
- Oh, so you can see that table there...
- Yep.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.560
-and it's not perfectly smooth.
- Exactly, so previously the cat

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.280
could not be hidden 
behind the laptop because

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.960
as you can see, the laptop
is shown up as a short mesh.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.580
If I had kept moving, 
it probably would have hidden it.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.520
The table though is a nice solid
object.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.880
(it's got that)
 and the dog is hiding

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.000
hiding behind the table,
so I can see the

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.220
hologram from here.
you probably cannot on

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.800
the screen now because
we're seen the preview.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.540
But as I move and I'm
behind the table, it's hidden.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.200
This has not systematically
scanned the entire room

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.600
- and got geometry exactly.
- Mhm

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.700
So, are we looking at a trade-off with that?

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.180
Yes. Yes. Seeing as this is an entirely
on-board process,

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.940
so unlike say, 
all the virtual reality headsets

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.600
we've seen, this does not
 require a desktop computer.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.680
It's basically mobile phone strapped
to my face, just like the Tango.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.860
There is continuously a trade-off between 
speed and performance,

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.040
so if you want to maintain
the experience that everything is smooth,

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.680
say about 30 frames per second for all the content

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.900
I'm seeing,  it's going
to start cutting corners.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.220
and it also goes down to the basically the capabilities

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.220
of the sensors.
How much granularity can they pick up.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.300
How much detail, so you'll see that

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.920
they kind of tend to cut corners,

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.750
will ignore clatter on the tables.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.340
They're not very good with
see through surfaces,

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.920
so for example, the glass walls
over here as you can see,

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.860
they will simply not register.
Because it all comes down

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.800
to computer vision in this case,
but computer vision on the sensors.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.840
Just like we have seen with
 other AR stuff when

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.300
it's through a some sort 
of glass case or what-have-you.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.420
The cameras actually see the reflections,
but unlike our brains,

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.000
they did not know to discard them.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.900
So they don't really know
what to do with them.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.900
The depth sensors so in this case,
I see straight through them.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.460
So that is both a good 
thing and a bad thing,

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.040
depending on your on how
 you want to apply it

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.710
So, I could place a hologram there, but it

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.840
wouldn't necessarily see it as a wall.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.300
So, let's see what we can do.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.620
Of course it's not all 
just placing Holograms around

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.500
Right off the bat, it's the idea that

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.150
you can use the environment around you

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.360
as you're, well, computer environment,

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.730
so if you could just transplant your

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:38.060
everyday desktop use into the
environment.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.740
So I can place a Word file over there,

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.940
I can put my browser on my ceiling,

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.520
make a massive screen.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.860
Eh, obviously there are a lot of uses

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.300
in entertainment, so the games
 on this thing are pretty good.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.820
They will use the environment,

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.260
you can use the physics of your-
 the environment around you.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.200
So you can have a ball bounce,

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.920
on the table,
bounce on the floor.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.225
People have tried this kind of gesture-based

00:08:00.225 --> 00:08:03.680
and moving around kind of 
interfaces for computing before

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.680
And it doesn't really seem to take off.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.320
People are quite comfortable
 with a keyboard and a mouse,

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.320
or some kind of trackpad.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.420
Indeed.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.600
Weirdly, this is probably the first
examples where I've seen people

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.800
just click with it.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.420
So it's only really got to gestures that recognizes,

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:23.940
the click and the menu,
but that is enough.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.260
It is. It is enough for you to be

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.100
able to do basic interaction such as

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.350
drag stuff around, scroll around, select things

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.680
in a way you normally might, you know,

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.820
pointing at something is a
is a normal interaction

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.840
and translates quite well.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.820
And it's the it's also reliability factor,

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.700
so one of the reasons these
 things don't catch on

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.320
Is because usually don't work.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.680
They have a, you know,
you're sitting there tapping

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.220
things, this one is just registering 
and working quite well.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.860
The two gestures for example, the the bloom 
"my bloom" it's called,

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.800
just works reliably every time.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.280
Same as the other main interaction which is the

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.640
click, so I'm not, well there we go.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.300
Every time I click, 
we get a update of the mesh.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.100
You can see how it's
reading the mesh there,

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.180
the environment around it.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.740
Or if I want to get rid of windows,
just point out what I want

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:14.900
and remove.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.130
There, we do have a bit of a problem.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.530
Yes, I can select things and there are

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.440
two gestures that work very reliably,

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.260
but what were missing is a cursor.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.800
Yes, I do have a cursor in
 the middle of like a,

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.780
like a crosshair in the
 middle of my view.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.470
But that means I'm relying on the

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:30.720
direction of my head in order to

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.300
basically look at something,

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.080
center it in the middle of my screen 
and then select it.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.300
Um, this is a good and bad thing.

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.770
There are various interaction methods to do this,

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.270
maybe, I could point at something.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.279
But you see that pointing is actually not

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.400
one of the most accurate things in the world.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.660
We have some other studies with

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:51.280
other interfaces where you can see that

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.820
people think they're pointing at something

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.390
but really they're pointing

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:55.640
with an arm,
they're pointing with a wrist,

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.860
they're pointing with a finger.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:01.060
So, getting a system that understands 
the intent of the user is pretty difficult,

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.440
but gaze is pretty solid.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.060
We have a crosshair,
we aim at we want

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.600
- we select it.
- We're seeing a preview here

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.700
which is a camera on the
front of the device in this view.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.560
Is your field of view a lot wider than that?

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.820
Can you see more stuff?

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.040
If you're looking at that cat,
 what can you see at the sides

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.720
- of your arms?
-That is a very good question.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:19.050
That's actually one of the

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:22.320
things that well surprises
 most people when they put this on.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.460
The field of view is actually that narrow.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:26.220
view is actually fat narrow,

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.410
unlike pretty much every headset just right now.

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:30.210
This is a proper heads-up display,

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:31.980
meaning it's not like the Google Glasses

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.490
where I have my real vision and then a

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.070
second window up in the corner, giving me a

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.839
version of the real world.

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:42.750
This is directly adding content to my normal

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:43.440
vision

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.170
The problem is the area that it has to

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.080
add this content is really very narrow.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.490
I think that's the equivalent of a

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.040
15-inch screen at normal distance,

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.560
so really my field of view of augmented

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.040
content and it sounds bad, but it's not

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.550
that bad, is really just this angle over here.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:05.820
- It's really narrow.
- But you can see at the sides, can you?

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.000
Uh, yes. Yes I can see.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.920
It's all perfectly clear, so I can

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.280
see the cat now.
It's in the center of my

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.830
vision, but if I move my head ever so

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:16.080
slightly, at this point, the cat is

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.990
outside my augmented field of view.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.089
It is quite narrow, but this is a technology

00:11:21.089 --> 00:11:23.190
limitation that my understanding is has

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.140
already been overcome. It's again a

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:26.800
trade-off between cost and performance.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.190
These are developer kits after all,

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.580
so they're already pretty pricey.
If they were to

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.460
have a proper field of you, probably the

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.270
weight and power requirements would have

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.620
made them quite unwieldy other time.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.720
You know, the launch works very well.
It's Cortana.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:45.620
- So umm...
- Should we try and put it on the camera?
-Yep.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.000
- Let's see if this works.
- Okay, so...Whoops.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.420
- It's not gonna work on b[oth]
- I'll have to look out through one

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.900
- of the eyes I guess.
- Oh yeah yeah.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.700
- Oh. Hold on. Yep, I see content.
- Oh, yeah.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:57.840
- Oh, there we are.
- Oh, Okay.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.620
- Okay, so uh
- So, do you want to hold that against there?

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:04.300
- Yep, aim on other account. 
Ok, then we-

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.560
- sure enough, there's content.
- Mhm.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.380
- There's more content.
- Is the cat still there?

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:12.440
- Yeah there's...
Oh hold on, I'm doing it now.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.180
- Uh, we move forward.
- Oh, there we go.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.640
- Yeah it's quite interesting to see that line,
 isn't it?

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.100
So, if I put this on the cat's nose
 for instance,

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.700
and then what?
Click or something?

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.350
- Yep. So, whenever you can interact with

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.560
something, the dot will turn into a circle.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.940
- Ah, okay
- Indeed. And also, when it sees

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.740
fingers and it says
"Okay, you're ready to click."

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:37.800
Same thing.
