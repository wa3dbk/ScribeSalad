00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
&gt;&gt; Sean: We've looked at Chomsky and we've looked at Finite 
State Automata,

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.980
and you've given me a sneak preview about what might be next,

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.360
and my first thought was

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.060
"What do all these notation marks mean, and where do they come from?"

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.760
&gt;&gt; DFB: Chomsky instinctively went for a notation that appeals to

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.960
mathematical logicians or theoretical computer scientists 
nowadays -- very tight, very compact.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.500
What he would basically say about a programming 
language identifier,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.300
which we're trying to define, is that everything in Chomsky's
world is a sentence.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.300
We've covered this already in the car park:

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.560
"A legal sentence in this language is five-five-five-five-five."

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.500
So everything's an 'S' in Chomsky notation.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.260
What he would say about the identifiers problem ..., 
In sensible languages,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.540
we've got to start off with a letter. I'll call that L.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.460
And then, the tail piece of the identifier.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.480
Well, it could be nothing at all because a single letter is an
identifier in pretty well every language.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.800
But the tailpiece could be more letters, more digits, in any
combination. Fine.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.140
Now, round about the time late '50s turning into 1960, there
was a whole bunch of them

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.960
defining the language ALGOL, which was the first language to
be designed by a committee

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.960
and ran into all the usual committee problems, but when you
think back to that era,

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.460
FORTRAN was there, COBOL was there, they never, until later
on, had a formal definition.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.240
The ALGOL people said we are going to use something like
Chomsky notation

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.160
to define what's a legal program.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.520
John Backus and Peter Naur, who were on the ALGOL 60
defining committee --

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.280
Backus was famous as one of the big inventors of FORTRAN;

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.320
Peter Naur, a very famous European computer scientist --

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.200
they said we need something that is more self-explanatory.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.820
And they invented a notation that looks like this:
pointy brackets!

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:07.500
Yes, this early on! And we are going to say, an identifier - not a
sentence, it's an identifier we're trying to define.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:15.280
And rather than using Chomsky's arrow, which they felt might
occur in the middle of a program and cause confusion,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:23.560
they wanted a "is defined as" operation here which wouldn't
ever occur inside a program.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.780
But they wanted it to be clear it was part of the definition.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.580
And they said, "Easy, we're not going to call it L, we're going
to say &lt;letter&gt;".

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.640
And you see the advantage straight away: That you can then
say, ahh!, it's a letter followed by

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.480
a tailpiece, which we'll call &lt;tail&gt;.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.920
By putting things in the pointy brackets, we're saying:
We don't literally mean that you must look for

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.560
the characters l-e-t-t-e-r on your input, no, we mean
"anything that can be a legal letter".

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.000
So further down here there'd be another definition saying a 
letter is an 'A', a 'B', a 'C' (...) all the way up to 'Z', and all that.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.740
The tailpiece is far more complicated because it's any mix of
further letters or further digits,

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.140
but there could be a definition for digits.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.420
But the point is, they're readable things here, they're readable
notions as they're sometimes called.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.420
And they are pretty well self-explanatory, far more appealing
to be setting out a definition of a programming language,

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.720
than you forever having to remember, "Oh, a letter capital
'D', is that a digit or is it a denominator?" You know.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.640
Of course the theoreticians say, "Oh, it's far too verbose, but
yes, I expect I do understand.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.220
You've got to make it clear to people who have got no brain,
exactly what's going on."

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.520
So this was very popular for defining languages.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:48.820
&gt;&gt; Sean: So this is a bit like having a how-to guide, is it? Like
saying "This is not programming; this is how the programming works."

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:57.340
Yeah, exactly, it's a blueprint for legal programs -- all of them
-- they've got to fit into this template basically;

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.980
that's what the formal definition did.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.800
And the interesting thing, as many of you are yelling at me now
is, "This is XML, isn't it?"

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:11.480
It is the forerunner of XML. XML, as some of you know,
started of with a thing called SGML,

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.640
which was its earlier form, but it was refined into being XML.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.480
And right back from the early SGML days, somebody saw
Backus-Naur Form notation and said

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.120
"That is going to be fantastically useful for what we
want to do."

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.620
The characteristic of this [BNF] stuff is that you never ever
see it in the actual language itself,

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.720
and we can see advantages in actually making these appear
in documents.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.720
Now, we all know this, don't we?! We all accidentally see a listing of
our Web pages that went wrong and you see

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.220
things like &lt;p&gt;. So this is XML, be clear.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.840
You see things like &lt;br/&gt;.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.920
&gt;&gt; Sean: And actually, if anyone right-clicks on the YouTube webpage
and selects 'View Source',

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.220
they're going to see all this (...) 
&gt;&gt; DFB: Yes, they're going to see this, all of that.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:02.260
But what the XML people realized was that so long as you
introduce the "end-of" slash --

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.860
just elaborate the notation a bit -- you really could use it in
an actual document.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.900
Say: "the paragraph starts here" and "the paragraph ends here".

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:17.700
The break-line here, it starts and finishes, it's just a marker,
and most browsers are tolerant if you miss the slash out,

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.620
but, you know, theoretically that should be there.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:27.380
So, they gave it some new lease of life, really, by saying, well,
we're not going to just keep it in the abstract,

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:33.440
we're actually going to use it, within documents, to clearly delineate
where things start and where things finish.
