00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
&gt;&gt; Sean: We are kicking off a bit of a 
mini-series on things that programmers find

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:11.400
essential, and it'd be great to find out
what you think is essential.
&gt;&gt; BWK: Sure.  Lots of

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.460
things that are essential.  Do you want to
narrow the scope of that a little bit?

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.160
I mean, coffee is essential.
&gt;&gt; Sean: So within programming, I mean, you want to tell us

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.180
about some kind of array -- is that true?
&gt;&gt; BWK: Yes, I guess I would say that I wanted

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.170
to talk primarily about associative
arrays which are in other contexts

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.309
called hash tables or sometimes in a
language like Python they're called

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.570
dictionaries.  The idea is an array which
has as its subscripts not integers from

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.239
0 or 1 up to something, but rather any
arbitrary thing is the subscript of the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.379
array.  And so this gives you a great deal
of flexibility; you can build really

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.680
interesting things with associative
arrays.  I will call them associative

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.449
arrays.  If you think hash table if you're
a Java or JavaScript programmer, let's

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.890
say, or if you think dictionary for
Python people, it's the same basic thing.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.820
So the idea is instead of having
subscripts which go from let's call it

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.680
zero up to something, you have arbitrary
subscripts, and for simplicity let's just

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.310
call them strings of characters, just
text: words like "Sean" or "Dave" or "Steve". 
&gt;&gt; Sean: So

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.610
let's get people context there -- we have
our our film crew in full effect.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.049
So if I understand rightly, then that
means instead of keeping track on you

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.759
know number 13 was the number that I
gave to the number of whatever then instead

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.229
it can say nails or screws or whatever 
&gt;&gt; BWK: Correct.  One of the classic

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.530
examples that this thing is that you
want to keep track of, for example, oh

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.189
your groceries that you might buy.  So we
are buying things like beer and pizza

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.070
and coffee and chips, this sort of
thing.  And so what you'd like to do is

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.649
have an array where the subscripts are
beer and pizza and chips and coffee or

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.800
whatever else.  And then the values of
those array elements can be whatever you

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.860
want, but they might be for example
how much you spent on beer and pizza and

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.360
coffee.  And so you could write a very
simple program that would simply say "I

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.659
have pizza ten pounds, beer 20 pounds, coffee two

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:33.260
pounds, beer 20 pounds" and I would like to
just add up all of the things for the

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.310
pizza, all of the things for the beer
separately, and so on.  And so I would

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.599
simply add that, add numeric values to
what you see in the array, add those

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.709
subscripts that are instead of being
numbers are just the strings: beer, pizza.

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:55.040
I think it's a lot easier in many
respects and so easy to use this stuff,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.790
very natural I think for many people, and
it turns out the implementation is

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.390
actually quite simple as well.  It took I
imagine in computer science a while for

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.900
people to realize how to do it well and
now I think people really do understand

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.530
how to make effective, efficient
implementations of associative arrays.  So

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.790
I don't know whether I could perhaps
draw a picture that would be useful that

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.370
would give somebody an idea of how do
this.  Let me try.  
&gt;&gt; Sean: Sure.
&gt;&gt; BWK: Let's suppose I

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.910
have an array, let's just call it X
because I have no imagination and I

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.380
would like to say, okay, the element here
is pizza.  And I could say how much pizza

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.639
did I buy?  Well 20 pounds worth of pizza or
something like that, or maybe it was 20

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:41.180
pizzas -- doesn't matter.  And so I can say X
of beer equals 10, and so on.  And then I

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:49.010
could later on say well, X of beer equals X
of beer plus 15.  So this is the way

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.400
that you would use these in a program
with all of the advantages and they

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.540
would look just like the subscripts that you
would find if these were integers

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.410
instead, like pizza were 1 and beer were 2
and so on, but this is a lot more natural.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.000
So that's kind of the use of this.  How
would you actually build one of these

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.819
things?  The internal representation is
often, and this is where really hash

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.319
table is probably the right way to think
of it, suppose we have in memory

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.489
somewhere an honest to god array of the
sort that we're familiar with where the

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:25.879
subscripts go from 0, 1, 2,
dot dot dot up to whatever, some number

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:31.159
N like this.  This is going to be the
hash table where you can find things.  And

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:36.080
what happens is if I want to find the
particular place in this table where

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.629
elements associated with let's say pizza
are stored, then what I do is I take pizza

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:47.870
and I run it through a hash which
scrambles it up in some way and produces

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.569
a number which is between 0 and in this
case let's call it N.   OK?  So the

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:57.530
hashing takes this, scrambles it, you
could imagine doing just by adding up

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.360
the letters, treat them as numbers, add
them up, and you get some value, and then

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.250
you use the modulus function to reduce
it so that it's in this range.  That tells

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.659
you the pizza stuff is going to be
stored here, but you don't store it in the

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:16.430
table; what you do is that you have
typically something that says I'm pizza

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.960
and my current value is 20.  This is
getting a little too small.  And this

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.000
simply points to it.  Okay?  So now somebody
comes along later on and wants to say

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.340
where is Pizza stored in the array?  What
I do is same process I say ok take

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.210
pizza, run it through the hash function,
gives me a number, let's call it in this

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.699
case 2, and I say oh ok the pizza guy is
there.  Okay?  So that's the basic thing. But

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:45.940
what happens if something else by
accident of the hashing collides with

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.580
pizza.  Maybe beer collides with pizza.  I
mean they go well together.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.080
So what happens there is that the data
structure is really a linked list and so

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:00.860
if it turns out that by accident beer
also, when run through the hash, comes out

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.569
as 2, so this is called a hash collision.
So what you have to do there is to say

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:08.930
well there's really a data structure a
little more complicated and it points off

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:14.719
to something that says beer, which is at
this point 25 let's say.  And so when I

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:19.430
want to look up beer, I simply start at
the front here and I say pizza no that's

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.440
not beer; ah there's beer, and now I'm all
set.  And there's also something that says

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.469
there's no more in this list.  And if
another thing comes along that happens

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:33.229
to also collide with this, then no
problem, we just make the list longer.  So

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:38.360
then what you have to do, this hashing
function here has to have the property

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.599
that you give it a bunch of different
things like beer, pizza, coffee, coke,

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:47.270
whatever, it should spread those things
fairly uniformly across the table so

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.930
that you don't get everybody piling up
in this particular element but you get

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.849
mostly these little chains of things
about the same length.  And that means

00:06:55.849 --> 00:07:00.439
that the access to the information in
this table, it's sort of constant time.

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:04.669
You do the hash function, it tells you
where to go, and there's usually only one

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:09.379
or two elements in any given chain of
things that happen to have the same hash

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:13.639
value.  You know, suppose that this is
small, maybe N is only 10 and you've got

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:17.060
hundreds of different things in the
table, N has to be bigger.  And so what

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.599
you can do at that point is you can
actually grow the table.  You can say okay

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:24.319
let's just rehash everything in sight
and make a new table.  I'm going to switch

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:29.689
to a new page here so we could see it.
&gt;&gt; Sean: fanfold is going to throw you now.

00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:32.629
&gt;&gt; BWK: Fanfold has thrown me.
I remember fan-fold from my youth.

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:37.699
So here we have this hash table that
went from 0 up to some old value of N

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:43.430
like this and we've got things in it
like my pizza and my beer and so on.  And

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.849
suppose that it's gotten very crowded at
this point; if N was small and I've got

00:07:46.849 --> 00:07:50.719
lots of things, it's going to get crowded
necessarily.  So what I can simply do is to

00:07:50.719 --> 00:07:54.860
say well let me make a new table let's
twice as big, four times -- doesn't matter,

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.209
something that's a lot bigger, and simply
take every element that I find here,

00:07:59.209 --> 00:08:02.419
whatever it might be,
compute its new hash value and just stick

00:08:02.419 --> 00:08:06.529
it into this table instead.  And so with a
different value here, might find that

00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:11.029
pizza is here but beer is down here;
they're no longer linked together -- quite

00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:15.680
possible because this value would
determine where they're put and so if I

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.610
changed so that this is let's say a
table of 2 N or something like that,

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:23.749
they might hash differently.  Might
hash the same too.  And so now you can see

00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:27.889
that on the average, the chains are going
to be half as big and only do this once

00:08:27.889 --> 00:08:31.909
in a while when the table starts to get
full, and maybe I make it four times as

00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:37.099
big.  And so at all times the accessed
information in this hash table is pretty

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:41.659
much constant time -- you come in, you hash
it, and very short look down a list and

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:44.839
you're done.  Once you've made this new
table of course, then you can throw away

00:08:44.839 --> 00:08:47.649
the information from that one.
&gt;&gt; Sean:  So the modulo or the

00:08:47.649 --> 00:08:51.880
amount to be modulo by will be N.
&gt;&gt; BWK: Yes,
right, exactly.  Yeah, I mean I've been

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.720
careless because we started at zero and
we went up to N, and so that's really

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.779
N plus one elements.  You have to be a
little cautious there, that's a classic

00:08:58.779 --> 00:09:03.220
kind of error that programming,
programmers -- other programmers -- might make.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:09.160
I would never do that.  But but that's the
idea.  And and then of course the details

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:14.440
of what's a good hashing function and
how to make that really spread arbitrary

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.940
information around -- it's still kind of a
you've got to be careful to get it right,

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.820
but there's an awful lot of good
guidance and so for the most part it

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:25.660
just works fine.  And and this is very
simple to implement; the amount of code

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:30.070
in pick your favorite programming
language is probably a few tens of lines

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:34.600
of code at most.  It's very compact, very
easy to do -- you do it once and then you

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.350
say okay, now I understand how that stuff
works.  You don't have to think about it.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:41.620
You can use somebody else's implementation 
&gt;&gt; Sean: So they're saying so some

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:45.610
of this is you write yourself but that
will probably be libraries out there.
&gt;&gt; BWK:  Yeah

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:49.839
right if you're in Java there's a class
what is it, hash table or something like

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:55.540
that I think; I've forgotten exactly.  In
Python there's the subscript dictionary

00:09:55.540 --> 00:10:02.649
that looks like that.  In Perl there's a
hash -- literally hash and so on.  These

00:10:02.649 --> 00:10:06.160
kinds of things, I've got too many of
them in my head, they blur, especially

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.260
under pressure, and so I would have to go
and look to be sure but that's the

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.160
essence of it.

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:20.720
Self-publication is a recipe for having things disappear
without a trace.  And so the first

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.079
edition did sort of disappear without
much trace.  The second edition was

00:10:24.079 --> 00:10:28.670
published by Princeton University Press
who also has an arrangement with Oxford

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:35.800
University Press, and so I'm hopeful that
the book gets a lot more publicity.
