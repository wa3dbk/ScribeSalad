- The whole fucking place
is fallin' apart,

00:00:02.802 --> 00:00:04.704
and quite honestly,
I'm sick of Jay's

00:00:04.737 --> 00:00:06.806
pretzel-eatin' attitude

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.275
comin' in hot!
What happened to us?

00:00:09.308 --> 00:00:11.511
- Everyone, it's the
soon-to-be-defunct "Bonfire"--

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:13.646
- What happened to us?!
- Comedy Central Radio,

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.549
SiriusXM 95 as it exists,
as we speak.

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:18.418
- Yes, as in the now.

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:20.520
- Speaking right now--
yes, speaking in the...

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:22.188
(chuckles)

00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:23.489
- Present tense.
- Speaking in the present tense.

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:25.158
Yes, uh, we are here.

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:26.559
- Oh, Dave-- someone unplugged
Dave's headphones.

00:00:26.592 --> 00:00:28.194
- Yeah, thanks a lot.

00:00:28.227 --> 00:00:30.063
- We come in here sabotaging
our guests, Dave.

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:31.397
- Yeah, what's it,
super competitive day?

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.465
- Yeah.
Good luck.

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:33.633
- Tommy Two Hats...

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:34.834
Tommy Two Hats himself,
everybody.

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:36.469
- Ah, me too.

00:00:36.502 --> 00:00:39.338
- From the "Bumping Mics"
special on Netflix.

00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:41.174
Uh, touring everywhere
right now.

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:43.342
- And from the coming-to-you
Tommy Two Hats Tour.

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:56.222
You guys are special.
- Great.

00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:57.490
- And I know now,
since this is the...

00:00:57.523 --> 00:00:58.691
pretty much,
I guess you could say

00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:01.060
the swan song
of this franchise.

00:01:01.093 --> 00:01:02.595
- Yeah, it really seems like
the farewell tour.

00:01:02.628 --> 00:01:03.696
- You're seeing us
in the death throes.

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:05.198
- I don't know, guys.

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:06.599
- We have gotten--
- You guys really--

00:01:06.632 --> 00:01:08.501
Together, I mean,
you were like, you know--

00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:10.069
It was awesome.
- Thanks.

00:01:10.102 --> 00:01:11.337
- Apart, I don't know
if it's gonna work.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.106
- We had one advertiser
all week.

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:14.440
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

00:01:14.473 --> 00:01:16.542
And ironically,
it's about looking for jobs.

00:01:16.575 --> 00:01:18.211
- Yeah.
(laughter)

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:19.745
- We're getting the message
they're putting out.

00:01:19.778 --> 00:01:22.448
Which is, "Search. Search for
something else to do."

00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.250
- They're sayin' hey,
if you go with ZipRecruiter,

00:01:24.283 --> 00:01:26.519
you could really probably
find something in a few days.

00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:29.222
- I think, you know, this is
a good time to look for work.

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:30.389
- Yeah.
- Yeah. (chuckles)

00:01:30.422 --> 00:01:31.757
- (Dave) You know?
- Economy's up.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.392
- Maybe it's not you,
maybe it's the tariffs.

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:34.827
- You're right, I think
it's the Chinese tariffs.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.629
- They're comin' into--
- They're getting hit big.

00:01:36.662 --> 00:01:38.197
- There's another "Bonfire"
out there you don't know about.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.565
- Yeah, there's
a Chinese "Bonfire"

00:01:39.598 --> 00:01:41.300
that works for half the price.
- (laughing)

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.768
- Before you came in--
- They just come in, they go...

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:44.303
(stereotypical Asian accent)
Have you seen Little Jay

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:46.072
and Very Tall Dan?
(laughter)

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:48.174
It's the Chinese version
of "Bonfire."

00:01:48.207 --> 00:01:50.476
Very funny, half price.
- "Very Tall Dan"?

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:51.744
- Very Tall Dan.

00:01:51.777 --> 00:01:54.180
- Sumo Jay and Very Tall Dan.
- Yeah.

00:01:54.213 --> 00:01:56.149
- That's good. I like that.
- He had three sisters.

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:59.118
Three dead sisters!
Not one dead sister, three!

00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:01.387
(laughter)
- That's a great voice.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.590
- Dave, before you came in
we were ranking ourselves here

00:02:04.623 --> 00:02:06.626
through a question that
Sal Vulcano asked earlier

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.561
I thought was a good one.
Ranking yourself...

00:02:08.594 --> 00:02:10.530
- (unaccented) The Cardinals.
- Just straight up from looks.

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:12.131
- (Dave) Mm-hm.
- One to ten.

00:02:12.164 --> 00:02:14.400
Like, when you walk
into a bar or something,

00:02:14.433 --> 00:02:15.568
or a club...
(Dave and Dan snickering)

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:17.069
...what's the number
you have,

00:02:17.102 --> 00:02:20.106
versus now tack in
personality, comedy,

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:22.175
whatever else you want to say,
fame or whatever,

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:23.609
where the number is
from there.

00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:25.244
- In-- in looks?
For me?

00:02:25.277 --> 00:02:26.612
- In looks, straight up,
yourself.

00:02:26.645 --> 00:02:28.614
- And one is the lowest?

00:02:28.647 --> 00:02:30.149
(laughing)

00:02:30.182 --> 00:02:32.451
I would give myself a fi--
a point-five.

00:02:32.484 --> 00:02:33.586
I think I'm below one.

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:35.154
- No.
- (Dan) Stop it, Dave.

00:02:35.187 --> 00:02:36.489
- I would.
- That's just insanity.

00:02:36.522 --> 00:02:38.191
- Well, what bar are we
talkin' about, then?

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:39.525
That I'm a good-lookin' guy?
- We're talking about

00:02:39.558 --> 00:02:42.094
the most exclusive bar
in New York City.

00:02:42.127 --> 00:02:43.396
"Fwap."
- I mean, a point-five.

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:45.298
- "It's named
after onomatopoeia."

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:47.400
- There's no bar at
the shelter.

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:49.669
- There's deformed people
out there, man.

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:51.170
- I'm talkin' about
the Rusty Rose

00:02:51.203 --> 00:02:52.405
in East fuckin' Canarsie.
- (laughing)

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:54.106
Oh, sure.
I look okay there.

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:57.109
- Yeah. I said you're walkin' in
at 5 a.m. on a Sunday.

00:02:57.142 --> 00:02:58.711
- I mean, it-- it could be
a room full of carnies,

00:02:58.744 --> 00:03:00.246
and I still would be
everyone's plan "B."

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:02.548
(laughter)
I really don't think...

00:03:02.581 --> 00:03:05.351
I don't-- No, I don't think
I'm a-- no.

00:03:05.384 --> 00:03:06.485
Ugly.
I'm an ugly.

00:03:06.518 --> 00:03:08.054
- No you're not.
- Yeah I am.

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:09.422
- No, you're not ugly.
- Stop it right now.

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:11.057
- I love saying that.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.258
How many times have you ever
said that to God?

00:03:12.291 --> 00:03:13.726
"God, why did
you make me ugly?"

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:15.261
- Yeah.
(laughter)

00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:16.762
You're lookin' at
a positive radio show.

00:03:16.795 --> 00:03:18.464
That's why they want us off
the airwaves, Dave.

00:03:18.497 --> 00:03:20.399
- We're spreadin'
a good message.

00:03:20.432 --> 00:03:21.801
- Well, I was watching
this thing about Chippendales.

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:23.569
- Okay.
- And we all know, um,

00:03:23.602 --> 00:03:25.171
here's my favorite thing.
It was like a self-produced

00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:26.672
documentary about Chippendales.

00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:28.541
You guys are probably
a little young for this, but...

00:03:28.574 --> 00:03:30.142
- Oh, no, but I want to dive
into this even...

00:03:30.175 --> 00:03:31.644
- Yeah, I-- I know ya do, right?
- Yeah.

00:03:31.677 --> 00:03:33.579
- But they said
it was at the Mystique.

00:03:33.612 --> 00:03:35.214
As well all know,
this nightclub

00:03:35.247 --> 00:03:36.682
in the '80s and '90s
in New York.

00:03:36.715 --> 00:03:38.517
Very big time for nightclubs.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.386
Uh, the Mystique,
right next to

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.622
a really, really funny
comedy club, The Dangerfield's.

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:44.056
So, I was like... (laughing)
- (Dan) Oh!

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:45.391
That's hilarious.
- I was like,

00:03:45.424 --> 00:03:47.059
that was a real tip of the hat.
- He goes...

00:03:47.092 --> 00:03:48.194
(mimicking Rodney Dangerfield)
"Hey, can we have

00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:49.662
"some of those fake bowties?

00:03:49.695 --> 00:03:51.097
I just want to wear a bowtie
and no shirt under it."

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.665
- (laughing)
- That's hilarious.

00:03:52.698 --> 00:03:54.333
- "You have any just cuff links
I can borrow?"

00:03:54.366 --> 00:03:56.202
(laughter)

00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:58.070
- 'Kay, I--
so, here's the best part,

00:03:58.103 --> 00:04:01.173
is that some of the guys,
you know, were the dancers.

00:04:01.206 --> 00:04:03.342
They were the main show.
And then there was the waiters.

00:04:03.375 --> 00:04:06.112
And then there was the emcee.
And they were all buff,

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:07.380
good-lookin' guys.
- (Jay) Yeah.

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:09.148
- So, where would I be
on that scale?

00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:11.183
I would be like, you know
the guy who parks the cars?

00:04:11.216 --> 00:04:12.652
- Yeah.
- (chuckles)

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:14.353
- So it'd be like, if there
was a problem with that,

00:04:14.386 --> 00:04:15.721
I would be the guy that
they would have to go, like...

00:04:15.754 --> 00:04:17.189
(Boston accent)
"There's a shark in the back."

00:04:17.222 --> 00:04:18.658
- (laughing)
- Yeah.

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:20.326
- "If you think someone
stole a coat outta your car,

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.028
"you talk to that guy.
Don't look at him, though.

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:23.429
Do not look at him."
- You're like the key holder.

00:04:23.462 --> 00:04:24.797
- Yeah.
- You're the guy with all the--

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.732
with all the rings of keys,
and they go,

00:04:26.765 --> 00:04:28.501
"I have the Accord--"
- And he goes, "Sir, do you

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:29.702
"want to put
a number on that

00:04:29.735 --> 00:04:31.137
so you know which keys
are mine?"

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.371
He goes, "I know
which keys are yours."

00:04:32.404 --> 00:04:34.140
- Yeah, believe me,
this is my...

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:35.441
- Got a little TV in the shack.
- This is my life's work.

00:04:35.474 --> 00:04:36.575
- You go, "That.
Whatever that number is."

00:04:36.608 --> 00:04:38.077
- No, I'm-- I'm not good--

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.312
How about yourself?
What do you think?

00:04:39.345 --> 00:04:40.579
I think you're
a good-lookin' guy.

00:04:40.612 --> 00:04:42.148
- Me too.
He's got sleepy blue eyes.

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:44.583
- I said, I would say, uh...
a five--

00:04:44.616 --> 00:04:47.119
I'm-- I'm saying a six,
'cause if you say five,

00:04:47.152 --> 00:04:48.521
people go,
"You're boo-hooing yourself."

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:50.122
- Yeah.
- A six?

00:04:50.155 --> 00:04:51.557
- And then I would say with...
- Dave just--

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.693
- With personality,
up to like maybe an eight.

00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:56.595
With personality, really,
and like everything--

00:04:56.628 --> 00:04:58.331
like, my whole resume.

00:04:58.364 --> 00:05:00.466
The whole picture is a--
is an eight.

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:02.068
- Can you factor in--

00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:03.502
- And that's probably
a way too-high number.

00:05:03.535 --> 00:05:05.538
- Can you factor in your
fan base and web presence?

00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:07.340
- Yes, web...
- These young kids--

00:05:07.373 --> 00:05:08.641
these young kids
got to feel

00:05:08.674 --> 00:05:10.276
tha they're important,
you know?

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:12.111
- We try to see what
his digital thumbprint is.

00:05:12.144 --> 00:05:13.779
- Thumbprint is.
- What do they-- I hate that.

00:05:13.812 --> 00:05:16.449
What's your digital
thumbrint, Jay?

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:18.150
- See, even as I say it again,
I think it's wrong.

00:05:18.183 --> 00:05:20.753
I think I go from five to--
to six or seven, maybe.

00:05:20.786 --> 00:05:23.055
- Mm.
- Hmm, well, I know one thing,

00:05:23.088 --> 00:05:24.223
tall is always in.
Women love a tall man.

00:05:24.256 --> 00:05:25.591
- It is.
- And Dan is very tall.

00:05:25.624 --> 00:05:27.193
- They can like a guy
that rebounds.

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:29.562
- That's a big deal.
Black Lou says that a--

00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:32.598
a short man can only max out
at an eight.

00:05:32.631 --> 00:05:33.799
- Really?
- (Lou) Yeah.

00:05:33.832 --> 00:05:35.468
- It's the glass ceiling
for a short man.

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:36.702
- (Dave) Interesting.
- Is Kevin Hart an eight?

00:05:36.735 --> 00:05:38.204
A hard eight?

00:05:38.237 --> 00:05:40.473
- You don't put him
at a nine?

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:41.640
- I gotta give him an eight.

00:05:41.673 --> 00:05:43.509
- You give him an eight?
- Really?

00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:45.044
- Just on physical appearance.
With personality, he's a nine.

00:05:45.077 --> 00:05:46.479
- (Lou) Oh, he's a ten.
- This guy shits money.

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:47.713
- (Dan) Yeah.
- Eight?

00:05:47.746 --> 00:05:49.148
- (Dan) He's a ten,
you're right.

00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:50.216
(Lou)
Jacob, what would you give him?

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:51.784
- The dick.
- Like, what...

00:05:51.817 --> 00:05:53.652
- (Dan) Jacob, now's your time
to talk about

00:05:53.685 --> 00:05:55.554
your physical attraction
to Kevin Hart.

00:05:55.587 --> 00:05:58.057
- Yeah, I'm with Lou on this.
I think height only--

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.093
- Would you give him a blowjob
to work on his network?

00:06:01.126 --> 00:06:02.762
- (chuckles)
- You're gonna have to,

00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:04.163
'cause this place is gonna
be gone.

00:06:04.196 --> 00:06:05.765
You think Dave's
gonna save you?

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:07.433
What, do you think Dave's gonna
take you out on "Bumping Mics"?

00:06:07.466 --> 00:06:08.634
- No, but I was here
like a couple of months ago.

00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:10.169
When did it become this
guys talking

00:06:10.202 --> 00:06:11.771
about other guys
and how good-lookin' we are?

00:06:11.804 --> 00:06:13.205
- Oh, that's been
a whole thing.

00:06:13.238 --> 00:06:15.274
- It was about talking
about our own--

00:06:15.307 --> 00:06:17.009
not about other guys.
- Okay.

00:06:17.042 --> 00:06:18.477
- I'm mostly here for
the other guys.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:19.779
- But I think Kevin--
the thing that I like

00:06:19.812 --> 00:06:21.447
about Kevin is that
he dresses up.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.615
He looks good.
- Yeah.

00:06:22.648 --> 00:06:24.250
- He looks good in a suit.
- True.

00:06:24.283 --> 00:06:25.584
- As we always used to say.
My dad said, like,

00:06:25.617 --> 00:06:27.086
if you look good in a suit,
you're set,

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:28.254
you know,
and he was shorter than me.

00:06:28.287 --> 00:06:29.522
- I don't look good
in a suit.

00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:31.023
- He was way tinier than me.

00:06:31.056 --> 00:06:32.358
- I don't look good
in a suit either.

00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:33.759
- Dan looks great in a suit.
- Of course.

00:06:33.792 --> 00:06:35.294
- I don't think I do.
I look a little boxy.

00:06:35.327 --> 00:06:37.329
Look a little "Lurchy."
- You do?

00:06:37.362 --> 00:06:38.764
- Yeah, look
a little "Lurchy."

00:06:38.797 --> 00:06:41.767
Um, are you into
independent detectives?

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.335
- Am I into them?
(laughter)

00:06:43.368 --> 00:06:45.604
Sure.
- Dude, sick segue, dude.

00:06:45.637 --> 00:06:47.106
- Thanks, bro.
- Is this a new app,

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:48.407
or is there actually
a detective here?

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.775
- No, we're trying to get--

00:06:49.808 --> 00:06:51.310
Jay's trying to get
me into this--

00:06:51.343 --> 00:06:53.479
We watch the show "Cheaters."
- Oh, oh!

00:06:53.512 --> 00:06:54.680
I know what
you're talkin' about.

00:06:54.713 --> 00:06:56.081
Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, detective work.

00:06:56.114 --> 00:06:57.683
- Yes.
- Yeah, Detective Gomez,

00:06:57.716 --> 00:06:59.118
I believe-- have we found
that, Christine?

00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:01.520
Is he the detective
from "Cheaters"?

00:07:01.553 --> 00:07:03.222
- (Christine) It looks like it.
It looks like he's the guy.

00:07:03.255 --> 00:07:04.356
- Do you ever watch "Cheaters"?
- Yeah, of course I--

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:05.491
I've been on the road.
- Yeah.

00:07:05.524 --> 00:07:06.725
(laughter)

00:07:06.758 --> 00:07:08.160
- That's a road show.
- "Blind Date."

00:07:08.193 --> 00:07:09.428 line:0%
- Like, three hours
of "Cheaters."

00:07:09.461 --> 00:07:11.130 line:0%
- You got "Blind Date,"
"Cheaters"...

00:07:11.163 --> 00:07:12.431 line:0%
- And "Cheaters," yup.
- All the old fuckin' hits.

00:07:12.464 --> 00:07:14.133
- "Forensic Files."
- "Foren"-- yeah.

00:07:14.166 --> 00:07:15.334
You know all the things
that are airing

00:07:15.367 --> 00:07:16.769
at two to three in
the morning.

00:07:16.802 --> 00:07:18.704
Well, Jay found this guy
from watching "Cheaters,"

00:07:18.737 --> 00:07:20.606
where he breaks down
"Cheaters" episodes.

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:22.274
Also, I like that he was--
- He doesn't break 'em down.

00:07:22.307 --> 00:07:23.609
He just posts them,

00:07:23.642 --> 00:07:26.011
but when it would go
to commercial normally,

00:07:26.044 --> 00:07:27.580
he just puts himself in there
going like,

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:29.248
"Yo, check out
detectivegomez.com

00:07:29.281 --> 00:07:30.483
"if you want to know if
someone's been cheating on you,

00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:32.284
you thnk that someone..."

00:07:32.317 --> 00:07:33.619
And it's just some dude...
- Oh, that's him? That's cool.

00:07:33.652 --> 00:07:35.354
- ...that just talks in between.
It's hilarious.

00:07:35.387 --> 00:07:36.589
- (Dan) Mm-hm.
- (Dave) Mm.

00:07:36.622 --> 00:07:37.690
(Christine)
The P.I. that the show--

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:39.458
that the producers hire.
- Yes.

00:07:39.491 --> 00:07:41.126
That makes sense to me.
- So they have a legit P.I.

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:42.328
- Is that show still
in production, as they say?

00:07:42.361 --> 00:07:44.263
- Well, their host just died.

00:07:44.296 --> 00:07:47.433
- Oh, really?
- Clark Gable III.

00:07:47.466 --> 00:07:49.034
- Oh. (laughing)
- Yeah.

00:07:49.067 --> 00:07:50.636
(laughter)
That's a real thing.

00:07:50.669 --> 00:07:52.738 line:0%
- That's a real thing, oh, yeah.
- Wow.

00:07:52.771 --> 00:07:56.575
- Oh, didn't Detective Gomez
do a "in memoriam"

00:07:56.608 --> 00:07:58.444
for Clark Gable III
that we could show Dave?

00:07:58.477 --> 00:08:00.613
- Yeah, we have-- I haven't
seen it yet myself.

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:03.516
I just know this guys'
got a wealth of videos online,

00:08:03.549 --> 00:08:05.751
and he's got one video where
he's talking in front of--

00:08:05.784 --> 00:08:07.386
- Look, Dave,
this Reese's peanuts

00:08:07.419 --> 00:08:08.521
is wearing two hats too.
This Reese--

00:08:08.554 --> 00:08:10.022
- (laughing)

00:08:10.055 --> 00:08:11.123
- Two hats--
- You're the winner, Dan.

00:08:11.156 --> 00:08:12.424
- Yeah!

00:08:12.457 --> 00:08:14.026
- You get the tour
of Dave's apartment.

00:08:14.059 --> 00:08:15.628
- Oh! I've got to go home
and change first.

00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:18.297
- Smell my finger.
The, uh...

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.567
So, this detective--
he's a real detective, right?

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.636
- He's a real detective,
but... (clears throat)

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:25.337
He-- Oh, wow,
is this gonna be it?

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:26.605
- (Dave) Oh, no.
- This is his--

00:08:26.638 --> 00:08:27.673
- But he didn't
do anything about

00:08:27.706 --> 00:08:29.174
this guy's death
or anything.

00:08:29.207 --> 00:08:30.576
He's like,
I'm not that kind of detective.

00:08:30.609 --> 00:08:31.544
- No.
- No-- Yeah, exactly!

00:08:31.577 --> 00:08:32.611
You don't get anything.

00:08:32.644 --> 00:08:34.179
- You know I get
in the mud.

00:08:34.212 --> 00:08:35.481
- I only deal with asking you
to put a camera

00:08:35.514 --> 00:08:37.316
inside your boyfriend's
apartment

00:08:37.349 --> 00:08:40.519
so you can watch him
banging your best friend.

00:08:40.552 --> 00:08:42.454
The B-roll-- I say
the "Bad Girls Club"

00:08:42.487 --> 00:08:45.124
and the show "Cheaters,"
the B-roll must be fantastic.

00:08:45.157 --> 00:08:46.425
- Oh, it must be.
- 'Cause they've walked in

00:08:46.458 --> 00:08:48.193
on people making
clown pornography before.

00:08:48.226 --> 00:08:49.562
- This is-- Is this a good time
to drop the bomb

00:08:49.595 --> 00:08:51.697
on my new show, or no?
- (laughing)

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:53.532
- I mean, we're waiting for
something to spool up, right?

00:08:53.565 --> 00:08:55.434
- We're waiting for Christine
to hit "play," I don't know.

00:08:55.467 --> 00:08:57.269
- Ah, here we go.

the most uncomfortable speakers

00:10:18.717 --> 00:10:20.419
I've ever seen. I have no idea
why he did the show.

00:10:20.452 --> 00:10:21.687
- He's not the original host
of "Cheaters," though.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.055
- No.
- The third.

00:10:23.088 --> 00:10:24.523
- That was
like five hosts ago.

00:10:24.556 --> 00:10:26.258
- Three, he's the third.
There was only three hosts.

00:10:26.291 --> 00:10:28.494
Tommy Grand started the show.
- (stifling laughter)

00:10:28.527 --> 00:10:30.763
- And then his name became
Tommy Habeeb.

00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:32.398
He started using
his real-ass name.

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:34.199
- (laughing)
- Very weird, right?

00:10:34.232 --> 00:10:37.336
Uh, and then Joey Greco
took over after people couldn't

00:10:37.369 --> 00:10:40.773
deal with the Tommy Habeeb
switch, I guess?

00:10:40.806 --> 00:10:42.408
I guess the world
wasn't ready.

00:10:42.441 --> 00:10:43.742
- Wow.
(laughter)

00:10:43.775 --> 00:10:45.544
- And then, uh,
Joey Greco did it.

00:10:45.577 --> 00:10:48.280
And then Joey Greco, they--
they faked a stabbing on a boat.

00:10:48.313 --> 00:10:49.581
- Yeah, I remember that,
seeing that.

00:10:49.614 --> 00:10:51.083
- And then it went
off the air for a while,

00:10:51.116 --> 00:10:53.152
and then CG3 came back.

00:10:53.185 --> 00:10:54.486
- (laughing) "CG3"!
- There's almost--

00:10:54.519 --> 00:10:56.355
there's almost
as many Dr. Who's

00:10:56.388 --> 00:10:58.290
as there are hosts
of "Cheaters."

00:10:58.323 --> 00:11:00.626
(laughter)

00:11:00.659 --> 00:11:02.194
- Let's continue with
the "in memoriam."

00:11:02.227 --> 00:11:03.729
- The Dr. Who
of "Who's Cheatin'?"

00:11:03.762 --> 00:11:06.098
- Who's...
the who's who...

00:11:06.131 --> 00:11:08.734
- Dr. Whodunnit!
- (laughing)

00:11:08.767 --> 00:11:10.402
- (Gomez)<i> Okay, we're gonna
 get on the road right now.</i>

00:11:10.435 --> 00:11:12.071
- There's nothing worse
than getting caught cheating

00:11:12.104 --> 00:11:13.772
and then a handsome man
stands there and goes,

00:11:13.805 --> 00:11:15.741
"Why would you do that?"
- Oh, also guy-- I--

00:11:15.774 --> 00:11:17.443
- "I don't understand
why you would do--

00:11:17.476 --> 00:11:19.111
she loved you so much.
She took care of you two years."

00:11:19.144 --> 00:11:20.479
- A guy that can't laugh along.

00:11:20.512 --> 00:11:21.647
You're like,
"Right, Clark, this sucks?"

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.082
He's like, "What?"

00:11:23.115 --> 00:11:24.717
- "I don't understand.
What sucks?

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.218
Why wouldn't you just tell her
you didn't want to be with her?"

00:11:26.251 --> 00:11:27.319
- "I got to spend
some time with her.

00:11:27.352 --> 00:11:28.787
She seems like a lovely lady."

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.456
You're like, "Please don't
do this to me, dude."

00:11:30.489 --> 00:11:32.424
- "She cares about you."
- "Can you be a guy about this?"

00:11:32.457 --> 00:11:33.726
- There's no way the timing
actually worked out that way.

00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:36.495
- (mimicking Ewok babble)
Detective Gomez.

00:11:36.528 --> 00:11:38.497
(mimicking Ewok babble)

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.365
Who is that?
Who is that furry little friend?

00:11:40.398 --> 00:11:42.301
- ♪ Bum ba dum ba dum
boop boop ♪

00:11:42.334 --> 00:11:45.237
♪ Bum ba dum
ba dum boop boop ♪

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.439
Um, yeah, he would just
get in...

00:11:47.472 --> 00:11:49.108
"Well, I don't understand why
you would cheat

00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:50.509
on someone who
loved you so much."

00:11:50.542 --> 00:11:52.611
They would really goad
the situation.

00:11:52.644 --> 00:11:54.279
- Let's keep watching
the "in memorial."

00:11:54.312 --> 00:11:55.681
- It was hard to feel sorry
for anybody on the show.

00:11:55.714 --> 00:11:57.116
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

00:11:57.149 --> 00:11:58.283
- Yeah, 'cause you know
that they all--

00:11:58.316 --> 00:11:59.485
this is all self-deserved.
- Yeah.

00:11:59.518 --> 00:12:01.220
- Self-fulfilled prophecy.

00:12:01.253 --> 00:12:03.789 line:0%
-<i> ...the location, and we're
 gonna go from there.</i>

00:12:03.822 --> 00:12:07.426 line:0%
<i> Stay tuned, and be ready
 for some crazy action.</i>

00:12:07.459 --> 00:12:10.162
- As they're laughing at
someone's life falling apart.

00:12:10.195 --> 00:12:11.497
- Is that them?
I didn't recognize them

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:12.698
'cause they were wearing
sunglasses.

00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:14.299
They were "undercover,"
I suppose.

00:12:14.332 --> 00:12:15.768
(laughter)

00:12:15.801 --> 00:12:17.336
- (Dan) They're on
a sting operation.

00:12:17.369 --> 00:12:19.204
- Who is that?
- Is that Detective Gomez?

00:12:19.237 --> 00:12:21.740
- Is that Tony Habeeb, or...
who is that?

00:12:21.773 --> 00:12:23.275
- That's Clark Gable III.
- (Dave) Oh, right.

00:12:23.308 --> 00:12:24.676
Oh, see?
(laughing)

00:12:24.709 --> 00:12:27.813
- CG3.
(Jacob laughing)

00:12:27.846 --> 00:12:30.716
(music plays on TV)

00:12:30.749 --> 00:12:32.651
- Terrible picture.

00:12:32.684 --> 00:12:34.787
- So how did he die, though?
Does anyone know?

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.388
- I think drugs.
- Probably drug overdose.

00:12:36.421 --> 00:12:38.157
- Oh, well that mime episode
was great.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.391
- I think he drowned
in pussy.

00:12:39.424 --> 00:12:41.160
- That was the only time
the mime talked.

00:12:41.193 --> 00:12:42.761
It's like... (whispering)
"You should go to a doctor."

00:12:42.794 --> 00:12:44.830
- "I see something.
You look 'jaunt.'"

00:12:44.863 --> 00:12:46.732
- "My mime abilities."

00:12:46.765 --> 00:12:48.167
- "Yeah, I'm miming
that you're jaunty."

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.501
- By the way--

00:12:49.534 --> 00:12:51.136
- "Ease up your heart rhythm.
It's off."

00:12:51.169 --> 00:12:52.671
- He goes from like
handsome and young-looking

00:12:52.704 --> 00:12:54.540
in one picture to like...

00:12:54.573 --> 00:12:56.074
- Yeah, look at that.
- Like someone age--

00:12:56.107 --> 00:12:57.476
like a gypsy curse
aged him or something.

00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:58.677
- Yeah, some of these pictures,
he looked like

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:00.145
he played in the NBA
in the '80s.

00:13:00.178 --> 00:13:02.381
- No, it looks like
he just lost, uh...

00:13:02.414 --> 00:13:03.715
he lost...
(laughing)

00:13:03.748 --> 00:13:05.217
he lost the belief
in true love.

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.451
- Yeah, it's gone.
- (laughing)

00:13:06.484 --> 00:13:07.753
- He's like,
"I'm never gonna find

00:13:07.786 --> 00:13:09.288
that one romance."
- "It's gone. It's gone.

00:13:09.321 --> 00:13:11.456
"Ashley got married.
She moved on.

00:13:11.489 --> 00:13:12.624
That was my shot."
- Oh, yeah, that'd be cool

00:13:12.657 --> 00:13:14.026
if he meet someone
on the show.

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:15.327
- Oh, yeah.
He hooks up with a girl

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.528
that got cheated on.
- (laughing) Yeah.

00:13:16.561 --> 00:13:18.730
"Come on over here,
little bit."

00:13:18.763 --> 00:13:20.299
- All right.
- How old was he?

00:13:20.332 --> 00:13:21.733
He was young, right?
- Died of an overdose.

00:13:21.766 --> 00:13:23.402
- Was he young?
- Yeah, he was in his...

00:13:23.435 --> 00:13:25.070
- Can't tell, it depends
what picture you're asking.

00:13:25.103 --> 00:13:27.439
- (Jacob) In his 30s.
I think it was OxyContin.

00:13:27.472 --> 00:13:29.241
- Mm.
- Mm, wow.

00:13:29.274 --> 00:13:32.177
- Good job, Purdue Pharma.
You took another good one.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:35.614
- He goes, "Well, he went out
feelin' 'noice.'"

00:13:35.647 --> 00:13:37.182
- That explains why
the "Cheaters" budget

00:13:37.215 --> 00:13:39.117
went up way high
the last season.

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.153
- Yeah.
- "Listen, we need..."

00:13:41.186 --> 00:13:42.454
- The "Cheaters,"
a lot of missing money

00:13:42.487 --> 00:13:44.189
in the "Cheaters"
petty cash.

00:13:44.222 --> 00:13:46.058
- They go, "Hey, guys, listen.
I know that we, uh...

00:13:46.091 --> 00:13:47.826
"we still greenlit
another season for 'Cheaters.'

00:13:47.859 --> 00:13:50.495
Can I ask why it has the budget
of an Avengers movie?"

00:13:50.528 --> 00:13:52.197
(laughter)

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:53.799
- "Can we get an advance?"

00:13:53.832 --> 00:13:56.335
- Yeah. "Did you guys catch
someone major

00:13:56.368 --> 00:13:59.538
"cheating on here with some,
I want to say, Blackwater--

00:13:59.571 --> 00:14:01.540
Did you guys hire Blackwater
to hire-- to find--"

00:14:01.573 --> 00:14:03.575
- Setting up a drone at
an Olive Garden parking lot

00:14:03.608 --> 00:14:05.177
is not cheap.
- (Dan and Jay) Yeah.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:07.045
- Maybe they can... (chuckles)
redo the show

00:14:07.078 --> 00:14:08.680
where it's like people
who are cheating on their diets.

00:14:08.713 --> 00:14:10.482
It would take some of the--
(laughing)

00:14:10.515 --> 00:14:12.117
- "That guy with that burger."
- "Put the brownie down!"

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:13.685
(laughter)

00:14:13.718 --> 00:14:15.153
- "Oh, yeah?
Why do we have video

00:14:15.186 --> 00:14:16.755
"of you with
a pastrami sandwich

00:14:16.788 --> 00:14:18.257
at home when you said
you were at work?"

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:19.758
- You can have
home security footage

00:14:19.791 --> 00:14:22.160
of Christine eating fuckin'
snacks while I'm gone,

00:14:22.193 --> 00:14:23.328
on the road
or something like that.

00:14:23.361 --> 00:14:25.130
- Old "Noodle Hands"
Christine?

00:14:25.163 --> 00:14:26.798
- Not willing to tell me.
- (Christine) I'd be mortified

00:14:26.831 --> 00:14:28.400
if I was being filmed while
you were on the road.

00:14:28.433 --> 00:14:30.102
(laughing)

00:14:30.135 --> 00:14:31.670
- Vecchione doesn't realize
I put on his clothes,

00:14:31.703 --> 00:14:34.740
and I eat...
I eat on his bed.

00:14:34.773 --> 00:14:36.508
- Christine just flagran--
- Oh, that would--

00:14:36.541 --> 00:14:38.310
that would make him nuts.
- I mean, he would kill me.

00:14:38.343 --> 00:14:39.678
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I think he would legitimat--

00:14:39.711 --> 00:14:41.246
If I sat Indian-style
and just ate, like,

00:14:41.279 --> 00:14:42.614
Indian food.
- Nom, nom, nom, nom.

00:14:42.647 --> 00:14:45.250
- (munching)
Then he comes home, he's like,

00:14:45.283 --> 00:14:47.085
"Dude, can I talk to you?"
- For sure.

00:14:47.118 --> 00:14:48.387
- So, can I pitch
my show now, or...

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.721
- (Dan) Yeah. Fuck, yeah.
- (Jay) Yup.

00:14:49.754 --> 00:14:51.189
- What's your show?
- We got a new show.

00:14:51.222 --> 00:14:52.491
It's called
"Celebrity Hospice."

00:14:52.524 --> 00:14:54.259
- (Dan) Okay. I like it.
(laughter)

00:14:54.292 --> 00:14:55.694
- I'm afraid--
I'm sorr--

00:14:55.727 --> 00:14:57.095
he would have been
a great addition, this kid,

00:14:57.128 --> 00:14:58.630
Clark Gable IV.

00:14:58.663 --> 00:15:00.165
It's when people's careers
are dying before they are.

00:15:00.198 --> 00:15:01.600
- Oh.
- And then, you know, we give--

00:15:01.633 --> 00:15:03.302
let them go out
with a little dignity.

00:15:03.335 --> 00:15:04.603
I'm gonna be
on the show myself.

00:15:04.636 --> 00:15:06.204
My career has died
ten years ago.

00:15:06.237 --> 00:15:07.639
- Is there--
Is there, like, a finale

00:15:07.672 --> 00:15:09.308
talent show that you guys do?

00:15:09.341 --> 00:15:11.109
Well, that's the whole thing
is we're, like, um,

00:15:11.142 --> 00:15:13.378
we try and, like, transition
them into getting jobs.

00:15:13.411 --> 00:15:15.180
- Mmm, you're--
- Yeah.

00:15:15.213 --> 00:15:16.481
- --assimilating.
- We have an audition today

00:15:16.514 --> 00:15:18.283
for you down at Staples.

00:15:18.316 --> 00:15:20.218
- Yeah, the winner gets to be

00:15:20.251 --> 00:15:21.653
Andy Dick's assistant
for a year.

00:15:21.686 --> 00:15:23.322
- Yeah.
- (laughter)

00:15:23.355 --> 00:15:25.357
(whispering) And...
the assistant for Andy Dick

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:28.160
is... (mimics drumroll)
- I loved that show.

00:15:28.193 --> 00:15:30.395
"The Assistant."
- "One unlucky customer!"

00:15:30.428 --> 00:15:32.097
- Yeah, um.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:33.532
- Let's finish this tribute.

00:15:33.565 --> 00:15:35.667
- Oh, to the fuckin'
Latin dance music?

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.469
Here you go. Hit it.
- That's a long tribute.

00:15:37.502 --> 00:15:39.604
- ♪♪
- But what's the other thing

00:15:39.637 --> 00:15:41.306
you had, Christine,
for this guy?

00:15:41.339 --> 00:15:43.175
- Well, there's--
there's a few things

00:15:43.208 --> 00:15:44.543
we have going on.
- Mm-hmm?

00:15:44.576 --> 00:15:46.378
- Well, is that guy a mime,
or is he wearing

00:15:46.411 --> 00:15:48.046
the reverse whiteface?

00:15:48.079 --> 00:15:49.614
- I bet-- that mime is

00:15:49.647 --> 00:15:51.616
definitely part of the--
catching the--

00:15:51.649 --> 00:15:53.151
- I think that's
Detective Gomez.

00:15:53.184 --> 00:15:56.221
- They've had people come in
and do a, like,

00:15:56.254 --> 00:15:57.789
fake, like, knock on the doors
as, like, a pizza guy

00:15:57.822 --> 00:15:59.591
and then-- and then bust in.

00:15:59.624 --> 00:16:01.760
- That would be a cool credit
on an acting thing.

00:16:01.793 --> 00:16:03.428
As the mime on "Cheaters."

00:16:03.461 --> 00:16:04.997
- Played Mime Clown
on "Cheaters."

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:07.599
- --were you in
Episode 167 of "Cheaters"?

00:16:07.632 --> 00:16:10.535
He's got his bio up on his--
he's-- what's the book?

00:16:10.568 --> 00:16:13.138
The book is "Ten Ways
You Can Spot Cheating."

00:16:13.171 --> 00:16:14.773
- Yeah, it's not--
- Let's go through these signs.

00:16:14.806 --> 00:16:16.308
- --super insightful,
it's pretty, like, on the nose.

00:16:16.341 --> 00:16:18.310
- This is good.
- (growly) Detective

00:16:18.343 --> 00:16:20.078
Daniel Gomez presents...

00:16:20.111 --> 00:16:21.513
- It's written like
a wedding invitation.

00:16:21.546 --> 00:16:22.714
(laughing)

00:16:22.747 --> 00:16:24.516
- I mean,
he's got a fuckin'...

00:16:24.549 --> 00:16:26.785
- The table of contents is
gonna be ten chapters, I hope?

00:16:26.818 --> 00:16:28.787
- Difficulty-- difficulty--
- The old-- calligraphy.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.422
- Oh, it's too much,
I'll tell you what--

00:16:30.455 --> 00:16:32.391
this guy is selling out
dudes across the country.

00:16:32.424 --> 00:16:34.292
Difficulty getting--
so every time you can't

00:16:34.325 --> 00:16:35.594
get a hold-- someone's
got a bad signal,

00:16:35.627 --> 00:16:36.628
they're definitely
cheating on you.

00:16:36.661 --> 00:16:38.196
- I wanna meet someone

00:16:38.229 --> 00:16:40.365
that has read this book
and fuckin' thought

00:16:40.398 --> 00:16:41.700
their partner was cheating
'cause of this book.

00:16:41.733 --> 00:16:43.435
- Everybody.
- Everybody.

00:16:43.468 --> 00:16:45.070
- Everyone who's read it is,
like, definitely,

00:16:45.103 --> 00:16:46.638
"I'm being cheated on."
- Difficulty reaching your

00:16:46.671 --> 00:16:48.073
partner is the first sign.

00:16:48.106 --> 00:16:49.274
- What's the next one?

00:16:49.307 --> 00:16:51.109
I can't reach during
business hours?

00:16:51.142 --> 00:16:53.278
My partner takes hours
to return texts.

00:16:53.311 --> 00:16:55.113
- Mmm.
- Cannot reach partner while

00:16:55.146 --> 00:16:57.215
running errands,
I'll tell you what--

00:16:57.248 --> 00:16:59.484
if someone starts--
if somebody starts responding

00:16:59.517 --> 00:17:01.753
to texts super-quick,
maybe also that's the thing,

00:17:01.786 --> 00:17:04.022
'cause they wanna
get it over with.

00:17:04.055 --> 00:17:05.390
It could be
any number of things.

00:17:05.423 --> 00:17:07.092
- What if your part--
what about number two--

00:17:07.125 --> 00:17:08.460
where your partner is
paying more attention

00:17:08.493 --> 00:17:10.262
to his or her appearance.

00:17:10.295 --> 00:17:12.264
- Oh, wow.
- Going from a 6 to an 8.

00:17:12.297 --> 00:17:13.999
- Mmmm.

00:17:14.032 --> 00:17:16.034
- Yeah, Christine's
been putting makeup on lately.

00:17:16.067 --> 00:17:17.669
- I don't like that.
- Mmm.

00:17:17.702 --> 00:17:19.237
- She been putting
a lot of makeup on lately.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:20.405
She hasn't been standing
in front of the mirror

00:17:20.438 --> 00:17:21.773
doing makeup in
quite some time.

00:17:21.806 --> 00:17:23.608
Now she's back
to making smoky eyes again.

00:17:23.641 --> 00:17:25.277
- Vecchione's been eating
a lot of vegetables.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.645
Do you think he's trying
to court a new roommate?

00:17:26.678 --> 00:17:28.780
- Yeah, I do.

00:17:28.813 --> 00:17:30.482
- I'm pretty insecure about it.
- All of a sudden, my partner

00:17:30.515 --> 00:17:32.117
has been spending
a lot more time working out

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:33.585
at the gym rather than
spending time with me.

00:17:33.618 --> 00:17:35.187
(under breath)
Well, that's not happening.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.789
Uh, I have not been going
to the gym at all.

00:17:37.822 --> 00:17:40.792
Uh, my partner recently
colored her hair differently.

00:17:40.825 --> 00:17:42.594
- No.
- Wow, this is very, uh--

00:17:42.627 --> 00:17:45.163
- More time in the mirror?
- This is vague as shit.

00:17:45.196 --> 00:17:47.466
- In the mirror, yeah,
Christine's in the mirror a lot.

00:17:47.499 --> 00:17:49.234
So, so far, she's cheating.

00:17:49.267 --> 00:17:52.037
I tried to call her earlier
today, she didn't answer.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.673
- It sounds a little--
very fine line of possession.

00:17:54.706 --> 00:17:57.042
Where it's like, uh,
my partner's doing anything

00:17:57.075 --> 00:17:59.711
that doesn't involve me?
She's cheating.

00:17:59.744 --> 00:18:01.480
- That is what it seems.
- I noticed she didn't laugh

00:18:01.513 --> 00:18:03.648
at the joke she heard
12 times at the barbecue.

00:18:03.681 --> 00:18:05.450
- (laughter)
- This book should be--

00:18:05.483 --> 00:18:07.385
- She's cheating!
- This-- This book should be

00:18:07.418 --> 00:18:10.355
called "Dating Detective
Daniel Gomez Is a Nightmare."

00:18:10.388 --> 00:18:12.057
- Did she-- Did she make plans
with her friends

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:13.725
instead of greeting you
when you got home from work

00:18:13.758 --> 00:18:15.694
with a Tom Collins?
- Cheating!

00:18:15.727 --> 00:18:17.696
- Cheating.
- Did she sleep--

00:18:17.729 --> 00:18:19.397
- Everyone--
- Did she sleep a half-hour

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.099
longer than she normally does?

00:18:21.132 --> 00:18:22.434
- Cheating.
- Cheating.

00:18:22.467 --> 00:18:25.137
- Partner is preoccupied
and less attentive.

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:28.006
Yeah, right now Christine's
cheating on me with Skankfest.

00:18:28.039 --> 00:18:31.176
- (muttering)
- Holding conversation?

00:18:31.209 --> 00:18:33.178
- Oh, my partner forgets
things I tell him.

00:18:33.211 --> 00:18:36.014
Uh-- I mean,
why is it always on him?

00:18:36.047 --> 00:18:38.683
Every-- things I tell "him"?

00:18:38.716 --> 00:18:40.252
Wouldn't it be "them"?

00:18:40.285 --> 00:18:42.154
It's always a guy, huh?
- It should be, but--

00:18:42.187 --> 00:18:44.489
- "My partner," yeah.
- My partner and I are having

00:18:44.522 --> 00:18:46.625
a very hard time
holding conversations.

00:18:46.658 --> 00:18:48.493
He's an idiot.
- I wonder if that--

00:18:48.526 --> 00:18:50.462
the scenario is,
"You know, that reminds me

00:18:50.495 --> 00:18:52.731
of one time on 'Cheaters.'"
- (laughter)

00:18:52.764 --> 00:18:55.634
- Snore. Snore.
- You don' think he doesn't--

00:18:55.667 --> 00:18:57.769
he doesn't fuckin' shoehorn
that in there every time?

00:18:57.802 --> 00:18:59.571
- Oh, yeah,
abso-- for sure.

00:18:59.604 --> 00:19:01.406
- He goes, "You know,
so when we're on set--"

00:19:01.439 --> 00:19:03.475
- Yeah.
- "And I know I got the perp,

00:19:03.508 --> 00:19:06.077
"what I like to do is,
I like to-- CG3, my boy,

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:08.113
RIP CG3."
- CG3.

00:19:08.146 --> 00:19:09.481
- He's in the dirt,
but he's not forgotten.

00:19:09.514 --> 00:19:10.749
- "I jump out of the van,

00:19:10.782 --> 00:19:12.217
the cameraman's
right behind me,"

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:15.387
bore! Bore!
- Boring.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.055
- Yeah, I don't wanna talk
to the detective.

00:19:17.088 --> 00:19:18.456
I wanna talk to the bouncers.

00:19:18.489 --> 00:19:20.358
- Yes.
- Or a host of the show.

00:19:20.391 --> 00:19:22.594
- Cameraman.
- I'll tell you what,

00:19:22.627 --> 00:19:24.196
uh, editor Corey over there,

00:19:24.229 --> 00:19:26.398
whoever gets to edit,
are you not envious

00:19:26.431 --> 00:19:28.400
of the job of editing,
like, a "Bad Girls Club"

00:19:28.433 --> 00:19:30.669
or a show like that--
there is so much gash

00:19:30.702 --> 00:19:33.238
just laying
on the cutting room floor there.

00:19:33.271 --> 00:19:35.540
- Is the editing community
a small one?

00:19:35.573 --> 00:19:37.709
Do you know the editors
of "Bad Girls Club"?

00:19:37.742 --> 00:19:39.544
Would you say
it's tightly cut?

00:19:39.577 --> 00:19:41.279
- Fuckin' this Camera Corey

00:19:41.312 --> 00:19:43.548
knows the guy who got
killed on "Cops."

00:19:43.581 --> 00:19:45.083
The cameraman.
- Yep.

00:19:45.116 --> 00:19:47.319
- That's how tight-knit
the camera community is.

00:19:47.352 --> 00:19:49.621
- Did you know that?
- Wow, how many rounds have you

00:19:49.654 --> 00:19:52.557
had to buy for that guy?
I mean, honestly.

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:54.159
- No, he died,
he got killed.

00:19:54.192 --> 00:19:55.760
- Oh, he did?
But that's like, that's like,

00:19:55.793 --> 00:19:57.562
that's like
adventure journalism,

00:19:57.595 --> 00:19:59.397
those guys, you know, the guys,
like, on the fishing boats.

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:01.700
All those guys?
- The "Deadliest Catch" dudes?

00:20:01.733 --> 00:20:03.101
- There's another guy
who's doing, like,

00:20:03.134 --> 00:20:04.336
"Well, I do 'Puppy Bowl,'

00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:05.804
you know,
I could get bit."

00:20:05.837 --> 00:20:08.106
Oh, yeah,
you're buying this round.

00:20:08.139 --> 00:20:09.708
- That's so great.

00:20:09.741 --> 00:20:11.543
Oh-- some of those dogs
have sharp teeth.

00:20:11.576 --> 00:20:13.078
- Yeah, I mean really.
- They let--

00:20:13.111 --> 00:20:14.379
They let
up to three months.

00:20:14.412 --> 00:20:15.780
- They trust 'em loose, too.

00:20:15.813 --> 00:20:17.215
They just let 'em
run loose.

00:20:17.248 --> 00:20:18.750
- They are--
their handlers are not

00:20:18.783 --> 00:20:20.752
in the room when that puppy bowl
is going on.

00:20:20.785 --> 00:20:23.121
Yeah, that's fuckin'--
- Do you notice your partner

00:20:23.154 --> 00:20:24.522
is not as interested
in Puppy Bowl anymore?

00:20:24.555 --> 00:20:26.258
- Cheating.
- Cheating.

00:20:26.291 --> 00:20:28.293
- I wonder how much cops--
- Is your partner playing

00:20:28.326 --> 00:20:30.528
in the Puppy Bowl?
Cheating.

00:20:30.561 --> 00:20:32.330
- Your partner's been going
on more business trips.

00:20:32.363 --> 00:20:33.765
- Decreased sexual activity,

00:20:33.798 --> 00:20:35.500
intimacy, and affection
from partner?

00:20:35.533 --> 00:20:38.837
Oh, every relationship?
- (laughter)

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:41.239
- Whoa, what a fuckin'
bold prediction.

00:20:41.272 --> 00:20:44.109
Hey, do you not find
your partner as attractive

00:20:44.142 --> 00:20:45.810
as you did
when you first met?

00:20:45.843 --> 00:20:48.380
- Mm-hmm.
- Cheating.

00:20:48.413 --> 00:20:50.515
- Uh, the next one says
intuition.

00:20:50.548 --> 00:20:51.816
I'm trying to read it.

00:20:51.849 --> 00:20:53.852
Intuition.

00:20:53.885 --> 00:20:56.154
Uh, the feeling,
the disturbing feeling

00:20:56.187 --> 00:20:57.722
that something is wrong.
- Yes.

00:20:57.755 --> 00:21:00.325
- That's what Jacob brings
to the table every day for me.

00:21:00.358 --> 00:21:02.360
- That's Jacob's daily routine.
- Fuckin' doom face.

00:21:02.393 --> 00:21:04.462
And then they, of course,
tell us in fact

00:21:04.495 --> 00:21:06.298
that there is doom,
imminent doom.

00:21:06.331 --> 00:21:08.199
So, my intuitions were correct.

00:21:08.232 --> 00:21:09.668
- If you don't know
the depth and details,

00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:11.569
your gut knows that something
is off-center.

00:21:11.602 --> 00:21:13.638
- So, if you have a feeling
that something's wrong,

00:21:13.671 --> 00:21:16.207
your-- your significant other
is cheating on you.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.076
- When he wrote this paragraph,
I wonder if he just

00:21:18.109 --> 00:21:20.078
pushed himself away
from the typewriter

00:21:20.111 --> 00:21:22.681
in that remote Maine cabin
that he rented to write this.

00:21:22.714 --> 00:21:24.549
- "You saved
a lot of people's lives."

00:21:24.582 --> 00:21:26.184
- I thought he was gonna go,
like, and you know,

00:21:26.217 --> 00:21:27.485
if you think
you're being cheated on,

00:21:27.518 --> 00:21:29.054
the first-- best thing to do is

00:21:29.087 --> 00:21:30.822
cheat on them
before they cheat on you.

00:21:30.855 --> 00:21:32.590
- (growly)
Cut their brake lines.

00:21:32.623 --> 00:21:34.392
They don't respect you,
they do not live.

00:21:34.425 --> 00:21:36.594
- You can do it with me.
I'm emotionless.

00:21:36.627 --> 00:21:39.097
I don't get attached easy.
- (growly) Hello, I am--

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:40.699
- I am a good,
generous lover, I'm told.

00:21:40.732 --> 00:21:42.567
- I am an apathetic sociopath

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.569
that does mind--
does not mind

00:21:44.602 --> 00:21:45.670
performing oral sex.

00:21:45.703 --> 00:21:47.205
- You gotta get this guy
in here.

00:21:47.238 --> 00:21:48.473
- Yeah, Daniel Gomez?
I would love that.

00:21:48.506 --> 00:21:49.741
- He could save
a lot of relationships.

00:21:49.774 --> 00:21:51.376
He might be able to save
the show.

00:21:51.409 --> 00:21:52.677
(fire crackling)

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:54.245
- Uh, it's the Bonfire,
we're hanging out

00:21:54.278 --> 00:21:56.281
with Dave Attell--
Dave Attell gonna be

00:21:56.314 --> 00:21:57.716
in Albany this Friday
and Saturday

00:21:57.749 --> 00:21:59.317
at the Funny Bone.

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:01.186
Uh, with dates coming up
for Bumping Mics

00:22:01.219 --> 00:22:03.154
at the Borgata

00:22:03.187 --> 00:22:05.724
as well as the Sands Casino
in Bethelehem, Pennsylvania.

00:22:05.757 --> 00:22:08.093
DaveAttell.com
for more info on those.

00:22:08.126 --> 00:22:11.029
And to buy tickets--
um, Dan, what's wrong?

00:22:11.062 --> 00:22:12.797
I ate too much candy.
- Are you having--

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:14.432
are you really getting a rush?
- I got a tummyache.

00:22:14.465 --> 00:22:16.101
- You got a candy headache.
- I got a tummy--

00:22:16.134 --> 00:22:18.203
I got a tummyache--
I fuckin' took down

00:22:18.236 --> 00:22:21.706
six Reeses Pieces, like,
five Kit Kats.

00:22:21.739 --> 00:22:24.175
Dave's a terrorist,
Dave's a candy terrorist.

00:22:24.208 --> 00:22:26.611
He comes in here,
and he fuckin' blows up our bus.

00:22:26.644 --> 00:22:28.780
- You--
- Meager bus.

00:22:28.813 --> 00:22:31.149
- I know you're backed up on
some things you have to watch...

00:22:31.182 --> 00:22:32.484
- Mm-hmm.
- ...for this show.

00:22:32.517 --> 00:22:33.818
You have not watched
the "Heart of Gold"

00:22:33.851 --> 00:22:35.553
documentary yet?
- I have not.

00:22:35.586 --> 00:22:37.088
- Did you check that out
at all, Dave?

00:22:37.121 --> 00:22:38.456
- What is it?
- It's about molestation.

00:22:38.489 --> 00:22:40.492
- The gymnastics...
- (Dave) Oh, no, no--

00:22:40.525 --> 00:22:42.494
- US gymnastics team getting
molested by the doctor.

00:22:42.527 --> 00:22:44.496
- Oh yeah, horrible story.
- "Horrible story".

00:22:44.529 --> 00:22:47.165
- No, it is. And, uh--
- It's weird to say

00:22:47.198 --> 00:22:49.634
it's a fantastic documentary
about a horrible--

00:22:49.667 --> 00:22:51.636
- It's a hard topic, yeah.
- It is definitely

00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:53.838
the most backflips
in any form of pedophilia.

00:22:53.871 --> 00:22:56.241
(laughs)
- Yeah, no shit.

00:22:56.274 --> 00:22:57.575
- Most capable
standing backflips.

00:22:57.608 --> 00:23:00.278
-<i> No mas.</i> 
- That doctor was crazy.

00:23:00.311 --> 00:23:03.047
You have the, uh-- you kee--
I feel like we keep

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.749
starting to say about
the "Rolling Stone" article

00:23:04.782 --> 00:23:07.585
on Corey Feldman.
- Oh, dude. There is a weird--

00:23:07.618 --> 00:23:09.454
the Corey Feldman is in
"Rolling Stone"...

00:23:09.487 --> 00:23:11.356
- Now, Dave went with us.
- (Dave) Yeah, I was there.

00:23:11.389 --> 00:23:13.425
- To see Corey Feldman live.
- So Corey Feldman,

00:23:13.458 --> 00:23:15.226
there's a new article
in "Rolling Stone"

00:23:15.259 --> 00:23:17.195
with Corey Feldman and he's
talking about the Wolfpack,

00:23:17.228 --> 00:23:21.032
who we had, um...
- The leader of, we spoke to.

00:23:21.065 --> 00:23:23.701
- ...on the show.
- The Wolfpack is a--

00:23:23.734 --> 00:23:27.505
a thing he believes is a group
of people coming to--

00:23:27.538 --> 00:23:30.341
I guess they attacked him with
a needle on the streets.

00:23:30.374 --> 00:23:32.677
- Oh, right, right.
- And bother him constantly

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:34.546
online, they basically
cyberbully him, he says.

00:23:34.579 --> 00:23:37.482
- Yeah, he gets cyberbullied.
- We talked to Bobby Wolfe

00:23:37.515 --> 00:23:39.818
of the Wolfpack who says
he doesn't know what

00:23:39.851 --> 00:23:41.686
he's talking about, but maybe
Bobby Wolfe's a lunatic.

00:23:41.719 --> 00:23:43.555
Who knows?
- But they talk about it

00:23:43.588 --> 00:23:45.590
in "Rolling Stone", and they
talk about how Corey Haim's mom

00:23:45.623 --> 00:23:48.092
is-- kind of assembled
the Wolfpack to stop

00:23:48.125 --> 00:23:50.228
Corey Feldman from, you know,
just blatantly talking

00:23:50.261 --> 00:23:51.729
about her son being raped.

00:23:51.762 --> 00:23:53.565
But then the weird thing is,
he talks about

00:23:53.598 --> 00:23:56.568
the Michael Jackson documentary
and he was like, "I don't know.

00:23:56.601 --> 00:23:59.370
I was being groomed--" I wanna
read you the exact quote

00:23:59.403 --> 00:24:03.107
because it's insanely
narcissistic where he just go--

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.642
- He's amazing, man.
- He goes, "Yeah, I don't know."

00:24:04.675 --> 00:24:06.344
- He finds a way to do it.
- He goes, "I don't know.

00:24:06.377 --> 00:24:07.745
"I was just, you know,
I was around his house

00:24:07.778 --> 00:24:09.447
"and he didn't
try anything with me.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.417
I mean, I was young, blonde,
and hot, just his type."

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:15.453
And you're like, what?
- He said "just his type"?

00:24:15.486 --> 00:24:17.388
- Yeah, he goes,
"I was his type."

00:24:17.421 --> 00:24:18.723
- (Christine) He's bummed.
- Well, that's--

00:24:18.756 --> 00:24:20.792
I mean, "just his type"?
- Crazy bummed.

00:24:20.825 --> 00:24:23.394
- "Just his type" is saying
that he did it.

00:24:23.427 --> 00:24:26.197
- Yeah. That's saying like--
oh yeah, no, but he's like--

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:28.733
'cause he says that he won't
speak about it anymore.

00:24:28.766 --> 00:24:30.702
(Christine) He says he won't
defend Michael Jackson anymore.

00:24:30.735 --> 00:24:32.136
He said after hearing
the stories,

00:24:32.169 --> 00:24:34.072
he can no longer
defend Michael Jackson.

00:24:34.105 --> 00:24:35.773
- But now he's gonna say
"I was his type"?

00:24:35.806 --> 00:24:37.642
- That's a weird thing
to say about someone you're--

00:24:37.675 --> 00:24:40.478
- "Guy never fucked me and
I was right in his wheelhouse.

00:24:40.511 --> 00:24:43.181
Young, fine-ass booty.
- (Christine) Dan?

00:24:43.214 --> 00:24:45.650
- What? Oh, "I watch--"
He's talking about

00:24:45.683 --> 00:24:47.519
"Leaving Neverland"-- "I watched
it with my wife and son.

00:24:47.552 --> 00:24:49.487
"It caused me to have concerns.
It's the standard grooming

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.224
process that they deserve."
- Describe. "They deserve?"

00:24:53.257 --> 00:24:54.592
Don't go on record
saying that, buddy.

00:24:54.625 --> 00:24:56.594
- Sorry. (chuckles)
"Everything was similar

00:24:56.627 --> 00:24:59.097
"to what happened to me
up until the sexual part.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:00.999
"Everything.
He bought me gifts,

00:25:01.032 --> 00:25:03.368 line:0%
"a watch and a TV,
a gold watch from Disneyland.

00:25:03.401 --> 00:25:05.270 line:0%
"So was he grooming me
and I just never ended up

00:25:05.303 --> 00:25:07.205 line:0%
"being his pick, or is that
just who he was?

00:25:07.238 --> 00:25:09.107
"That's the fucking thing,
we'll never know.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:11.142
"But I would've been
exactly his type.

00:25:11.175 --> 00:25:13.611
I was cute, short,
and blonde, you know?"

00:25:13.644 --> 00:25:15.246
- He really considers
himself a 9.

00:25:15.279 --> 00:25:17.215
- Yeah, oh--
- A 9?

00:25:17.248 --> 00:25:19.250
- Trying to circle it back
to when I walked in.

00:25:19.283 --> 00:25:21.686
- He doesn't, he considers
himself a flat-out 10.

00:25:21.719 --> 00:25:24.322
He thinks he's the shit.
- I think 10 is too low for him.

00:25:24.355 --> 00:25:26.491
I think he's-- he's
the secretive 11.

00:25:26.524 --> 00:25:29.460
- Yeah, he is. Da--
I still love the fuckin' line

00:25:29.493 --> 00:25:31.162
where we're watching
Corey and the Angels

00:25:31.195 --> 00:25:32.730
and Dave just leans over
and he goes,

00:25:32.763 --> 00:25:35.133
"If one of the girls
gets kicked out of the band,

00:25:35.166 --> 00:25:37.335
are they out of heaven?"
- (laughter)

00:25:37.368 --> 00:25:39.103
- "Do they get
kicked out of heaven?"

00:25:39.136 --> 00:25:41.205
- Take a notice,
you are out.

00:25:41.238 --> 00:25:44.509
- But it's the craziest thing
that this guy...

00:25:44.542 --> 00:25:46.210
the whole thing started off
with "I'm gonna tell the truth

00:25:46.243 --> 00:25:47.745
"about what happened to me
and Corey Haim.

00:25:47.778 --> 00:25:51.516
We were both raped a ton."
Then he made that movie

00:25:51.549 --> 00:25:54.552
where he shows him getting
his dick sucked sorta once

00:25:54.585 --> 00:25:56.788
and Corey Haim gets
raped constantly.

00:25:56.821 --> 00:26:01.492
And now when he starts
this song, it says--

00:26:01.525 --> 00:26:04.028
The song we were play--
- ♪ He told me not to tell ♪

00:26:04.061 --> 00:26:06.364
♪ That's all I did ♪♪
- ♪ He told me a secret ♪

00:26:06.397 --> 00:26:09.100
♪ The secret I knew
I could never tell ♪♪

00:26:09.133 --> 00:26:10.568
So it's like, now it's
just becoming that

00:26:10.601 --> 00:26:13.071
only Corey Haim was--
it's bizarre.

00:26:13.104 --> 00:26:14.472
Like, I'm-- like,
I'm only keeping your secret.

00:26:14.505 --> 00:26:16.207
There's no--
I don't have anything.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.744
- Wait till you see
"The Bonfire" Lifetime movie.

00:26:19.777 --> 00:26:21.646
- Oh, it's gonna be dark.
- It's gonna be me

00:26:21.679 --> 00:26:23.448
saving the entire staff from

00:26:23.481 --> 00:26:26.484
your torturous
raping and drugging.

00:26:26.517 --> 00:26:28.486
- Wow, that would be
out of character.

00:26:28.519 --> 00:26:31.656
- Is it? It's my story to tell.
- Agree, that would be a--

00:26:31.689 --> 00:26:33.791
that would be very out of--
- When you turn on Jeff Ross,

00:26:33.824 --> 00:26:35.593
Dave Attell, what will that
Lifetime movie be?

00:26:35.626 --> 00:26:37.295
- I was gonna say,
this is, like,

00:26:37.328 --> 00:26:39.797
the ultimate segment
to give out some free passes.

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:41.799
- Everybody, you can catch
hilarity like this

00:26:41.832 --> 00:26:43.801
on Sunday night
at Caroline's.

00:26:43.834 --> 00:26:46.738
- No, I-- you know what I think?
Is this Corey--

00:26:46.771 --> 00:26:48.673
has he ever come in here?
Because I think he would

00:26:48.706 --> 00:26:50.575
be a good addition to the show.
- He would never.

00:26:50.608 --> 00:26:52.276
- I would love it
but he won't do it.

00:26:52.309 --> 00:26:54.379
He blocked us. He blocked us
on all social media.

00:26:54.412 --> 00:26:57.181
- But he's just a...
- I'd like to hear his...

00:26:57.214 --> 00:26:59.183
- He's barkin'--
- He's a musician and an act--

00:26:59.216 --> 00:27:01.019
- He had everybody's ear
for a minute, and no o--

00:27:01.052 --> 00:27:03.154
and he just lost
everybody again.

00:27:03.187 --> 00:27:05.156
- I don't know what to say.
- 'Cause he's gonna

00:27:05.189 --> 00:27:06.991
roll it out the way he wants.

00:27:07.024 --> 00:27:09.027
He's like, "I'm just gonna say
the names of these people,

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.195
I need money
to make a documentary."

00:27:11.228 --> 00:27:12.664
That was his thing.
- Yeah, I get it.

00:27:12.697 --> 00:27:15.166
- (laughter)
- He's a Hollywood kid, though.

00:27:15.199 --> 00:27:16.668
- He doesn't know anything else.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

00:27:16.701 --> 00:27:18.403
Yeah, it's the only game
he knows and that's why he j--

00:27:18.436 --> 00:27:20.038
- That's all he knows.
- He just keeps going back in.

00:27:20.071 --> 00:27:21.606
- Like me, you know,
I know shoes.

00:27:21.639 --> 00:27:23.574
I was a shoe salesman.
That's all I know.

00:27:23.607 --> 00:27:25.243
- I know, what everyone
talks abou--

00:27:25.276 --> 00:27:27.245
they call you Sole Man.
- Sole Man, yeah. (laughter)

00:27:27.278 --> 00:27:29.047
- Did you sell shoes?
- "Did you want these i--

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.648
"I'm ready to get
another box,

00:27:30.681 --> 00:27:32.350
"I'll go downstairs
and find a better shoe.

00:27:32.383 --> 00:27:34.185
I'll do that for you."
- I've walked through

00:27:34.218 --> 00:27:36.320
Union Square with Dave Attell
and they go, "There's Sole Man."

00:27:36.353 --> 00:27:37.655
- (laughter)
- He goes,

00:27:37.688 --> 00:27:39.390
"I worked at the Payless
it was on 15th an--"

00:27:39.423 --> 00:27:41.492
- "That's why the Toe Bro
and I are gonna hook up."

00:27:41.525 --> 00:27:44.028
- Toe Bro.
That should be your thing.

00:27:44.061 --> 00:27:45.363
- You know that guy,
the Toe Bro?

00:27:45.396 --> 00:27:47.365 line:0%
- No.
- Oh, m-- he's like,

00:27:47.398 --> 00:27:49.534 line:0%
the Detective Gomez of toes,
this guy.

00:27:49.567 --> 00:27:51.302 line:0%
- Go for it.
- If you got a hangnail

00:27:51.335 --> 00:27:52.670 line:0%
or anything wrong
with your foot,

00:27:52.703 --> 00:27:54.238 line:0%
he like, goes at it
and like fixes it up.

00:27:54.271 --> 00:27:55.807 line:0%
- What, does he come to you?
- No, no, no.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.408
People go on the show
and they're all like,

00:27:57.441 --> 00:27:59.343
"I'm a dancer--"
- Toe Bro.

00:27:59.376 --> 00:28:00.545
- And like, "I thought
I was gonna have to give up

00:28:00.578 --> 00:28:01.679
dancing because of
my horrible feet."

00:28:01.712 --> 00:28:03.614
- Oh, it's a TV show?
- Yeah.

00:28:03.647 --> 00:28:05.216
- I watch
"Dr. Pimple Popper",

00:28:05.249 --> 00:28:06.751
and there's a new one
someone told me about

00:28:06.784 --> 00:28:09.387
where it's like
urban skincare thing?

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.090
And it's just a woman
popping blackheads

00:28:12.123 --> 00:28:15.359
on black women's labias.
- What? (laughter)

00:28:15.392 --> 00:28:18.062
- I said it's a--
- Oh, here it is.

00:28:18.095 --> 00:28:19.764
"The life-changing Toe Bro".

00:28:19.797 --> 00:28:23.101 line:0%
- That's always the best part,
the reveal. Oh my--

00:28:23.134 --> 00:28:24.635 line:0%
- Oh, they show the feet?
Oh, so do you think

00:28:24.668 --> 00:28:27.004
people with foot fetishes
watch this and just like,

00:28:27.037 --> 00:28:28.506
stay half hard?
- I guess so, yeah.

00:28:28.539 --> 00:28:30.441
- You think they edge right
until they see the feet?

00:28:30.474 --> 00:28:32.176
- Absolutely, yes.
- Feet are very-- ugh.

00:28:32.209 --> 00:28:34.045
- "Are you gonna make me pop?
You gonna make me pop

00:28:34.078 --> 00:28:35.613
with your toesies?"
- You guys don't jerk off

00:28:35.646 --> 00:28:37.448
to the, uh,
childbirth videos

00:28:37.481 --> 00:28:39.016
'cause you're still
seeing a vagina?

00:28:39.049 --> 00:28:41.385
- (laughter)
- Oh, then I don't either.

00:28:41.418 --> 00:28:44.021
- I like him just helping out
hillbillies. He goes,

00:28:44.054 --> 00:28:46.357
"Toes, shit, I got
like three of them."

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:48.760
- That is really--
- I wanna go visit a Toe Bro.

00:28:48.793 --> 00:28:50.795
- No, me too, I wanna let
Toe Bro go nuts.

00:28:50.828 --> 00:28:53.030
I got an ingrown toenail.
- Do they fix, Dave,

00:28:53.063 --> 00:28:56.067
as the connoisseur of the show,

whatever the problem is,
but he always also lik--

00:29:00.037 --> 00:29:02.240

- What's going on w--

00:29:02.273 --> 00:29:04.075
small-- you mean
that little pinky?

00:29:04.108 --> 00:29:05.576
- The pinky toe, I got the one
where it's like,

00:29:05.609 --> 00:29:08.279
it's curled up sorta.
- A little piggy.

00:29:08.312 --> 00:29:11.349
- You got hammer-- hammer toes?
- No, not hammer toes.

00:29:11.382 --> 00:29:13.651

00:29:27.364 --> 00:29:29.767

12 cameramen on the show.

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.136

- I can't believe that's

00:29:42.413 --> 00:29:44.215
the only death on "Cops"--
- It's disgusting.

00:29:44.248 --> 00:29:45.650

I was watching it on the road,

00:29:45.683 --> 00:29:47.485
I was like, "Whoa!"

00:29:47.518 --> 00:29:49.720

00:29:49.753 --> 00:29:51.656

pulled out a fuckin'--

- Really?

00:30:01.599 --> 00:30:03.668
- It was-- it looked
like a breast implant.

00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:06.103
- Did the person go like this?
- I guess so, yeah.

00:30:06.136 --> 00:30:08.206
It was-- but I mean,
it was this big,

00:30:08.239 --> 00:30:09.640
and they pulled it out
of their shoulder.

00:30:09.673 --> 00:30:11.209
- Was there a lot of relief
out of the person?

00:30:11.242 --> 00:30:13.578
I'd be like, "Ooh..."
- Go to their Instagram.

00:30:13.611 --> 00:30:16.113
- (smacking lips)
- That's what I saw.

00:30:16.146 --> 00:30:17.548
Dude, this thing comes o--
I can't believe it,

I can't believe the things
people let grow

00:30:21.719 --> 00:30:23.454
in their bodies that long.
- Does it look satisf--

00:30:23.487 --> 00:30:25.256
I like that you just sai--
- No, it doesn't look satisfy--

00:30:25.289 --> 00:30:27.325
it looks like they took out
like, her deltoid muscle.

00:30:27.358 --> 00:30:29.160
- But it's funny 'cause
you said that they--

00:30:29.193 --> 00:30:31.329
these people let this grow
inside of them.

00:30:31.362 --> 00:30:32.697
- Yeah.
- But I don't think

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:34.465
they "let them", it just
does grow inside them.

00:30:34.498 --> 00:30:36.634
- No, man.
- You can get that reality T--

00:30:36.667 --> 00:30:38.836
I wonder what the insurance
is on these shows.

00:30:38.869 --> 00:30:40.605
- Most of these things
can be handled.

00:30:40.638 --> 00:30:41.839
- "All right, here's
your, um, AFTRA money.

00:30:41.872 --> 00:30:43.541
But you owe us,
with the co-pay--"

00:30:43.574 --> 00:30:45.109

00:30:52.316 --> 00:30:54.852
"You had more than
three lines."

00:30:54.885 --> 00:30:57.722
- Lipoma. That sounds like
a great name, like a fake name.

00:30:57.755 --> 00:31:00.224
- Lipoma? That's
a good rapper name.

00:31:00.257 --> 00:31:02.226
- Lipoma.
- "Who's gonna be there?"

00:31:02.259 --> 00:31:03.461
"Well, you know, Lipoma."
- Yeah, that was it, that's it.

00:31:03.494 --> 00:31:05.196
It's not a deltoid muscle.

00:31:05.229 --> 00:31:08.165
This is fucking crazy.
- I'm in.

00:31:08.198 --> 00:31:11.102

00:31:11.135 --> 00:31:12.703
What could possibly
be wrong with that?

00:31:12.736 --> 00:31:15.139
- That's so cool,
her bicep is up there.

00:31:15.172 --> 00:31:16.374
- She's like giving directions
with her-- with her arm.

00:31:16.407 --> 00:31:18.476

This is nuts.

00:31:20.477 --> 00:31:22.246
It looks like a Nerf ball comes
out of her shoulder.

00:31:22.279 --> 00:31:24.181

take some of the meat out of it.

I probably should've went to
an emergency room for

in my life, for sure.
- You've done a lot of

field home surgery?

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.628
cut things
off my body for sure.

00:32:44.661 --> 00:32:47.631

- Um...

00:32:47.664 --> 00:32:50.301
like a skin tag?
In my life, yeah.

00:32:50.334 --> 00:32:51.635

- Have you ever done

00:32:51.668 --> 00:32:54.205
your own stitches?
- No.

00:32:54.238 --> 00:32:55.539

00:32:55.572 --> 00:32:57.108
- Didn't you see
"Rambo First Blood"?

00:32:57.141 --> 00:32:58.476

- As a kid going,

00:32:58.509 --> 00:32:59.643
"Let's do our own stitches."

00:32:59.676 --> 00:33:01.045
My mom did that
for me one time

00:33:01.078 --> 00:33:02.546
'cause I cut my knee,
and she goes,

00:33:02.579 --> 00:33:05.116
"I'm not w-- I'm sick of
running to the emergency room

00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:07.118

and she just like did it.

00:33:07.151 --> 00:33:09.353
- For real?
- Like we were frontier people.

00:33:09.386 --> 00:33:11.088
- With fishing line?
- Yeah, she's like,

00:33:11.121 --> 00:33:12.490
"Here's an ice cream"
and she was like--

00:33:12.523 --> 00:33:14.325
no, with like
a needle and thread.

00:33:14.358 --> 00:33:17.294
- Jesus. When she took it out,
did it hurt like a motherfucker?

00:33:17.327 --> 00:33:19.463
- No, actually, you know,
it was one of those things--

00:33:19.496 --> 00:33:21.399
it's the worst scar,
but it was still like one of

00:33:21.432 --> 00:33:23.768
those things where like that's
what everybody used to do.

00:33:23.801 --> 00:33:27.171

- The stapling now

00:33:27.204 --> 00:33:29.407

even do thread anymore.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.675

and watch you guys wipe "negro"
off everything in that studio

00:35:15.212 --> 00:35:17.548
and you think that makes him
feel good about himself?

00:35:17.581 --> 00:35:19.717
It makes me
uncomfortable as shit.

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:22.019
- (Christine) Great description.
- It takes everything in Jacob

00:35:22.052 --> 00:35:24.688
not to Formula 409
Black Lou himself.

00:35:24.721 --> 00:35:27.391
- He's tried, he's spritzed--
- I've seen him try before.

00:35:27.424 --> 00:35:29.059
- I got right in the way.
I said,

00:35:29.092 --> 00:35:30.561
"Jacob, that is not okay."
- And we go, "Jacob--"

00:35:30.594 --> 00:35:32.263
- And when you put--
- "Jacob, it doesn't come off.

00:35:32.296 --> 00:35:34.198
Jacob, it doesn't come off."
- "Jacob, stop it!"

00:35:34.231 --> 00:35:35.466
- "Jacob, it doesn't come off.
You're gonna hurt his eyes."

00:35:35.499 --> 00:35:36.767
- "Jacob, your mother
is ignorant

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.435
and she taught you that."
- (laughter)

00:35:38.468 --> 00:35:39.803
- "Jacob, your mother
is very ignorant--"

00:35:39.836 --> 00:35:42.173
- "You come
from Florida rubes."

00:35:42.206 --> 00:35:45.176
- "Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised
if her carnival people--"

00:35:45.209 --> 00:35:47.645
- (laughter)
- "You do not do that."

00:35:47.678 --> 00:35:49.647
- "Your father who built
a Tilt-A-Whirl taught you wrong.

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.815
It doesn't come off."

00:35:51.848 --> 00:35:53.617
It's not
winter jacket-cold today.

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:55.319
- That's too much.
- Come on, that's a lot.

00:35:55.352 --> 00:35:58.222
Come on, Eskimo lady.

00:35:58.255 --> 00:36:00.057
- Corey, you don't know
what an Eskimo jacket looks like

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:02.359
cause you followed
the completely wrong person.

00:36:02.392 --> 00:36:04.228
The only person you
didn't film right there

00:36:04.261 --> 00:36:05.763
was the one person
with the Eskimo jacket,

00:36:05.796 --> 00:36:07.998
- Corey, you just blew my trust
in you for winter coats.

00:36:08.031 --> 00:36:10.067
- (laughter) Yeah.
- And I was gonna say,

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:11.735
fall clothing--
- Corey, do me a favor,

00:36:11.768 --> 00:36:13.437
I'll give you back the money,
can you buy me a winter coat?

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:15.306
Man, a real winter coat.
- When people ask me about Cor--

00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:16.674
- He's gonna give me
an umbrella and boots.

00:36:16.707 --> 00:36:18.576
- I go, "Lights-out
fall clothing.

00:36:18.609 --> 00:36:22.046
"Winter? Now I'm suspect.
Now I'm very suspect.

00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:24.281
"Jay gave a clear instruction
of a coat

00:36:24.314 --> 00:36:26.250
and you went
the wrong direction."

00:36:26.283 --> 00:36:27.785
- But did you see how fast
he whipped, though?

00:36:27.818 --> 00:36:29.486
That was good camerawork.
- Yeah, it was just smo--

00:36:29.519 --> 00:36:31.455
that was-- look at that.
- Oh, dude.

00:36:31.488 --> 00:36:33.591
- I bet someone just puked.
- You'd be a great--

00:36:33.624 --> 00:36:36.260
you'd be good on "Cheaters".
- (mock retching)

00:36:36.293 --> 00:36:39.163
Yeah, you ever thought
about doing like,

00:36:39.196 --> 00:36:41.031
side work on "Cheaters"?

00:36:41.064 --> 00:36:42.533
- Corey, would you
wanna do "Cops"

00:36:42.566 --> 00:36:44.702
and like chase perps
with the camera?

00:36:44.735 --> 00:36:47.438
Hoppin' fences and shit?
- Right? You'd wanna do that?

00:36:47.471 --> 00:36:50.507
- Hell yeah. That's gotta be
the cameraman's dream.

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.209
- Oh yeah, the camera's--
- "Cops".

00:36:52.242 --> 00:36:54.578
- You think "Cops"
is their NFL?

00:36:54.611 --> 00:36:56.413
- Yeah, that's the pros.
- "This season of 'Cops',

00:36:56.446 --> 00:36:58.249
in the second-round
cameraman draft..."

00:36:58.282 --> 00:37:00.484
- You see the camera guy
get shot on "Cops".

00:37:00.517 --> 00:37:02.052
Camera guy got shot,
you saw that?

00:37:02.085 --> 00:37:03.654
Of course, yeah,
probably came out in

00:37:03.687 --> 00:37:06.423
the cameraperson newsletter.
- Yeah, I was gonna say,

00:37:06.456 --> 00:37:09.059
I go, "Lynn and Corey, would you
be okay with us watching this?

00:37:09.092 --> 00:37:11.729
Or th-- as a cameraperson,
are you gonna be triggered?"

00:37:11.762 --> 00:37:13.397
- As a cameraperson, is it
gonna wig you out?

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:15.099
(Corey) No, I knew the guy
that got killed.

00:37:15.132 --> 00:37:16.600
- You don't mean that.
- (Corey) No, I'm serious.

00:37:16.633 --> 00:37:18.669
- Really? The camera guy
community's that small

00:37:18.702 --> 00:37:21.338
that you knew a Wichita
fuckin' camera guy at "Cops"?

00:37:21.371 --> 00:37:23.474
- I went to college with him.
- For what?

00:37:23.507 --> 00:37:25.242
- Camera college?
- "Cops" ca-- camera college?

00:37:25.275 --> 00:37:27.411
(laughter)

00:37:27.444 --> 00:37:29.413
- He goes, "Man, we were
in 'Cops' Camera 101 together.

00:37:29.446 --> 00:37:32.016
Freshman year."
- He goes, "We did

00:37:32.049 --> 00:37:35.419
microphotography and..."
- Yeah.

00:37:35.452 --> 00:37:40.090
- "And filmology"?
- He goes, "I had nature, uh,

00:37:40.123 --> 00:37:42.793
closeness, I had--"
- "'Cops', I minored in 'Cops'.

00:37:42.826 --> 00:37:45.696
- "I minored in 'Cops'."
- You knew him from college?

00:37:45.729 --> 00:37:48.666
Was he voted most likely to take
a fuckin' L filming something?

00:37:48.699 --> 00:37:51.135
- (laughter)
- You know the problem?

00:37:51.168 --> 00:37:52.636
You're a pussy, Corey.
You don't get involved

00:37:52.669 --> 00:37:54.405
in any dangerous-- you want
me and Dan to start

00:37:54.438 --> 00:37:55.806
playing Russian Roulette
in the studio,

00:37:55.839 --> 00:37:57.508
aiming at you and Lynn?
- We'll go nuts.

00:37:57.541 --> 00:37:59.343
You don't think I won't
Molotov cocktail?

00:37:59.376 --> 00:38:04.114
- Click. "Oh, must be
Lynn's lucky day."

00:38:04.147 --> 00:38:05.549
(makes cylinder clicking sound)

00:38:05.582 --> 00:38:07.318
- "Guys, we're gonna take
our first break

00:38:07.351 --> 00:38:08.652
and when we come back..."
(makes cylinder clicking sound)

00:38:08.685 --> 00:38:10.087
"Corey might not be here!"

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.588
- "Corey's turn".

00:38:11.621 --> 00:38:14.591
You see the camerawork's
like very...

00:38:14.624 --> 00:38:18.028
- I go, "Focus, focus,
focus, focus."

00:38:18.061 --> 00:38:20.297
- Dude, you got five chances,
nothing to this thing.

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:22.166
Click.
- Yeah. Ha-ha!

00:38:22.199 --> 00:38:24.068
- Click. Click. Click.
I'm crazy!

00:38:24.101 --> 00:38:26.103
- "Lou!" Lou just
puts his mouth on it

00:38:26.136 --> 00:38:28.372
like a sippy straw.
- (muffled) "What--

00:38:28.405 --> 00:38:30.240
what're we doing?"
- Oh, man.

00:38:30.273 --> 00:38:31.608
- "What're we doing?
Do me the favor."

00:38:31.641 --> 00:38:33.310
- He goes...
(muffled)

00:38:33.343 --> 00:38:34.578
"Put m-- take me to
the final commercial break."

00:38:34.611 --> 00:38:37.147
(laughter)

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:40.050
- We go, "Sign off.
Sign off."

00:38:40.083 --> 00:38:42.186
- "Time to go set up
live reads in the sky."

00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:43.387
(laughter)

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.756
