When a woman has to find a shirt
for her special guy,

00:00:04.403 --> 00:00:07.607
what will it take for him
to say "Fine" to the shirt?

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.342
If you love
"Say Yes to the Dress,"

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:11.944
you'll understand the concept

Amy and her fiancé Brian are
shopping for a replacement shirt

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:21.554
after he left his main shirt
at an airport.

00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:23.222 align:start position:0%
Just pick something,
let's go.

Nice to meet you "Rah."

00:00:33.432 --> 00:00:34.534
No, he's saying "Brian."

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:36.269 align:start size:75% position:25%
Brian, Brian.
Nice to meet you, Brian.

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:38.171 align:start position:0%
Jeez, I just
said it 14 times.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:39.639 line:85%
He's so cute.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:39.639 align:start size:78% position:22%
Didn't catch that either.

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:43.242 align:start size:72% position:28%
So you're our man and
let's find you a shirt!

00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:45.945
(Amy)
Brian and I have been together
for five years,

00:00:45.978 --> 00:00:48.815
and engaged
for four-and-a-half years.

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:52.752
Brian is... my soul mate.

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:55.388
We met and we both knew
right away,

00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:57.590
so I asked him to marry me,
and he said,

00:00:57.623 --> 00:01:00.226
and I'll never forget it,
he said,

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:04.464
"Fine, I guess."

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:07.266 align:start size:63% position:38%
So, guys, what's our
price range today?

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.203 align:start size:75% position:25%
Um, I would say anything
between $50, up to--

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:13.039 align:start size:69% position:31%
If it's like, amazing,
like, 12,000? Um...

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:14.574 align:start size:75% position:25%
I don't know,
what do you think, babe?

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:16.476 align:end position:100%
Like, what are you
comfortable with?

(muttering indistinctly)

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:20.413 align:start size:47% position:53%
Okay, great.
Are we thinking

00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:23.216 align:start size:69% position:31%
sexy, classic sleeves?

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:25.218 align:start size:59% position:41%
Maybe some buttons?

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.019 align:start size:44% position:56% line:85%
Oh! Buttons!

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.019 align:start size:16% position:84%
Yeah?

00:01:27.052 --> 00:01:28.421 align:start size:69% position:31% line:85%
Did you say buttons?

00:01:27.052 --> 00:01:28.421 align:start size:44% position:56%
Yeah, buttons.

00:01:28.454 --> 00:01:29.856 align:start size:66% position:34% line:85%
Did you hear her?

00:01:28.454 --> 00:01:29.856 align:start size:25% position:75%
Buttons?

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:30.990 align:start size:66% position:34% line:85%
Are you listening?

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:30.990 align:start size:19% position:81%
Brian?

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:32.258 align:start size:72% position:28% line:85%
Are you even listening?

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:32.258 align:start size:81% position:19%
What?

00:01:32.291 --> 00:01:34.393 align:start position:0%
Why am I here?
I have another shirt.

00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:36.896 align:start position:0%
I don't need "another"
another shirt.

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.433 align:start size:66% position:34%
Okay, Brian, when
you were a little boy

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:42.602 align:start size:84% position:16%
and every night,
you dreamed about clothing,

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:43.769 align:start size:38% position:63%
what shirt
did you see?

00:01:43.802 --> 00:01:44.703 align:start position:0%
That never happened.

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.172 align:start position:0%
I didn't dream about
stupid stuff like that.

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:48.608 align:start position:0%
Seriously, though,
I gotta piss.

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:51.110 align:start position:0%
Is this fine?

00:01:51.143 --> 00:01:52.178 align:start size:28% position:72%
Yeah.

00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:53.846 align:start position:0%
Is this fine?

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:55.381 align:start size:28% position:72%
Fine.

00:01:55.414 --> 00:01:58.351 size:81% position:41%
Well, it seems like Brian
will wear almost anything,

00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:00.086 align:start position:0%
so it's really gonna
take all my skills

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.089 align:start position:0%
to make this prince
feel like a princess.

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:05.791 align:start position:0%
Oh!
Oh, my God!

00:02:05.824 --> 00:02:07.293 align:start position:0%
What do you think?

00:02:07.326 --> 00:02:10.997 align:start position:0%
Brian has not seen Josh
and Beaver since college,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.666 align:start position:0%
so I hired a private detective
to track them down.

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:15.968 align:start position:0%
It cost me $20,000,

00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:18.704 align:start position:0%
but it is so
gonna be worth it

00:02:18.737 --> 00:02:21.774 align:start position:0%
to see the look on Brian's
face when he sees them.

00:02:21.807 --> 00:02:23.276 align:start size:38% position:63%
Open.

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:24.977 align:start size:78% position:22%
I got your two
best friends from college

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.480 align:start size:50% position:50%
to come to share
in our joy.

00:02:27.513 --> 00:02:28.781 align:start size:56% position:44%
Yo, what up?

00:02:28.814 --> 00:02:30.316 align:start position:0% line:0%
Hey, man.
You hear T.J. died?

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:31.817 align:start size:41% position:59% line:0%
Oh, for real?

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.119 size:75% position:38%
What's up, Beav?

00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:34.854 align:start size:25% position:75%
Yo.

00:02:34.887 --> 00:02:38.524 align:start size:44% position:56%
(whispering)
Magical.

00:02:38.557 --> 00:02:39.759 align:start size:31% position:69%
(Travis)
Hey, gang!

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:41.494 align:start position:0%
So Brian, this is
a Tommy Bahama.

00:02:41.527 --> 00:02:45.731 align:start position:0%
Okay, so it is blue,
it has buttons.

00:02:45.764 --> 00:02:47.200 align:start size:66% position:34%
What do you think?

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:48.568 align:start size:88% position:13% line:85%
Whatever.

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:48.568 align:start position:0%
Fantastic.

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:50.603 align:start position:0%
Let's try it on.
Come on.

00:02:50.636 --> 00:02:53.105 line:85%
(sighing)

00:02:50.636 --> 00:02:53.105 align:start size:94% position:6%
Come on, come on.

00:02:53.138 --> 00:02:57.043
(whispering)
Buttons.

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:59.078
(announcer)
It's time
for the big reveal.

00:02:59.111 --> 00:03:00.980
Brian has just tried on
the shirt.

00:03:01.013 --> 00:03:03.983
Will it be fine or will it be
back to the rack for Travis?

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:09.822 align:start position:0%
Okay, let's see
our prince!

00:03:09.855 --> 00:03:11.657 align:start size:50% position:50%
(gasping)

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.326 align:start size:50% position:50%
He looks amaze.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.195 align:start position:0%
Friends, thoughts?

00:03:16.228 --> 00:03:18.097 align:start size:66% position:34%
Pretty cool.
Doesn't look too gay.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.633 align:start position:0%
Okay, and you, Brian,
what do you think?

00:03:20.666 --> 00:03:22.401 align:start position:0%
Is it everything
you were hoping for?

00:03:22.434 --> 00:03:24.570 align:start size:38% position:63%
I guess.

00:03:24.603 --> 00:03:25.938 align:start position:0%
(Travis)
You know what?

00:03:25.971 --> 00:03:27.506 align:start position:0%
I think we need
to jack him up.

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:29.141 align:start size:38% position:63% line:92%
What?

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:29.141 align:start position:0%
Stand over there.

00:03:29.174 --> 00:03:30.243 align:start size:47% position:53%
Do it.

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:31.210 size:78% position:39%
What?

00:03:31.243 --> 00:03:32.578 align:start size:38% position:63%
Let him jack
you up, guy!

00:03:32.611 --> 00:03:35.648 align:start position:0%
Just trust me,
just trust me.

00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:37.250 align:start position:0% line:85%
Now, look.

00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:37.250 align:start size:69% position:31%
I don't wanna look.

00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:44.890 align:start position:0%
Look in the mirror.

00:03:44.923 --> 00:03:47.393 align:start position:0%
Yes! This is
my new main shirt.

00:03:47.426 --> 00:03:52.031 align:start position:0%
Brian, are you saying
"fine" to the shirt?

00:03:52.064 --> 00:03:54.500 align:start size:19% position:81%
Fine.
Oh!

00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:57.870 align:start size:69% position:31%
Fine, yes!
A thousand times fine!

00:03:57.903 --> 00:04:00.139 align:start position:0%
(Brian)
I love it!

00:04:00.172 --> 00:04:02.541
This has been such
a hard year for me.

00:04:02.574 --> 00:04:04.510
I just never felt
that good about myself

00:04:04.543 --> 00:04:06.879
and then I just looked at myself
in the mirror

00:04:06.912 --> 00:04:09.115
and I'm like...
I felt like a butterfly.

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:10.816 align:start position:0%
You know, at the end
of the day,

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.453 align:start position:0%
my real job is
to make dreams come true.

00:04:14.486 --> 00:04:15.788 align:start position:0%
Also, I'm a cashier
