00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:09.243
IN THIS NICE APARTMENT
THAT HER PARENTS ARE PAYING FOR.

00:00:09.276 --> 00:00:11.612
SO THEY'RE SITTING AT HOME,

00:00:11.645 --> 00:00:15.582
AND SHE'S READING
IN HER BATHROBE WITH HER FIANCE.

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:20.254
AND THEN THERE'S, LIKE,
A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.

00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:23.590
[dog barking]
NO. CUTIE, IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

00:00:23.624 --> 00:00:25.559
IT'S FAKE.

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:26.927
THEY DIDN'T HAVE DOGS.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.363
QUIET!
QUIET, QUIET, QUIET!

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:30.697
SHE OPENS THE DOOR.

00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:32.199
LIKE, OH, CAN WE HELP YOU?

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:34.067
OH, WE RAN OUT OF GAS MONEY.
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:36.103
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
THEY ALL CAME POURING IN.

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:37.437
AND THEY'RE LIKE, AHH!

00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:38.672
AND THEY BEAT UP
THE MATH TEACHER,

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.642
STRANGLE HER,
AND TAKE HER CAPTIVE.

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:46.213
BRING HER IN A VAN
OVER TO THEIR HEADQUARTERS.

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:48.048
SHE'S BLINDFOLDED.
SHE'S GAGGED.

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:51.118
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S GAGGED.
SHE'S DEFINITELY BLINDFOLDED.

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:55.656
THEY PUT HER IN THIS CLOSET.
IT'S LIKE THE SIZE OF A CLOSET.

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:58.325 line:0%
 
AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING, REALLY.

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:03.063 line:0%
 
SO IT'S 57 DAYS
SHE'S IN THIS ROOM.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.898 line:0%
 
SO FINALLY, ONE DAY,

00:01:04.932 --> 00:01:07.134
THEY LET HER GET OUT
OF THE CLOSET,

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:10.204
AND THEY TAKE OFF
HER BLINDFOLD.

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:13.807
AND SHE LOOKS OUT
AND SHE SEES ALL THE PEOPLE.

00:01:13.841 --> 00:01:15.876
SHE'S LIKE, OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.744
OH, WHO ARE THESE PEO--

00:01:17.778 --> 00:01:19.580
LIKE, YOU GUYS LIKE--
YOU'RE MY MOMMY.

00:01:19.613 --> 00:01:23.417
THIS IS ESSENTIALLY
WHAT STOCKHOLM SYNDROME IS.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.787
THAT WAS THE SYMBIONESE
LIBERATION ARMY.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.490
"SYMBIONESE" IS NOT A WORD.

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:32.659
IT'S--THEY KINDA MADE IT UP.

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:35.095
THEY'RE NOT THE BRIGHTEST PEOPLE
IN THE WORLD.

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:38.098
NOW YOUR NAME'S TANIA.

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:39.900
AND THIS IS YOUR NEW LIFE.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.769
AND SHE'S LIKE...

00:01:42.803 --> 00:01:44.638
OKAY.

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:46.573
[upbeat rock]

00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:48.108
AND THEN THEY DO
A PHOTO SHOOT,

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:51.445
AND SHE PUT THE BERET ON
AND A MACHINE GUN,

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:54.648
AND SHE'S, LIKE,
ALL WITH THE S.L.A.

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:57.451
SO SHE STARTED RECORDING
THESE AUDIO TAPES

00:01:57.484 --> 00:01:58.886
AND SENDING THEM
TO HER PARENTS.

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:02.356
MOM, DAD, I'M OKAY.

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:05.559
BUT I NEED YOU TO FEED
EVERY POOR PERSON.

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:07.728
THAT ENDS UP BEING
LIKE 300,000.

00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:10.063
$300 MILLION.

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:12.399
THEY'RE ALREADY STUPID.
LIKE, THEY COULD NOT COUNT.

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:14.635 line:0%
 
AND THE HEARSTS ARE LIKE,
WE DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH MONEY.

00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:16.870 line:0%
 
WE'LL GIVE YOU $3 MILLION.

00:02:16.904 --> 00:02:16.970 line:0%
 
WHATEVER, DUDE.
