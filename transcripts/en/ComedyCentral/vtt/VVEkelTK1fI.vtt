- You drop the case
against my client,

00:00:05.938 --> 00:00:09.675
and in return,
I, Ari Shaffir, Esquire,

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:13.246
will agree to be
the Holy Spirit's lawyer.

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:15.915
And the Holy Spirit was like,
"Yeah, man, I'm in."

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:17.450
[laughter]

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.351
And that's how I started
my law firm.

Welcome to
"This Is Not Happening."

00:00:58.057 --> 00:00:59.625
I'm your host, Ari Shaffir,

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:02.228
and today all the stories
are about karma.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:04.329

 [cheers and applause]</i>

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:12.071
- So, you guys, I'm going to do
a story about karma.

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:13.773
This is when I first discovered
what karma is,

00:01:13.773 --> 00:01:16.442
'cause everyone uses
the word "karma," you know?

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:18.311
Any time, like, something bad
happens to you,

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:19.578
if someone laughs at you,

00:01:19.578 --> 00:01:21.414
any time something bad
happens to them,

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:24.016
you're like, "Yes.
It's worked out in my favor.

00:01:24.016 --> 00:01:25.752
Thank you, karma."

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.987
But I never really understood it
until this moment.

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:30.089
I was just starting
stand-up comedy.

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:31.424
It was, like, two years in.

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:33.325
I--okay, before I start,
I should tell you this.

00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:35.261
I don't know how--how many Jews
are in here right now?

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:37.129
[scattered cheers]
Okay, a few.

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:39.265
Jews never get excited.
They just kind of--

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:42.535
You were like,
"Uh, I don't know.

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:44.837
This is how it starts.
No, thanks."

00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:46.005
[laughter]

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:47.440
"You're not gonna trick me."

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.108
What if that's how
the Holocaust started:

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:50.543
with, like, "Any Jews in here?"

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:51.677
Like, "Yeah!"

00:01:51.677 --> 00:01:53.679
Be like, "Get him.
Get him. Get her."

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.482
[laughter]

00:01:56.482 --> 00:01:58.150
And then one Jew
is in the bathroom.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.518
Guy be like, "What did I miss?"

00:01:59.518 --> 00:02:01.454
Like, "Shut up.
You didn't miss anything.

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:05.391
Just fucking trust me.
Shut up."

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:08.394
So I am a lot of people's
Jewish friend,

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:10.796
and what that means is,
they call me

00:02:10.796 --> 00:02:13.199
when they have any questions
about Jews.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.967
Like, I'll get phone calls
from my friends.

00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:16.202
They're like, "Hey, Ari,

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:18.070
why are they walking around
today?"

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.806
[laughter]

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:21.140
"It's Wednesday.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.975
"I thought they only walk around
on Saturday.

00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:24.544
What's the deal?"

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:26.980
And you got to be like,
"Oh, it's National Hut Day"

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.682
or "Sukkos" or whatever
you guys want to call it.

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:31.517
But--you know,
or they'll be like,

00:02:31.517 --> 00:02:33.252
"What does C-h-c-h spell?"

00:02:33.252 --> 00:02:35.488
I'm like, "You're not gonna be
able to pronounce it."

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:37.022
They're like,
"Is it chuh-chuh?"

00:02:37.022 --> 00:02:39.024
I'm like, "No, it's not.
It's not choo-choo.

00:02:39.024 --> 00:02:40.159
It's...
[guttural sounds]

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.427
And they're like, "Yeah,

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:42.995
I wouldn't have gotten that
at all."

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:44.363
[laughter]

00:02:44.363 --> 00:02:47.599
So I got this phone call
one night from my friend

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.402
who's, like, a bigger comedian
at the time.

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:50.836
I was just starting.

00:02:50.836 --> 00:02:52.838
He was, like, a well-known,
kind of a rich guy

00:02:52.838 --> 00:02:54.373
who was, like, really famous.

00:02:54.373 --> 00:02:56.175
And it doesn't matter who it is,
but, like,

00:02:56.175 --> 00:02:57.877
he called me one night,
and he goes, "Ari!"

00:02:57.877 --> 00:02:59.211
And I was like, "Yes?"

00:02:59.211 --> 00:03:00.780
And he goes, "I need you
to be my lawyer!"

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.415
And I'm like, "This is
the most racist phone call

00:03:03.415 --> 00:03:05.517
"I've ever gotten in my life.

00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:09.689
We don't all just know
how to do that."

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.790
And he was like,
"I know, asshole.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.859
I was--I just--
okay, here's what happened."

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.361
He was videotaping some guy.

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:16.795
It was the early days
of video cameras, you know,

00:03:16.795 --> 00:03:18.264
when you had to, like,
have a lot of money

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:19.298
to afford one.

00:03:19.298 --> 00:03:20.767
He had a ton of cash.

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:22.902
He did mixed martial arts
commentary on the side.

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:25.404
And...
[laughter]

00:03:25.404 --> 00:03:29.776
And so he had money from that.

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:31.911
But then, um...

00:03:31.911 --> 00:03:34.780
But then he was videotaping
some crazy person.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.716
I was like, "What?
What are you talking about?"

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:38.284
He was like, "Listen,
I was videotaping some guy."

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:39.985
And then right then,
I got call waiting.

00:03:39.985 --> 00:03:41.888
And I was like, "Wait, I'm
getting call waiting right now."

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.422
And he just goes,
"You're my lawyer!"

00:03:43.422 --> 00:03:44.490
And then he hangs up.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.158
And I was like, "All right.

00:03:46.158 --> 00:03:49.228
Let's see what this
call waiting's all about."

00:03:49.228 --> 00:03:51.931
And I picked up the phone,
and this guy on the other end

00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:53.900
was like, "Hello,
my name is Michael [bleep],

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.303
and are you Joe Rogan's--
or whoever, his lawyer?"

00:03:57.303 --> 00:03:58.938
[laughter]

00:03:58.938 --> 00:04:00.740
Uh...
[laughs]

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.742
[applause]

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:05.511
And I was like,
"Um, yes, I am.

00:04:05.511 --> 00:04:06.945
That's right.
Esquire."

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:09.082
And, uh...
[laughter]

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:12.251
And he goes, "Okay, well,
he was videotaping me.

00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:13.585
I want him to delete
the footage."

00:04:13.585 --> 00:04:15.121
And he told me
to contact his lawyer.

00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:16.655
And I was like, "Okay,
here we go."

00:04:16.655 --> 00:04:18.591
It's my first case,
and I wanted to win it.

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:21.360
[laughter]

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.665
Also, this guy thought
that he was the Holy Spirit.

00:04:26.665 --> 00:04:28.267
He goes, "I'm the Holy Spirit,

00:04:28.267 --> 00:04:29.669
and I'm looking to sue
this guy."

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.437
And I was like,
"All right, well,

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:32.838
I ought to negotiate."

00:04:32.838 --> 00:04:35.541
And I was able to use
one thing that I knew

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:37.009
that he did not know,
and I was like,

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:38.644
"Well, I'll use that
to my advantage."

00:04:38.644 --> 00:04:42.114
And that was that he was not
the Holy Spirit.

00:04:42.114 --> 00:04:43.449
[laughter]

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.519
That is not a real thing.

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:49.955
Even if it was a real thing,
it wasn't this dude.

00:04:49.955 --> 00:04:53.559
Anyway, so I was able
to talk to him.

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:55.128
I talked to him,
and I got to a truce,

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:57.363
and the way I was able
to negotiate a truce was,

00:04:57.363 --> 00:04:58.630
I told him,
"Hey, how about this?

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.300
"You drop the case
against my client,

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.037
"and in return,
I, Ari Shaffir, Esquire,

00:05:05.037 --> 00:05:08.173 size:88% position:56%
"will agree to be
the Holy Spirit's lawyer

00:05:08.173 --> 00:05:11.477
in any cases he might have."

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:15.748
And the Holy Spirit was like,
"Yeah, man, I'm in."

00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:17.717
And that's how I started
my law firm.

00:05:17.717 --> 00:05:18.851
[laughter]

00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:21.520
And he had so many cases,
you guys.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.989
He wanted to sue
so many people.

00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:26.259
He couldn't pay me.
He was like, "I can't pay you."

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:27.993
I'm like, "Yeah, I know.
Obviously.

00:05:27.993 --> 00:05:30.529
"Like, that's not
what this is all about.

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:31.763
"It's not a money-making scheme.

00:05:31.763 --> 00:05:33.398
"It's just to entertain myself.

00:05:33.398 --> 00:05:35.868
I'm an open-mic comic,
and I'm bored."

00:05:35.868 --> 00:05:37.836
He goes, "I'll tell you what,
though.

00:05:37.836 --> 00:05:40.005
I can't pay you,
but in lieu of payment..."

00:05:40.005 --> 00:05:42.408
And I was like, "Hmm? All right.
What are you gonna say?"

00:05:42.408 --> 00:05:45.744
And he goes, "When I become
King of Kings..."

00:05:45.744 --> 00:05:48.581
I was like, "Hold on.
Hold on. Let me...

00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:50.215
"Okay, go ahead.
I'm ready now.

00:05:50.215 --> 00:05:51.850
Hit me with the rest of that."

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.019
He goes, "When I become
King of Kings,

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:55.420
"I will reward you

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.224
by letting you rule
over all of Jerusalem."

00:05:58.224 --> 00:06:00.560
I'm like, "Dude, I've never
wanted to rule over anywhere

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.395
"as badly in my life

00:06:02.395 --> 00:06:04.196
"as I want to rule
over Jerusalem right now.

00:06:04.196 --> 00:06:06.699
"I didn't even know I wanted it
until right now.

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:09.401
"And I'll rule them all--
the Jews, the Palestinians.

00:06:09.401 --> 00:06:12.872
They'll all bow before me!"

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:14.407
The power's already gone
to my head.

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:15.975
Maybe I should wait.

00:06:15.975 --> 00:06:19.245
Anyway, and I talked to him,
like, every day for weeks.

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:20.546
Like, this went on.

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:22.481
He wanted to sue
so many people, you guys.

00:06:22.481 --> 00:06:24.650
He wanted to sue John Edwards.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.618
Remember the psychic?

00:06:26.618 --> 00:06:30.790
John--he wanted to sue him
for being a false prophet.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:31.890
For money.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.059
He wanted money
for that guy being a--

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:36.995
and I was like, "Why would you
get the money for that?

00:06:36.995 --> 00:06:38.731
"Like, let's say
he is a false prophet.

00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:41.066
Like, why do you cash in?"

00:06:41.066 --> 00:06:43.602
And he was like,
"'Cause I'm a real prophet,

00:06:43.602 --> 00:06:46.738
and he's--it's hurting
my business."

00:06:46.738 --> 00:06:48.007
And I was like, "You know what?

00:06:48.007 --> 00:06:49.842
"That works as a tactic.
Absolutely.

00:06:49.842 --> 00:06:52.577
We'll put in libel
or something."

00:06:52.577 --> 00:06:53.679
God, he wanted to sue people.

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:54.914
I talked to him so much,

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:56.582
and the weeks turned
into months.

00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:59.118
Like, I talked to him sometimes
multiple times a day.

00:06:59.118 --> 00:07:02.288
Probably 12, 13 times a week,
I talked to him.

00:07:02.288 --> 00:07:04.356
Keep in mind
I talk to my parents

00:07:04.356 --> 00:07:07.426
once every two weeks.

00:07:07.426 --> 00:07:10.128
And I talked to the Holy Spirit
26 times

00:07:10.128 --> 00:07:13.598
every time I talked
in between my parents.

00:07:13.598 --> 00:07:14.933
God, he wanted to sue people.

00:07:14.933 --> 00:07:16.836
He always used big words
around me too.

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:18.604
Like, he would talk to me,
and he was like--

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:20.106
when he wanted to sue
a new person,

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:23.709
he was like, "Henceforth,
when I, um, shall take

00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:25.210
the plaintiff into"--

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.113
And I'm like, "Dude,
I'm the fake lawyer,

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:28.614
"not you, you know?

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:30.349
"You don't have to use
big words.

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:31.717
That's on me."

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.389
God, he wanted to sue p--
he wanted sue--

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:37.790
I got him to give me
power of attorney

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.125
over all his affairs too.

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:40.960
[crowd exclaims]

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.128
Yeah, I was like, "Dude,

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:44.129
I need you to say the words
out loud."

00:07:44.129 --> 00:07:45.997
I told him, "I'm recording it,"
and I--

00:07:45.997 --> 00:07:47.800
it was all on, like,
those cassette tapes.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.868
I threw them out eventually.
I wish I had those things.

00:07:49.868 --> 00:07:51.838
But I was like, "I need you
to say the words."

00:07:51.838 --> 00:07:53.005
He goes, "Okay.

00:07:53.005 --> 00:07:56.808
He goes, "I, Michael [bleep],
the Holy Spirit,

00:07:56.808 --> 00:07:59.645
hereby give Ari Shaffir
power of attorney"--

00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:01.080
I'm like, "Ah-ah!"

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.649
He goes, "Hereby give
Ari Shaffir, Esquire,

00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:07.586
power of attorney
over all my affairs."

00:08:07.586 --> 00:08:10.322
And I was like,
"You did the right thing."

00:08:10.322 --> 00:08:13.592
He wanted to sue so--and
the months turned into years.

00:08:13.592 --> 00:08:16.996
Like, this went on for, like,
four years plus.

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:19.264
He wanted to sue
to the San Diego State Hospital

00:08:19.264 --> 00:08:23.035
for something to do
with electroshock therapy.

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:25.271
He probably had a case
on that one, to be honest.

00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:26.906
[laughter]

00:08:26.906 --> 00:08:29.775
Probably should have contacted
a real lawyer on that last one.

00:08:29.775 --> 00:08:31.910
The false prophet, he wasn't
gonna go anywhere with,

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:36.448
but the electroshock,
he had a legit case.

00:08:36.448 --> 00:08:38.884
And after a while,
I got bored of it.

00:08:38.884 --> 00:08:40.586
But I told him--
like, at some point,

00:08:40.586 --> 00:08:42.387
I was like, "I can't be
your lawyer anymore."

00:08:42.387 --> 00:08:44.022
And he was not happy about it.

00:08:44.022 --> 00:08:45.257
He was like, "Why?

00:08:45.257 --> 00:08:47.059
What about all the cases
we're so close on?"

00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:49.128
I'm like, "Well,
you'd be surprised.

00:08:49.128 --> 00:08:52.564
"We're not really that close
on a lot of those cases.

00:08:52.564 --> 00:08:55.367
"The law is a slow-moving beast.

00:08:55.367 --> 00:08:59.071
"That's what we say
around the water cooler...

00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:01.207
over at the law firm
I work at."

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:02.808
And he was mad.

00:09:02.808 --> 00:09:04.476
He was like, "Well, if you're
not gonna be my lawyer,

00:09:04.476 --> 00:09:06.045
I'm not gonna pay you."

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:07.412
And I'm like, "Well,
"this is all pro bono work.

00:09:07.412 --> 00:09:08.714
You weren't paying me anyway."

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:10.282
He was like, "I promised you
to be king

00:09:10.282 --> 00:09:11.617
over all of Jerusalem."

00:09:11.617 --> 00:09:12.918
I was like, "I know,
and I'm sorry

00:09:12.918 --> 00:09:15.720
"that that's gonna go away,
but...

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.623
I'm gonna have to accept that
in my life."

00:09:17.623 --> 00:09:19.058
And he kept calling.

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:20.725
Eventually, I stopped
taking his phone calls,

00:09:20.725 --> 00:09:23.562
and the phone calls stopped
after a while,

00:09:23.562 --> 00:09:24.763
and then it was over.

00:09:24.763 --> 00:09:26.465
And then, like,
three months after that,

00:09:26.465 --> 00:09:27.799
I got a letter in the mail,

00:09:27.799 --> 00:09:29.668
and it was from
the Better Business Bureau.

00:09:29.668 --> 00:09:33.438
[laughter]

00:09:33.438 --> 00:09:37.576
Yeah, they threatened
to shut me down.

00:09:37.576 --> 00:09:42.080
My firm that I built
from the ground up!

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.951
Not in my America!

00:09:48.487 --> 00:09:49.955
So I fought it...

00:09:49.955 --> 00:09:51.357
[laughter]

00:09:51.357 --> 00:09:52.925
The only way I knew how
to fight

00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:54.926
against a letter from
the Better Business Bureau:

00:09:54.926 --> 00:09:57.096
by not replying to the letter.

00:09:57.096 --> 00:09:59.197
I was--I was legit scared
for a while

00:09:59.197 --> 00:10:02.935
until I realized that
I don't have a law firm, so...

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:04.703
I'm just some guy
in an apartment building.

00:10:04.703 --> 00:10:07.472
You can't do anything to me.

00:10:07.472 --> 00:10:08.707
And then the letters
went away,

00:10:08.707 --> 00:10:10.108
and I was off scot-free

00:10:10.108 --> 00:10:12.044
until one day I get
a knock at my door,

00:10:12.044 --> 00:10:14.212
and it was some guy
in a suit outside.

00:10:14.212 --> 00:10:16.549
And when I see a guy in a suit
at my door,

00:10:16.549 --> 00:10:19.117
which has never happened,
my first thought, obviously:

00:10:19.117 --> 00:10:20.552
lottery.

00:10:20.552 --> 00:10:22.220
[laughter]

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.856
And I was like,
"How much did I win?"

00:10:23.856 --> 00:10:24.956
He was like, "What?"

00:10:24.956 --> 00:10:26.558
I'm like, "How much did I win?"

00:10:26.558 --> 00:10:29.128
He was like, "Are--what's--
are you Ari Shaffir?"

00:10:29.128 --> 00:10:29.961
And I go, "Yes."

00:10:29.961 --> 00:10:31.296
And he handed me an envelope,

00:10:31.296 --> 00:10:33.465
and he goes,
"You've been served."

00:10:33.465 --> 00:10:37.236
And I was like, "I've been
served lottery winnings?"

00:10:37.236 --> 00:10:39.805
He was like, "No,
you're being sued."

00:10:39.805 --> 00:10:42.307
And I was like,
"Who's suing me?"

00:10:42.307 --> 00:10:45.344
It was the Holy Spirit.

00:10:45.344 --> 00:10:47.045
The Holy Spirit went to a court

00:10:47.045 --> 00:10:49.648
and figured out
how to sue somebody,

00:10:49.648 --> 00:10:51.650
and he sued me.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:52.985
He sued me!

00:10:52.985 --> 00:10:55.153
Guess how much
he sued me for.

00:10:55.153 --> 00:10:56.322 align:start size:25% position:75%
- 2,400!

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:57.556
- $2,400.

00:10:57.556 --> 00:10:59.725
What an exact amount
you suggested.

00:10:59.725 --> 00:11:01.393
No, you didn't get it.

00:11:01.393 --> 00:11:03.829
$2,400, that'd be
a lot of money. No.

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:06.498
He sued me for $800 million.

00:11:06.498 --> 00:11:07.532
[laughter]

00:11:07.532 --> 00:11:11.003
Yeah, $800 million

00:11:11.003 --> 00:11:14.606
was how much he sued me for.

00:11:14.606 --> 00:11:16.341
So here's the deal, you guys.

00:11:16.341 --> 00:11:19.178
I don't know if you know how
the American legal system works.

00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:22.881
But if somebody sues you,
you have to reply,

00:11:22.881 --> 00:11:25.583
or you just lose the case.

00:11:25.583 --> 00:11:30.022
And I don't have $800 million.

00:11:30.022 --> 00:11:32.458
I don't have
any million dollars.

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:35.293
But I don't know how to reply
to a lawsuit.

00:11:35.293 --> 00:11:37.963
You'd think with all those years
of training,

00:11:37.963 --> 00:11:40.198
I would have picked up
something,

00:11:40.198 --> 00:11:42.701
but no, I did not.

00:11:42.701 --> 00:11:46.305
So I had to find a lawyer.

00:11:46.305 --> 00:11:50.809
I had to get a lawyer
to help represent me.

00:11:50.809 --> 00:11:52.444
So I call Rogan,
and I was like,

00:11:52.444 --> 00:11:55.447
"Remember the Holy Spirit?"

00:11:55.447 --> 00:11:58.150
And he was like, "No."

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.818
And I'm like,
"You don't remember him?"

00:11:59.818 --> 00:12:01.620
He's like, "No.
What are you talking about?"

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:02.988
"Remember, like,
a long time ago,

00:12:02.988 --> 00:12:05.056
"you called me one night
and you said

00:12:05.056 --> 00:12:06.892
"you needed me to be your lawyer

00:12:06.892 --> 00:12:09.561
because you were videotaping
some guy?"

00:12:09.561 --> 00:12:12.664
And he was like, "Sort of.

00:12:12.664 --> 00:12:14.633
I barely remember that."

00:12:14.633 --> 00:12:17.068
And I was like, "Okay, well,

00:12:17.068 --> 00:12:19.772
I've been representing him
for the last half decade."

00:12:19.772 --> 00:12:22.908
[laughter]

00:12:26.411 --> 00:12:28.080
"And he's suing me now."

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.282
And he's like, "What?
Why did you do that?"

00:12:30.282 --> 00:12:32.517
I'm like, "A better question is,
did I win your case?

00:12:32.517 --> 00:12:35.254
And the answer is yes."

00:12:38.523 --> 00:12:41.493
So I had to find another lawyer,
and I had to hire her,

00:12:41.493 --> 00:12:44.663
and she got it thrown out.

00:12:44.663 --> 00:12:46.765
And the way she got it
thrown out was,

00:12:46.765 --> 00:12:50.102
one, it was written
in Magic Marker,

00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:52.337
which is not the standard
ink type for a lawsuit.

00:12:52.337 --> 00:12:56.108
And then she showed
the judge that,

00:12:56.108 --> 00:12:58.977
and she showed the judge
that the original amount,

00:12:58.977 --> 00:13:02.113
what he wanted to sue me for,
was not $800 million.

00:13:02.113 --> 00:13:05.818
The original amount was
"all the riches in the world."

00:13:05.818 --> 00:13:09.121
[laughter]

00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:12.858
He legit wanted to sue me
for all the riches in the world.

00:13:12.858 --> 00:13:15.394
And the court clerk
had to be like,

00:13:15.394 --> 00:13:17.395
"That's not an amount.

00:13:17.395 --> 00:13:20.299
You can't get all the riches
in the world."

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:22.567
And they were like,
"What does that mean to you?"

00:13:22.567 --> 00:13:23.868
He's like, "Oh, 800 million."

00:13:23.868 --> 00:13:29.341
So she got it thrown out
with--with...

00:13:29.341 --> 00:13:30.309
prejudice, thank you.

00:13:30.309 --> 00:13:32.010
That sounds like
a real lawyer.

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:34.079
You'd think I would have fucking
remembered that one.

00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:35.647
Yeah, which prejudice,
which means

00:13:35.647 --> 00:13:37.149
he can't ever sue me again.

00:13:37.149 --> 00:13:39.818
"Also, do you want
to countersue him," she said,

00:13:39.818 --> 00:13:41.420
"For damages
for putting you through this?"

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.988
And I was like,
"What do you mean?"

00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:44.422
She goes, "That's what karma is,
you know?

00:13:44.422 --> 00:13:46.158
"He can't, like,
put you through this.

00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:47.592
Now he's gonna have to go
through his own thing."

00:13:47.592 --> 00:13:49.828
And I was like, "Oh, no,
karma's already...."

00:13:49.828 --> 00:13:51.730
[laughter]

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:54.500
Like, I've never seen it
as clearly

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.168
as I have right now.

00:13:56.168 --> 00:13:57.836
But, like, it's done.

00:13:57.836 --> 00:14:01.240
It already came and went back
to where it was supposed to.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.874
All right, that's my story,
everybody.

00:14:02.874 --> 00:14:04.576
Thank you very much, you guys.

00:14:04.576 --> 00:14:12.518
