- [Dan] Yeah.

00:00:04.696 --> 00:00:05.529
- Anytime I'm at a coffee
place, they're like

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:07.412
"what's your name?" I just go nope.

00:00:07.412 --> 00:00:08.245
- [Dan] Yeah.
(laughing)

00:00:08.245 --> 00:00:09.837

00:00:09.837 --> 00:00:10.670
(rock music)

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.728
(fire crackling)

00:00:13.728 --> 00:00:15.533
- Do you get worried
that your son's 19 and

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.737
just out there now? As you know like...

00:00:17.737 --> 00:00:18.710
- No, not really.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.560
I'd like to think that I

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.520
Well, I don't know if
I instill great values.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.353
- [Dan] Yeah.

00:00:25.353 --> 00:00:26.463
- You know, good enough.

00:00:26.463 --> 00:00:28.212
- Okay so you putting him out there like

00:00:28.212 --> 00:00:30.393
Jay's daughter is gonna be 16 in October.

00:00:30.393 --> 00:00:31.773
- Okay I have a daughter that's 14.

00:00:31.773 --> 00:00:33.074
- Nutty. Huh? You have
a daughter that's 14?

00:00:33.074 --> 00:00:34.743
- My daughter's gonna be
a freshmen this year yeah.

00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:35.660
- Is that terrifying?

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.205
Was that, I mean cause.

00:00:37.205 --> 00:00:38.301
- In every step of it.

00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:39.695
- It's terrifying a little because

00:00:39.695 --> 00:00:41.935
I talk about, and she said
it was okay to do, but I

00:00:41.935 --> 00:00:44.581
talk about her first period
she had at my house in my act.

00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:45.681
- [Dan] Yeah.

00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:47.250
Oh man you don't think about that.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.607
If you're the daughter of a comedian

00:00:48.607 --> 00:00:50.378
and you're like, uh man, with Isabella.

00:00:50.378 --> 00:00:51.682
- [Chad] Yeah. I asked.

00:00:51.682 --> 00:00:53.233
- And your daughter.

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:54.975
- I said here's what I like to say

00:00:54.975 --> 00:00:56.652
and I told her everything
that I was going to say.

00:00:56.652 --> 00:00:58.620
But grown men will come
up to me after shows,

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.995
and she goes "Oh, she's a woman now."

00:00:59.995 --> 00:01:01.797
And I'm like, I will fucking murder you.

00:01:01.797 --> 00:01:02.657
(laughs)

00:01:02.657 --> 00:01:04.697
No she's not, she's a
little girl, so back it up.

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:08.290
♪ Girl, you'll be a woman soon. ♪

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.327
- Cause I noticed you talked
about your little girl

00:01:10.327 --> 00:01:11.731
becoming a woman. And you're like,

00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:13.521
"I'll rip you God damn throat out."

00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:15.931
Who's at a comedy club
like, "I enjoyed that act,

00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:18.042
let me go talk to him about
his daughter's period."

00:01:18.042 --> 00:01:19.890
- Several people, you'd be surprised.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.149
- And how old is this little princess, 14?

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.638
Countdown starts.

00:01:24.638 --> 00:01:25.471
- [Dan] There he goes.

00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:26.712
- Nice to meet you Mr. Daniels.

00:01:26.712 --> 00:01:29.127
- Anyways, good show.

00:01:29.127 --> 00:01:31.030
Is this the new lady of the lake?

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.382
(laughs)

00:01:32.382 --> 00:01:34.438
He goes, "good jokes."

00:01:34.438 --> 00:01:36.210
- A mature woman in Tijuana.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.043
(laughs)

00:01:37.043 --> 00:01:41.045
- He goes, "You know in certain
kingdoms, you'd be a queen."

00:01:41.045 --> 00:01:42.408
Anyways, good jokes. I'll see ya later.

00:01:42.408 --> 00:01:44.342
(laughs)

00:01:44.342 --> 00:01:46.000
- My palms are sweating right now

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.899
just thinking about this shit.

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.467
- Ah dude, yeah! If someone
without kids, like Jay and I...

00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:52.800
- Soft features.

00:01:53.862 --> 00:01:55.276
Anyway man, love the closures.

00:01:55.276 --> 00:01:57.009
(laughs)

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.612
- Been a fan for quite some time.

00:01:58.612 --> 00:02:00.342
(laughs)

00:02:00.342 --> 00:02:01.360
- I follow all of your work.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.231
- He goes, "Ay ay ay, good stock. Anyways.

00:02:05.231 --> 00:02:06.064
Yeah, I really enjoyed...

00:02:06.064 --> 00:02:07.304
- I remember listening to stories

00:02:07.304 --> 00:02:09.015
about her when she was three.

00:02:09.015 --> 00:02:10.391
(laughter)

00:02:10.391 --> 00:02:13.236
- You know, I thought she
aged nice in your act,

00:02:13.236 --> 00:02:14.805
turns out better in person.

00:02:14.805 --> 00:02:17.002
- Well look who's filling out.

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:20.169
Anyway, can you make it out to Steven.

00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:23.205
- Seriously, I got every
one you put out there.

00:02:23.205 --> 00:02:24.229
- This is for my friend:

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:26.534
To Steve, you're a fag for not coming.

00:02:26.534 --> 00:02:27.867
Check, you write that please.

00:02:27.867 --> 00:02:30.214
Guys, he's asks you to write
something like volatile.

00:02:30.214 --> 00:02:31.047
I don't know
- Yeah.

00:02:31.047 --> 00:02:31.880
- I'm gonna stab you in the throat,

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.369
I don't want to put that down.

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:34.643
(Chad laughs)

00:02:34.643 --> 00:02:35.754
- I pray for your death.

00:02:35.754 --> 00:02:38.083
I hope your mother never
recovers from her surgeries.

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:39.810
- Yeah! Hey dude, I
understand that you're fan,

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.516
you came out, I can't
write 'death to America,

00:02:41.516 --> 00:02:43.223
praise Allah', I just feel like that's...

00:02:43.223 --> 00:02:44.929
- My girlfriend couldn't
make the show man,

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:46.813
but if you could write like,
"If you would've been here,

00:02:46.813 --> 00:02:48.380
I'd try to fuck you, that'd be great".

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.213
- Yeah, uh..

00:02:49.213 --> 00:02:50.183
- Yeah, I'm gonna put my name on that.

00:02:50.183 --> 00:02:51.124
(laughter)

00:02:51.124 --> 00:02:54.641
- Or the Shanghai, you're
making a video with me right now

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:56.318
for this asshole who couldn't come.

00:02:56.318 --> 00:03:00.431
- Aw dude, no his kid just
got hit by a car, hold on.

00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:01.807
Steve!

00:03:01.807 --> 00:03:03.460
Look what you're missing!

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.267
Your son's bones are weak!

00:03:05.267 --> 00:03:07.349
Aw, awesome dudes, thanks, man.

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:08.182
- My friend couldn't make it, man.

00:03:08.182 --> 00:03:09.508
He's being shipped home from Iraq.

00:03:09.508 --> 00:03:10.586
He's legless.

00:03:10.586 --> 00:03:11.586
Hey, Thomas!

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:13.592
- [Dan] Wish you could run to the club!

00:03:13.592 --> 00:03:14.824
- Look who I'm with!

00:03:14.824 --> 00:03:16.969
- Dude, this would've put
you in such a better mood.

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:18.504
- Yeah, aw man, no, yeah,

00:03:18.504 --> 00:03:20.368
my friend just found out his
wife just completely fucked

00:03:20.368 --> 00:03:23.148
him over like financially,
emotionally, and spiritually.

00:03:23.148 --> 00:03:23.981
Hold on real quick.

00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:24.898
Hey, Boner!

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.347
- Yeah, what's up, Dick-nuts,
look who I'm sittin' with!

00:03:28.347 --> 00:03:30.572
- [Dan] I'm 'bout to do a shot
with your favorite comedian,

00:03:30.572 --> 00:03:31.405
Fuck-face!

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.253
Yeah, he's crying.

00:03:33.253 --> 00:03:34.086
Like, we're on suicide watch.

00:03:34.086 --> 00:03:37.308
All of us have to call
him, to check in his house.

00:03:37.308 --> 00:03:39.740
So you called me last
night while I was watching

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.036
Hard Knocks, which is great this season.

00:03:42.036 --> 00:03:43.593
Really enjoying it.

00:03:43.593 --> 00:03:46.229
But, (mumbles) about Jay just the same way

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:47.812
they called me out for
looking like I'm dressing

00:03:47.812 --> 00:03:50.486
for a Rock N' Jock bit softball game.

00:03:50.486 --> 00:03:51.619
When you called me, I go, yeah dude

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:52.933
I'm watching Hard Knocks.

00:03:52.933 --> 00:03:54.785
And you go, "what are you
watching? Some wide receiver

00:03:54.785 --> 00:03:56.508
"taking his baby mamma out to dinner?"

00:03:56.508 --> 00:03:58.000
I'm like, oh no.
(laughing)

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.583
I go, "no I'm watching the
fourth ring quarterback

00:03:59.583 --> 00:04:02.378
take his stripper girlfriend
to some fuckin' bug place.

00:04:02.378 --> 00:04:04.780
And you go, exactly.
- [Jay] Exactly.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.824
But he called me because
you were like, dude,

00:04:06.824 --> 00:04:09.086
did you know that Ariana
Grande, or as I call her,

00:04:09.086 --> 00:04:10.612
airy-anna-gran-dee.

00:04:10.612 --> 00:04:11.973
- You'd been watching Total Divas,

00:04:11.973 --> 00:04:12.854
is what you were watching?

00:04:12.854 --> 00:04:13.687
- Yeah, hey shut up.

00:04:13.687 --> 00:04:14.520
- [Jay] I like to follow everyone.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.648
- I was watching SmackDown, dude.

00:04:15.648 --> 00:04:16.688
- I follow everybody.

00:04:16.688 --> 00:04:17.521
- Fight me.

00:04:17.521 --> 00:04:19.564
(laughs)

00:04:19.564 --> 00:04:21.017
But you called me and were like, dude,

00:04:21.017 --> 00:04:22.621
Ariana, which I knew that she had a song

00:04:22.621 --> 00:04:23.489
called Pete Davidson, but.

00:04:23.489 --> 00:04:24.683
- I was late to the game on this.

00:04:24.683 --> 00:04:27.430
- But I knew it was
coming, I just didn't...

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.531
- Isabella told me.

00:04:28.531 --> 00:04:29.364
- She told you about it?

00:04:29.364 --> 00:04:30.197
- Yeah.

00:04:30.197 --> 00:04:31.030
- [Dan] It's called Pete Davidson

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.845
and then you said at the end,

00:04:32.845 --> 00:04:37.183
she says it's only like a
minute forty-five seconds long.

00:04:37.183 --> 00:04:39.515
- I'm sorry, how long are the
songs gettin' written for you?

00:04:39.515 --> 00:04:41.546
- Which, I didn't know she
was gonna do a fuckin' Ramones

00:04:41.546 --> 00:04:43.641
fuckin' punk lines.

completely dope, I guess.

00:07:33.133 --> 00:07:35.781
He talks to me about a
lot of people he fucked,

00:07:35.781 --> 00:07:37.510
uncomfortably sometimes.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.931
- He goes, It's pretty
graphic about the sex.

00:07:39.931 --> 00:07:41.172
Well, I don't know.

00:07:41.172 --> 00:07:42.377
Ariana likes him.

Tao, he lives here also.

He's a spiritual voice.

00:07:47.484 --> 00:07:48.946
- He makes us sushi.

00:07:48.946 --> 00:07:50.356
(laughs)

00:07:50.356 --> 00:07:52.236
- He makes a kind of fish that, like,

00:07:52.236 --> 00:07:53.945
if he cuts it wrong, we die.

00:07:53.945 --> 00:07:55.891
- It's, you're not gonna
like what I'm gonna do,

00:07:55.891 --> 00:07:57.445
but this is the part that
I want to talk about is,

00:07:57.445 --> 00:07:59.685
you called me and you're
like, listen for the end.

00:07:59.685 --> 00:08:01.292
It's only a minute and forty-five seconds.

00:08:01.292 --> 00:08:03.237
Of course they're doing
all that punk shit.

00:08:03.237 --> 00:08:04.420
(laughs)

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.406
- You were like, dude, listen for the end

00:08:05.406 --> 00:08:07.585
because it sounds like
she's saying uppy uppy.

00:08:07.585 --> 00:08:08.768
- I wanna be uppy uppy.

00:08:08.768 --> 00:08:11.248
- I wanna be uppy uppy and
you said you texted him

00:08:11.248 --> 00:08:14.027
and he was like, no, the song.

00:08:14.027 --> 00:08:15.027
- That's not.

00:08:15.027 --> 00:08:15.936
- That's not what it was.

00:08:15.936 --> 00:08:16.769
- I mean, he laughs.

00:08:16.769 --> 00:08:17.602
He enjoyed the uppy uppy, I guess.

00:08:17.602 --> 00:08:20.588
- Here's the thing, when we
sent the clip of the Ariana,

00:08:20.588 --> 00:08:22.501
of me calling her Arry-anny-granny.

00:08:22.501 --> 00:08:23.508
- Airy-anna-grandy.

00:08:23.508 --> 00:08:25.035
- Airy-anna-grandy and he was like, yeah.

00:08:25.035 --> 00:08:27.324
We listened to it and we were laughing,

00:08:27.324 --> 00:08:29.963
and you're like, oh, yeah, hey, what's up.

00:08:29.963 --> 00:08:32.960
(laughing)

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.616

where you go, man, I'm cool.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:38.303
- God damn, that stuff's annoying.

00:08:38.303 --> 00:08:39.694
- [Dan] You guys went over there,

00:08:39.694 --> 00:08:40.718
you guys hung out at the apartment.

00:08:40.718 --> 00:08:41.755
- I felt so old.

00:08:41.755 --> 00:08:42.955
- [Dan] Let's play the part of the song

00:08:42.955 --> 00:08:44.532
where you can hear her go uppy.

00:08:44.532 --> 00:08:45.939
She put out this video?

00:08:45.939 --> 00:08:48.356
- Yeah, no, this is like her.

00:08:49.858 --> 00:08:53.207
- A video of the time
Pete attacked a gay guy.

00:08:53.207 --> 00:08:54.461
- Yeah, it was shocked by 'em.

00:08:54.461 --> 00:08:55.988
- [Jay] Don't touch me, homo.

00:08:55.988 --> 00:08:58.654
- Good for Pete, he got
some shoulders on him.

00:08:58.654 --> 00:08:59.695

00:08:59.695 --> 00:09:02.513

00:09:06.099 --> 00:09:07.743
- She's had it her entire life.

00:09:07.743 --> 00:09:09.719
She doesn't know anything else.

00:09:09.719 --> 00:09:11.722

as a 40-year-old white dude
- What?

00:12:47.729 --> 00:12:49.996
The performance is unbelievable.

00:12:49.996 --> 00:12:52.663
She can all right, man, she's
so talented of a singer.

00:12:52.663 --> 00:12:55.277
All right, turn it off before
Jacob creams his shorts.

00:12:55.277 --> 00:12:57.328
- He goes, "It's happening again.

00:12:57.328 --> 00:12:58.748
"Insides are coming outside."

00:12:58.748 --> 00:13:00.230
- He's like, "oh God, I'm 'bout to poof.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:01.063
"I'm about to poof!"

00:13:01.063 --> 00:13:01.896
(laughing)

00:13:01.896 --> 00:13:03.457
- "Oh no I'm gonna ink!

00:13:03.457 --> 00:13:05.839
"I'm gonna ink right here.

00:13:05.839 --> 00:13:06.716
"I can't"

00:13:06.716 --> 00:13:09.243
- "Oh no, poof's coming!

00:13:09.243 --> 00:13:10.190
"Poof's coming!"

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:12.683
- Yeah, she's insanely talented.

00:13:12.683 --> 00:13:15.253
- She's insanely talented.

00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:18.138
- And she's fuckin' gorgeous.

00:13:18.138 --> 00:13:20.653
- And she's gorgeous
and insanely talented.

00:13:20.653 --> 00:13:22.093
And that's why she's Ariana Grande.

00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:23.632
- [Jay] Hell yeah.

00:13:23.632 --> 00:13:26.199
That's why she's my niece, Ariana Grande.

00:13:26.199 --> 00:13:27.952
- And Pete has to pause Madden.

00:13:27.952 --> 00:13:29.641
It's just weird to know your friend, like,

00:13:29.641 --> 00:13:31.756
Pete's texting me, like,
"we all play Madden."

00:13:31.756 --> 00:13:34.312
- She's like, "Baby, is
this a sexy dance move?"

00:13:34.312 --> 00:13:35.845
- He goes, "it's pretty good baby,

00:13:35.845 --> 00:13:36.900
"you could probably do better.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:37.733
"What's up dudes!"

00:13:37.733 --> 00:13:38.566
(laughing)

00:13:38.566 --> 00:13:41.724
- He goes, "hey Gorgeous,
do you wanna play Madden?"

00:13:41.724 --> 00:13:43.515
- He goes, "I don't know, babe,

00:13:43.515 --> 00:13:45.235
"I mean, I guess you're
not practicing enough,

00:13:45.235 --> 00:13:47.773
"but you'll figure it out
at some point, I mean.

00:13:47.773 --> 00:13:49.411
"Hey, what's up Fart-bitch."

00:13:49.411 --> 00:13:50.887
- "I don't think the lyric

00:13:50.887 --> 00:13:54.118
"'love is a mystic forest' makes sense.

00:13:54.118 --> 00:13:56.712
"I don't know, you hit random three times,

00:13:56.712 --> 00:13:59.575
"and if you do a fourth time
you have to keep the team."

00:13:59.575 --> 00:14:04.575
- "Which just sounds a lot
like (mumbles) lose people."

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:06.563
(heavy metal music)

00:14:06.563 --> 00:14:09.313
(fire crackling)

00:14:10.246 --> 00:14:12.496
(beeping)
