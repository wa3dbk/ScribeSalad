and he's just like, "Hold on.

"I'm getting married

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:54.587
- Hello, everybody.

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:56.122
Welcome to
"This Is Not Happening."

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:57.556
I'm your host Ari Shaffir,

00:00:57.556 --> 00:00:59.659
and today all the stories
are about nostalgia.

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:00.993
[cheers and applause]

00:01:00.993 --> 00:01:02.495
You guys'll absolutely love her.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:04.830
Please give it up for Miss
Annie Lederman, everybody.

[cheers and applause]

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:11.638
- My story is about
my happy place.

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:13.506
You know,
we all have that happy place

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:16.342
that we can go back to
whenever we're in dark times,

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:19.845
that place from our childhood
that just brings us back,

00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:22.314
you know,
makes us feel happy.

00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:25.284
My happy place was Camp Swatara,

00:01:25.284 --> 00:01:28.821
my Quaker camp that I went to
in upstate Pennsylvania.

00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:31.424
And I remember, like,
when my dad and my mom

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:33.426
would put me in the car,
and they'd drive me up.

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:35.761
I remember the butterflies
I'd get when I started to get--

00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:38.865
we'd approach, you know,
the entrance.

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:41.767
And they would drop me off, and
it was just, like, so amazing.

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:43.269
There was just, like,

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:46.873
bonfires and friendship
bracelets and fucking dreams.

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:49.042
Like, I remember
the pizza bagels,

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:51.977
like, every single thing
about it.

00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:55.281
And then there was Mark Parker.
Um...

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:59.486
Oh, he was just, like,
the cutest counselor ever.

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:00.953
He was so hot.

00:02:00.953 --> 00:02:02.521
He had an eyebrow ring.

00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:05.291
He knew, like, every lyric
to every Dave Matthews Band song

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:07.226
that you know he played
on acoustic guitar

00:02:07.226 --> 00:02:10.029
at every fucking bonfire.

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:12.198
And he could fuck up
a hacky sack.

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:16.402
Like, he was just...
he was so hot.

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:19.305
Like, I was, like,
I didn't even know what--

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:20.873
why my underwear was wet.

00:02:20.873 --> 00:02:22.575
I just knew that,
like--

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:24.243
I knew two things
about that underwear,

00:02:24.243 --> 00:02:26.045
that my mom had written
my name in it,

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:27.813
and that it was soaking wet.

00:02:27.813 --> 00:02:29.382
I was, like, Baby Horny.

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:32.251
I was like, "What are you?
I love you, these feelings."

00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:34.920
Ugh, and all the counselors
were so cool,

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.390
and I fucking loved that camp.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.360
Um, camp did not
love me back as much.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.763
I was just completely invisible,
not cool at all.

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:46.532
Like, when you got older,
when you were, like, 13, 14,

00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:48.400
they would start--
the counselors would start

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.603
to wake up the cool girls
at night and, like,

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:53.572
bring them out to smoke weed
and drink.

00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:55.440
And so I would--they would,
like, wake me up.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.876
I'd be like,
"Hello. Yes?"

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:58.878
And they were like,
"Do you mind moving over?

00:02:58.878 --> 00:03:00.712
Sarah's getting down."

00:03:00.712 --> 00:03:03.516
And when you graduate
from the camp at 14,

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.418
you can apply to be
a counselor,

00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:07.620
and all I wanted in my life
was to be a counselor.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.355
I mean, they were, like,
living the dream.

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:11.957
They were just, like,
so awesome.

00:03:11.957 --> 00:03:13.259
And I was, like, I--you know,

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:14.694
I would love to be
a camp counselor

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:18.130
at Camp Swatara,
but I'm not gonna get the job,

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.399
so I never applied,
because I was, like, I--

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:22.101
you know,
I can't handle that rejection.

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:23.936
It'll be too deep,
you know?

00:03:23.936 --> 00:03:28.641
So instead,
I graduated from Camp Swatara,

00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:31.310
and since I couldn't,
you know,

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.579
smoke weed and drink
with the counselors,

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.815
I decided to just, like,
go back to Philadelphia

00:03:36.815 --> 00:03:40.419
and just smoke and drink
with real criminals,

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.588
and I just became, like,
a horrible juvenile delinquent

00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:44.157
and was just stealing cars.

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:46.092
Like, my life just, like...
[whistles]

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:48.427
went completely downhill
from there.

00:03:48.427 --> 00:03:50.496
So I went to some
really dark times

00:03:50.496 --> 00:03:52.999
and really struggled
with alcoholism and drugs

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:54.500
and really got fucked up,

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.803
and I remember a moment
just staring into a mirror just,

00:03:57.803 --> 00:04:00.239
like, "What have you done
with your life?

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.609
You used to be a camper."

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.412
And I wrote in lipstick--
I wrote on the mirror--

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:09.749
I wrote,
"Remember Camp Swatara,"

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.517
and I left it there for,
like, years,

00:04:11.517 --> 00:04:14.320
like, just years and years,
I never cleaned that mirror,

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.855
and I would just look at it
in my dark times,

00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:17.923
and it would bring me back,
and I could really, like,

00:04:17.923 --> 00:04:20.259
close my eyes and remember,
like, the morning bell,

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:21.627
and I could remember, like,

00:04:21.627 --> 00:04:23.529
the pig that they had
at the little farm.

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:26.165
I just remembered
the tire swings and the zip line

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:27.834
and, like,
the lake and everything,

00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:29.168
and Mark Parker.

00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:31.804
I mean,
it was just so incredible.

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:34.974
So then a couple years later,
I quit drinking.

00:04:34.974 --> 00:04:37.543
I moved to New York
to start doing stand-up comedy.

00:04:37.543 --> 00:04:40.479
And I am feeling good
about myself.

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.281
And right then on Facebook,

00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:45.484
I get an invite
to a Camp Swatara reunion,

00:04:45.484 --> 00:04:48.321
and I'm like, "Oh, my God.

00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:51.490
"Here's my time to shine.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.293
"Here's my time to show them
how cool I was.

00:04:54.293 --> 00:04:55.862
"I wasn't invisible.

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:57.463
"I'm Annie Lederman,

00:04:57.463 --> 00:05:01.033
an open mic'er
living in Bushwick."

00:05:01.033 --> 00:05:02.568
[laughter]

00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:04.003
But I'm just, like,
so excited to go,

00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:06.805
and I look at it,
and I'm working the weekend,

00:05:06.805 --> 00:05:08.574
and I can't go
to the fucking reunion,

00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:12.210
and I'm, like, devastated,
and I go out--

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.712
before I go out, though,
I--

00:05:13.712 --> 00:05:15.681
I take the opportunity
when I realize

00:05:15.681 --> 00:05:18.217
that I can't go to the reunion
to just friend request

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:21.987
every counselor I ever had,
just everyone across the board.

00:05:21.987 --> 00:05:23.589
Don't give a fuck
if they accept me.

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:25.925
I'm just throwing it
out there anyway.

00:05:25.925 --> 00:05:30.095
And I go--I go onto the subway
all bummed out,

00:05:30.095 --> 00:05:31.563
and I hear--from behind me,

00:05:31.563 --> 00:05:33.899
I hear someone go,
"Annie Lederman?"

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:37.437
And I turn around, and it's
this guy, Dan McFarland,

00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:39.172
who was one of my
camp counselors,

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:41.707
and I'm like, "Holy shit,"
and he's like, "Oh, my God,"

00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:43.910
and I'm like--first of all,
I'm shocked he remembers.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.777
Like, I can't even believe
that he remembers me.

00:05:45.777 --> 00:05:48.114
I'm, like,
maybe I wasn't invisible.

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:50.582
And he goes,
"Annie, this is so crazy

00:05:50.582 --> 00:05:52.184
"that I'm running into you
right now,

00:05:52.184 --> 00:05:54.953
"because I was just talking
to one of the other counselors.

00:05:54.953 --> 00:05:56.589
"He was talking about
your Facebook.

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:58.590
"He had looked at your Facebook,
and he's, like,

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.125
was talking about how hot
you are."

00:06:00.125 --> 00:06:01.927
And I was like,
"Me? Hot?"

00:06:01.927 --> 00:06:05.531
I was like, "But who--
who was the counselor?"

00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:07.132
And he was like,
"Mark Parker."

00:06:07.132 --> 00:06:09.802
And I was like, "Oh, my God!

00:06:09.802 --> 00:06:11.136
Holy shit!"

00:06:11.136 --> 00:06:13.138
I was like, "I have wanted
to fuck him my whole life.

00:06:13.138 --> 00:06:15.574
"Before I knew what fucking was,
I wanted to fuck this guy.

00:06:15.574 --> 00:06:17.209
"I've measured every guy
against him.

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:18.544
"I'm in love with him.

00:06:18.544 --> 00:06:21.814
"I have loved him every day
since camp.

00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:22.815
"Give him to me.

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:26.252
Where is he?
Put him inside me now."

00:06:26.252 --> 00:06:29.888
And he's like, "Oh, he doesn't
live in New York anymore,"

00:06:29.888 --> 00:06:33.592
and I'm, like, about to cry,
and he's just like, "Hold on.

00:06:33.592 --> 00:06:36.596
"I'm getting married
next weekend in Pennsylvania,

00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:38.163
"and he'll be there.

00:06:38.163 --> 00:06:41.834
Why don't you crash my wedding
and fuck Mark Parker?"

00:06:41.834 --> 00:06:43.435
[laughter]

00:06:43.435 --> 00:06:46.772
And I'm like, "Yes."
- Yeah!

00:06:46.772 --> 00:06:48.974
- I'm like, "Is Jesus real?"

00:06:48.974 --> 00:06:52.011
Like, I'm like,
"What is going on?"

00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:54.246
I'm like--I mean, fate,
fate, fate, fate.

00:06:54.246 --> 00:06:56.983
I'm, like, this is just, like,
gonna be the best experience,"

00:06:56.983 --> 00:06:58.183
so I tell everyone.

00:06:58.183 --> 00:06:59.852
Like, I'm going to bodega guys.

00:06:59.852 --> 00:07:02.021
I'm going on the subway.
I'm stopping homeless men.

00:07:02.021 --> 00:07:04.457
I'm like, "Here's a quarter.
I'm gonna fuck Mark Parker."

00:07:04.457 --> 00:07:06.124
Everyone knows.

00:07:06.124 --> 00:07:08.828
I'm, like, this is gonna be
the best day of my fucking life.

00:07:08.828 --> 00:07:10.863
Not only was it amazing
that this had happened,

00:07:10.863 --> 00:07:13.432
but it's also, like,
I was wrong about who I was.

00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:15.434
Like, if I had applied
to be a counselor,

00:07:15.434 --> 00:07:16.802
like,
I might have gotten it.

00:07:16.802 --> 00:07:19.838
Like, I may have missed
my fucking opportunity

00:07:19.838 --> 00:07:22.041
to live
this fucking incredible life,

00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:24.710
because how would he know--
like, he wouldn't--

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.379
losers don't get stopped
on the fucking subway.

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:30.649
Invisible people don't have
Mark Parker saying they're hot.

00:07:30.649 --> 00:07:34.020
Like, so I go
on his Facebook page,

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.988
and I write, like,
"You're a CILF,"

00:07:35.988 --> 00:07:37.956
and then in parenthesis
in case he doesn't get it,

00:07:37.956 --> 00:07:39.692
I'm like,
"A counselor I'd like to fuck,"

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:41.560
and then I'm like,
"That's not enough,"

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.897
so then I go on his--
into his messages,

00:07:44.897 --> 00:07:50.503
and I'm like,
"Hey, Mark, let's fuuuuuuck."

00:07:50.503 --> 00:07:52.971
And he writes back,
like, "Cool.

00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:54.306
"Yes, absolutely.

00:07:54.306 --> 00:07:56.075
I'm down."

00:07:56.075 --> 00:07:58.910
Um, so I pack my fuck bag.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.580
It's just a suitcase
filled with underwear,

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.916
obviously no condoms,
'cause I can party,

00:08:03.916 --> 00:08:06.085
and then I, like, you know,
I pull my little suitcase,

00:08:06.085 --> 00:08:07.820
and I go in, and I'm just,
like, I mean,

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.655
I can't even, like,
describe to you how I felt.

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:10.923
I'm, like,
I can't wait to meet

00:08:10.923 --> 00:08:13.091
this fucking handsome-ass
fucking man.

00:08:13.091 --> 00:08:15.894
Like, I just--I just
remember him being, like,

00:08:15.894 --> 00:08:17.930
so tall and dark and handsome

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.432
and, like,
amazing and talented

00:08:20.432 --> 00:08:22.401
the way he fucking played
"Crash Into Me."

00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:24.370
I mean...
[laughter]

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.839
And I'm, like, and just to see
all the counselors in general,

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:29.775
like, to see my heroes again,
and I, like, you know, I, like,

00:08:29.775 --> 00:08:31.744
but through the door,
and it's after the wedding,

00:08:31.744 --> 00:08:33.211
because when you crash
a wedding,

00:08:33.211 --> 00:08:34.513
you don't go for the ceremony.

00:08:34.513 --> 00:08:36.916
You go to fuck,
obviously.

00:08:36.916 --> 00:08:39.785
So I go in, and I look around,
and I'm like,

00:08:39.785 --> 00:08:42.621
"Who are these old people?

00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:45.458
Oh, these are my counselors."

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:47.293
I'm like, "Oh, holy shit."

00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:50.295
They're all, like,
balding and fat and, like,

00:08:50.295 --> 00:08:52.764
pregnant, and I'm, like,

00:08:52.764 --> 00:08:56.402
it was like if 1990 froze...

00:08:58.137 --> 00:08:59.538
But they got old as fuck.

00:08:59.538 --> 00:09:01.807
[laughter]

00:09:01.807 --> 00:09:04.443
So I'm, like,
it's cool, whatever.

00:09:04.443 --> 00:09:05.945
Mark's gonna be hot.

00:09:05.945 --> 00:09:07.646
I'm, like,
I'm looking for him, right?

00:09:07.646 --> 00:09:09.148
And before I can find him,

00:09:09.148 --> 00:09:11.283
this woman I've never met
comes up, and she goes,

00:09:11.283 --> 00:09:13.151
"Oh, my God.
Are you Annie?"

00:09:13.151 --> 00:09:16.255
And I'm like, "Uh-huh,"
and she was like, "Oh, my God.

00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:17.656
Are you Mark's Annie?"

00:09:17.656 --> 00:09:20.493
And I'm like,
"Well, it's--I guess."

00:09:20.493 --> 00:09:22.661
And she was like,
"He's so excited you're coming.

00:09:22.661 --> 00:09:24.296
He's been talking about you
this whole time."

00:09:24.296 --> 00:09:25.831
And I'm, like,
that's when I realized

00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:27.466
I'm the
second-most-eventful thing

00:09:27.466 --> 00:09:30.302
that's happening at this wedding
besides the nuptials.

00:09:30.302 --> 00:09:33.271
Like, everyone's like, "This
girl's gonna come to fuck Mark.

00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:34.573
"This is amazing.

00:09:34.573 --> 00:09:37.810
Mark's getting fucked."

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:41.013
So then, you know,
the dork sea parts,

00:09:41.013 --> 00:09:45.284
and there he is.

00:09:45.284 --> 00:09:49.421
And let me tell ya,
he still has the eyebrow ring.

00:09:49.421 --> 00:09:52.824
[laughter]

00:09:52.824 --> 00:09:54.793
He had, like,
those long fingernails

00:09:54.793 --> 00:09:56.695
like he still plays guitar,

00:09:56.695 --> 00:09:58.363
which by the way, guys,
just trim them.

00:09:58.363 --> 00:09:59.865
Jesus fucking Christ.

00:09:59.865 --> 00:10:01.666
I don't need to know
whether I have HPV

00:10:01.666 --> 00:10:04.035
from your fucking fingernails.

00:10:04.035 --> 00:10:07.206
And I'm just, like, holy shit.

00:10:07.206 --> 00:10:12.043
Everything that made him cool
in the fucking '90s

00:10:12.043 --> 00:10:17.116
makes him so
unmotherfucking fuckable now.

00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:18.884
[laughter]

00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:21.787
Keep in mind, I've quit
drinking at this point.

00:10:21.787 --> 00:10:23.155
I'm sober as fuck.

00:10:23.155 --> 00:10:26.057
Like, there is no way
to drink him hot.

00:10:26.057 --> 00:10:30.729
Like, this is my lot in life
at this point.

00:10:30.729 --> 00:10:33.866
There's no other reason
I'm at this wedding

00:10:33.866 --> 00:10:36.001
than to fuck Mark Parker.

00:10:36.001 --> 00:10:39.004
Like,
I'm there to get it.

00:10:39.004 --> 00:10:41.807
And he comes over,
and he's like, "Hey, girl."

00:10:41.807 --> 00:10:45.878
And I'm like, "Noooooo.

00:10:45.878 --> 00:10:47.880
"Oh, he's also got
gay voice?

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.683
"Jesus fucking Christ.

00:10:51.683 --> 00:10:54.253
I got nothing
to work with here."

00:10:54.253 --> 00:10:56.188
[laughter]

00:10:56.188 --> 00:10:58.724
So I'm like,
"All right, I hatch a plan."

00:10:58.724 --> 00:11:03.162
I'm like,
"I am gonna get him so wasted

00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:05.430
"that he passes out,

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:09.101
and it's his fault
he doesn't fuck me," right?

00:11:09.101 --> 00:11:12.771
I'm like, "That sucks.
I was looking forward to it."

00:11:12.771 --> 00:11:14.373
So it's--the plan's working,
right?

00:11:14.373 --> 00:11:15.941
He's starting to bobblehead.

00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:19.678
He's got Cookie Monster eyes,
you know.

00:11:19.678 --> 00:11:21.847
He's fucking about out.

00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:23.282
And I see him.
He pops a pill.

00:11:23.282 --> 00:11:25.717
And I'm like, "Ambien?"

00:11:25.717 --> 00:11:29.522
"No, Adderall, motherfuckers."

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:34.527
So now he's just--
he's just there for me, guys.

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:39.231
And I'm, like--and he was,
like, so nice you know,

00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:40.632
so I had to fuck him.

00:11:40.632 --> 00:11:42.367
I had to!

00:11:42.367 --> 00:11:44.536
What was I gonna be, like,
that's the whole reason I came,

00:11:44.536 --> 00:11:46.539
I couldn't be all of a sudden,
"I'm not ready.

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:47.973
I'm not ready."

00:11:47.973 --> 00:11:49.875
I aggressively was like,
"I'm gonna fuck you.

00:11:49.875 --> 00:11:51.643
"I'm gonna fuck your dick.

00:11:51.643 --> 00:11:53.646
"I don't know if you know
what body part I'm gonna fuck.

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:55.647
It's your dick."

00:11:55.647 --> 00:11:57.115
Like, at least we'll
go back to his,

00:11:57.115 --> 00:11:58.984
like, nice room in this nice
bed and breakfast.

00:11:58.984 --> 00:12:01.920
No, he didn't have
his own room.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.590
I fucked Mark Parker
on the pullout couch

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.293
in another counselor's room.

00:12:08.293 --> 00:12:10.495
[laughter]

00:12:10.495 --> 00:12:12.164
So the sex was great.

00:12:12.164 --> 00:12:15.134
Just kidding,
terrible.

00:12:15.134 --> 00:12:16.235
[laughter]

00:12:16.235 --> 00:12:18.337
At one point,
he goes down on me,

00:12:18.337 --> 00:12:20.772
and he looks up,
and he goes, "Mmm, delicious."

00:12:20.772 --> 00:12:22.273
[audience groans]

00:12:22.273 --> 00:12:25.144
Like he's making a Yelp review
of my pussy.

00:12:25.144 --> 00:12:27.679
[laughter]

00:12:27.679 --> 00:12:29.248
Like, "Mmm, delicious."

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:30.349
Can we both be shot?

00:12:30.349 --> 00:12:32.284
Can we be taken out by snipers
right now?

00:12:32.284 --> 00:12:34.853
Like, someone should die
after someone says that.

00:12:34.853 --> 00:12:37.156
So fucking humiliating.

00:12:37.156 --> 00:12:39.625
And I'm just, like,
in my own personal Vietnam.

00:12:39.625 --> 00:12:42.594
I'm like, "Oh, my God.
How do I get out of this?"

00:12:42.594 --> 00:12:45.263
So I close my eyes, and I try
to go to my happy place,

00:12:45.263 --> 00:12:47.699
but all that's in my happy place
is, "Mmm, delicious."

00:12:47.699 --> 00:12:49.935
And I'm like, "God damn it!

00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:53.472
"I fucked my happy place.

00:12:53.472 --> 00:12:55.040
Oh, my God."

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.275
But I, like,
after the deed is done

00:12:57.275 --> 00:12:59.845
and everything's been
Wet-Napped up...

00:12:59.845 --> 00:13:01.513
[laughter]

00:13:01.513 --> 00:13:06.785
I just, like, go to bed feeling,
you know, grossed out.

00:13:06.785 --> 00:13:08.821
Like,
I ruined camp for myself,

00:13:08.821 --> 00:13:11.323
but at least I saved camp
for him,

00:13:11.323 --> 00:13:14.893
and he now goes to bed knowing
that he's preserved this--

00:13:14.893 --> 00:13:16.462
you know, this crush
and this relationship

00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:18.397
that he's always imagined
having too.

00:13:18.397 --> 00:13:20.966
So I go to bed a hero,
and then I wake up

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:24.036
from those sweet,
sweet dreams

00:13:24.036 --> 00:13:29.074
to Mark watching me sleep,
which is always delightful.

00:13:29.074 --> 00:13:30.976
What a way to wake up.
"Ahh."

00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:32.912
My life is in danger,
terrifying.

00:13:32.912 --> 00:13:35.180
Just to have your mistakes
just right in your face,

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.381
like, "Ahh!"

00:13:36.381 --> 00:13:38.884
The glistening
from the eyebrow ring, great.

00:13:38.884 --> 00:13:40.385
[laughter]

00:13:40.385 --> 00:13:43.722
So he--you know,
he's staring at me, and I go,

00:13:43.722 --> 00:13:46.758
"Uh, hello," and he goes,
"You know what?

00:13:46.758 --> 00:13:49.728
"I was looking at you,
watching you sleep,

00:13:49.728 --> 00:13:54.032
and I'm realizing, I think I do
remember you from camp now."

00:13:54.032 --> 00:13:57.169
[audience groans and laughs]

00:14:00.038 --> 00:14:02.207
I'm, like, about to cry.

00:14:02.207 --> 00:14:05.377
He didn't remember me
from camp.

00:14:05.377 --> 00:14:07.680
Yes, I was invisible.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.581
Yes, I was a loser.

00:14:09.581 --> 00:14:11.450
Do you know who I was to him?

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:15.687
Some fucking stranger that
friend-requested him on Facebook

00:14:15.687 --> 00:14:19.725
and then was like,
"I'm gonna fuck your dick."

00:14:19.725 --> 00:14:21.727
And then I fucked him.

00:14:21.727 --> 00:14:25.230
I was just the chick
from Facebook.

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:28.433
[audience groans and laughs]

00:14:28.433 --> 00:14:31.436
So I guess the moral
of the story is,

00:14:31.436 --> 00:14:34.907
don't rape yourself
with someone else's body.

00:14:34.907 --> 00:14:36.942
[laughter]

00:14:36.942 --> 00:14:39.811
And never go back
to your happy place.

00:14:39.811 --> 00:14:44.816
Don't fuck your happy place.

00:14:44.816 --> 00:14:46.918
My only issue
with telling this story

00:14:46.918 --> 00:14:49.288
is that Mark is, like,
so nice, you know.

00:14:49.288 --> 00:14:51.089
He's, like,
such a good person.

00:14:51.089 --> 00:14:53.592
And I'm just so afraid
he's gonna see this,

00:14:53.592 --> 00:14:56.094
you know,
and I'm gonna feel so guilty

00:14:56.094 --> 00:14:58.330
and have to fuck him again.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.499
You guys,
thank you so much.
