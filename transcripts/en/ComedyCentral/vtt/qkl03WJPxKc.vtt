00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.839
- We were, like,
face-to-face right here,

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.373
and she was like,
"Yeah, this is,"

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:08.508
you know, blah, blah, blah,
and I was like,

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:09.842
"Oh, it's really pretty,"

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:11.610
and then she looks me
right in the eye,

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.413
and I swear to God she says,
"I want you to come in my face."

Welcome to

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:57.156
I'm your host, Ari Shaffir,

All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:05.798 --> 00:01:07.800
he's got an amazing podcast
in iTunes

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.636
called "Tuesdays with Stories."

00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:17.176
- So here we go,
story time.

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:21.114
I--I decided I wanted to go
to film school in New York City,

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:25.117
so I moved there and moved
to Crown Heights, Brooklyn,

00:01:25.117 --> 00:01:26.686
with 400 bucks in my pocket.

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:27.921
It was a horrible year.

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.355
I got mugged three times
in a year,

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:30.657
my landlord died of AIDS,

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:32.191
and the first day
I got my apartment,

00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:33.793
there was a pigeon in there.

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:38.464
Yeah, probably should have
closed with the AIDS, but yeah.

00:01:38.464 --> 00:01:41.468
So if you don't know
Crown Heights,

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:43.635
it's this crazy neighborhood
way out in Brooklyn.

00:01:43.635 --> 00:01:45.104
It's got a highway dividing it.

00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:46.939
It's all Hasidic Jew
on this side,

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.475
all Caribbean black
on this side,

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:52.778
so obviously,
I moved into the black side.

00:01:52.778 --> 00:01:53.812
Yeah.

00:01:53.812 --> 00:01:55.280
There were two apartments
available,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.484
but I'm not gonna live
with Hasidic people.

00:01:57.484 --> 00:01:58.684
I mean, come on.

00:01:58.684 --> 00:02:00.153
What's going on there?

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:01.987
I don't want--
how many landlords do you want?

00:02:01.987 --> 00:02:04.857
You know what I mean?
Like, Jesus Christ, you know.

00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:06.326
And nothing against Jews.
I love Jews.

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:07.993
My ex-girlfriend's Jewish;
I love Ari,

00:02:07.993 --> 00:02:11.331
you know, show business,
ahh, but, you know,

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.733
I would come home drunk a lot
at, like, 5:00 in the morning,

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:15.834
and these Jews
would pull up in their minivan,

00:02:15.834 --> 00:02:17.170
and they'd slide the door open,
like,

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.671
"You're on the wrong side.
Get in."

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:19.906
And I was like,
"I'm not Jewish."

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:21.507
And they would just
peel right off.

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:23.509
Yeah,
they were a tough bunch.

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:26.012
They're very loyal.

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:29.148
So I lived in this apartment,
the worst apartment of all time.

00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:31.050
Periodically,
the hot water would go out,

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.386
the electricity would go out,
and the heat would go out.

00:02:33.386 --> 00:02:34.754
It was the dead of winter.

00:02:34.754 --> 00:02:36.422
So I'm going to film school
every day.

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:38.758
It's, like, an hour commute
back to Manhattan every day

00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:40.894
from my apartment,
and I wake up one Monday

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:42.361
to go to school--
no hot water.

00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:44.363
I was like, "Eh,
I didn't shower all weekend,

00:02:44.363 --> 00:02:45.698
"but I can go one more day.

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:47.200
It's cold out,"
you know?

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.534
I go to school.

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:50.403
Tuesday I wake up,
no hot water.

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:53.673
"Eh, I can't take a shower
in cold weather with cold water.

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.007
I'll just go to school."

00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:58.277
Wednesday rolls around,
no hot water.

00:02:58.277 --> 00:03:00.245
"Ah, I'll be all right."

00:03:00.245 --> 00:03:02.015
Now I'm the smelly guy
at school, you know?

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.217
I'm the--it was brutal.
I was that guy, you know.

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:05.951
So I'm kind of
getting desperate.

00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:10.055
Thursday comes, zero,
no hot water, nothing, no heat.

00:03:10.055 --> 00:03:12.358
It's like, "Ahh," but I'm late,
so I just go to school.

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:13.726
Finally, Friday,
I get desperate.

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:15.194
I wake up early.

00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:17.463
I'm like,
"I'm putting water in a pot,

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:19.966
"I'm gonna boil it, and I'm
gonna just take a whore bath

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:21.400
right in the kitchen,"
you know?

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.302
Yeah.

00:03:23.302 --> 00:03:25.404
So the heat's out,
the electricity is out,

00:03:25.404 --> 00:03:27.807
and the hot water is out,
so I just go, "Ah, God damn it."

00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:29.241
So I'm in the kitchen
in the dark

00:03:29.241 --> 00:03:30.609
just pouring water into a pot.

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.212
I start boiling it, you know,
in the dark,

00:03:33.212 --> 00:03:35.748
and I just kind of start bathing
myself, and it felt amazing.

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:39.151
I was so gross, and the lights
click on just then,

00:03:39.151 --> 00:03:41.721
and the pot had been used
by my roommate

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:44.656
to cook Stove Top Stuffing in
the night before.

00:03:44.656 --> 00:03:47.059
So now I'm--not only
do I have terrible B.O.

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:48.994
I'm covered in 11 herbs
and spices, you know?

00:03:48.994 --> 00:03:50.963
I got--I got all these
little things on me,

00:03:50.963 --> 00:03:52.931
little green things,
and garlic here.

00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:54.467
It was a mess,
so now I'm desperate.

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:56.268
I run to the train.
I have no time to clean up.

00:03:56.268 --> 00:03:57.903
I'm already late.
So I run to the train.

00:03:57.903 --> 00:03:59.304
And I get on the train.
It's packed out.

00:03:59.304 --> 00:04:00.806
I'm the only white guy
on the train,

00:04:00.806 --> 00:04:02.108
and all these black guys
are sniffing me,

00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:03.609
you know, like,
"What is that?

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.145
"Is this hobo Thanksgiving?
What's going on here?"

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:08.447
So I'm like, "I don't know.
Somebody probably farted.

00:04:08.447 --> 00:04:09.983
It is November.
I don't know."

00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:11.851
Yeah, so I get to school,
and now I'm desperate.

00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:13.252
I'm going around
asking everybody

00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:14.987
if I can shower at their place,
you know,

00:04:14.987 --> 00:04:16.455
teachers, students, whatever.

00:04:16.455 --> 00:04:17.824
I'm just freaking out.

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:19.491
Everybody says no.
I'm, like, a weirdo.

00:04:19.491 --> 00:04:20.693
People are looking at me funny.

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:22.861
And eventually,
I get to Mrs. Fritz.

00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:24.630
Now, I'll paint the picture
of Mrs. Fritz.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.966
She was the--
the horror makeup lady.

00:04:27.966 --> 00:04:29.335
She, like,
did all that horror shit,

00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:32.171
you know, and she was
a kooky gal, you know.

00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:34.374
She had, like, a beehive hairdo,
Lisa Loeb glasses.

00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:36.475
She would have, like,
watermelons on her dress,

00:04:36.475 --> 00:04:38.043
and then watermelon earrings.

00:04:38.043 --> 00:04:42.147
You know, she was a full-class
kook, you know, like,

00:04:42.147 --> 00:04:44.817
half art teacher, half hipster,
all nutjob, you know?

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:46.152
She was fun.

00:04:46.152 --> 00:04:47.819
But she was attractive
in her own right.

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:49.622
She was probably 40,
41 years old, nice lady,

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.223
and I was like,
"Hey, Mrs. Fritz,

00:04:51.223 --> 00:04:52.825
"you're gonna kill me,
but just feel free to say no.

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:54.160
Can I shower at your place?"

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.894
And she goes, "Yeah, sure.
What do I care?"

00:04:55.894 --> 00:04:57.497
And meanwhile,
this is a 41-year-old woman.

00:04:57.497 --> 00:04:59.832
You know, she's a teacher.
People give her apples.

00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:02.301
You know, like,
I'm a 21-year-old idiot.

00:05:02.301 --> 00:05:04.503
I've got, like, a propeller hat
and a big lollipop.

00:05:04.503 --> 00:05:06.672
I was nothing,
you know.

00:05:06.672 --> 00:05:08.307
So I was like,
"Oh, my God.

00:05:08.307 --> 00:05:09.842
Thank you so much.
I'm so excited."

00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:11.343
And I know people are thinking,
like,

00:05:11.343 --> 00:05:13.412
"Mark, your hot water's out
for a week.

00:05:13.412 --> 00:05:14.813
"You get no electricity.

00:05:14.813 --> 00:05:16.515
Why didn't you just tell
your landlord?"

00:05:16.515 --> 00:05:19.185
Well, it's a little awkward
complaining to your landlord

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:21.220
about hot water
when he has AIDS.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.222
Yeah, it's a tough one.
What am I gonna say?

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:24.357
"I got not hot water."

00:05:24.357 --> 00:05:25.891
"Well,
I don't have an T-cells."

00:05:25.891 --> 00:05:29.061
"Cool, all right, yeah, got it.

00:05:29.061 --> 00:05:31.697
Yeah," so, you know,
and this was--

00:05:31.697 --> 00:05:33.165
he wasn't, like, Magic Johnson.

00:05:33.165 --> 00:05:35.067
He was, like,
fuckin' "Dallas Buyers Club."

00:05:35.067 --> 00:05:37.269
He was, uh, it was a bad.

00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:39.205
I'm talking "Rent,"
"Philadelphia,"

00:05:39.205 --> 00:05:44.043
full-blown, baby, yeah,
so...nice guy, sweet kid.

00:05:44.043 --> 00:05:45.411
So I'm all excited.

00:05:45.411 --> 00:05:46.945
"I'm gonna go to
Mrs. Fritz's house.

00:05:46.945 --> 00:05:48.213
I'm gonna take a real shower."

00:05:48.213 --> 00:05:49.948
I hit the buzzer.
She buzzes me in.

00:05:49.948 --> 00:05:52.084
I go up to her place,
amazing apartment, unbelievable.

00:05:52.084 --> 00:05:53.518
She's was like a real adult.

00:05:53.518 --> 00:05:55.388
She had pictures in a frame
and curtains.

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:56.889
It was wild,
you know.

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.926
Every light bulb worked,
no stains, crazy, real adult.

00:05:59.926 --> 00:06:04.931
And I go into her kitchen,
giant table laid out,

00:06:04.931 --> 00:06:08.033
you know, all these place mats,
like, wine glass,

00:06:08.033 --> 00:06:10.269
regular glass, two plates,
forks, knives, the whole thing.

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:12.271
It was crazy; she was having
a dinner party at 8:00.

00:06:12.271 --> 00:06:13.972
So she was like,
"Hey, you can shower,

00:06:13.972 --> 00:06:15.574
but you've got to get in,
get out," you know.

00:06:15.574 --> 00:06:17.376
I was like, "No problem."
It was, like, 6:30.

00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:19.045
I was like,
"I'll be out of here by 8:00.

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:20.712
You've got a dinner party.
No problem."

00:06:20.712 --> 00:06:22.048
So I was like,
"All right, here we go.

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:23.382
Let's get in that shower."

00:06:23.382 --> 00:06:24.917
She goes, "Well,
have a glass of wine first."

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:26.452
I was like,
"Eh, all right, you know,

00:06:26.452 --> 00:06:27.719
I'll have a glass of wine."

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:29.321
Then I had another one
and another one,

00:06:29.321 --> 00:06:31.890
and we're talking about life
and love and the arts,

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.926
you know, and I--you know,
all this stuff,

00:06:33.926 --> 00:06:35.294
and I just had
got out of college,

00:06:35.294 --> 00:06:37.096
so I had a couple tricks
up my anal, you know.

00:06:37.096 --> 00:06:38.630
I was ready to go,
you know, and she...

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.099
just talking about everything.

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:41.900
We're laughing.
We're having a great time.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.002
And this is, like, a--
this is, like,

00:06:43.002 --> 00:06:44.637
a real woman here,
you know?

00:06:44.637 --> 00:06:46.439
Like, I'm--I'm a 21-year-old
drunk from New Orleans.

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:48.007
The only people
I've hooked up with are, like,

00:06:48.007 --> 00:06:49.475
bar skanks and cousins,
you know,

00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:50.942
nothing crazy,
you know?

00:06:50.942 --> 00:06:53.912
So...so I'm intimidated by her.

00:06:53.912 --> 00:06:55.982
She's, like,
successful and smart and clever

00:06:55.982 --> 00:06:58.183
and interesting and all that;
I was blown away.

00:06:58.183 --> 00:07:00.285
And so we're drinking,
and we're having a great time,

00:07:00.285 --> 00:07:02.421
and she goes, "You know,
I'm making some paella here."

00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:04.190
She had, like, eight pots going,
all this food.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.692
And I'm like, "Well, like,
I've got to skedaddle

00:07:06.692 --> 00:07:08.127
"here, sister;
I can't be eating.

00:07:08.127 --> 00:07:09.929
You've got dinner party
coming over, you know."

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:12.464
She was like, "Don't worry about
it; you've got plenty of time.

00:07:12.464 --> 00:07:14.300
It's, like, 7:00."
I was like, "All right."

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.970
So I had the paella; it's
amazing, unbelievable, so good.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.371
Everything's great.
We're laughing.

00:07:19.371 --> 00:07:20.940
And she pours another glass
of wine.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.140
And I was like,
"Look, it's 7:30.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.643
I've got to get in the shower."

00:07:23.643 --> 00:07:25.310
And she goes, "All right,
all right, all right,"

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.812
and she had everything
in there, you know,

00:07:26.812 --> 00:07:28.814
like, soap,
and so then I...

00:07:28.814 --> 00:07:32.185
so...unbelievable,
real adult.

00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:34.120
So I'm like, "Oh, wow,
this is great, all right."

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.655
So I remember, you know,
laughing.

00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:37.723
She hands me a towel.
We're having a great time.

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:38.957
She's so nice.

00:07:38.957 --> 00:07:40.192
And I remember taking a shower,

00:07:40.192 --> 00:07:44.163
being in her bathroom
just like...

00:07:44.163 --> 00:07:46.999
"Am I gonna--
am I gonna fuck Ms. Fritz?

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:49.167
"No, no, come on.
She's a 58-year-old woman.

00:07:49.167 --> 00:07:50.536
"What, are you crazy?
Get out of here.

00:07:50.536 --> 00:07:52.338
She's got a dinner party
on the way over."

00:07:52.338 --> 00:07:54.507
So I was like, "All right,
all right, all right, come on."

00:07:54.507 --> 00:07:56.342
So I get out of the shower.
I dry off real quick.

00:07:56.342 --> 00:07:58.010
It's, like, 7:48 now.
I'm freaking out.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.512
So I get out of the shower;
I'm like,

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:01.514
"All right, that was great."
I put my new clothes on.

00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:03.416
"I'll get out of your hair.
This was a great time."

00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:05.350
She goes, "Well,
have one more glass of wine."

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:06.852
And I'm like,
"You know, Mrs. Fritz,

00:08:06.852 --> 00:08:08.320
"you've got people coming over.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.022
This is, uh,
you've got the dinner party."

00:08:10.022 --> 00:08:11.523
And she goes,
"Ahh, it's fine."

00:08:11.523 --> 00:08:13.593
So she has another glass
of wine poured, and she goes,

00:08:13.593 --> 00:08:15.861
"Let me give you the tour
of the house before you go."

00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:17.263
It's like, "All right, eh."

00:08:17.263 --> 00:08:18.564
[laughter]

00:08:18.564 --> 00:08:19.898
Yeah, you guys know.

00:08:19.898 --> 00:08:22.267
I didn't know what "tour" meant.

00:08:22.267 --> 00:08:24.603
So I was like, "All right, sure,
I'll take a tour, yeah."

00:08:24.603 --> 00:08:25.837
I'm holding my glass of wine.

00:08:25.837 --> 00:08:27.205
She was like, "Oh, this chair

00:08:27.205 --> 00:08:29.008
"has been in my family
for a million years.

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:30.942
This lamp is from
the Byzantine era," whatever,

00:08:30.942 --> 00:08:33.212
you know, all this shit,
and she's like,

00:08:33.212 --> 00:08:35.046
"This painting has been
in my family for years.

00:08:35.046 --> 00:08:36.715
Come--get on the couch.
Step on the couch."

00:08:36.715 --> 00:08:39.284
So we're standing on her couch
looking at this painting,

00:08:39.284 --> 00:08:41.186
and, you know, I was like,
"Oh, this is nice."

00:08:41.186 --> 00:08:43.221
She was like, "Yeah,
it's Rembrandt's gay period,"

00:08:43.221 --> 00:08:47.226
or whatever, and...
staring at this thing,

00:08:47.226 --> 00:08:49.729
and we were, like,
face-to-face right here,

00:08:49.729 --> 00:08:51.062
and she was like,
"Yeah, this is,"

00:08:51.062 --> 00:08:52.765
you know, blah, blah, blah,
and I was like,

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:54.099
"Oh, it's really pretty,"

00:08:54.099 --> 00:08:55.734
and then she looks me
right in the eye,

00:08:55.734 --> 00:08:59.938
and I swear to God she says,
"I want you to come in my face."

00:08:59.938 --> 00:09:03.141
True story.
True story.

00:09:03.141 --> 00:09:06.912
Unbelievable, so I go,
"Well, I think I can do that."

00:09:06.912 --> 00:09:08.914
[laughter]

00:09:08.914 --> 00:09:10.583
And so we just start going at it
on the floor.

00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:12.585
We're making out like crazy.
We're rolling around.

00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:14.252
We knock over lamps.
The cat's hissing.

00:09:14.252 --> 00:09:15.954
[hisses]
It was just hot.

00:09:15.954 --> 00:09:17.823
It was wild!
Crazy!

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:19.659
Teacher! Student!
Paella!

00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:21.060
What a night!

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.761
So we're going at it
like animals.

00:09:22.761 --> 00:09:23.962
I pick her old ass up,

00:09:23.962 --> 00:09:25.430
I throw her on the bed,
the whole thing.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.265
Oh, my God.
It was wild.

00:09:27.265 --> 00:09:29.435
And she pulls some cord; all
the lights go out in the house.

00:09:29.435 --> 00:09:31.603
Something happened,
so now we're rolling around

00:09:31.603 --> 00:09:32.938
in the dark just going at it.

00:09:32.938 --> 00:09:34.439
"Ahh," crazy, you know,

00:09:34.439 --> 00:09:36.274
this is a 68-year-old woman
I'm banging here.

00:09:36.274 --> 00:09:38.610
This is wild,
so it was just hot and heavy

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.278
and great in every way
and all this.

00:09:40.278 --> 00:09:42.114
I can feel her earrings
dangling around me.

00:09:42.114 --> 00:09:43.582
It was unreal.

00:09:43.582 --> 00:09:45.517
So we're going at it.
We're both naked.

00:09:45.517 --> 00:09:47.652
"Ahh," you know,
and I remember at one point,

00:09:47.652 --> 00:09:50.456
we're probably 45 minutes
into this,

00:09:50.456 --> 00:09:52.958
we're going at it, and I was in
the doggy-style position,

00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.528
and I remember vividly thinking,

00:09:55.528 --> 00:09:57.696
"Where the hell's
that dinner party?"

00:09:57.696 --> 00:09:59.298
[laughter]

00:09:59.298 --> 00:10:01.133
Ahh, people cancel.
Who cares?

00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:02.634
Ahh, let's get back to it.

00:10:02.634 --> 00:10:04.303
So we're going at it,
blah, blah, blah.

00:10:04.303 --> 00:10:05.704
Eventually,
we got at it for a while.

00:10:05.704 --> 00:10:07.606
Then we pass out;
we're both wine drunk.

00:10:07.606 --> 00:10:09.942
You know, we've had probably
nine glasses of wine here.

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:11.477
So we're, you know,
we pass out.

00:10:11.477 --> 00:10:13.979
I wake up the next morning.
The sun is beaming in.

00:10:13.979 --> 00:10:15.347
The whole apartment's lit up.

00:10:15.347 --> 00:10:17.316
I've got a crazy wine hangover.

00:10:17.316 --> 00:10:18.617
And I was like, "Oh, my God.

00:10:18.617 --> 00:10:20.152
What the hell happened
last night?"

00:10:20.152 --> 00:10:21.653
That was wild.
Oh, man."

00:10:21.653 --> 00:10:23.689
I look down; she's kind of
nuzzled right here.

00:10:23.689 --> 00:10:24.890
And I go to get up.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:26.659
I look at the bed--

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:28.794
covered in blood

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:32.698
head to toe.

00:10:32.698 --> 00:10:34.166
[laughter]

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:35.834
I mean,
this was tons.

00:10:35.834 --> 00:10:37.236
It was like a murder scene.

00:10:37.236 --> 00:10:39.338
She must have lost tons of iron.
This is wild.

00:10:39.338 --> 00:10:41.072
I mean,
I didn't know what to do,

00:10:41.072 --> 00:10:43.175
and, you know, I thought,
you know,

00:10:43.175 --> 00:10:44.810
at that age,
isn't that shit over?

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.179
I had no idea, you know, and she
was so nonchalant about it.

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:49.181
She was like, "Oh, we
should have put a towel down."

00:10:49.181 --> 00:10:50.983
What are you--
that was a fucking tarp.

00:10:50.983 --> 00:10:53.185
That's insane.

00:10:53.185 --> 00:10:54.553
So I was like, "Oh, my God."

00:10:54.553 --> 00:10:55.988
Just the irony here.

00:10:55.988 --> 00:10:58.224
I'm coming from the cleanest
I've ever been in weeks.

00:10:58.224 --> 00:11:00.693
Now I'm covered in uterine
lining here, all right?

00:11:00.693 --> 00:11:02.661
It was unbelievable.
I've got ovaries on my face.

00:11:02.661 --> 00:11:04.195
I looked like
a fucking Apache here.

00:11:04.195 --> 00:11:06.031
I was, like, fucking war paint.

00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:08.033
[whooping]

00:11:08.033 --> 00:11:10.235
Oh, my God.
It was crazy.

00:11:10.235 --> 00:11:11.670
But I was like,
oh, wow, all right,

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:13.772
well, I guess
this is New York City,

00:11:13.772 --> 00:11:16.108
yeah, yeah, so...

00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:17.610
so I had--
you know, I was still in school.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.178
I had school on Saturday
back then.

00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:20.512
So I was like,
"I've got to get up.

00:11:20.512 --> 00:11:22.214
I've got to go.
What, are you crazy?"

00:11:22.214 --> 00:11:24.216
And so I, you know,
just didn't have time to shower.

00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:26.117
I just put my clothes on,

00:11:26.117 --> 00:11:28.186
and I remember my underwear
was so gross,

00:11:28.186 --> 00:11:29.388
I just put it in my pocket.

00:11:29.388 --> 00:11:31.557
I just put my jeans on,
yeah,

00:11:31.557 --> 00:11:33.726
and put them there,
jeans on, shirt on.

00:11:33.726 --> 00:11:36.262
I just ran out the door, and she
goes, "Hey, hey, wait a minute.

00:11:36.262 --> 00:11:39.065
"Before you go, remember,
I'm a fucking teacher.

00:11:39.065 --> 00:11:41.300
"You're a student.
Don't tell anybody, you weirdo.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.034
We could get in trouble."
I'm like, "Of course."

00:11:43.034 --> 00:11:45.237
She's like, "I'm serious.
This is real stuff here."

00:11:45.237 --> 00:11:46.739
I'm like,
"Of course, of course."

00:11:46.739 --> 00:11:48.807
So I run down to the train,
and I get on the train,

00:11:48.807 --> 00:11:50.376
and I go to school,

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:54.380
and I immediately gather
every male at the school,

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.215
every single one, you know,
student, teacher, janitor,

00:11:57.215 --> 00:11:58.484
whatever you are.

00:11:58.484 --> 00:11:59.985
I had the goddamn mayor
in there.

00:11:59.985 --> 00:12:02.254
Yeah, so I gather all of them
into the equipment room.

00:12:02.254 --> 00:12:03.888
Everybody's hanging
from the rafters.

00:12:03.888 --> 00:12:05.457
People are sitting on the floor.

00:12:05.457 --> 00:12:07.293
Everybody's like,
"What's going on, Norman?

00:12:07.293 --> 00:12:08.760
What's the big news?
What's the word?"

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.295
I go,
"You're not gonna believe this.

00:12:10.295 --> 00:12:12.430
I banged Mrs. Fritz."

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:14.233
And they all go, "Oh, shut up.

00:12:14.233 --> 00:12:16.068
"Get out of here.
She's, you know, 71.

00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:18.003
"What, are you crazy?

00:12:18.003 --> 00:12:19.471
You're a liar."

00:12:19.471 --> 00:12:23.074
And I go,
"You don't believe me, huh?"

00:12:23.074 --> 00:12:26.144
I pull out the tighty whities.

00:12:26.144 --> 00:12:27.980
Yeah, so they were like,
"Oh, my God."

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.582
Everybody's hitting each other,
going crazy, unbelievable.

00:12:30.582 --> 00:12:33.251
It was like that--you know
when you have sex with a Greek,

00:12:33.251 --> 00:12:35.020
and you put the sheet out
on the window?

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.488
That was it.

00:12:36.488 --> 00:12:38.957
That's--
look--Google that.

00:12:38.957 --> 00:12:42.194
So yeah.
Oh, it was great.

00:12:42.194 --> 00:12:44.129
It was like "Sixteen Candles,"
but, you know,

00:12:44.129 --> 00:12:45.464
with, like,
a miscarriage in there.

00:12:45.464 --> 00:12:47.165
Yeah, it was unbelievable.

00:12:47.165 --> 00:12:49.101
So Monday comes around.

00:12:49.101 --> 00:12:51.203
They--they fire Ms. Fritz.

00:12:51.203 --> 00:12:53.338
Yeah,
but they never told her why,

00:12:53.338 --> 00:12:56.141
which is why I did this show.

00:12:56.141 --> 00:12:59.545
[laughter]

00:12:59.545 --> 00:13:02.547
It's cool.
