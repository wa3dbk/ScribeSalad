- It was 2011 and, uh,

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:15.107
two grown men
are lying face up.

00:01:15.107 --> 00:01:17.410
It's Super Bowl weekend,
Saturday night.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.979
Two grown men are lying face up,
fully clothed,

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.782
on twin beds
at the MGM Grand hotel,

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:25.150
and they're focusing
really hard on their breathing,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.585
and they're listening to Enya,

00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:28.655
'cause that's the only thing...
[laughs]

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:30.522
they've been able
to figure out that keeps them

00:01:30.522 --> 00:01:35.428
from completely just
freaking the fuck out.

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:38.464
One of these guys
is comedy booking agent Stu.

00:01:38.464 --> 00:01:42.769
Doesn't want his last named
to be revealed for this story.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:45.271
But it sounds a lot like
[bleep].

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:48.607
[laughter]

00:01:48.607 --> 00:01:50.676
It sounds exactly like that.

00:01:50.676 --> 00:01:54.681
[laughter]

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:57.616
Right now Stu is really worried
that the other guy in the room

00:01:57.616 --> 00:01:59.385
has a knife and wants
to stab him with it,

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:01.387
and the other guy in the room
doesn't have a knife.

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:02.988
He also doesn't care
about telling Stu

00:02:02.988 --> 00:02:04.624
that he doesn't have a knife,

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:06.993
'cause he doesn't think
Stu is a real person.

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:08.394
[laughter]

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:10.129
He's currently convinced
that Stu

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:11.563
is a psychological construct

00:02:11.563 --> 00:02:13.832
that's been planted
into his subconscious

00:02:13.832 --> 00:02:15.468
by some kind of evil scientist

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:17.069
that's been studying him
in a coma,

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.470
trying to get secrets,

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.507
and he doesn't want
to reveal those secrets.

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:24.343
Uh, that man is me.

00:02:24.343 --> 00:02:27.413
And, uh, this is about
the night my agent and I

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:30.817
tried to recreate "Fear
and Loathing in Las Vegas."

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:32.018
[laughter, whooping]

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:34.254
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:02:37.656 --> 00:02:39.558
I've thought a lot
in the years since

00:02:39.558 --> 00:02:42.328
about why at 33
I decided to head to Vegas

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:45.164
with a bag of drugs,
including nine hits of acid--

00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:47.733
like, I had never partied
quite that hard before or since.

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:49.402
And a lot of it was the movie,

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:50.602
"Fear and Loathing
in Las Vegas."

00:02:50.602 --> 00:02:51.670
Like, I saw that movie, finally.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.872
I was really fascinated that

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:54.340
Hunter S. Thompson
and his lawyer

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.075
just went to Vegas
for work, like,

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:57.577
technically
they're there for work,

00:02:57.577 --> 00:03:00.446
and they just blew off
all responsibilities in life

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:03.349
to burn through a literal
briefcase full of drugs.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.686
And I found that
strangely, uh, inspiring.

00:03:07.686 --> 00:03:10.022
Like, I've always been
so worried about consequences,

00:03:10.022 --> 00:03:11.423
and I thought,
"How fun would that be?"

00:03:11.423 --> 00:03:13.359
Just for, like, one night,
at least.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.028
Just to do whatever
I wanted to do,

00:03:16.028 --> 00:03:17.697
no matter how terrible
of a choice it was.

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:20.867
And what I had really wanted
to do for a long time

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:22.868
was a lot of drugs.

00:03:22.868 --> 00:03:25.638
I wanted to know how it felt
to have that mind just, like,

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:29.141
brutally altered to the level
that their minds were.

00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:31.044
And so, uh, I think it--

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:32.878
and especially acid.

00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:35.381
I feel like acid was a big part
of that movie for me too,

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:37.049
'cause I'd been fascinated
with acid.

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.718
It was on my bucket list ever
since a buddy of mine in college

00:03:39.718 --> 00:03:41.788
told me this story
that I'll never forget

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:42.888
about how he dropped acid.

00:03:42.888 --> 00:03:44.390
He went to this party,

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.226
and he got stuck in the bathroom
for a couple of hours,

00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:49.061
where he was perched up
on the the toilet,

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:50.563
and he was afraid to get down,

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:53.298
'cause he had noticed
that a lot of tiny horses

00:03:53.298 --> 00:03:56.068
had sprung up from the tiles.

00:03:56.068 --> 00:03:57.570
And he thought
they were beautiful,

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.239
and he didn't want to risk
hurting one of these...

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.442
like, you know,
really gorgeous creatures.

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:04.577
And I had been high before,
but I had never been

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:07.480
"don't squish tiny horses"
high.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.482
And I definitely wanted
a piece of that action.

00:04:10.482 --> 00:04:12.951
So it's--you know,
it's 2:00 in the afternoon.

00:04:12.951 --> 00:04:14.153
We get to the MGM.

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:15.955
We check in,
and we pop some codeine,

00:04:15.955 --> 00:04:17.422
smoke a little weed,
have a few drinks,

00:04:17.422 --> 00:04:19.758
just to put our brains
in a peaceful state

00:04:19.758 --> 00:04:22.294
to ensure that we
have a nice, soothing trip.

00:04:22.294 --> 00:04:24.029
And we each take a hit of acid,

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:25.631
and then we go
to the Circus Circus,

00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:27.600
where Hunter S. Thompson
hallucinated,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.967
to go play some poker.

00:04:28.967 --> 00:04:30.937
And we get there and the acid
still hadn't kicked in,

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.438
and we got really nervous.

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:34.440
We were like, "Aw, man,
I think we got a bad batch."

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.642
And we decided to take
a second hit of acid.

00:04:36.642 --> 00:04:37.977
[audience groans]

00:04:37.977 --> 00:04:41.046
Yeah, exactly.

00:04:41.046 --> 00:04:42.381
Not bad.
Not a bad batch.

00:04:42.381 --> 00:04:43.682
I sat down at the poker table,

00:04:43.682 --> 00:04:47.487
started having
some very new thoughts.

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:50.323
Like, I remember thinking that
the guy sitting across from me

00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:51.623
had the most chips.

00:04:51.623 --> 00:04:53.492
Like, he was doing
the best at poker

00:04:53.492 --> 00:04:57.997
specifically 'cause
his face had too many angles.

00:04:57.997 --> 00:05:01.133
Like, I didn't know how many
angles a face should have.

00:05:01.133 --> 00:05:03.636
I was like, "This fucker
has more than that."

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:06.872
And I felt like it gave him
a strategic poker advantage.

00:05:06.872 --> 00:05:08.508
And I also had a thought
that Stu

00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:10.009
has no chance of
winning at poker,

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.478
'cause he has
a teeny, tiny head.

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:15.348
I'd never noticed how truly tiny
it was until that moment.

00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:18.150
Like, not "Beetlejuice"
head shrinker dust tiny,

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.584
but pretty goddamn close.

00:05:19.584 --> 00:05:21.187
And I'm like, "He can't win."

00:05:21.187 --> 00:05:22.821
You can't win
with a tiny head at poker.

00:05:22.821 --> 00:05:24.656
That's just--I know that now.

00:05:24.656 --> 00:05:26.192
And I'm having
a lot of fun thoughts.

00:05:26.192 --> 00:05:27.526
I'm laughing
at these fun thoughts.

00:05:27.526 --> 00:05:29.094
Stu's laughing
at this fun thoughts,

00:05:29.094 --> 00:05:30.396
and then we decide
to take our great time

00:05:30.396 --> 00:05:31.864
and ruin it by making

00:05:31.864 --> 00:05:33.499
easily what was our
worst decision of the night.

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:35.167
We decided to go back
to the hotel

00:05:35.167 --> 00:05:38.404
and take the rest of the acid.

00:05:38.404 --> 00:05:41.741
Taking the rest of the acid
is just a bad premise.

00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:45.177
Right, like, it implies you've
already taken an amount of acid

00:05:45.177 --> 00:05:46.679
you thought would be enough

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:50.249
when you didn't already
have a head full of acid.

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:52.752
And now you're taking
more than that,

00:05:52.752 --> 00:05:55.587
'cause you're quite
literally insane.

00:05:55.587 --> 00:05:58.524
So we take 2 1/2 more hits each.
There's a half in there.

00:05:58.524 --> 00:06:00.425
We were so greedy
with our drugs,

00:06:00.425 --> 00:06:03.029
we couldn't let one guy have
one more hit than the other guy.

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:06.532
We actually tore a little tiny
tab in half, and we had 2 1/2--

00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:09.435
and then we decided
we need to reconfirm

00:06:09.435 --> 00:06:12.371
picking up some coke
and ecstasy in a little bit,

00:06:12.371 --> 00:06:14.273
and before we go get
the rest of the drugs,

00:06:14.273 --> 00:06:16.909
we need to go get some pizza
across the street.

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:18.711
[laughter]

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:21.146
We're really planning
this out as best we can.

00:06:21.146 --> 00:06:23.248
And it should have taken
us about 15 minutes

00:06:23.248 --> 00:06:25.817
to make it across the street
to get some pizza.

00:06:25.817 --> 00:06:29.721
We estimated later it took us
roughly an hour and a half.

00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:32.224
'Cause by the time
we hit the lobby,

00:06:32.224 --> 00:06:33.825
the acid was kicking in so hard

00:06:33.825 --> 00:06:35.627
our brains
were just disintegrating.

00:06:35.627 --> 00:06:38.230
Stu's new reality became,
once we got to the lobby,

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.733
that there was
a security team tracking us

00:06:40.733 --> 00:06:42.401
trying to catch us
doing the drugs

00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:43.402
complete with dogs.

00:06:43.402 --> 00:06:46.472
He thinks dogs are following us.

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:48.341
Like--like that's
ever gonna happen in Vegas.

00:06:48.341 --> 00:06:49.642
Like they're just gonna let,
you know,

00:06:49.642 --> 00:06:51.276
drug-sniffing dogs
loose on the strip.

00:06:51.276 --> 00:06:53.779
They would bark at almost
every fucking person

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:55.581
they came across.

00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:57.349
And--but he thinks
our best course of action

00:06:57.349 --> 00:06:59.919
is to hide in the MGM
parking lot behind some cars

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:02.621
so the dogs don't find us,
and so we do that.

00:07:02.621 --> 00:07:04.523
We go out,
and we're hiding behind a car.

00:07:04.523 --> 00:07:07.459
It's not even dark out.

00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:11.764
We're two men in our 30s
just hiding behind random cars.

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:13.432
And then we would--
he would get nervous

00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:14.867
that the dogs were closing in,

00:07:14.867 --> 00:07:16.435
and then he would decide
we got to, like, head down,

00:07:16.435 --> 00:07:18.037
scurry to the next car

00:07:18.037 --> 00:07:19.372
to not looks suspicious.

00:07:19.372 --> 00:07:21.640
That looks so suspicious.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.975
And I'm following him
knowing it's a bad idea,

00:07:23.975 --> 00:07:25.277
but I have to stay close to him,

00:07:25.277 --> 00:07:26.879
'cause I have a new reality
as well.

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:28.448
My new reality is that

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:29.882
everything that's now really,
really close to me

00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:33.485
that I look at
starts to drift back and away

00:07:33.485 --> 00:07:35.621
and up into the air,
including Stu.

00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:37.723
And I actually am thinking
that if I don't stay

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:39.825
within grabbing distance
of my friend,

00:07:39.825 --> 00:07:42.728
he could drift into space.

00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:45.197
And I can't handle
that right now.

00:07:45.197 --> 00:07:47.799
I just cannot risk that,
and so he's--

00:07:47.799 --> 00:07:49.368
We're just scurrying,
and I'm chasing.

00:07:49.368 --> 00:07:50.903
And finally we make it
to the pizza place

00:07:50.903 --> 00:07:53.706
where I decide to order us
two pepperoni pizzas,

00:07:53.706 --> 00:07:56.142
which--I don't even really
like pepperoni pizza,

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:57.709
but another real
thought I'm having

00:07:57.709 --> 00:07:59.478
is that I'm convinced
that some things

00:07:59.478 --> 00:08:01.747
that I've always thought
were real are real,

00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:04.650
and some things that I've always
thought were real are not real.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.253
I love Canadian bacon pizza,
but you know what?

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:09.822
It's fucking fake pizza,
you guys.

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:11.490
It's never real.
It's never existed.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.692
And you can't eat things
that don't exist.

00:08:13.692 --> 00:08:14.993
[laughter]

00:08:14.993 --> 00:08:17.163
So pepperoni pizza,
it's super-duper real.

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:19.098
It's the most real pizza.

00:08:19.098 --> 00:08:22.201
And by God,
that's what we're gonna eat.

00:08:22.201 --> 00:08:24.503
And...
[laughs]

00:08:24.503 --> 00:08:26.672
and all this makes perfectly--
sense to me at the time.

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:28.006
It makes really good sense.

00:08:28.006 --> 00:08:29.842
And they have this, like,
you know like

00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:31.911
the individual little boxes in
the little trays on the shelf?

00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:34.613
And I go to just grab us
two pizzas from the counter,

00:08:34.613 --> 00:08:36.748
and, like, millimeters
before grabbing it,

00:08:36.748 --> 00:08:38.750
my fingers crumple
and my wrist bends

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.920
like I hit something,
and it really hurts.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.055
And I'm just like, "What the
fuck is that--happened?"

00:08:43.055 --> 00:08:45.458
And I just look at Stu, and he's
off worried about security.

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:46.725
He's in a bad place.

00:08:46.725 --> 00:08:48.260
And I just keep trying
to grab it,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.928
and it just keeps
crumpling over and over.

00:08:49.928 --> 00:08:52.298
And I'm like, "I cannot for
the life of me get this pizza."

00:08:52.298 --> 00:08:54.400
I went back the next day
to see what the hell--

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.402
there was a plexiglass
barrier...

00:08:56.402 --> 00:08:59.438
[laughter]

00:08:59.438 --> 00:09:01.240
Between product and customer

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.608
that I'm unable
to visually process.

00:09:03.608 --> 00:09:06.145
I remember at one point
actually digging

00:09:06.145 --> 00:09:08.046
at the fucking force field

00:09:08.046 --> 00:09:12.051
like an insane badger
just desperate for pepperoni.

00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:14.886
And they take pity on me.
They give us the pizzas.

00:09:14.886 --> 00:09:17.223
I wish they would have given us
security camera footage

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:19.257
of that interaction.

00:09:19.257 --> 00:09:21.393
I would--that'd be priceless.

00:09:21.393 --> 00:09:23.628
But we were somehow able
to eat these pizzas.

00:09:23.628 --> 00:09:27.466
And then we hop on a taxi to go
find the rest of the drugs.

00:09:27.466 --> 00:09:30.236
And I have a piece of paper

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:31.736
I'd put down
in my pocket earlier

00:09:31.736 --> 00:09:33.105
with the address written down,

00:09:33.105 --> 00:09:34.740
'cause I knew I'd be
in a bad place.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.075
And I read what
I think are the words

00:09:37.075 --> 00:09:38.810
on the paper to the driver.

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:41.279
I'm reading him
what I think is an address.

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:45.317
He hears, what I'm guessing,
is just drug-fueled gibberish,

00:09:45.317 --> 00:09:46.919
and he wants more information.

00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:50.255
Essentially,
he wants an actual address.

00:09:50.255 --> 00:09:53.192
And he wants--or references,
what part of town is it?

00:09:53.192 --> 00:09:55.794
You know,
nearest intersection.

00:09:55.794 --> 00:09:59.431
I can't answer any ques--
I'm only mentally capable

00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:01.466
of re-reading
what I think it says

00:10:01.466 --> 00:10:03.935
louder and more aggressively.

00:10:03.935 --> 00:10:05.771
I don't know what I was yelling,
just some--

00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:08.640
I'm sure it was some just
gibberish-y address-y kind of--

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.311
"7-6 Street Durango 7-6!

00:10:12.311 --> 00:10:13.679
"Place! Street!

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:17.049
[yelling]
"7! 7! 7! 7! 7! 7! 7!"

00:10:17.049 --> 00:10:19.051
[laughter]

00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:21.553
I'm freaking out, uh...

00:10:21.553 --> 00:10:23.121
Like a lot of people,

00:10:23.121 --> 00:10:27.960
the driver doesn't like
being screamed at by a maniac.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.828
He becomes very upset,

00:10:29.828 --> 00:10:32.064
and now he's screaming at me,

00:10:32.064 --> 00:10:33.399
and this freaks Stu out.

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:35.033
Stu's really freaking out.

00:10:35.033 --> 00:10:37.335
Now, I found out later that
at this point in the evening,

00:10:37.335 --> 00:10:39.070
Stu becomes convinced
that this driver

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:40.539
is part of the security team,

00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:42.541
and he's driving us
straight to prison.

00:10:42.541 --> 00:10:44.643
Like, not even a--
not processing,

00:10:44.643 --> 00:10:46.478
not police station,
not jail, just prison.

00:10:46.478 --> 00:10:48.213
We're going to some kind of
drug prison.

00:10:48.213 --> 00:10:50.483
And at the next intersection
at the red light,

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.717
he just leaves.

00:10:52.717 --> 00:10:54.986
He just opens the door mid-fare

00:10:54.986 --> 00:10:57.089
and just starts running
away from the taxi,

00:10:57.089 --> 00:11:01.059
which I didn't know was
an option you could do in taxis.

00:11:01.059 --> 00:11:03.328
I grab an unknown amount of cash

00:11:03.328 --> 00:11:05.531
and just throw it at the driver

00:11:05.531 --> 00:11:07.165
and chase him,

00:11:07.165 --> 00:11:09.501
and we just run for a long time.

00:11:09.501 --> 00:11:11.836
I don't know.
We couldn't track time.

00:11:11.836 --> 00:11:13.872
I do know--I remember, like,
being in alleys.

00:11:13.872 --> 00:11:16.675
I remember a lot of scurrying
and hiding.

00:11:16.675 --> 00:11:18.244
Finally we're able to actually

00:11:18.244 --> 00:11:20.245
see the MGM tower
in the distance,

00:11:20.245 --> 00:11:23.081
and we were, like,
we navigated like savages.

00:11:23.081 --> 00:11:25.017
We just, like,
would see it visually

00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:27.453
and we're moving
somewhat towards it

00:11:27.453 --> 00:11:29.688
like two monsters
following the moon.

00:11:29.688 --> 00:11:31.690
And we finally do make
it back to the room,

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.592
where I decide
we got to lay down,

00:11:33.592 --> 00:11:34.894
we got to focus
on our breathing,

00:11:34.894 --> 00:11:36.528
and we got
to calm the fuck down,

00:11:36.528 --> 00:11:38.096
'cause shit's
getting real weird.

00:11:38.096 --> 00:11:40.532
On the way back, Stu started
talking a lot about a knife,

00:11:40.532 --> 00:11:42.300
and he was real worried
about getting stabbed.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.402
He's asking me over and over
about the knife.

00:11:44.402 --> 00:11:46.205
I don't even care about
answering him,

00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:49.074
'cause he's the Canadian bacon
of people to me right now.

00:11:49.074 --> 00:11:50.876
I don't--like,
you're not even a real thing.

00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:52.377
You're just
so annoying right now.

00:11:52.377 --> 00:11:54.914
You're a fake, annoying thing.

00:11:54.914 --> 00:11:57.482
And I just think that, like,
if we could just lay down,

00:11:57.482 --> 00:11:58.817
focus on our breathing,

00:11:58.817 --> 00:12:00.752
and maybe listen
to some music or something,

00:12:00.752 --> 00:12:02.821
'cause things are--
it's getting so dark.

00:12:02.821 --> 00:12:04.623
You know, like, I--
every time I look around,

00:12:04.623 --> 00:12:06.224
I'm convinced
there's a wall of blood

00:12:06.224 --> 00:12:08.060
behind me in the background.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.895
I need some kind of music,
but unfortunately,

00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:11.897
I listen to a lot
of hard rock and metal,

00:12:11.897 --> 00:12:14.066
and Rage Against the Machine,
Queens of the Stone Age--

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:16.302
not what I fucking
need right now.

00:12:16.302 --> 00:12:18.303
Not gonna put me
in a better place.

00:12:18.303 --> 00:12:20.071
And luckily I think back

00:12:20.071 --> 00:12:23.775
to an album I used to fall
asleep to in high school,

00:12:23.775 --> 00:12:26.245
and I'm able to type four
letters into the keyboard,

00:12:26.245 --> 00:12:28.947
which is really hard
'cause my keyboard's melting.

00:12:28.947 --> 00:12:31.149
I can't look at it
for more than a few seconds

00:12:31.149 --> 00:12:32.317
without it starting to melt,

00:12:32.317 --> 00:12:35.654
but I'm able to get in
E-N-Y-A.

00:12:35.654 --> 00:12:37.756
[sighs]
Oh, sweet Enya.

00:12:37.756 --> 00:12:40.259
I have never loved her
more than that evening.

00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:42.127
If you don't know who Enya is--
you've heard her.

00:12:42.127 --> 00:12:45.130
She's that sweet, like,
New Agey spa music,

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.499
like wizard music.

00:12:47.499 --> 00:12:48.800
Like, if elves were real,

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.602
Enya would be number one
on the elf charts

00:12:50.602 --> 00:12:52.004
week in and week out.

00:12:52.004 --> 00:12:53.205
Right?

00:12:53.205 --> 00:12:55.040
Like, to me
she's not even a real human.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.108
She was never born.

00:12:56.108 --> 00:12:57.709
She just, you know,
just sprang up

00:12:57.709 --> 00:13:00.679
from some mystic Irish pond
fully-formed--

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:03.815
[vocalizes]

00:13:03.815 --> 00:13:05.450
I'm like, "Please, Enya,

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:06.951
"turn these blood walls
into waterfalls.

00:13:06.951 --> 00:13:09.121
I need you now more than ever!"

00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:10.822
[laughter]

00:13:10.822 --> 00:13:13.159
And we laid down and listened
to her soothing rhythms,

00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:13.992
and it worked.

00:13:13.992 --> 00:13:15.861
We rode Enya through the peak,

00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:17.662
and things got a little bit
worse for a while,

00:13:17.662 --> 00:13:18.964
but then they got a lot better.

00:13:18.964 --> 00:13:20.532
Stu stopped talking
about the knife.

00:13:20.532 --> 00:13:21.800
I started thinking he was real.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.202
And we were able to stand up,

00:13:24.202 --> 00:13:26.538
and I looked out
at the skyline, the strip,

00:13:26.538 --> 00:13:27.906
and it was
the most beautiful skyline

00:13:27.906 --> 00:13:29.174
I've ever seen in my life.

00:13:29.174 --> 00:13:31.243
It was, like,
pulsating and trailing

00:13:31.243 --> 00:13:33.478
and just truly beautiful.

00:13:33.478 --> 00:13:35.047
And I remember thinking,
like, I knew

00:13:35.047 --> 00:13:37.349
that I shouldn't have done
any of the things

00:13:37.349 --> 00:13:38.817
I'd done so far that night.

00:13:38.817 --> 00:13:41.020
I knew that
I definitely shouldn't,

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.822
after all of that,
still go find coke and ecstasy,

00:13:43.822 --> 00:13:46.158
but I was going to.

00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:47.892
I mean, I--you know,
it's bad choices.

00:13:47.892 --> 00:13:49.728
You know, it's like,
I got responsibilities,

00:13:49.728 --> 00:13:51.897
got a mortgage,
I got two kids.

00:13:51.897 --> 00:13:53.365
Not with me that weekend.

00:13:53.365 --> 00:13:55.867
Let's not get too fucking
judge-y right now.

00:13:55.867 --> 00:13:58.269
They were safe away from me.

00:13:58.269 --> 00:14:00.005
But, you know,
I don't regret it, you know?

00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:01.573
It's, like, I finally
just did a night

00:14:01.573 --> 00:14:02.675
just truly for me.

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:03.908
I got my own story.

00:14:03.908 --> 00:14:05.744
You know,
I didn't see tiny horses,

00:14:05.744 --> 00:14:08.613
but I now definitely
know how it feels

00:14:08.613 --> 00:14:10.683
to have your mind
terribly altered.

00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:13.184
And if this story
that I've just told

00:14:13.184 --> 00:14:16.522
actually inspires you
to go on your own drug binge,

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:18.690
I got to say, uh...

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:21.359
No.
Don't fucking do it.

00:14:21.359 --> 00:14:23.895
It was terr--I was in
the Devil's brain

00:14:23.895 --> 00:14:26.030
for a good six hours.

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:28.032
Like, it was terrifying!
It was truly terr--

00:14:28.032 --> 00:14:29.234
I feel like I was one hit away

00:14:29.234 --> 00:14:30.869
from still wandering
the strip today,

00:14:30.869 --> 00:14:33.438
just like,
"7-6! 7, 7, 7, 7!

00:14:33.438 --> 00:14:35.740
"You can't eat pizza
that's not real!

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:39.110
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Okay!"

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:41.113
So close to being
that guy forever,

00:14:41.113 --> 00:14:44.282
but if you're gonna do it--
and I can't stop you--

00:14:44.282 --> 00:14:45.784
bring your own snacks.

00:14:45.784 --> 00:14:47.886
You don't want
to deal with force fields.

00:14:47.886 --> 00:14:49.621
Bring a little bit of Enya,

00:14:49.621 --> 00:14:51.456
and never take
the rest of the acid.

00:14:51.456 --> 00:14:53.058
Two is more than enough.

00:14:53.058 --> 00:14:55.493
Thank you, guys.
Be safe out there.
