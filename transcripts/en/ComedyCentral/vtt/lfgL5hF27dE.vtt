 go,

"Yeah, Tommy,
come with us, guy."

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:08.675
And they take him around
the corner, and the guy is

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:13.679
handcuffed to a chair, and they
go, take a couple rips at him,

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:14.947

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.663
- I wanna tell you a story
about Boston, Massachusetts.

00:01:37.663 --> 00:01:42.135
I started doin' stand-up comedy
there, and it is the place

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:45.004
to learn stand-up because it's
not--in Boston,

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:50.476
you don't perform for the crowd,
you perform against the crowd.

00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:53.546
There's a winner
and there's a loser.

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:55.882
And when you first start coming
up, it's, like,

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:58.451
you realize very quickly--it's
saloon comedy,

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:00.452
and it's guys from Southie.

00:02:00.452 --> 00:02:03.223
They go, "What are you--hey,
Sully, Fitzy,

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:05.457
"what are you doing tonight,
kid?

00:02:05.457 --> 00:02:08.461
Let's go downtown, heckle some
queers."

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:09.863
[laughter]

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:12.065
"Then we'll go down and beat up
some colored kids.

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:15.468
Come on, guy."

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:20.073
So they come out to these clubs,
and the comics are,

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:21.974
you know,
these are bad-ass dudes.

00:02:21.974 --> 00:02:24.977
And they--there was a lot of
drugs, and there was a club

00:02:24.977 --> 00:02:29.181
called "Stitches Comedy Club,"
and the comedians used to

00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:33.152
sit at the bar and do coke while
the watched each other.

00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:34.720
They'd get paid 100 bucks cash.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.689
They would immediately hand it
to a guy,

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.158
guy would give them an envelope
of coke, and they'd chop it up.

00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:42.162
And the club told them they
could no longer do coke

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:46.699
at the bar, and they had a
strike for four days.

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:51.170
The comedians went on strike
until they were allowed to snort

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.405
cocaine at the bar.

00:02:53.405 --> 00:02:55.741
And they had a guy--there was

00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:58.377
this one guy named Tommy, like,
the best comedian I've ever

00:02:58.377 --> 00:03:00.413
seen, this guy out of Boston.

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:02.882
I can't say his last name for
legal reasons,

00:03:02.882 --> 00:03:08.221
because this next story involves
him perhaps committing a felony.

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:12.024
He was on stage, and some
wise-ass from Southie,

00:03:12.024 --> 00:03:16.696
he goes back and forth with him.
Guy throws a bottle at Tommy.

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:18.731
Cops are in the back of the
club, 'cause the cops

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:22.301
would hang out at Stitches, and
so would the prostitutes,

00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:24.236
'cause it was in the Red Light
District.

00:03:24.236 --> 00:03:26.973
So the back of the room
was cops who were pretty much

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:29.875
on the take.
The mob owned the place,

00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:32.545
and so these cops happened to be
in the back,

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:35.448
and they grab the guy
who threw the bottle,

00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:37.250
and they take him out,
and I'm just thinkin'

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.252
they are throwing a beating on
this dude right now.

00:03:40.252 --> 00:03:42.421
But then, Tommy gets off stage

00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:44.724
and they go, "Yeah, Tommy,
come with us, guy."

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:46.626
And they take him around
the corner, and the guy is

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:51.764
handcuffed to a chair, and they
go, take a couple rips at him,

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:53.265
there you go.

00:03:53.265 --> 00:03:57.803
And he--Tommy just lights this
dude up--chest, stomach,

00:03:57.803 --> 00:04:00.439
and he goes, "Yeah, that felt
pretty good, thanks.

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:05.611
Now I'll go do a couple lines
off the bar and relax."

00:04:05.611 --> 00:04:08.581
So the first time I ever did
stand-up comedy was at Stitches

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:11.450
at this thing called--Sunday
nights, amateur night--

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.653
and they called it Comedy Hell.

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:17.757
That literally would be written
on the marquee: "Comedy Hell."

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:20.359
And it was hosted by a guy named
George MacDonald,

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.128
and he he would start the show
off by saying,

00:04:22.128 --> 00:04:25.931
"Welcome to Comedy Hell, where
the dreams of a handful of

00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:29.602
"road comics can soar as high as
the lights on Broadway

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:31.937
"or crash and burn in that fiery
pit

00:04:31.937 --> 00:04:35.641
known only as Comedy Hell."

00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:38.711
And I go up, and I remember my
first time, I followed a guy

00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:41.948
out of Providence who was
dressed as a clam.

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:43.782
[laughter]

00:04:43.782 --> 00:04:49.555
And he sang "Mannish Boy"--
"I'm a man."

00:04:49.555 --> 00:04:51.791
But it was "I'm a clam."
Get it?

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.459
'Cause he was dressed--I don't
know if I mentioned

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:55.361
he was dressed as a clam.

00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:57.396
And he kills, destroys.

00:04:57.396 --> 00:04:59.231
The place, like...
[roaring]

00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:01.801
And I'm in the back going like,
"Holy shit.

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:02.801
"I have no clam outfit.

00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:04.803
I'm fucked."

00:05:04.803 --> 00:05:08.140
And so I go up on stage, and I
tank it.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.144
I am eating it, and it's going
so poorly, I'm between jokes,

00:05:12.144 --> 00:05:15.982
and I overhear a woman in the
front row say to her husband,

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:18.017
"The poor bastard."

00:05:18.017 --> 00:05:20.652
[laughter]

00:05:20.652 --> 00:05:23.422
It was worse than being yelled
at, 'cause she didn't think

00:05:23.422 --> 00:05:24.990
I'd hear it.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.028
And so--so I work this club,
and I become a regular.

00:05:29.028 --> 00:05:31.430
And then I come in one
Sunday night, and there's

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.666
a Jewish singles night
that's in the club.

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:37.336
So they--all the--you know,
these rich kids from Boston

00:05:37.336 --> 00:05:39.171
have got the room for the night.

00:05:39.171 --> 00:05:41.607
And so the room is filled with
these kids, and then there's

00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:45.611
one table for four up front with
only one person at it,

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:47.546
and he's heckling everybody.

00:05:47.546 --> 00:05:51.016
And it turns out that he is this
guy from the Israeli Army

00:05:51.016 --> 00:05:54.754
who's a cabdriver, and he heard
"Jewish singles night,"

00:05:54.754 --> 00:05:59.691
and thought, "I am real Jew!
They will love me!"

00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:04.697
It's like, no, they love
the Jew-ish guy,

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:07.233
not the Jew-guy,

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:10.569
they want
the guy--the pre-med Jew-guy.

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:13.439
And so he's heckling everybody,
but here's the thing:

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:15.274
he's good.

00:06:15.274 --> 00:06:19.245
He's like a heckling savant.
He goes inside people's heads,

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:21.881
and he breaks them down.

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:23.382
There's a girl on stage,

00:06:23.382 --> 00:06:25.718
and she--and she's bombing
and he goes--he goes to her,

00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:28.788
"You have loneliness
in your eyes."

00:06:28.788 --> 00:06:30.123
[laughter]

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:33.926
[screams feebly]

00:06:33.926 --> 00:06:37.596
And another guy--another
guy gets up, and he says

00:06:37.596 --> 00:06:42.001
to this other guy,
"You lack basic confidence."

00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:45.738
You can't come back from that.
Once you're told that, it only

00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:49.776
gets worse as you try to say,
no, I do have confidence.

00:06:49.776 --> 00:06:51.977
And so I'm watching this,
and I'm like, "Shit."

00:06:51.977 --> 00:06:54.947
But I--what I've learned
from watching Boston comedy

00:06:54.947 --> 00:06:56.849
is you fight for that space.

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:58.817
You don't give
that shit away.

00:06:58.817 --> 00:07:02.621
So I'm ready, and I go on,
I'm three minutes into my act,

00:07:02.621 --> 00:07:06.926
and he goes,
"You are [bleep] man."

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:09.862
[laughter]

00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:13.199
Like I'm a superhero, like
I should have an F on my chest

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:18.036
and--and leap over dicks,
and so,

00:07:18.036 --> 00:07:20.038
and I--and it does make you
think, all right,

00:07:20.038 --> 00:07:22.641
if he was so on the money on
these other guys,

00:07:22.641 --> 00:07:25.044
is that
what people think about me,

00:07:25.044 --> 00:07:27.613
that I'm a [bleep] man?

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:30.849
And I'm angry, but I'm angry at
myself.

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:33.853
Maybe I should have--whatever,
so--

00:07:33.853 --> 00:07:36.722
so now, he calls me this, and so
then I just go right after him.

00:07:36.722 --> 00:07:38.324
I go, "All right, pal,
you want to get in my head?

00:07:38.324 --> 00:07:40.026
How 'bout I get in yours?"

00:07:40.026 --> 00:07:42.494
I go, "You"--this is the worst
thing you can say to a Jewish

00:07:42.494 --> 00:07:46.365
person--"You are a bad Jew.

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:48.968
You left Israel."

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:51.871
[laughter]

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:57.676
And he says to me,
he looks at me,

00:07:57.676 --> 00:08:01.146
and he says, "Nothing more."

00:08:01.146 --> 00:08:04.250
I said, "Really--nothin' more?"
I go, "I want you to think

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:08.887
"about this: every time you're
driving your cab down Com Ave,

00:08:08.887 --> 00:08:12.591
"and some ugly American gives
the 'Heil Hitler' sign,

00:08:12.591 --> 00:08:16.262
you pull over,
and you give them a ride."

00:08:16.262 --> 00:08:18.530
[laughter]

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:22.101
[laughs]
And the flames come out of his

00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:25.704
eyes, and he just jumps up
on stage, fist clenched,

00:08:25.704 --> 00:08:28.941
comes straight at me,
and so I've got the microphone,

00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:32.245
and it's, like, it's, like, this
kind of wire mesh,

00:08:32.245 --> 00:08:34.379
but I don't know if you remember
back in the '90s,

00:08:34.379 --> 00:08:36.849
they were--it was big steel.

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:40.519
It was like a--it was like a
"Game of Thrones" weapon.

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:43.022
And so I just take it,
and I just--

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:47.193
I crack him across the forehead,
and he is bleeding

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:49.394
all over his face.
And the audience is like,

00:08:49.394 --> 00:08:51.564
"What the fuck is happening?"

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:55.867
And then he comes at me, but now
he's this stocky dude from the

00:08:55.867 --> 00:08:59.739
Israeli Army, and he gets me--
he gets me into a headlock,

00:08:59.739 --> 00:09:03.875
and does some Krav Maga shit,
turns me around, and now my ass

00:09:03.875 --> 00:09:08.080
is towards the audience,
and they just see him pummeling

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.984
me while my ass goes in the air,
and then he starts

00:09:12.984 --> 00:09:17.056
spinning me like a helicopter.
My legs are flopping around

00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:20.226
the front row, tables are goin'
down, drinks are smashed,

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:23.729
I'm screaming, crowd's
screaming, bouncers--

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:27.232
bouncers are--they're out back
smokin' a joint.

00:09:27.232 --> 00:09:31.637
So it takes about three minutes
of beating before finally

00:09:31.637 --> 00:09:34.106
these guys come on stage,
and they grab this guy,

00:09:34.106 --> 00:09:36.008
who's name was Simpka, by the
way.

00:09:36.008 --> 00:09:38.410
I remember his name was Simpka,
'cause I remember telling him

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.979
that was the name of the village
idiot in Woody Allen's movie

00:09:40.979 --> 00:09:45.351
"Love and Death," so...so they
grab Simpka,

00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:46.953
and they throw him
out of the club.

00:09:46.953 --> 00:09:49.020
And I'm standing next to
the stage, and my neck is

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.757
on fire, and the club owner
comes over to me, and he goes

00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:53.292
like this, he goes,

00:09:53.292 --> 00:09:56.595
"All right, Fitzsimmons,
you got five minutes left."

00:09:56.595 --> 00:09:58.497
[laughter]

00:10:02.468 --> 00:10:04.870
So the MC--the show is now
stopped.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.607
The MC then reintroduces me,

00:10:08.607 --> 00:10:10.676
and I walk up on stage,

00:10:10.676 --> 00:10:13.979
and I get up there,
and the crowd jumps on its feet,

00:10:13.979 --> 00:10:17.149
my first standing ovation
of my life.

00:10:17.149 --> 00:10:20.119
[cheers and applause]

00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:23.188
Because--
'cause this is Boston.

00:10:23.188 --> 00:10:25.190
They'd rather see a fight
than a comedy show

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.360
any night of the week.
So they calm down, and I just

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:33.298
look around the crowd, and I go,
"All right, who's next?"

00:10:33.298 --> 00:10:35.500
All right, you guys have been
great, thank you very much.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.503
[dark electronic music]
