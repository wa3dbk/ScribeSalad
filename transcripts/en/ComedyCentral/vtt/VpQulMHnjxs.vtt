00:00:05.738 --> 00:00:10.676
that comes out of 75 different
people's shit rags...

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:12.579
It's kind of like,
a cross between, like,

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:16.349
when Ghostbusters cross streams,
and, uh, and in Indiana Jones

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.017
when they open up
the Ark of the Covenant

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:21.020
and all the Germans
are like, "Augh!"

<i>Mr. Ari Shaffir, everybody!</i>

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.432
Okay, this is a quick story
about how I understood

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:08.835
the lyrics to a song
for the first time.

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:11.470
Um, I--last year
I went to China.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.139
They told me two things--
I went for comedy--so they told

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:14.774
me two things before I went.
They gave me two rules.

00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:17.410
First rule, they said, no
bringing drugs in of any kind,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.179
because, they said,
it's punishable by death.

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:22.582
Yeah, and I was like, "fuck."

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:24.584
How much weed can I bring?

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:26.118
And they were like, "Ari!
None!"

00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:29.422
And I was like, "Counter offer.
Some!"

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:31.157
And they were like,
"Don't do it!"

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:32.692
I'm like, "I'm bringing
pot cookies on the plane,

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:33.693
you can't stop me."

00:01:33.693 --> 00:01:35.328
And I did.

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:37.030
And then we landed in Shanghai,
and I had like two pot cookies

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.831
left over so I just downed them
and had a great

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:40.766
first eight hours in Shanghai.

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:42.602
It was wonderful.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.436
Here's what they don't tell you:
it's not punishable by death.

00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:46.372
To traffic drugs
is punishable by death.

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:48.007
But if they just catch you
with them there,

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:49.108
it's very illegal.

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:50.376
It's still very illegal.

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:51.611
They'll kick you out
of the country.

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.012
That's what they'll do.

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:54.947
But I thought about it,
and it turns out that

00:01:54.947 --> 00:01:59.618
I don't live in China, so...

00:01:59.618 --> 00:02:01.620
Let's do it.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.990
So fun--three weeks in China
for comedy.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.358
Every once in a while,

00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:09.395
every once in a while,
comedy really pays off.

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:13.298
All you got to do is
live in poverty for nine years.

00:02:13.298 --> 00:02:17.637
And then you get your
free trip to China.

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:19.305
The cool thing is
is it's so illegal,

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:21.474
marijuana and all drugs there,
especially weed.

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:23.409
Once you do find weed there--
and I did find weed

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.144
'cause I'm a pothead
and that's what potheads do.

00:02:25.144 --> 00:02:27.246
We find weed.

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:29.382
When you do find weed,
the cops in China

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:33.185
do not know
what marijuana smells like.

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:34.520
Yeah, it's just not around.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.355
So this comedian in Beijing
showed me.

00:02:36.355 --> 00:02:38.223
He goes, "Dude, you can smoke
pot right in front of them."

00:02:38.223 --> 00:02:40.259
And he blew pot smoke
right at a cop.

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:42.328
I'm like,
"Are you out of your mind?"

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:43.763
He goes, "He's just thinks

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:47.333
you're smoking
tobacco for poor people."

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.669
And he's never smelled
that smell before.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:52.338
The only way they can catch you,
literally, the only way they can

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:55.607
catch you is if you learn
the mandarin words for

00:02:55.607 --> 00:02:59.712
"Officer,
we're smoking marijuana."

00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:03.282
And my advice is
just don't learn those words.

00:03:03.282 --> 00:03:06.218
They're not gonna help you.

00:03:06.218 --> 00:03:08.387
The other rule they gave me
is they said, um, they said,

00:03:08.387 --> 00:03:10.022
"No making fun of
the Chinese government."

00:03:10.022 --> 00:03:11.591
No making any jokes about
Chinese government.

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:13.192
And I was like,

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:14.694
"I don't have any jokes about
Chinese government."

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:16.262
Fucking, get over yourself,
Chinese government.

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:19.432
Nobody's talking about you.

00:03:19.432 --> 00:03:22.301
I've done comedy in Los Angeles,
New York, London, and Toronto,

00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:24.103
and I've never heard a single
comedian do any jokes

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:26.372
about Chinese government.

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:30.376
'Cause it's way too
self-absorbed.

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:32.645
Here was a cool thing about
China--well, everything.

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:34.781
Here was the terrible thing,
and about all of Asia,

00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:36.382
it's the toilet situation.

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:38.985
Yeah, so you know the seats
that go up and down

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:40.319
for men or women,
like that seat?

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.887
So they don't have that seat.

00:03:41.887 --> 00:03:43.990
And then, they also, they don't
have the whole toilet.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.758
They don't have any of it.

00:03:45.758 --> 00:03:47.126
They don't have toilets.

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:48.995
They don't believe in it
or something.

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:51.664
They just got holes
in the ground.

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:53.733
I'm--literally--it's like
a regular bathroom floor,

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:57.903
with tiles and everything, and
then where the toilet should be

00:03:57.903 --> 00:03:59.439
is just this hole.

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.240
And you're supposed to
go over it

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.076
like a college basketball coach

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:06.346
and you're just
supposed to squat.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.082
You're just supposed to squat

00:04:10.082 --> 00:04:14.820
and shit into this hole.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.088
And they don't tell you at all.

00:04:16.088 --> 00:04:17.590
They don't tell you
about any of it.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.525
They just expect you to know,
so--and by the way,

00:04:19.525 --> 00:04:21.860
in the hotels and stuff
they have regular toilets.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.462
It's just in the rural parts.

00:04:23.462 --> 00:04:26.131
So I was having a good time,
went to the Great Wall of China.

00:04:26.131 --> 00:04:28.267
I went to--I went to visit
the Imperial Palace.

00:04:28.267 --> 00:04:30.936
That was cool.
Nope--wait.

00:04:30.936 --> 00:04:34.306
That's Star Wars.

00:04:34.306 --> 00:04:36.542
"Imperial Palace," yeah,
that's for sure Star Wars, yeah.

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:37.776
What is--uh,
the Forbidden City!

00:04:37.776 --> 00:04:38.944
That's what it is.

00:04:38.944 --> 00:04:43.682
It's where the emperor lived.

00:04:43.682 --> 00:04:45.517
And so I went there,
and I was walking around,

00:04:45.517 --> 00:04:48.154
having a good time, and then
I got this important phone call

00:04:48.154 --> 00:04:49.788
from my friend diarrhea.

00:04:49.788 --> 00:04:53.026
And, um, that's when I really
started to hate China

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:56.529
because of this
toilet situation!

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:00.199
I run to the bathroom.

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.901
I'm just--sprint
to find the bathroom.

00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:03.502
I burst open the door.

00:05:03.502 --> 00:05:06.638
I'm telling you right now,
when you open up a stall door,

00:05:06.638 --> 00:05:09.642
and there's no toilet in there,

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:14.213
your mind can't even wrap its
head around what's happening.

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:17.149
It's like some sort of
optical illusion.

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:18.584
You know, it's like,
"Which line is longer?"

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:19.918
You're like, "I don't know.
Top one?"

00:05:19.918 --> 00:05:21.654
They're like, "No, same size!"

00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:22.989
And you're like, "Bullshit.

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:25.191
Measure again."

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.229
Regular bathroom work--tiles
and then just fucking hole.

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.832
It looks like a union guy
was coming to install a toilet

00:05:33.832 --> 00:05:35.167
and then he was like,
"Oh, lunchtime."

00:05:35.167 --> 00:05:37.937
And then he just fucking left.

00:05:37.937 --> 00:05:41.173
And they forgot
to get back to it.

00:05:41.173 --> 00:05:42.608
I burst open the door
and I was like,

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:45.778
"Wha--oh, this one
must be under repair."

00:05:45.778 --> 00:05:47.346
'Cause there's no toilet.

00:05:47.346 --> 00:05:48.881
That's the one thing
you look for in a toilet,

00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:50.716
is the toilet!

00:05:50.716 --> 00:05:52.585
That's 95% of the experience,

00:05:52.585 --> 00:05:55.521
is the actual toilet.

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:56.955
And I went to the next one,
I was like,

00:05:56.955 --> 00:05:58.290
"This one--are they all
under repair?

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.360
Am I just missing the sign?"

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.195
And then I remembered like,
"Oh, they told me about these.

00:06:03.195 --> 00:06:06.265
These fucking
shit-squat toilets."

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:07.533
That's what
you're supposed to do.

00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:09.034
And I reali--
right then I was like,

00:06:09.034 --> 00:06:11.237
"You know what,
I'm not doing this."

00:06:11.237 --> 00:06:15.107
I was born an American
and I'll die an American.

00:06:15.107 --> 00:06:16.975
And Americans sit down
when we shit.

00:06:16.975 --> 00:06:18.211
That's our thing.

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.412
When they say,
"USA, number one."

00:06:20.412 --> 00:06:21.814
They're talking about
number two.

00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:23.616
We're number one
in number two.

00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:25.384
And I was like,
"I'm out--I'm gone."

00:06:25.384 --> 00:06:27.719
So I left, I walked out,
and I got like two steps away

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:30.456
and then diarrhea was like,
"Of course, you're doing it."

00:06:30.456 --> 00:06:31.891
And I was like,
"Oh, yeah, diarrhea,

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:35.628
I forgot about you."

00:06:35.628 --> 00:06:38.664
It gives you a break sometimes,
diarrhea, you know?

00:06:38.664 --> 00:06:40.633
Diarrhea and the hiccups,
where you think they're gone

00:06:40.633 --> 00:06:44.937
for a minute,
but then they ain't gone.

00:06:44.937 --> 00:06:46.071
We're like,
"I got to shit so bad!

00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:47.840
"I got to--what?
No.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.342
"Oh, I might be okay.

00:06:49.342 --> 00:06:52.311
"Never have I had to shit
so bad!"

00:06:55.314 --> 00:06:57.749
So I go back into this--
into this stall,

00:06:57.749 --> 00:07:00.486
I close the door.

00:07:00.486 --> 00:07:02.588
Side note, by the way:
There's a trash can in there.

00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:05.424
And all these--don't fucking
look in the trash can because,

00:07:05.424 --> 00:07:07.093
uh, they don't flush
their toilet paper.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.161
They throw it away.
[audience groans]

00:07:09.161 --> 00:07:11.163
Yeah, and so they have
this trash can.

00:07:11.163 --> 00:07:13.266
You know the--the little
office trash cans

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:15.667
that, like, spin?
The top spins.

00:07:15.667 --> 00:07:17.035
You know, where it goes like--

00:07:17.035 --> 00:07:18.638
and you can like hit it down
and it like...

00:07:18.638 --> 00:07:21.107
I always try to hit it just
enough so it pops back up

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:23.475
and like go--
it's like a ride at Six Flags

00:07:23.475 --> 00:07:25.444
where, you know...

00:07:25.444 --> 00:07:27.279
And I open it up,
and the fucking smell

00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:32.151
that comes out of 75 different
people's shit rags...

00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:34.220
It's kind of like,
a cross between, like,

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.157
when Ghostbusters cross streams,
and, uh, and in Indiana Jones

00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:39.458
when they open up
the Ark of the Covenant

00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:43.729
and all the Germans
are like, "Augh!"

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:46.365
That's the smell
that comes out of this thing.

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:49.401
So I go into this fucking stall,
and I close the door.

00:07:49.401 --> 00:07:51.070
And I'm looking at this hole.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.537
Here's my first question:

00:07:52.537 --> 00:07:54.474
how far do you
take your pants down?

00:07:57.643 --> 00:08:01.480
I've done it, and I don't know
what the answer is.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.848
I have no idea.

00:08:02.848 --> 00:08:05.318
My first thought was like,
"Take them down to your ankles."

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:07.186
'Cause that's how
I'd normally do it.

00:08:07.186 --> 00:08:09.521
But then you can't do that
because here's the deal,

00:08:09.521 --> 00:08:11.723
I went down,
I took them down to my ankles,

00:08:11.723 --> 00:08:15.160
and then I, like, lined it up.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.196
And I'm like,
"Hold on a second."

00:08:23.435 --> 00:08:25.571
Like, "My asshole

00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:28.207
"is directly above my pants.

00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:35.247
"How am I not gonna
shit into my pants?

00:08:35.247 --> 00:08:37.383
"Unless a heavy gust
of wind comes by,

00:08:37.383 --> 00:08:41.087
I'm for sure gonna
shit into my pants."

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:45.957
And by the way,
I thought about it

00:08:45.957 --> 00:08:48.260
and I realized that
shitting into your pants

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.298
is actually a lot worse
than shitting in your pants.

00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:55.868
You'd think they'd be
the same thing, right?

00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:58.036
They're not the same thing.

00:08:58.036 --> 00:08:59.938
Shitting into your pants
is a holocaust

00:08:59.938 --> 00:09:02.941
compared to shitting
in your pants.

00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:05.278
'Cause if you
shit in your pants--

00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:07.746
and let's be honest,
a lot of us have done that,

00:09:07.746 --> 00:09:09.314
am I--am I not wrong?

00:09:09.314 --> 00:09:13.385
Like, I mean like
after ninth grade.

00:09:13.385 --> 00:09:15.154
It happens!

00:09:15.154 --> 00:09:18.790
Whatever, you're drinking
and you sneeze.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.893
That's not your fault.
That's just destiny.

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:23.262
That's just destiny.

00:09:25.397 --> 00:09:27.566
But what do you do
when that happens?

00:09:27.566 --> 00:09:29.268
I know what I do.

00:09:29.268 --> 00:09:30.902
I go home.

00:09:30.902 --> 00:09:33.238
I go home 'cause I'm a grown man
and I have shit in my pants

00:09:33.238 --> 00:09:35.007
and I can't be out
with other people.

00:09:35.007 --> 00:09:38.443
Just can't; I can't be out with
people with shit in my pants.

00:09:38.443 --> 00:09:40.079
I think about it, usually,
for a second, like,

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:41.647
"How much shit is in there?"
you know.

00:09:41.647 --> 00:09:43.649
Like it goes through my head,
and then I realize

00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:45.417
it doesn't matter,
it does not matter.

00:09:45.417 --> 00:09:47.253
There could be a shart
and it could be an unloading.

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:49.287
Either way, I'm a grown-up
and I have shit in my pants

00:09:49.287 --> 00:09:52.291
and I can't be out
with other people.

00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:53.959
No matter what I'm doing,
I could be in line at a movie,

00:09:53.959 --> 00:09:55.828
and I'll be like, "Hey,
you guys, that's so funny I--

00:09:55.828 --> 00:09:57.029
"Achoo!
Oh--

00:09:57.029 --> 00:09:58.464
I'll see you guys later."

00:09:58.464 --> 00:09:59.931
They're like, "What?
Where are you going?

00:09:59.931 --> 00:10:01.433
You wanted to see the movie."

00:10:01.433 --> 00:10:03.001
I'm like, "Yeah, I don't
want to see it anymore.

00:10:03.001 --> 00:10:04.003
You tell me how it was."

00:10:04.003 --> 00:10:07.773
And just fucking slowly...

00:10:07.773 --> 00:10:11.209
Just real slowly walk away.

00:10:11.209 --> 00:10:13.446
You don't want to jostle at all,
you know what I mean?

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:16.715
Just even steps.

00:10:16.715 --> 00:10:20.118
It's just gonna be a little bit
warmer than it was before.

00:10:20.118 --> 00:10:21.653
[audience groans]

00:10:21.653 --> 00:10:24.156
Yeah, that's if you
shit in your pants.

00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:28.727
But if you shit
<i> into</i>your pants,

00:10:28.727 --> 00:10:33.498
well then, you got to not
have those pants on.

00:10:33.498 --> 00:10:37.169
And then you got to
work up the courage...

00:10:39.705 --> 00:10:44.476
The suicide-like courage,

00:10:44.476 --> 00:10:49.214
to put the dirty diaper
back on yourself.

00:10:49.214 --> 00:10:52.150
And you know it's gonna
squoosh in there,

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.987
like you're making a mold
for a retainer.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.498
So anyway, it's not down
to your ankles, I don't think.

00:11:07.666 --> 00:11:09.935
And by the way, the one time
you want handicap bars

00:11:09.935 --> 00:11:11.836
to hold onto,

00:11:11.836 --> 00:11:13.104
they don't have handicap bars.

00:11:13.104 --> 00:11:14.573
They make you be
fucking Zen about it.

00:11:14.573 --> 00:11:18.177
And you just got to fucking
use your core.

00:11:19.578 --> 00:11:22.247
So I don't know
what the answer is.

00:11:22.247 --> 00:11:24.283
They don't help you in any way,
by the way.

00:11:24.283 --> 00:11:26.218
There's no diagram.

00:11:26.218 --> 00:11:28.586
There's no fucking help
along the way.

00:11:28.586 --> 00:11:30.523
Everything has a diagram on it!

00:11:32.891 --> 00:11:34.726
A hand dryer in a bathroom,

00:11:34.726 --> 00:11:36.528
fucking, a big machine that's
right next to the sink

00:11:36.528 --> 00:11:38.931
with one button
right in the middle.

00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:42.201
They're like, "No,
you'll never figure this out."

00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:43.769
So they put
a little cartoon on it

00:11:43.769 --> 00:11:45.905
of somebody pushing the button
and then somebody else

00:11:45.905 --> 00:11:47.239
drying their hands,

00:11:47.239 --> 00:11:50.409
or taking the bacon.

00:11:52.577 --> 00:11:55.380
That's a hand dryer.
Chinese shit-squat toilet?

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:59.718
Nah, figure it out.
It's intuitive.

00:11:59.718 --> 00:12:01.220
So I have no idea.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.955
I didn't know what to do.

00:12:02.955 --> 00:12:04.423
So here's what I did.

00:12:04.423 --> 00:12:05.891
I don't know if this
is right or wrong,

00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:10.562
but I took my shirt off.

00:12:10.562 --> 00:12:14.099
And you know the hook that's on
the door of the bathroom stalls?

00:12:14.099 --> 00:12:16.302
I just sort of hooked it
on there, and then I...

00:12:19.738 --> 00:12:22.908
[audience clapping]

00:12:23.742 --> 00:12:26.412
Lowered myself.

00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:28.914
And I just kind of
did it that way.

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:33.752
Feels like I shit right now.
[laughs]

00:12:33.752 --> 00:12:35.587
Yeah, I don't know if
that's the right answer or not,

00:12:35.587 --> 00:12:37.590
but that's what I did.
It seemed to work.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.592
It seemed to work, I mean,
I shit that way, so...

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:40.659
I felt good too.

00:12:40.659 --> 00:12:42.127
When I did it, I was like,
"Fuck, yeah.

00:12:42.127 --> 00:12:44.997
I live like
a real Chinese person."

00:12:47.432 --> 00:12:48.867
And I finished
and it feels great.

00:12:48.867 --> 00:12:50.535
When you shit like this,
by the way,

00:12:50.535 --> 00:12:53.505
it's aw--it clears you out
from the neck all the way down.

00:12:53.505 --> 00:12:55.307
It's like you're a new man.
Have you ever done it?

00:12:55.307 --> 00:12:57.976
It feels wonderful.
I do it now when I get home.

00:12:57.976 --> 00:13:00.112
I'll stand on my toilet seat,

00:13:00.112 --> 00:13:03.282
and then I'll fucking squat over
just for old time's sake.

00:13:03.282 --> 00:13:05.484
Like a POW who's got to sleep
underneath the bed

00:13:05.484 --> 00:13:07.520
once in a while.

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:16.996
And I did it, and I felt great.
I felt wonderful.

00:13:16.996 --> 00:13:18.463
I was very careful
not to let my balls

00:13:18.463 --> 00:13:21.399
touch the fu--surface
of the thing.

00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:23.835
'Cause I have--I have
very long balls,

00:13:23.835 --> 00:13:26.705
and they'll occasionally touch
the water level of a toilet.

00:13:26.705 --> 00:13:30.408
And if there's one place
I want my balls to never touch

00:13:30.408 --> 00:13:35.247
it's the inside of a
Chinese shit-squat toilet.

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:42.220
So anyway, I finish,
and I was like,

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.988
"Yeah, I did it,"
and I got up to wipe,

00:13:43.988 --> 00:13:45.490
and that's when I found out that

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.659
they don't offer toilet paper
in China.

00:13:47.659 --> 00:13:48.927
[audience groans]

00:13:48.927 --> 00:13:51.063
Yeah, they don't believe in it.

00:13:51.063 --> 00:13:54.667
I think their theory is:
you're the one shitting,

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:58.036
you clean it up.

00:13:58.036 --> 00:14:00.405
And that's not wrong!
It's not even that it's wrong!

00:14:00.405 --> 00:14:02.040
I'm just saying,
you should warn people.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.575
You should let people know.

00:14:03.575 --> 00:14:05.944
Like everyone who lands at the
airport with a round eye,

00:14:05.944 --> 00:14:07.379
they should give them
a pamphlet, and be like,

00:14:07.379 --> 00:14:11.217
"Here, you're
gonna have some problems."

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:17.222
Just figure it out.

00:14:17.222 --> 00:14:19.057
I'm standing there; I'm like,
"What am I gonna to do?"

00:14:19.057 --> 00:14:20.425
Well anyway, here's the deal.

00:14:20.425 --> 00:14:22.360
Five days before,
I landed in Shanghai,

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.229
it's the first place I got to,
I got there in the morning.

00:14:24.229 --> 00:14:26.732
Uh, I got to a club, the first
place I performed, this bar.

00:14:26.732 --> 00:14:28.900
And the club owner was like,
the bar owner was like, um,

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.202
"Oh, you just got here today?"

00:14:30.202 --> 00:14:31.569
And I was like, "Yeah."
And he goes, "Oh!"

00:14:31.569 --> 00:14:34.273
And he gave me
this packet of tissue paper.

00:14:34.273 --> 00:14:36.908
You know those little
travel Kleenex packs?

00:14:36.908 --> 00:14:38.210
And he gave me one of those,
and he goes,

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:41.547
"Here.
You'll need this."

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:44.583
It was like Gandalf had come up
to me or something, you know.

00:14:44.583 --> 00:14:46.718
And I was like,
"What will I need it for?"

00:14:46.718 --> 00:14:47.920
And he just goes,

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.222
"You'll know."

00:14:53.158 --> 00:14:54.626
And--but he was right, though.
He was right.

00:14:54.626 --> 00:14:56.161
I was standing there
at that fucking toilet

00:14:56.161 --> 00:14:57.429
at the--at Forbidden City,
and I was like,

00:14:57.429 --> 00:14:58.963
"What am I gonna--
[frantic mumbling]

00:14:58.963 --> 00:15:02.101
I got the toilet paper!"
[indistinct yelling]

00:15:08.406 --> 00:15:10.476
I was so excited.

00:15:10.476 --> 00:15:12.244
Here's the problem, though,
they don't give you

00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:14.612
unlimited tissue paper
in one of those things.

00:15:14.612 --> 00:15:16.748
They give you six.

00:15:16.748 --> 00:15:19.017
They give you six pieces
of tissue paper.

00:15:19.017 --> 00:15:22.454
With six, you can't
be an American anymore.

00:15:22.454 --> 00:15:25.523
You can't be like,
"Ah, four at a time.

00:15:25.523 --> 00:15:27.692
"I love to waste.

00:15:27.692 --> 00:15:29.494
"Most resources in the world.

00:15:29.494 --> 00:15:33.532
USA, USA!"

00:15:33.532 --> 00:15:35.166
Not with six.

00:15:35.166 --> 00:15:38.636
With six you got to budget.

00:15:38.636 --> 00:15:41.139
You got to make every one count.

00:15:41.139 --> 00:15:46.111
You got to start like
way from the bottom

00:15:46.111 --> 00:15:47.980
and then go all the way up

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:51.950
to about here.

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:54.119
Fold.

00:15:56.287 --> 00:15:58.957
Go back, start from the bottom.

00:15:58.957 --> 00:16:01.527
Now we're here.

00:16:01.527 --> 00:16:03.294
I kept doing that:
Start from the bottom, now here.

00:16:03.294 --> 00:16:04.997
Start from the bottom, now here.

00:16:04.997 --> 00:16:08.900
And that's when I realized what
that Drake song was all about.
