The letter "vav"
is also the number 6--

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.976
short top, long tail.

00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:07.440
Short top,
long tail.

00:00:07.473 --> 00:00:09.242
You could have here,
in Hebrew,

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:11.177
"666" on the can.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.446
And look at it this way.

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:16.182
Even if the "M"
was not the issue,

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:18.918
you cannot deny that
that is a cross.

00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:20.787
And what is witchcraft?

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.923
When the cross
goes upside down.

00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:27.260
Bottom's up.

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:30.263
And the devil laughs.
Hmm.

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:31.964
Eh, it's not like
Jesus Juice

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:33.933
has such a glowing
reputation either.

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.334
That crusader
is Christine,

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:36.702
and like every woman
in the world,

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:38.037
she might be reading
into things

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.372
a little too much.

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:41.607
My true fans know
this show is full

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.742
of hidden messages.

00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:44.844
Not much is known
about the devil,

00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:46.446
except that he is
the root of all evil,

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.581
has an awful goatee,
and wears Prada.

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:51.484
All signs point
to it being Kanye.

00:00:51.517 --> 00:00:52.919
God is like
your strict father

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:54.320
who is always
disappointed in you,

00:00:54.353 --> 00:00:56.289
and Satan is
your fun uncle

00:00:56.322 --> 00:01:00.093
who eventually rapes you
in the butt.

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:02.395
If Jesus wants to appeal
to a younger demo,

00:01:02.428 --> 00:01:03.796
he's gonna have
to start showing up

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.332
on something
cooler than toast.

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:08.501
Hell just seems like
the place to be.

00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:10.403
None of that
annoying harp music.

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:11.938
Did Lucifer fall
from Heaven,

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:13.005
or did he jump

00:01:13.038 --> 00:01:14.474
because he was tired
of playing bingo

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:17.176
with everyone's boring
dead grandparents?

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:19.612
And say what you will
about Satan worshippers,

00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:21.647
but nobody's ever been
blown to smithereens

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.883
just for drawing
a cartoon of him.

00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:25.418
I don't know
why Christine cares

00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:27.487
about saving
BMXers and gamers

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.188
from the clutches
of Monster Energy drink,

00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:30.523
but I'll fly her to L.A.

00:01:30.556 --> 00:01:33.126
as long as she promises
to say more crazy [bleep].

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.427
And if the devil
doesn't like it,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.661
he can sit on a tack,

you worked for Red Bull.

I don't.
I just got an amazing deal.

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:53.346
You wouldn't believe
how much a car depreciates

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:56.048
when you weld a giant soda can
to the top of it.

00:01:56.081 --> 00:01:57.416
I'd believe it.

Do you know what the biggest
problem I had with your video?

00:02:07.593 --> 00:02:10.363

[snorts]
Okay.

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:13.132
Your delivery
was polished.

00:02:13.165 --> 00:02:15.835
It made sense to even people
that probably thought

00:02:15.868 --> 00:02:16.969
you were a nut job.

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:18.271
I apologize,
but there are some.

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:19.372
It was, yeah.

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:20.773

(Daniel)
It was just
a perfect punctuation.

00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:27.647
God gave me that gift

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.950
to be able to present it
in a way that was perfect.

00:02:30.983 --> 00:02:32.818

where you're gonna
go viral ."

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:36.489
There was a spiritual
agenda here.

00:02:36.522 --> 00:02:37.890
And it goes right back
to the Bible.

00:02:37.923 --> 00:02:39.792
It's not flesh and blood
we war against.

00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:41.561
It's the principalities
of the air,

familiar with that--

00:02:43.128 --> 00:02:44.463

As a good Christian,

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:50.136
what energy drink
should I be drinking?

- Ugh.

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:54.840
I think Christians
should only drink lemonade.

00:02:54.873 --> 00:02:56.242
Well, of course,
lemonade's good.

00:02:56.275 --> 00:02:57.243
It's nice.

It's not.

00:03:09.922 --> 00:03:12.625
Things like your show--

You're putting
a lot on me.

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:14.961
Yeah, I am,
because you are--

You ever seen South Park?

00:03:16.395 --> 00:03:17.430
You're right in
with that.

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:18.998
But South Park 
is way worse.

Will you get to go?

The rapture is not gonna come
while I'm still alive.

00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:29.542
According to the Bible,
it will.

Boom.

Are you worried that

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:37.917
the sales of
Monster Energy drink?

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.352
No,
but if the world wants

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:40.820
to increase it,
go ahead.

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:43.623
I would be interested to hear
what first quarter sales are.

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:44.824
Yeah.

00:03:44.857 --> 00:03:47.760
My biggest fear is that
I speak to someone

and I do not share
the gospel with them

00:03:50.062 --> 00:03:51.197
and they go
to hell for it.

is monsters.

Yes, I have.

00:03:59.938 --> 00:04:02.375
I did when I first started
doing the presentation.

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:03.943
I figured I had to know
a little bit

00:04:03.976 --> 00:04:06.345
of what I am
talking about.

00:04:06.378 --> 00:04:07.513
I have never tried it.

00:04:07.546 --> 00:04:08.748
- Okay.
- For the record.

00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:10.616
There's no question that

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:13.686
people that buy
this stuff regularly

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:14.987
will not succeed
in life.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.024
Do you think the head CEO
of a company is,

00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:20.626
like, calling his
personal assistant,

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:24.964
"Hey, I'm out of Monster Energy
drink in here."

00:04:24.997 --> 00:04:26.799
No, he's asking
for some tea.

00:04:26.832 --> 00:04:28.134
All right.

Oh, whoa!

00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:30.936
I'll be honest with you--
that was cool.

Okay, now--

00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:33.072
Was that the beast?

00:04:33.105 --> 00:04:34.206
Can you see the connection

00:04:34.239 --> 00:04:35.441
when you actually
put the cross

00:04:35.474 --> 00:04:36.442

00:04:36.475 --> 00:04:37.777
666.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.279
There is no doubt that you are
accurate about the 666,

00:04:40.312 --> 00:04:42.214
but, I mean, they did it
because they're ad execs,

00:04:42.247 --> 00:04:43.282
and they're a bunch of geeks

00:04:43.315 --> 00:04:44.684
sitting around,
trying to be cool.

00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:47.620
Or, if God uses people
in product, does also Satan?

00:04:47.653 --> 00:04:48.754
He doesn't do that.

00:04:48.787 --> 00:04:51.857
Here, I don't want us
to have to actually--

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.125
Now what are you gonna do?

00:04:53.158 --> 00:04:55.127
Well, we--I don't want us
to swallow this garbage.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.363

I need another set of eyes

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:18.384
to make sure there's nothing
subtly offensive

00:05:18.417 --> 00:05:20.553
or sacrilegious about

I get it.

00:05:30.195 --> 00:05:31.430

00:05:31.463 --> 00:05:32.965
This is a winner.

00:05:32.998 --> 00:05:34.867
But energy drinks
are not milk.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.202

your concept.

00:05:36.235 --> 00:05:38.070
- Muslim Milk.

you can say that
there's anything...

- Offensive.
- Sacrilegious about--

00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:03.929
Oh, no, there's
definitely gonna be

about it.

"TOSH" on it.

00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:40.232
Look at the acronym.
TOSH.

00:06:40.265 --> 00:06:42.067
Taking Others
Straight to Hell.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.235
Why do you keep
saying that?

00:06:43.268 --> 00:06:44.637
Because it is true.

00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:52.211
Introducing Satan's Semen.

00:06:52.244 --> 00:06:55.080
Coat your throat with Beelzebub.

00:06:55.113 --> 00:06:56.916
(man)
Now with unholy levels
of caffeine

00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:59.051
and throbbing veins
for better grip.

00:06:59.084 --> 00:07:00.853
Served exclusively
on United Airlines

00:07:00.886 --> 00:07:03.255
and at participating
Chipotle locations.

00:07:03.288 --> 00:07:05.124
Currently banned
in the Bible Belt.

00:07:05.157 --> 00:07:07.426
[demonic laughter]

00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:10.062
[gags]

00:07:10.095 --> 00:07:12.164
That's real.

00:07:12.197 --> 00:07:14.767
The devil is a lie!

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.335
That was recorded
a month ago,

00:07:16.368 --> 00:07:18.938
and all we ask of anyone
who comes on this show is,

00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:21.207
don't do anything insane
before it airs.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.610
So what did she do
the day after she left here?

00:07:24.643 --> 00:07:30.516
Celebrate the seventh
Texas Muslim Capitol Day.

00:07:30.549 --> 00:07:32.151
We are honored--

00:07:32.184 --> 00:07:35.121
[cheers and applause]
- Thank you.

00:07:38.824 --> 00:07:42.027
I proclaim the name
of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.297
over the capital
of Texas.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.000
I stand against Islam!

00:07:48.033 --> 00:07:51.303
Islam will never dominate
the United States,

00:07:51.336 --> 00:07:55.241
and by the grace of God,
it will not dominate Texas!

00:07:55.274 --> 00:07:57.910
You are officially
unredeemed!
