00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:02.602
- Do I have a drink right now?

00:00:02.602 --> 00:00:06.606
I'm only allowed one with
my antibiotics I'm on.

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.244
I'm about to film this
stand-up for my show.

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:12.746
This isn't like a polished set

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:14.347
like I would want to
do for my special,

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:15.815
but I'm proud of where it is.

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:19.786 align:start size:97% position:3%
And hopefully these people
will like hearing about semen.

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:24.124
We're filming the
stand-up tonight.

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:25.625 line:0%
Do you want to hear
some of my jokes?

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:28.161 line:0%
Well give me $10,000.

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.696
Do you think Jim
Norton or Attell

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:32.499 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
are having two
fittings in one day?

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:34.868
Making sure that, like,
their ass looks okay

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.803
so they can tell a fucking joke.

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:38.938
I can only be as pretty
as I can fucking be.

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:40.573
Look at this, this is
what I'm working with.

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:42.075
Like, I know what I look like.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:43.510 align:start size:97% position:3%
Like, you'd bang me but
you wouldn't blog about it.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.811 align:start size:81% position:19%
I get it.
(audience laughs)

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:47.013
I wish that everybody
knew how important

00:00:47.013 --> 00:00:49.149 align:start size:84% position:16%
this stand-up portion
was to the show.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.051
This is why I have a TV show.

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:55.855 line:0%
So we're headed to West Nyack
to perform at Levity Live.

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:57.390 align:start size:81% position:19%
I've just been
going on the road,

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.392
getting ready for the stand-up
that's gonna be on the show.

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:01.661 align:start size:97% position:3%
Nothing makes you as strong
as going on the road.

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:02.929
We tried to have sex.

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.731
It did not happen at all.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:06.099
My heart was in it.

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:07.567
This lady was not.

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:09.069
(audience laughs)

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:10.737 line:0%
- Tonight, the culmination
of Amy workshopping material

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:12.572 line:0%
and working at the clubs.

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:14.240 align:start size:84% position:16%
- And he went, like,
right down on me,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.642
because he was raised well.

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:17.844
(audience laughs)

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:20.613 align:start size:84% position:16%
- She can say filthy,
obscene things

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:22.248
but in the sweetest manner.

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:24.751 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I just think you should
consider, you know,

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:28.922
terminating the pregnancy
if it was rape or incest

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:30.090
or with a redhead.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.724 align:start size:88% position:13%
Like, the
unforgivables, you know?

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.259
(audience laughs)

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.761
The unacceptables.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.231 line:0%
When I'm done with my set,

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:41.701 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
and the last thing that
I'll talk about is,

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:44.170
like, if I were to
have a gaping pussy

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.040
from having sex with a guy
with too big of a penis,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.777
and then my NuvaRing would
fall out, and that like,

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.579
I'd be looking for it
on the subway platform

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.981
and a rat would run by
wearing it like a crown.

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:56.316
And then I'll take questions.

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:57.317
- [Curtis] Okay.

00:01:57.317 --> 00:02:00.820
(raucous laughter)

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.722 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh man, this is
kinda disappointing.

00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:04.757
This question is, "How many
fingers am I holding up?"

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:06.926 align:start size:84% position:16%
But I just read, like,
how many fingers,

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:08.828 align:start size:94% position:6%
and I was like, "I've
got this, I've got this!"

00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:11.097
(audience laughs)

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:12.565 align:start size:84% position:16%
- It's just been
absolutely incredible

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:15.902
how much new material she's
been able to generate in

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:17.403
A) a short amount of time,

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:19.405
and B) probably one of the
busiest periods of her life.

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:20.673 line:0%
- [Man] Alright, man,

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:21.941 line:0%
y'all ready for this
show, man, to start?

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:22.942 line:0%
Come on, damn it!

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:23.877
(audience applauds)

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:25.311
- Thank you, this hits the spot.

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.580 align:start size:88% position:13%
Thank you so much,
I'll see you very soon.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.152
- [Man] Please put your hands
together for Miss Amy Schumer.

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:34.988
(audience cheers)

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:43.563
- Aw, you guys, thank you
so much for coming out.

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:45.265
This is a big deal for me.

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:46.533
- [Man In Crowd] Amy!

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:49.302
- Thank you, but are
you too hot to clap?

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:52.405
(intense rock music)

00:02:56.776 --> 00:02:58.278 align:start size:88% position:13%
Like, who's the biggest
slut of you guys?

00:02:58.278 --> 00:02:59.512
Like which one?

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:00.413 align:start size:81% position:19%
Oh, they right
away point to her!

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:02.582
They're like boom!

00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:03.917
Boom!

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:05.151
(audience laughs)

00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:05.985
Good for you.

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:07.520
What's your name?

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.888
Dana, yes it is.

00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:10.623
She's like Dana, huh?

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.464
Are these tickets to this?

00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:20.667 align:start size:81% position:19%
(audience laughs)
Oh, cool.

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:22.402
He goes, "Yeah!"

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:24.070
General admission, it's
like embarrassing to see

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.740 align:start position:0%
a ticket for yourself that
says zero point zero zero zero.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.577
(audience laughs)

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:33.613
It's emotional.

00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:34.847
This is the show of
my dreams to make,

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:37.150
and I feel really lucky
that I got to make it.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.718
(audience cheers)

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:39.552
Thank you.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.095
Mountain.

00:03:49.095 --> 00:03:52.365
They almost called that
show Martin, Mountain,

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:53.600
and then at the last second.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.169
See, if you watch the webseries,

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.939 align:start size:94% position:6%
this is the kind of
riffing you're gonna get.
