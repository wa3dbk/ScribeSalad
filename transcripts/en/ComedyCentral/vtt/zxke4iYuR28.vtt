00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:12.544
Yeah, the terrorist in me
ain't gonna stand for that shit.

00:00:12.544 --> 00:00:14.747
This is my first time
terrorizing anyone,

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:16.015
I'm going balls to the wall.

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:19.585

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:21.221

He's probably the best thing

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:48.047
to ever come out
of Staten Island, you guys.

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:49.915
[cheers and applause]

00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:52.618
[laughs]

00:00:52.618 --> 00:00:55.388
From the show
"Impractical Jokers" on TruTV,

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:57.923
my friend and yours,
Mr. Sal Vulcano!

00:00:57.923 --> 00:01:00.660
<i> [cheers and applause]</i>

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:03.296
- I want to tell you guys
about a time

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:04.463
I took a weed edible.

00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:06.099
It's a story of the first...

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:08.935
and the last time
that I saw Stacy Wu.

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:10.136
Okay?
- Whoo!

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:12.104
So I g--
[laughter]

00:01:12.104 --> 00:01:14.441
- Quiet down, step children.

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:15.474
No, I'm kidding.

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:17.276
I got a package
delivered to my house.

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:19.345
It was addressed to Stacy Wu.
I don't know Stacy Wu.

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:21.080
Never heard of her.
Never met her.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.448
But the address
was my address.

00:01:22.448 --> 00:01:24.250
So I figure,
okay, it's a mistake.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.085
I'll toss it to the side.
I'll deal with it later.

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:29.589
Weekend comes,
I take a weed edible.

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:31.657
Later that night I'm chilling,
I'm like, all right,

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:33.126
let me open up this package,

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:35.929
see if there's a contact info.
for this Stacy,

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.431
see if I can let her know
that I have her stuff.

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:40.600
So I open up the package.
Sure enough...

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.802
her address is in there--
her email address.

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:44.604
And it is a pair of pants,

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:48.374
women's, six 6,
sateen dress pants,

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:50.944
black, from Ann Taylor Loft.

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:53.212
So I'm like, I'm gonna
get Stacy her pants back.

00:01:53.212 --> 00:01:56.815
So I open up my email and I type
her email address in.

00:01:56.815 --> 00:01:58.718
I write right in the subject,

00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:00.153
"I have your pants."

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:02.188
[laughter]

00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:07.193
And I'm about to tell her,
you know, "Just drop me a line.

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:09.295
I'll get 'em to you,"
you know?

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:10.897
But then I thought,

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:14.300
"Ohh, wouldn't it be great

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.570
if I wrote her
a ransom note for them?"

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.141
It's the weed edible.
That's what happens.

00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:23.509
I'm like, "Of course
it would be great."

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:27.313
So that's what people do.
[laughs]

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:28.480
They write ransom notes.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.015
So I get out my
"Entertainment Weeklies"

00:02:30.015 --> 00:02:31.684
and just start chopping away.

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:33.152
Five hours.

00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:36.589 line:91%
For five hours, I cut letters
out of years' worth of

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:39.091
"Entertainment Weekly"
magazines.

00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:40.893
It was a work of art.

00:02:40.893 --> 00:02:45.531
And I taped the pages
and I scanned it into the email.

00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:48.034
And I'm about to hit send
and I'm like,

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:51.670
"Ah! This is not how
ransom notes work.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.873
"I have to send her
a picture of the pants,

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:57.376
prove I got them shits."

00:02:57.376 --> 00:03:00.413
And then I thought,
"Oh...

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:02.247
"wouldn't it be great...

00:03:02.247 --> 00:03:06.019
if I was in them?"

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.189
'Course it would.
That's why I'm here. Tonight.

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.191
So I get myself
in these pants.

00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:14.360
It took minutes.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.196
That's a long time
to get into pants.

00:03:17.196 --> 00:03:19.132
But I got this body

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:22.535
into those size 6 sateens.

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:24.570
And I take some pictures
of myself and I realize

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.372
I'm bare-chested,
and I'm like,

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:29.241
"Ah, that's kinda weird."

00:03:29.241 --> 00:03:32.378
I don't want her to get
the wrong idea

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:34.714
about this ransom note.

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:38.383
I want this ransom note
to be on the up and up.

00:03:38.383 --> 00:03:40.553
So I put on a shirt, a tie,
a jacket, shoes.

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:42.822
I really classed
this ransom note up.

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:44.223
I really did.

00:03:44.223 --> 00:03:45.891
I'm about to take
a picture of myself

00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:49.795
in them and I said,
"Oh...

00:03:49.795 --> 00:03:51.263
"this is not how this works.

00:03:51.263 --> 00:03:54.233
She can't see my face."

00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:56.736
So I said,
"Wouldn't it be great

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:58.604
if I was in a ski mask?"

00:03:58.604 --> 00:04:01.106
[laughs]

00:04:01.106 --> 00:04:02.574
I know.

00:04:02.574 --> 00:04:04.910
It's awesome.
[laughs]

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.178
So I put on a ski mask.

00:04:06.178 --> 00:04:08.147
I take a bunch of pictures
of myself.

00:04:08.147 --> 00:04:10.249
I upload this all
into the email,

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:15.087
I hit send,
and I am so proud of myself

00:04:15.087 --> 00:04:17.689
because this is what life is.

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:19.658
Okay? A lot of you don't know
how to live.

00:04:19.658 --> 00:04:21.193
People don't know
how to live.

00:04:21.193 --> 00:04:22.762
I figured it out.

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:26.432
This is it.
So I just go to bed.

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:30.002
I dream great dreams.

00:04:30.002 --> 00:04:31.470
And I wake up on the morning--

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.273
It's like Christmas morning
to me.

00:04:34.273 --> 00:04:37.309
I run straight to my laptop
and I open it up

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:40.379
to see if Stacy Wu
has received

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:43.282
my correspondence

00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:44.950
and if she wrote back.
And she did.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.621
And I'm going to read you now
what she wrote back to me.

00:04:50.322 --> 00:04:52.825
"This is really creepy.

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:56.062
"A man sending pictures
wearing women's pants

00:04:56.062 --> 00:04:57.797
"and a ski mask?

00:04:57.797 --> 00:05:00.332
"I'm filing a complaint
with UPS.

00:05:00.332 --> 00:05:03.702
"I'll have the authorities
track you down

00:05:03.702 --> 00:05:06.071
"to where the pants
were delivered

00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:08.974
"and charge you with robbery

00:05:08.974 --> 00:05:11.911
and possible terrorism."

00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:14.480
[laughter]

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.249
I know!
[laughs]

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:18.017
I did not--I never
in my wildest dreams

00:05:18.017 --> 00:05:19.819
I'd think this was
"possible terrorism."

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.821
I thought this was
gonna be a hoot.

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:25.023
Like, a little light hoot,
not a possible terror.

00:05:25.023 --> 00:05:26.392 align:start size:56% position:44%
- That's terrible.

00:05:26.392 --> 00:05:29.095
- She goes on.
"They look for people like you,

00:05:29.095 --> 00:05:31.230
you son of a bitch."

00:05:33.198 --> 00:05:34.934
[chuckling]

00:05:34.934 --> 00:05:38.003
"I don't know who you are.
I don't know what you want.

00:05:38.003 --> 00:05:39.505
"This truly isn't funny,

00:05:39.505 --> 00:05:41.273
"and if you're looking for
peanut butter,

00:05:41.273 --> 00:05:43.508
I don't have any!"

00:05:43.508 --> 00:05:47.413
I'll get to that
in a second.

00:05:47.413 --> 00:05:50.249
I'm in over my head.
I'm in over my head.

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:52.185
It's obvious.
I should have said,

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:55.554
"This is a joke!
Take your pants!"

00:05:55.554 --> 00:05:58.390
But instead, I said...

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.027
"Do you think
I'm playing games?"

00:06:02.027 --> 00:06:06.365
Yeah! The terrorist in me
ain't gonna stand for that shit!

00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:08.300
This is my first time
terrorizing anyone.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.637
I'm going balls to the wall,
okay?

00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:14.440
I do everything I do
to the best of my ability.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.408
If I'm possibly
terrorizing you,

00:06:16.408 --> 00:06:19.912
look the fuck out.

00:06:19.912 --> 00:06:23.215
And I just sent her
a bunch more photos, okay?

00:06:23.215 --> 00:06:24.883
So then I step away
from the laptop.

00:06:24.883 --> 00:06:26.885
It was the first thing I did
that day and did nothing else,

00:06:26.885 --> 00:06:28.621
so I went to my phone
for the first time

00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:30.322
and opened it up,
and I had a text

00:06:30.322 --> 00:06:32.891
from the night before
at 10:32 pm.

00:06:32.891 --> 00:06:36.328
This is before I dabbled
with any of this other stuff.

00:06:36.328 --> 00:06:39.065
And the text
is from my landlord Stanley

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:40.566
who lives right below me.

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:43.435
And this is what his text said.
He said, "Hey, buddy,

00:06:43.435 --> 00:06:46.605
"was there a package
delivered last Monday

00:06:46.605 --> 00:06:48.407
"and left on your porch?

00:06:48.407 --> 00:06:51.577
It's for my girlfriend Stacy."

00:06:51.577 --> 00:06:54.747
[audience groans]

00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:58.517
I felt the same way.

00:06:58.517 --> 00:07:00.986
Felt the same, exact way.

00:07:00.986 --> 00:07:03.255
I'm like, ha ha ha ha...

00:07:03.255 --> 00:07:06.291
there's no way
he's finding out about this.

00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:07.459
I don't care
what I have to do.

00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:08.927
I'm getting rid of the pants.

00:07:08.927 --> 00:07:10.663
I'll take the fucking pants
down to a ravine

00:07:10.663 --> 00:07:13.598
and fuckin' shoot 'em.

00:07:13.598 --> 00:07:16.335
However you get rid of stuff.

00:07:16.335 --> 00:07:18.103
I'm gonna do it.
And then I realized...

00:07:18.103 --> 00:07:23.775
oh, man, I sent her the note
from my email address.

00:07:23.775 --> 00:07:26.111
It's got my first, last,
and two middle names

00:07:26.111 --> 00:07:27.880
in the type.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.951
So I have to confess.
I have to come clean to Stan.

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:34.619
So I call him on the phone.
I'm like, "Stan, it's Sal.

00:07:34.619 --> 00:07:36.622
"As a matter of fact,
I do have the pants,

00:07:36.622 --> 00:07:38.390
"and if you wanna meet me
on the side of the house,

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:41.393
I'll give 'em to you.
Uh, also..."

00:07:41.393 --> 00:07:44.130
[laughter]

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.733
"I gotta tell you something.
Gotta tell you something."

00:07:47.733 --> 00:07:49.034
So he meets me
on the side of the house.

00:07:49.034 --> 00:07:50.736
He's like, "Oh, Sal,
thanks so much."

00:07:50.736 --> 00:07:52.571
I'm like, "Stan, no problem.
I even emailed her

00:07:52.571 --> 00:07:53.973
and let her know I had 'em."
He's like, "You're the best.

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:56.475
I'm like, "Hold on.

00:07:56.475 --> 00:07:59.545
Just hold on.
Just let me finish."

00:07:59.545 --> 00:08:04.983
I said, "Stan, somewhere
in there I felt it apropos...

00:08:04.983 --> 00:08:08.688
to also write her
a ransom note for them."

00:08:08.688 --> 00:08:10.022
He's like,
"What are you talking about?

00:08:10.022 --> 00:08:13.692
I'm like, "It's exactly
what you think."

00:08:13.692 --> 00:08:15.928
And I knew...
[laughs]

00:08:15.928 --> 00:08:18.564
I knew he was gonna ask me,
"Well, what did it say?"

00:08:18.564 --> 00:08:20.866
And so I brought the ransom note
to the side of the house

00:08:20.866 --> 00:08:23.335
to read to him right there
in the driveway.

00:08:23.335 --> 00:08:25.371
And I also brought it tonight.

00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:28.508
[cheers and applause]

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:34.213
[laughter]

00:08:34.213 --> 00:08:36.882
- This is it.
This is living.

00:08:36.882 --> 00:08:40.453 line:0%
It says, "Hello.
I have your pants."

00:08:41.887 --> 00:08:45.858
You guys?
I'll do it every five pages.

00:08:45.858 --> 00:08:47.192
"Hello. I have your pants.

00:08:47.192 --> 00:08:50.596
Check the picture for proof."
- Oh, wow!

00:08:50.596 --> 00:08:54.467
- We agree that the ransom note
should have ended there.

00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:57.537
Allow me to read you
the next 18 pages.

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:03.809
"In order to
get them back safely,

00:09:03.809 --> 00:09:08.581
"I am going to need
one 15-ounce jar

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:13.886
"of Skippy all-natural
Honey Peanut Butter...

00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:15.921
smooth."

00:09:15.921 --> 00:09:20.393
This is the weed edible talking.
I'm allergic to peanut butter.

00:09:23.095 --> 00:09:25.764
"I know what you're thinking.
'Peanut butter'?

00:09:25.764 --> 00:09:28.133
"Yeah. Peanut butter.

00:09:28.133 --> 00:09:32.471
So what?
This is about<i> me</i>right now."

00:09:33.439 --> 00:09:37.242
[laughter]

00:09:37.242 --> 00:09:39.745
Bitch.

00:09:39.745 --> 00:09:44.283
"This really isn't the time
for you to be judging me

00:09:44.283 --> 00:09:46.018
"about the peanut butter.

00:09:46.018 --> 00:09:48.654
I have your pants."

00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:54.793
"To be honest,
I felt silly

00:09:54.793 --> 00:09:57.629
asking for the peanut butter,

00:09:57.629 --> 00:10:00.032
"but I gathered myself,
and here we are.

00:10:00.032 --> 00:10:03.436
[laughter]

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:05.704
"Peanut butter is delicious,
and I'm out of it."

00:10:05.704 --> 00:10:08.107
I'm now
explaining myself to her

00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:11.777
for no good reason.

00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:14.947
"I could have asked for
a lot worse than peanut butter."

00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:18.117
I don't even know
what the implication was there.

00:10:18.117 --> 00:10:20.352
I don't need
to question myself.

00:10:20.352 --> 00:10:23.789
"So let's just move on.

00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:27.159
Put the peanut butter
in an unmarked duffle..."

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:28.994
[laughter]

00:10:28.994 --> 00:10:31.530
Clearly, all of my
knowledge of ransom notes

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.131
has come from the movies.

00:10:33.131 --> 00:10:34.800
I don't even know
what an unmarked duffle is.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.402
I--What is a--
What is a marked duffle?

00:10:37.402 --> 00:10:39.538
What is a marked--
I don't know, but don't send

00:10:39.538 --> 00:10:42.675
that shit to me
in a fucking marked duffle.

00:10:42.675 --> 00:10:46.545
"Deliver to my home
no later than noon

00:10:46.545 --> 00:10:48.681
"on Friday.

00:10:48.681 --> 00:10:51.383
"Every day...

00:10:51.383 --> 00:10:55.487
"that I do not receive

00:10:55.487 --> 00:10:59.391
"the peanut butter...

00:10:59.391 --> 00:11:01.694
"I will wear your pants...

00:11:01.694 --> 00:11:03.662
[laughter]

00:11:03.662 --> 00:11:08.334
"With a different cute top."

00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:11.103
She's giving me no choice.

00:11:11.103 --> 00:11:13.238
"Your move.

00:11:13.238 --> 00:11:15.607
PP forever."

00:11:15.607 --> 00:11:18.744
[applause]

00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:24.417
That's nice of you.
That's how I felt.

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:26.385
I was elated.

00:11:26.385 --> 00:11:29.721
I said to him,
"I also, uh--

00:11:29.721 --> 00:11:32.858
"I also sent her a photo
to prove I had 'em."

00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:34.960
And he was like...

00:11:37.063 --> 00:11:38.363
"Let me see it."

00:11:38.363 --> 00:11:40.599
And I showed him on my phone,

00:11:40.599 --> 00:11:43.869
but for you guys,
I went to Kinkos.

00:11:45.571 --> 00:11:47.540
You're gonna wanna
look at that.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.710
[crowd whooing]

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.283
I call that terrorist casual.

00:11:58.283 --> 00:12:01.153
Yeah, I got your pants,
but really, it's no biggie.

00:12:02.655 --> 00:12:05.457
Just what I do.

00:12:05.457 --> 00:12:07.593
It was my first terrorizing.

00:12:07.593 --> 00:12:09.228
I kept it light.

00:12:13.398 --> 00:12:18.404
He said,
"What did she say?"

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:20.238
I said, "She said...

00:12:20.238 --> 00:12:23.742
she was gonna call
the authorities...

00:12:23.742 --> 00:12:26.579
and charge me with robbery

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:29.448
and terrorism.

00:12:29.448 --> 00:12:32.450
He said, "Holy shit!

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.420
What did you say?"

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.355
And I said...

00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:43.595
I said, "Oh, I just said, 'Do
you think I'm playing games?'

00:12:43.595 --> 00:12:46.098
"and then I just
fired off a bunch more

00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:49.034
photos to her."

00:12:49.034 --> 00:12:51.604
Look, this one cuts deep.
This one's like...

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:55.340
I'm straight relaxin'
while I'm terrorizing you.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:59.178
I'm literally wearing
the pants in the situation.

00:13:00.946 --> 00:13:02.614
Moment of silence
and then he grac--

00:13:02.614 --> 00:13:05.617
Oh, by the way,
Kinkos, no questions.

00:13:05.617 --> 00:13:07.686
[laughter]

00:13:07.686 --> 00:13:11.990
Ten employees,
not a fucking word.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:15.194
But he graciously said,
"Look, I will tell her.

00:13:15.194 --> 00:13:18.229
I'll tell her and try
and hash it out for you."

00:13:18.229 --> 00:13:22.501
And then, uh,
a year and a half later,

00:13:22.501 --> 00:13:24.736
I'm walking out of my home
down my driveway

00:13:24.736 --> 00:13:28.307
and a female's walking up it,
and we meet in the middle.

00:13:28.307 --> 00:13:30.375
And she says to me,

00:13:30.375 --> 00:13:32.645
[inhales, exhales]

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:34.546
"Are you the guy..."

00:13:34.546 --> 00:13:38.651
[laughter]

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:41.654
"That had my pants?"

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:43.888
This was a moment of truth
for me,

00:13:43.888 --> 00:13:47.492
so I dug very deep,
I looked her in the eye

00:13:47.492 --> 00:13:49.694
and I said,

00:13:49.694 --> 00:13:52.231
"I never got the peanut butter."

00:13:53.498 --> 00:13:55.767
That's the story
of the first and last time

00:13:55.767 --> 00:13:58.236
I ever saw Stacy Wu.
Thank you, guys.

00:13:58.236 --> 00:13:59.738
Thanks.

00:13:59.738 --> 00:14:02.875
