00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 in this capsule we will see Algeria 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.250
 of the retro propagation then we saw 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.410
 in the previous capsule what is a 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.610
 neural network 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.660
 so we can see a network of neurons 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.039
 like several neurons corresponding to 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.840
 logistic regressions that are at 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.500
 horgen organizing multiple layers 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.180
 several hidden causes and finally 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:29.550
 an output layer we will calculate 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.800
 our prediction f of h2x women and so 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.940
 the layers we have here correspond to 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.840
 neurons on a regression 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.910
 logistics 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.280
 so they too are two layers 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.700
 hidden here we have an input cause that 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.450
 corresponds to our inputs x1 x2 and then 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.579
 finally an exit layer here and 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.579
 now the question arises how 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.710
 will we be led to resolve 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.449
 Beyond so comment on what will adapt 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.539
 to give us training for 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.059
 modify the value of our parameters 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.090
 from here ie the weights of 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:08.900
 connections between the neurons we have 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:13.110
 in the different layers we saw the 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.150
 paradise of minimizing the loss 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.009
 so that allowed us to get a 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.810
 December general algorithm of gaza 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.790
 stochastic who tells us that if we have 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.270
 parameters but a way of 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.939
 adjust his two shots and examples of 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.210
 training log and put to 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.759
 day our parameters by subtracting a 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.030
 learning rate times drifting and 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:40.350
 partial of a loss associated with our 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.030
 current prediction in relation to this 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.890
 parameter there and so we would make a bet 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.270
 update of toulon allow according to this 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.970
 rule here here when a model that is 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.890
 much more complicated than that of 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.560
 with a sister logistic regression 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.670
 so it may seem hard to 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.110
 calculate the value of each of these 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.610
 derby by these lots for all 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.530
 settings so all collections to 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.840
 our network but fortunately we're going 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.810
 succeed in facilitating greatly 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.129
 calculates by exploiting the rule of 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.129
 chain derivation 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.480
 it's a fast-paced art and 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.000
 derivation goes on a function eve 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.819
 2 x which depends on a variable x and 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.480
 that this most calculated function to 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.609
 from intermediate results j2x 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.189
 well we saw that the derivatives 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:35.010
 partial m 2 and compared to notary 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:36.900
 x can be written as the product of 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.720
 partial evry of fixed relative to 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.730
 Thursday x times the derivative the aderee not 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:47.659
 that of gdx with respect to m 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:49.530
 and if eve ii x6 written rather like the 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:52.650
 the application of a function on 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.290
 several intermediate results ji of 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.859
 x or y indices the different results 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.200
 intermediaries and in this case the 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:03.420
 partial drift of fgx prepared that that 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.819
 is going to be the sum for all the results 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.049
 intermediates of the partial hervé 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.819
 of mtx fraport ag i 2 x times the last 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.670
 not that of gdx my result 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.709
 intermediate with respect to x so 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.940
 the usefulness of this credit if in the case 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.150
 neural networks is actually 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.569
 generics under the umbrella of x to vote 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:28.260
 in actually doing the math done to some 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.599
 layer and ninth art be the derivatives 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.769
 partial 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.019
 so we will actually be able to use 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.120
 calculations that are made to a layer case 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.060
 at home to get the derbys 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.609
 partial for a previous hidden layer 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.470
 so we're going to comment exactly what 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:48.739
 we will exploit this rule in the 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:51.479
 framework of networks their then we have our 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.819
 rule to use to make the 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:55.650
 modification of heavy goods vehicles 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.680
 when you go down the gas 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.150
 stochastic to train the prison 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.639
 and by the application of the judgment 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.659
 in chain have actually that drift and 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:08.879
 of the cost of the loss compared to my 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:11.479
 settings wsj my connection to my 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:15.530
 neuron there is my hero jim 

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:17.909
 in fact I can describe it as or 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.469
 leu decomposed as the dlv 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:24.210
 partial loss compared to 

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:24.920
 the entry of the activation function 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.300
 for the wall 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.830
 once times partial derivatives of 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.370
 the input of the activation function of the 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:38.530
 neuron j relative to my parameters 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:41.180
 wg so we remember here only at jcs and 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.820
 activating a savannah girl 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.530
 is equal to an activation function 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:54.770
 therefore the logistic or sigmoid function 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:59.330
 applied to the entrance of this world there and j 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:01.280
 it's just the sum of the neurons 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:06.520
 who are connected a weighted orgy 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:09.020
 by their weight associated with neurons j ok 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.640
 so that's something I can 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.660
 to do because of the stopping of the 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:17.990
 chain derivation and what we see 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.250
 is that the direction I'm going 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.940
 use to update the 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.220
 settings 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.930
 it's going to be given by the gradient of the 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.500
 loss in relation to the sum of the entries 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:30.440
 of the neuron so angie who if the sum 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:33.020
 weighted inputs of the neuron once the 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.520
 gradient of this sum there compared 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:40.070
 by weight 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:41.450
 w yj accurate so we have in excess only for 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.930
 have a few more discussions about 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:47.930
 why can it work but 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:51.920
 Charles v language here if we only have the 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:54.920
 loss increases if angie increases one goes 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.670
 see that drift and by this one is going 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.210
 to be positive 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:02.100
 on the other hand if we only have the sum 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.630
 entrance within one hour in 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.919
 before the logistics function 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:10.020
 it decreases if wsj increases the flow 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:12.690
 partial is going to be negative so 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.280
 logically offered the gradient of the 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.620
 loss by where debris part of the 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.470
 loss compared to ew chigy is expected 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:22.199
 to be negative so because that's it 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:24.840
 decreases socially but this segment if 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:26.940
 during social asks if this segment 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:32.190
 by then relevant if it increases 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:33.690
 well we have that if it increases the loss goes 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.820
 decrease 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:40.349
 we prefer similar reasoning if we 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:42.300
 had that loss decrease if angie has 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:43.169
 increased one with the drift and would 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.229
 negative 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:47.580
 then if we still had angie so 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:50.580
 what goes into the function 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.970
 activation decreases if wsj increases on 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.650
 would have a function 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:58.289
 we interviewed by set themselves negative 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.210
 so in this case both - this cancer 

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:05.430
 and we would logically 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:07.620
 that if wsj increases because it decreases 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.570
 but what if this segment that it decreases 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.210
 so alain around 6:50 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:15.449
 if that decreases socially we will see 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:17.520
 that the loss will increase if wgi armand 

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:20.130
 actually average format 1re give 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:23.009
 more adhere partial see the sign 

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:25.500
 positive as we expected so I say 

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:27.210
 just po just confirmed gives you 

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:31.199
 a little more addition that's why this 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:33.570
 make it happen here at 10 years old and their 

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:35.190
 water losses that we would like to calculate 

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:38.370
 each of these tables this one here is 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:40.560
 this one here the theme that will cause 

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.820
 problem that's this one the eight is going to be 

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.949
 still difficult enough 

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.210
 it could be naively used to 

00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:47.130
 calculate is for each of us 

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.509
 let's have fun computing what is 

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:52.080
 the partial derbi of the loss by 

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:54.270
 report at the input of the function 

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.130
 activation of the neuron safer a lot 

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:59.340
 of calculations are done separately 

00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:00.900
 on the other hand we will see an algorithm that 

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:02.370
 of the retro propagation of 

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:05.190
 gradients that will also be more 

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:07.979
 smart about sharing and trying to 

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:11.719
 share the calculations in the calculation of 

00:08:07.979 --> 00:08:11.719
 its partial derivatives here here 

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:17.360
 in fact the demotion algorithm 

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:20.250
 gradients will exploit the fact that 

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.650
 the drift and for a neuron in a 

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:24.870
 layer it for example the layer the 

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:27.750
 first layer cash and 10 one can be 

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:30.300
 calculated from derivatives of 

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:31.890
 neurons connect to that role in there 

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:35.100
 the left it simpler for example 

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:38.850
 the second layer hide and so that 

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:43.650
 it's a fact that got because of 

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:44.790
 the chain derivation party and we're going 

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:46.560
 see more formally what we want 

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:50.400
 to say that is the derivative of the loss 

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:52.080
 compared to what goes in to 

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.180
 inside the activation function 

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.580
 for the wall man j learn moment I 

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:58.020
 can write it as the product of the 

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:01.080
 partial lifting of the loss from 

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.790
 when activating a dress j 

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:07.020
 ok so this is the function 

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:10.170
 logistics activation applied to on 

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:12.360
 what took mgi here is hervé 

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:15.300
 partial activation of a control room 

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.800
 compared to his entry in j so this so 

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.320
 simple application of art and 

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:22.230
 oak damage where we have a result 

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:25.550
 intermediate is acting there now I 

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:28.950
 get into the pot it's clearer 

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:30.690
 take that term here what am I going 

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:35.730
 do a game just write them where I 

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:38.610
 will replace a geometry with a function 

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:40.920
 I applied to angie and function 

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:42.210
 I actually write it if it's the 

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.610
 logistic function I do not write 

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:47.100
 logistics just for the line to be 

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:49.710
 shorter so I just replaced acted 

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:52.920
 by jci where I try the function 

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:54.750
 logistics threat term it's going to get 

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.140
 break down a little bit more we will apply 

00:09:54.750 --> 00:10:04.110
 the chain game rule at this term there 

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:08.190
 so finally we have if we have a neuron here 

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:10.200
 who would be my haji neuron are surrendering 

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.880
 there is connected in my network of 

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:15.450
 neurons to other neurons in a 

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:17.010
 next layer and so I have each of 

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:19.500
 these neurons there will be oriented 

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:21.620
 possibly connect with the layer 

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:24.690
 output on which the loss is calculated 

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:25.570
 is the art of telling my channel so me 

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:27.730
 allows everything 

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:31.180
 and as an intermediate result it is 

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:32.740
 a hike here in the next layer and 

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:35.230
 if I guess I calculated the 

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:37.420
 partial derivatives here because I 

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:40.480
 can do with the bypass line 

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:42.490
 exchange can use them these calculations 

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.920
 intermediate to calculate the gait 

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:48.580
 n of my variant that interests me and which 

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:50.200
 so in fact since all these calculations 

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:52.990
 intermediate logistics are all 

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:55.330
 neurons the next cashes layer that 

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:57.550
 I come from here by when I go to 

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:59.500
 suppose I calculated people the 

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:02.050
 partial derivatives of loss by 

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:04.720
 report to the input of these neurons and 

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:06.940
 his course and now by the rule 

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.460
 revenge in belgium is actually the 

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:11.800
 derived from the loss compared to orgies 

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:13.750
 and that's the sum on all these calculations 

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:16.060
 intermediate so the neurons and dc 

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:19.360
 by case in the next race of the 

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:23.230
 partial dlv of the loss in relation to 

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:26.320
 the entrance of these neurons the ncaa times the 

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:28.240
 drift and the entry of the function 

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.340
 activation of the neurons codes of the 

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:33.730
 next layer compared to 

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:36.790
 activation of my neuron 

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:37.990
 so I have once again just 

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:39.700
 apply the stop of the diversion 

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:41.740
 go on here but in a college and 

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:43.330
 several intermediate outcomes that 

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:49.330
 corresponds to the neurons of the layer 

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:51.460
 next I'll have so now I'm going 

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:54.850
 keep here the term of the der vis of the 

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:58.660
 rhdp peace report to inc drifting and 

00:11:54.850 --> 00:12:01.000
 of inco compared to the regime so we get 

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:02.320
 recalls the formula the the entry of the 

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.060
 activation function for corium 

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:09.310
 neurons that's the sum of the neurons of 

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:13.270
 with which is connected the cam ranh 

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:16.030
 so neurons paris times the weight of 

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:18.850
 the connection between neurons asia and the 

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:21.160
 neuron case and I'm summing up on everything 

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:24.250
 neurons that have a weight that 

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:27.820
 will not have so if I do the derivative of 

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:31.990
 ncaa with respect to a given index j in 

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:35.020
 specific neurons jbc term the here 

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:38.010
 they depend the messi dumbbells which 

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:42.240
 depend on the intelligence and the case where 

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:45.720
 It is equal to j and the drift and w jk 

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:49.500
 orgy times compared to argy only 

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:52.130
 well it's just w jk so the weight 

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:55.170
 between Neroli and Morocco 

00:12:52.130 --> 00:13:01.620
 so if I just replaced stamm 

00:12:55.170 --> 00:13:02.820
 the shunt barça who w jk and 

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:06.120
 finally for the logistics function 

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:07.350
 well it turns out that so the 

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.690
 function I that the logistics function 

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:12.720
 it turns out that if I do the derivative 

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:16.530
 of the function g in relation to its 

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:18.930
 entry angie it turns out to be it's 

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:22.620
 possible to write it as being jci x 1 

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:25.950
 - gide idji so logistics dungey times 

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:27.300
 a logistics way of angie and I will be 

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:30.420
 not the derivation here but it's a 

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:33.000
 result that well known and then you 

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:36.720
 can do the facet exercise 

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.790
 derivation ok so when that got us 

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.350
 allowed to do here is to formulate the 

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:43.110
 drift and partial loss by 

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:45.480
 relation to angie compared to derivatives 

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:47.520
 partial loss compared to a 

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.710
 shell for neurons that action a 

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.690
 layer closer to the layer of 

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:55.610
 exit and so we have a wording 

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:58.320
 recursive so that if I calculate 

00:13:55.610 --> 00:14:00.000
 the drift and for the exit layer to 

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:02.820
 from that formula I'm going 

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.550
 ability to propagate partial derivatives 

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:07.410
 there to get the partial derbys to the 

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:09.210
 previous layer and then I'll be able to 

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:11.520
 continue like this for my other 

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:13.320
 November in my other layers hide 

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.700
 so but I do not make connections 

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.890
 like that I will continue to propagate 

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:19.230
 partial derivatives like that up 

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:20.670
 what I reach the inlet throat and 

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:23.570
 that's going to give me the grid of the retro 

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.570
 Severe spread 

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:31.230
 so here's a preview a visualization 

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:32.940
 of the algorithm while one to get 

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:35.190
 but gradient must I start with 

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.840
 calculation and all my neurons hide so 

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:40.440
 I'm going to have a first spread to 

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:43.020
 20 or from mid-November entry 

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:46.560
 that I'm going to be assigned to the value of here 

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:48.510
 extract and x26 g2 between and from 

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.190
 that I'm going to calculated each of the walls in 

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:50.830
 cash and the first coach to 

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.690
 multiply 

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:56.350
 a word does not make here by its weight with 

00:14:52.690 --> 00:15:01.600
 the 33 here and then adding up will be my 

00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:03.370
 input neuron 2 x the weight w 2 3 so 

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:06.430
 the weight of the connection between the number 

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:08.830
 2 and number 3 I will continue like this 

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:10.240
 where I'm going to calculate eventually but my 

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:11.740
 second layer hidden finally my 

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.630
 last layer which is the layer of 

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:16.690
 exit so I'm just going to apply 

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:18.580
 my formula that the activation of the corium 

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:23.230
 neurons it's my logistic function 

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:25.150
 applied to the combination light for 

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:27.250
 rites of neurons is acting in the 

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.880
 previous layer so especially get 

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:36.040
 finish here 

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:38.590
 the ama swimming it is to be in and 

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:40.930
 finally the output layer so here 

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:42.370
 we take a healthy body for just one 

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:43.960
 single output neuron but I had 

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:46.530
 calculated what is the loss 

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:50.200
 the derby of fear versus 

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:52.360
 input activation to feed themselves and 

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.790
 I will use the formula that I come 

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:57.160
 to arrive to allow me to take 

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:59.080
 this partial view there to get the 

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:02.110
 partial lifting but compared to 

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:04.720
 the entry of this level and to surrender 

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:06.070
 here in this sense using the rule 

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:09.100
 recursively here I can do the same 

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:10.300
 thing for the first layer hide and 

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:12.460
 I could go on like this for 

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:14.170
 as many layers hidden as I have but in 

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:16.480
 done as we will see I can 

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:21.370
 allow to stop at the last the 

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:24.760
 first layer hide now for 

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:27.490
 make the link with the book notation 

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.840
 to gather our lives and it's a 

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:30.400
 formulation also sometimes seen 

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:34.560
 in other lines then in others 

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:40.210
 articles often rather than spread 

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:43.120
 the derivative of loss by angie one can 

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:45.850
 also in the passenger seat - the derivative 

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.990
 of the loss compared to angie and in 

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:51.120
 the notation will use 

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:53.620
 we will call this term and if delta I 

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:57.310
 so in fact everything that changes is 

00:16:53.620 --> 00:17:00.370
 that we have less here and with the same 

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:01.620
 formula that we had before share 

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:03.340
 Rewrite it 

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:07.390
 if I add 

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:10.180
 if I do less right here then to 

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:13.690
 left here so this term is it going to be 

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:17.950
 lithologies and then that term here that 

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:20.140
 is going to be tricky and so I'm getting 

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:21.730
 the singh formula which is equivalent 

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:24.120
 but with the delta where the deltas is 

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:26.890
 less the partial hervé of the entrance 

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:29.080
 so that's just another way of 

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:31.510
 derive the same algorithm everything changes 

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:35.440
 it is spreading partial hervé 

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:37.930
 rather than drifting and biased and 

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:40.240
 finally if I had come to my rule 

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.920
 learning as laid down 

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:44.110
 the algorithm to get off gas 

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:46.560
 stochastic to optimize my loss 

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:49.720
 average of which I wrote that 

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:52.870
 get involved with my settings 

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:54.550
 that says substrate - alpha times the 

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:56.560
 partial derivatives of the input 

00:17:54.550 --> 00:18:00.550
 the input activation of the function 

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:02.080
 activation for a dress so the 

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:04.930
 debate is about loss versus 

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:10.210
 angie times the last part of angie 

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:12.880
 compared to my wsj settings and whose 

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:16.300
 we remember that the license is that 

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:17.440
 that I called home but actually 

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.270
 least that's what I called 

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:21.150
 of alcoholism so less ethology 

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:24.750
 match that here 

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:29.590
 after that we remember that mj 

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:32.130
 it's equal to the sum on ing tesi 

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:38.530
 take it just to distinguish it from here 

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:41.140
 of w so this is the weight of the 

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:45.100
 i premium collection with monday six bonuses 

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:48.540
 and between the name with the connection 

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:50.620
 really it's the weight wai premji 

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:53.310
 is the weight between the neuron 

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:57.040
 with the prime industry and the neuron j 

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:59.320
 faith the activation of the neuron that primes 

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:01.860
 so that's the definition of mj I 

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:03.990
 just changed there 

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:06.210
 the symbol I use for the index 

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:07.350
 for the previous layer so if I'm going 

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:09.960
 there partial derivatives 

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:12.660
 angie versus wsj for an index that 

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:16.559
 gave the only terms that depend 

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:19.590
 wjc the bonus code is equal to 1 

00:19:16.559 --> 00:19:24.660
 and when wg hervé sylla par 

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:25.590
 report to it's going to be to me if I put 

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:28.080
 all together 

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:31.470
 I have at least six who goes this cancer is 

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.640
 here and I get that wsj 

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:34.410
 all I should do is 

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.299
 take my current value then 

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:38.460
 add alpha that goes up or 

00:19:36.299 --> 00:19:42.900
 of learning times the value of 

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:46.370
 neuron to y so here times there derivative 

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:50.160
 partial to the neuron j the delta 

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:51.630
 for the neuron and the deletion for 

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:55.490
 all the values ​​for everything 

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:57.929
 allow all walks and lodgings 

00:19:55.490 --> 00:20:00.540
 which one is ready to put all that 

00:19:57.929 --> 00:20:04.559
 together to finally see 20 on the code 

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:06.540
 so to drive a neurons horizon 

00:20:04.559 --> 00:20:09.240
 we will start by initializing all 

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:12.260
 weight wsj we come here the initialized 

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:14.370
 a little worth a draw that will say 

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:17.880
 often sampled in a 

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:22.230
 interval for example between 0 point 0 - 

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:24.059
 0 point 0 10.01 inclusive for 

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:27.120
 to sample uniformly is normal 

00:20:24.059 --> 00:20:29.250
 signaling that is reasonable and 

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:33.000
 then saab and for each of my 

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:35.309
 peers x / y teeth but my whole 

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.650
 drive I'm going to assign the 

00:20:35.309 --> 00:20:40.290
 neurons from the input layer into 

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:42.919
 English so their activation I want them 

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:45.720
 assigned to the value of the exquisite entry 

00:20:42.919 --> 00:20:46.950
 and for each of the layers of the 

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.900
 first layer hidden they were 

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:50.940
 woven at 2 because the layer of 

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:53.960
 treat so at 1 until my last 

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:58.320
 layer or thanks with the exit layer 

00:20:53.960 --> 00:21:00.900
 I take each of the neurons in the 

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:03.270
 layer she I'm calculated the entry of 

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:05.340
 the angie activation function that is 

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:06.690
 as we write now the sum 

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.790
 weighted neurons the layer 

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:11.700
 previous weighted by the weight of the 

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:12.530
 connection between the neurons y here and the 

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.420
 north j 

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:17.000
 I'm trying to calculate then we 

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:19.100
 calculates the activation acts as being my 

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.120
 nonlinear function g which is the 

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:25.700
 logistic function applied to angie and 

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:28.070
 the weighted sum of the neurons of a 

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:30.770
 previous layer like that that's it 

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:33.170
 this here the spread before then of 

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:35.630
 that here we go the back propagation for 

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:36.950
 calculate the deltas so I'm going 

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:39.410
 initialize debts 

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:41.210
 j for all the energy in the darkness 

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:43.120
 so hide that's an algorithm for 

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:45.440
 one will have several imminent kinds 

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.310
 our concept to pay to one 

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:49.970
 exit since have made a 

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:53.090
 final classification and oenology 

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:56.750
 vote is initialized unlike 

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:59.000
 between the target y is the value of a 

00:21:56.750 --> 00:22:01.760
 rent so yj in our commune 

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.610
 soliciting it would just be less 

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:06.710
 logic and the activation value of the 

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:09.080
 output neuron so that's actually it 

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:13.460
 can demonstrate that it corresponds to less 

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:16.820
 there of partial hervé 2 compared to angie 

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:19.370
 or jc here the neuron of the union of the 

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:20.450
 left of exit and finally I'm going 

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:22.460
 go in the opposite direction I'm going 

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:23.990
 from the second last layer 

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:25.760
 is the last kosher layer because 

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:27.290
 the layer to it is the layer of 

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:30.890
 exit so a less good it'll be the 

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:33.800
 last layer hidden until the 

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:37.130
 first layer in fact here we could 

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:39.650
 only go to the hidden layer 

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:41.660
 in fact that's what we said dalton less 

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:43.430
 calculated that we will not need and 

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:46.250
 when we do it is that for each of the 

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:47.750
 neurons in the layer she running I 

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:49.310
 will calculate it's delta with the 

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:51.020
 formula when seen previously who 

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:53.540
 involves the deltas of the layer at 

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:55.270
 so on the layer that was calculated 

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:58.520
 closest to the output layer 

00:22:55.270 --> 00:23:00.620
 and finally will update every 

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:02.900
 weight so all wgi corrections 

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:05.210
 in my network according to the rule in all 

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:07.720
 what I do is that I add a 

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:10.760
 learning rate times the value 

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:12.920
 activation of the neuron there is hervé 

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:15.070
 partial - there rup and del 

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:18.080
 toro j for the neuron 

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:20.280
 I have I continue like that until 

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:24.150
 I have a criterion 

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:25.200
 who daric are satisfied for example 

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:28.640
 it could be that the world mistake 

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:31.320
 does not change enough 

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.520
 or sakurai that I classified 

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:34.500
 perfectly all my examples 

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:36.270
 drive so that's it 

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:38.190
 the algorithm of a retro propagation of 

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:40.260
 gradients who is here who will us 

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:41.940
 allow to calculate the gaza for 

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:44.730
 to make the descent of guards 

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.990
 stochastic to train 

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:48.830
 effectively a network of neurons 

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:48.830
 artificial
