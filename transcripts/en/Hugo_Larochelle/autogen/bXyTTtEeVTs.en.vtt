00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 this capsule was worth translating the 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.509
 Bezian network concept and we are going 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.470
 to address the role that rose to the needs 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.290
 can play in intelligence 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.759
 artificial 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.880
 so in this capsule and those who 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.279
 will follow the goals are from 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.250
 cover what is the definition of a 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.960
 Bezian network is among others addressed the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.269
 concept of the structure of a network 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.220
 bezels of probabilities in a network 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.320
 beziers to see also commented this 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.359
 we can identify independence 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.640
 conditional from a 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.690
 representation in network form 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.579
 beziers of an environment on the other hand 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.860
 how to make inference in a 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.770
 Bezian network of inference is exact 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.969
 or approximate and finally we will 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.160
 see what we can build 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.960
 automatic Bézian networks 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.960
 with automatic learning 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.210
 so we saw in the capsules 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.739
 previous the basics of reasoning 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.309
 probabilistic based on the theory of 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.199
 probabilities 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.880
 we have seen that if we define ourselves as a model 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.830
 which actually corresponds to a table of 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.570
 productive joint so we do not live a 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.040
 previous southern cape where we had a table 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.140
 then in our table we had several 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.780
 random variables is the last 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.220
 colony if we had the probabilities 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.290
 associated with all assignments 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.409
 possible of my random variable 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.900
 so we saw because defining a model 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.240
 so finally this table represents 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.909
 finally a modeling of 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.799
 relationships of the different concepts the 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.650
 different elements of my environment 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.060
 from models in this form 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.189
 we were able to calculate several 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.900
 probability of marginal qualities and 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.610
 conditionalities that are useful for 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.439
 make probabilistic reasoning that 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.540
 will take into account our uncertainties by 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.299
 relationship to these elements 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.040
 there in our environment 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.630
 we made a very simple example where we 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.149
 had then you want to do the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.189
 detection emails from is this 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.050
 that an email conceives that we hold good 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.230
 meaning and where is it 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.270
 the sender's address is unknown 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.040
 in practice actually to get some 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.170
 systems in over detection of spam 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.530
 who works well who are who are 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.060
 effective than a good one good 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.530
 prediction performance we finally go 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.690
 want to have hundreds or even 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.760
 thousands of random Arabs makes that the 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.370
 market approach based on a table like 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.360
 this one will just not passable on 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.330
 said random variable which are 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.620
 binary bath then if one has ten thousand 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.090
 variable it means we will have a 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:33.660
 table with 2 to the 1000 ranger for the 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.470
 2000 different configurations of our 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.080
 random variable 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.090
 are we going to see in the capsules 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.160
 that will follow is that the networks 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.140
 beziers will just allow us to 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.850
 represent more effectively this 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.540
 probability table there so 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.070
 implicit 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.350
 so that will allow us to build 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.180
 a model for reasoning 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.130
 project list but that is going to be a lot 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.330
 more efficient in memory that will us 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.060
 to be much more effective 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:02.760
 also in our probability calculations 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:05.220
 conditional is marginal then the 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.900
 Bezier networks it is we can see that 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.270
 as a kind of marriage between the 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.959
 graph theory and theory of 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.670
 probabilities the Bezier networks actually 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.300
 will allow us to represent well 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.910
 our probabilistic knowledge for a 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.220
 given application so if we have 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.320
 different clinical knowledge of a 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.230
 expert corresponds to a doctor in this 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.180
 case also which represents links of 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.040
 causality between diseases of 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.030
 symptoms the Hobbesian are going to us 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.410
 allow to represent that way 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.500
 still quite intuitive actually placed 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.540
 directly the Bezier networks go 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.310
 take care of it to model site of 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.380
 knowledge there that can be 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.490
 used in for example a kind of 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.130
 expert system that 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:56.000
 a system that will support the taking of 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.740
 decisions by one person and this 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.170
 particle is particularly useful 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.480
 when one is in a situation where the 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.250
 causality plays an important role so we 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.420
 is able to identify events 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.380
 so random variables that cause 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.090
 who have a causal relationship with 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.690
 other random in my 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.710
 environment 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:18.500
 and it's especially useful when 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:21.350
 these causal relationships there are not 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.730
 fully understood so we do not have in 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.030
 makes causal relationships that are 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.380
 deterministic and we want to incorporate a 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.180
 other notion of relative certainties 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.070
 what are its causal relationships 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.480
 who is able to handle this 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:37.160
 uncertainty there to make our 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:39.770
 probabilistic reasoning let's see 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.690
 some examples of applications then 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.570
 promised is when I mentioned earlier 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.630
 medical diagnosis or another 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.980
 network beziers will allow us to 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.130
 enter others model the relationship 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:55.490
 between the possible disease of building 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.740
 patients and its symptoms associated with 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.450
 disease and with two Bezier networks 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.910
 among other things what will be useful is 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.680
 that we are going to be able to lighthouse the 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.650
 probabilistic reasoning among others 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:10.490
 when we do not really know 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.530
 the set of symptoms so where the 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.940
 set of information the social and 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.920
 environment so that's okay that would 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:20.030
 easy for us to identify what is 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:22.040
 age sex is there no one 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.890
 not smoke if he has information that 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.790
 are easy to acquire however 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:31.340
 identify if you finally die in 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:34.850
 in the patient or also do a test 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.650
 who measures calcium levels his cdc 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.090
 operations it's information that 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.919
 is expensive to acquire that we do not have 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.110
 necessarily access which one is painted 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.180
 aksil oath in any situation and 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.250
 so his coming with the obediences is in 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.740
 measure actually first two to model 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.320
 the causal relationships between these 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.630
 different aspects there of our situation 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.130
 then be able then to care of 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.270
 do different in this case also this 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.970
 which really interests us to know 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:05.270
 does our patient have cancer or 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:07.100
 not by the way there are systems of 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.260
 medical diagnosis that have been 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.210
 developed 1 which is particularly 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.220
 impressive is that of the pathfinder 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.830
 which is based on bezier networks he 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.350
 was developed at an extracting the 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.360
 expertise of different systems but in 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.310
 modeling this expertise there in a 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.870
 network well we see here this is the 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.090
 bezian network what if he is very very 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.940
 big of each peelings like that 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.289
 is actually a league from everything 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.630
 our network bezy so this very big 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:33.949
 bezier network and the results that have 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.660
 been obtained are still enough 

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:38.210
 impressive 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.580
 if we compare is the kind of diagnosis 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:44.419
 made by this system there to experts 20 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:46.970
 50 times out of 53 we got there was 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:49.550
 agreement between the automated system and 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.500
 the experts and the predictions were 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.430
 considered to be equally good too 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.510
 valid than that of the experts who were 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:07:01.340
 solicited to develop the system 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:02.870
 so the expertise of the doctors that you 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.909
 want doctors whose appraised has been 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.320
 embedded in the beziers network he 

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:10.150
 made predictions that is also 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.150
 good that the automated system 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:14.560
 we can also diagnose but 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.240
 in this case computer 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:20.090
 there are microsoft tools like by 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:23.630
 example the famous clip i software 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:25.780
 word that uses the associated technology 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:29.360
 to benzian networks or do 

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:32.090
 identification of two problems by 

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:35.030
 example related to printing and 8 in 

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:39.340
 windows so these are 

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:43.430
 these are applications that use 

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:44.990
 Bezier networks that has been developed 

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:50.270
 and used a lot by people from 

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:51.710
 microsoft non application this is the 

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:54.710
 prediction of road traffic 

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:58.160
 again we are going to be a 

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:59.600
 application named djembe type of 

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.160
 technology that makes it possible to do the 

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.170
 prediction of what would be the traffic 

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.710
 road from information 

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:09.590
 partial like road reports 

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:12.490
 or weather information is located 

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:15.350
 and it's an application done that they 

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:18.580
 could work on a device 

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.580
 mobile like a cell phone 

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:25.310
 our application list here so the 

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:26.930
 nasa to do sports diagnosis in 

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.280
 real-time system failures 

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:31.790
 propulsion of a space vacuum 

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:33.470
 at &amp; t use it the bézy networks 

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:35.840
 redo the detection of fraud or 

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:38.390
 detecting bad payers for 

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.130
 telephone bills classification of 

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:42.350
 obese documents will go very very 

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:43.430
 still used today to make the 

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.170
 classification of documents is 

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:47.240
 often one of the approaches 

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.410
 declassification of documents which is 

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.030
 relatively old but works 

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:51.380
 particularly well and in too much of the 

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.180
 spam detection there are many who 

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.680
 is made from networks of beziers 

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:57.230
 which will allow us in too many 

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.880
 support for only two variables 

00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:00.500
 random diagnosis as it is 

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:04.880
 done in an example really support 

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:07.010
 several other variables and also the 

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.540
 bezy networks are behind kind of 

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:10.310
 technology to do the localization 

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.170
 robots in a map so let's imagine 

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:13.700
 that we have robots walking around in a 

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:16.010
 effective environment and identify 

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:18.260
 where they are on a map of this 

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:20.210
 environment there the Bezier networks 

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.990
 can be used to try 

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:22.990
 to attack this problem
