00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 in this capsule goodbye the concept 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:09.059
 of the value of a plan we saw the 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.090
 definition of a mdp our processes of 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.980
 peace on marc orian it requires the 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.509
 definition of the whole heap of 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.609
 action that can be taken from 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.039
 different states of transition model 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.100
 which determines us the probity to arrive 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.980
 in mind state if one is a state s and 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.529
 that we perform an action at and finally 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.269
 a reward function as we who 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.840
 determines the reward that there I 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:37.710
 hold back if it reaches you also 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.360
 given the definition of a plan then this is 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.579
 simply a set of decisions that 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.850
 specifies each and 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.420
 what is the action that followed 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.559
 the action has therefore that corresponds to do 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.590
 a request to the plan worse for you have 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:58.500
 current so that does not specify the actions 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.219
 who are followed by an agent when 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.600
 follows the plan and then data 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.850
 now what we would like is for 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.159
 evaluate the quality of a plan for 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.260
 eventually say that or develop 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.310
 algorithms to maximize this 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.220
 value there so and intuitively we 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.880
 would like the value of a plan to be 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.950
 basically correspond to the sum 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.979
 rewards that we accumulate if we 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.299
 follows a plan that gave so let's see 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:34.430
 more formally how do we 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:38.820
 can set the value of a dish then 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.520
 for a plan worse data and a state where 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.360
 the money is sold our tv of 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.600
 pi s as being the value of a plan worse 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.939
 do you have and this value there actually 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.340
 it will match the rewards 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.079
 accumulated average to average because 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.360
 that there is uncertainty in our 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.860
 environment 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.320
 so we're going to have to average a sphere 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.570
 hope on what could happen 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.590
 to integrate our certainty about what 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.630
 what could happen after 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.819
 running in the dish so that's going to be 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.399
 the accumulated rewards if we follow a 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.659
 full udder 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:17.150
 and that we start at the state is this so 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:20.540
 finally me often write that way 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.730
 recurring yves then vépy two aces 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.310
 the sum of two things the first 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.269
 thing this is the present reward if I 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.890
 find me the state s 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:33.109
 I'm going to make an air reward of s 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.489
 I will add to that the others 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.739
 rewards coming 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.189
 after the state s I did an action 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.650
 given that I'm going to a state that 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:45.440
 share in a spirit state even and because 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.980
 that v de pie ix this game defines them as 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.889
 being the sum of the rewards from 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.470
 of a state is this good if I want to know 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:57.109
 what is the sum from the state s 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.790
 I can link him to vic the sum of 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:02.150
 future rewards market from the 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:05.900
 roofs and this premium or express that would be 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:09.170
 a vise that I will have reached after having 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.299
 been in the state is this so in this 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.000
 recursive definition the man but are 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.790
 the sum of rewards accumulate I the 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.269
 breaks down into the present reward and 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.609
 the future rewards where he is this is the 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.819
 sum of future rewards that 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:28.250
 corresponds to v2 and s premium now 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.650
 because there is uncertainty from 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.199
 of a state is this if I am my plan 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.389
 so I take the action pi 2s 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:38.540
 so that's going to match the action that 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:41.150
 I take to the state is this if I am the 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.949
 given peak plan there is some 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.919
 probability that I reach anywhere 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:48.409
 what and todd expresses as a whole 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:50.419
 of all grand s so what I do 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:54.260
 it is that I will hope for 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:57.169
 this future value of the parades and the 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.690
 sum of future rewards so I do 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:02.540
 with an average hope for all 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.489
 the following states expresses possible 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.799
 weighted by the probability that 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.310
 I reach that spirit state mla from 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.829
 of 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.180
 when I am my plan would give so 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.459
 if what this expression the 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.310
 correspondence makes the sum especially the 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.989
 minds even possible from value to this 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.549
 once I reach it expresses my 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.870
 weighted by the probability that 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.450
 I arrived this bonus 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.240
 if from rs I do the action that 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.980
 s now there is another term here 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.980
 that I have not explained what is 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.330
 call the second factor 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.980
 so that's a factor that normally 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.350
 is between 0 and 1 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.780
 we need that factor because 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.280
 as I explained in a capsule 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.440
 previous normally we suppose that 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.850
 the agent life infinitely in 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.920
 the environment then finally no but 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.730
 end of action so it helps to 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:52.340
 represent the body or an age where one 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.200
 do not really know the number of actions 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.930
 that the agent will do or that can 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.420
 also match a species 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.760
 evaluation if you have an agent who 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.490
 invests in the stock market and so they 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.710
 want jacket then the agent in question 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.540
 final computer equipment 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.200
 infinite and we want to know took a 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:15.320
 very very large number of action towards which 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:19.130
 then is our policy 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.530
 our agent will converge however if 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.520
 the rewards are all positive 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.480
 although I made a name for a movie 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.980
 of action i'm going to get a reward 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.600
 cumulative that will be infinite so I 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.800
 must be introduced a term that must 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.750
 to be smaller than one who is I can 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.660
 actually demonstrate that if I do that so 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:42.410
 if my kid here strictly smaller 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.210
 than at a bath I had to have a 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:47.060
 sum of rewards that will converge 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.650
 who will not be infinite and his 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.080
 intuitively too we can see 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.790
 as representing the fact that precisely 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.640
 with an agent who had style in the 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:58.310
 money purse that I get the day 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:01.220
 even who would be my present reward 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:04.730
 worth a little more than money 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:07.640
 i would get it later would not it 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:11.060
 because that money there can win in 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:14.180
 value by the money that got more 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.890
 early in the future so intimate 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.970
 we can see it a little like that then 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.680
 if not from a mathematical point of view 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:22.040
 it's to control the fact that in fact 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:24.620
 if we have a man is finished with action he 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.600
 must have some 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.310
 seconds on future rewards 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:36.100
 hope for not having a sum that 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:38.660
 finished now that we defined the value 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.350
 let's see how with this value there 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.490
 we can compare different plans 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.580
 firstly we will say that a plan that 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:49.190
 will dominate another full prime 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.890
 if we have the following two conditions 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:55.670
 first is that value then is it 

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:58.460
 so vépy is this your biggest of 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:01.610
 treat could have been prime is this for all 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:04.760
 states but in addition it will exist 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:06.410
 at least one state is such that the value 

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.800
 at this state is this your strictly 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:11.920
 bigger for the plan worse than for 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.180
 my other pip plan 

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:17.720
 so we go in this case that foot in 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:20.900
 does its value is always at worst equal 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:24.740
 to the value associated api prime except for 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.970
 - a state where we will have a value 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.100
 strictly more serious 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:30.230
 so that's why we're going to say that the 

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:35.180
 plan will dominate the plan that will dominate 

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:37.550
 the other plan that premium and now we 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.920
 will say that a plan that would be optimal 

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:43.700
 a plan that is dominated by no other 

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:45.290
 plan so in fact with this definition 

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:47.630
 there could be several plans 

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:50.720
 optimal but all these plans are going in 

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:52.610
 does have exactly the same value and 

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.920
 that we could have two plans that 

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:58.130
 are incomparable that is to say that 

00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:01.220
 none will dominate each other so that wants 

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:04.550
 to say that in fact the dominance based on 

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:06.680
 plan values ​​will induce a 

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:09.620
 order function but only partial 

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.820
 between plans this being said it's not 

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.860
 really a problem because we 

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:17.410
 will be interested in actually found the plan 

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:20.210
 optimal and therefore platinum at the time 

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:21.950
 it goes forward either one or 

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:24.200
 many but he'll always have to 

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:25.850
 less an optimal plan and how 

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.890
 resell there are two algorithms 

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:29.840
 different iterations by value 

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:31.730
 evaluated creation and iteration by 

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.040
 political or not so very young who will 

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:41.320
 allow us to find this plan 

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:43.400
 optimal before seeing his algorithms 

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.830
 we will see how can we 

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.350
 characterize the value of a block 

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:50.060
 buildings wherever they are 

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:52.730
 the equations of the requests that we 

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:54.830
 gives a condition that is guaranteed 

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:57.470
 to be true for optimal plans 

00:08:54.830 --> 00:09:00.890
 specifically for the value of these 

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:04.130
 plants immo the equations 2010 that for 

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:06.680
 a final plan it's going their victory to 

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:10.610
 the state is this vote is equal to the 

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:12.800
 reward to pieces the most the maximum 

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:15.140
 about the actions that I can take at 

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:20.000
 the state is actually I would have belonged 

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:23.900
 sizes 2 6 6 2 so the maximum on 

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.680
 the actions of the sum of the rewards 

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:31.430
 future hope to associate with the action 

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:33.040
 given ok so mark if it's not 

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:35.839
 exactly the same as before at 20 

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:38.089
 in the equation associated with the definition 

00:09:35.839 --> 00:09:42.020
 recursive value to places of lodges 

00:09:38.089 --> 00:09:45.980
 who you are with and therefore what it is 

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:47.650
 says here is that in a plane 

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:50.450
 optimal 

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:53.420
 the action here is the action that goes 

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:55.910
 so maximize the action that is being flouted 

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:58.370
 for the timal plan would be the action 

00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:02.240
 who would maximize that sum of 

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:03.740
 future rewards was hoping so so that 

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:08.209
 means that if we are able to 

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:11.600
 calculate to find v stars we would 

00:10:08.209 --> 00:10:13.459
 able to get the plant imams the plan 

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.280
 said massa would be just for each 

00:10:13.459 --> 00:10:19.970
 and it corresponds to finding the action 

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:21.589
 which maximizes the sum of rewards 

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.959
 future and hope they have justice 

00:10:21.589 --> 00:10:26.390
 so the gamma here that is constant by 

00:10:23.959 --> 00:10:28.100
 relation to so if we can ignore it 

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:29.889
 would simply maximize that 

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.779
 expression there here 

00:10:29.889 --> 00:10:33.279
 and if we had kept watch so we 

00:10:31.779 --> 00:10:35.499
 could do this maximization there and 

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:37.929
 that would allow us to get the plan 

00:10:35.499 --> 00:10:39.699
 optima so that's equations 

00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:42.790
 of Germany that will come when we go 

00:10:39.699 --> 00:10:45.459
 talk about the algorithms that will attempt 

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:47.230
 to find a little evil white 

00:10:45.459 --> 00:10:49.889
 for a decision process mark 

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.889
 come back give
