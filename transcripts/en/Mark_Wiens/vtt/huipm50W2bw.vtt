00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.900
Delhi, located in North India, is the national
capital city of the country and has a metro

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.450
population of around twenty two million residents.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.070
From the ancient congested alleys of Old Deli
to the wide tree lined boulevards of New Delhi,

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.080
it's a city that's overflowing with diversity
and opportunity.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.930
With records that dates back to the 6th century
BC, Delhi is loaded with history, art, culture,

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.230
and religion.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.960
No matter what you choose to do, you can be
certain it will be an adventure!

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:45.900
Now let's get started with these 21 things
to do in Delhi.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.310
Number one is the Bahai Lotus Temple.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.030
Which is one of the most popular and famous
destinations to visit.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.489
It's made from marble, in the shape of a lotus
flower, and kind of representing a variety

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:59.969
of different religions.

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:07.610
They don't allow shoes in the temple, but
it's free to deposit your shoes in the cloakroom.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.600
Number two is the Hare Krishna ISKCON temple.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:18.830
Right now I'm at the Sri Sri Radha Parthasarathi
Mandir which is more popularly known as ISKCON.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:27.940
Oh hello, how are you, I'm fine.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.150
Are you at school?

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:49.360
Number three is Kalkaji Mandir, one of the
most famous Hindu Temples in the city.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.880
Number four is Jama Masjid, the most significant
mosque in Old Delhi.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:03.870
The Jama Masjid, which is the largest Muslim
mosque, here in, I think in all of India actually.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.750
Right in the most hectic area of Delhi, known
as Chandni Chowk and the Chawri Bazar.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.709
I am at Akshardham Temple complex in Delhi
India.

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.550
They do not allow any photography, or even
any electronics, or even any bags to go inside

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.200
the temple and the complex, but luckily they
have a really nice cloakroom where you can

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.950
leave all your stuff for free, and it's safe.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.160
It's absolutely mind blowing, the detail is
stunning to say the least.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.239
It's something you have to see when you're
in Delhi.

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.709
Number six is Gurdwara Bangla Sahib Sikh Temple.

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:51.030
I think it's the largest Sikh temple in Delhi,
and of course, you need to cover your head

00:02:51.030 --> 00:03:05.379
before you enter, and also remove your shoes.

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:10.680
Number seven is the Laxmi Narayan Mandir - a
Hindu temple that was inaugurated by Mahatma

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.680
Gandhi.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.989
It's one of the most famous Hindu temples
here in Delhi, India.

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:25.060
Now they don't allow any photography inside
so you actually have leave your shoes and

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:32.330
your camera is a secure like tourist room,
but this is another temple that you should

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.090
visit when you visit Delhi.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.590
Number eight is the Hauz Khas historical complex.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.090
So it's actually turned into kind of a park,
but there's ruins all around, there's a couple

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.780
of tombs also.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.480
It once functioned sort of as a water complex,
so you can just sort of walk around this area

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.650
leisurely browse around this area.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.320
Check out the ruins, the lake down below and
you can even have a picnic here and relax

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.400
if you'd like.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.319
Number nine is Delhi's impressive Lodi Gardens.

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.440
I'm at the entrance of the Lodi Garden in
Delhi, and this is a big, very nicely maintained

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.930
park but at the same time it's a historical
attraction.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:22.229
So within the park you can sort of walk around,
check out some of the tombs, and some of the

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.150
ancient structures around this park.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.110
It's just like any other central park, but
in Delhi within the grass and trees are ancient

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.449
thousand year old tombs and monuments.

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:41.710
Number ten is the famous India Gate and its
quite similar to the Arc de triumph in Paris,

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.259
but it's like a victory gate commemorating
India.

00:04:47.259 --> 00:05:01.509
Two rupees, no thank you.

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:05.439
Number eleven is the astronomy complex of
Jantar Mantar.

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:11.641
There's thirteen different astronomy instruments,
it's almost like a playground over here, but

00:05:11.641 --> 00:05:15.139
you can walk around and check out the different
instruments.

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:20.169
Number twelve, one of the iconic landmarks
of Delhi, is Qutub Minar.

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:26.770
I think it's the tallest minaret in India,
and I think it measures about seventy three

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:34.419
meters in height, built in eleven ninety three,
this is an ancient site, and it's still in

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.219
fabulous condition.

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:44.770
It's really tall, and it's quite a site to
visit when you come to Delhi.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.990
Flocks of birds flying from pillar to pillar
made the experience even more gorgeous.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.839
Number thirteen is Humayun’s Tomb, a Mughal
masterpiece.

00:05:55.839 --> 00:06:00.729
And this is one of the three UNESCO World
Heritage sites in Delhi.

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:05.860
It looks very well preserved but at the same
time they are doing some renovation as you

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.999
can see some scaffolding at the top of the
tomb there.

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:14.059
Number fourteen is the Tomb of Safdarjung.

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:19.629
This one is a little less maintained than
some of the other places I've been, but nevertheless

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:22.899
it's still an amazing attraction.

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:32.219
So it's just a five minute walk from the Jor
Bagh metro station to get here.

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:37.229
Number fifteen is Raj Ghat, a memorial park
dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:47.160
At the Mahatma Gandhi memorial.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.249
Number sixteen is Delhi's Red Fort.

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:57.430
Which is another one of Delhi's UNESCO World
Heritage sites, and it's a big complex you

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:03.249
can walk around, see a number of different
monuments, it's like an entire walled in city,

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:10.099
and to be honest it sort of almost looks like
a college campus right now, but it's a nice

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:18.069
grounds to walk around and check out these
amazing historical sites.

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:23.719
Number seventeen is the chaotic business area
of Chandni Chowk and Chawri Bazar.

00:07:23.719 --> 00:07:34.639
I am in Delhi India, Old Delhi at Chandni
Chowk and this is one of the most busy business

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:41.610
and shopping districts in the old city, always
entertaining, always busy.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:47.169
There's basically anything you could ever
want to buy, as well as lots of famous restaurants,

00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:49.259
and lots of food to eat.

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:53.559
So Chandni Chowk, this is Old Delhi, India.

00:07:53.559 --> 00:07:58.219
While walking around Chandni Chowk, you can
visit the Sikh Temple, and just get lost in

00:07:58.219 --> 00:07:59.419
the market alleys.

00:07:59.419 --> 00:08:18.319
You'll also find incredible food like jalebis
and parathas in the area.

00:08:18.319 --> 00:08:24.749
Now one of the best ways to get around Chandni
Chowk in Delhi is by cycle rickshaw, and these

00:08:24.749 --> 00:08:31.599
guys can go anywhere, and it's amazing actually
the places they can fit and things they can

00:08:31.599 --> 00:08:33.860
get through and the busyness.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:34.860
wow.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:49.440
But it's definitely always an exciting ride.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.940
Number eighteen is Dilli Haat, a handicraft
market and village.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:58.529
I'm at the Dilli Haat which is kind of a central
handicraft market here in Delhi, set up by

00:08:58.529 --> 00:08:59.540
the tourism authority.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:07.819
Now it costs twenty rupees entrance fee, but
it's a fantastic place to purchase handicrafts

00:09:07.819 --> 00:09:09.870
from around the entire country.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:14.990
There's also different canteens, where you
can sample cuisine from around the entire

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:19.410
country, so that is what I'm looking forward
to most actually.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:23.350
Number nineteen is Paharganj, also known as
the main bazaar.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:30.019
And this is kind of the backpacker area, there's
lots of budget guest houses and hostels as

00:09:30.019 --> 00:09:35.019
well as a lot of restaurants and shopping
all around this street.

00:09:35.019 --> 00:09:41.529
And it's just a short walk from New Delhi
train station railway station, so this is

00:09:41.529 --> 00:09:50.690
called the main bazar area.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:54.709
Number twenty is the modern business district
of Connaught Place.

00:09:54.709 --> 00:09:58.660
This is Connaught Place, known more locally
just as CP.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:05.520
Full of all kinds of shopping, restaurants,
a lot of street vendors as well, but basically

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:11.250
anything you could want is available somewhere
within this gigantic roundabout, and there's

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:16.860
kind of like a series of roundabouts as well,
and then with a park in the middle, and also

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.550
an underground shopping center.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:25.050
CP is such a huge area that it's honestly
a little confusing, so be sure to decide where

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:27.769
you want to go and bring a map.

00:10:27.769 --> 00:10:34.680
Be careful of the crazy street crossings and
the many touts in the area.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.300
Number twenty one is Delhi street food.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:42.589
Stopping on the side of a road for a bowl
of chole, a rich chickpea curry, and a piping

00:10:42.589 --> 00:10:46.600
hot fresh chapati is one of the joys of visiting
Delhi.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:58.350
There are also numerous other tasty treats
to grab on the go while exploring.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:10.610
It’s up to you now to visit Delhi and experience
this diverse and interesting land that will

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:23.079
keep you on the edge of your seat occasionally,
but will keep amazed time after time again.

00:11:23.079 --> 00:11:25.630
Thank you very much for watching this video.

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:32.029
