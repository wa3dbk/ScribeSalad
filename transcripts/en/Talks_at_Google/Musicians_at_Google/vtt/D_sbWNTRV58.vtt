BRETT PERLMUTTER: My
name is Brett Perlmutter,

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.610
and I'm the head of Google Cuba.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.670
It is my distinct privilege to
welcome today's Talk at Google,

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.060
special guest, world-renowned
musician, stellar human being

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.970
hailing from the island of
Cuba, Mr. Harold Lopez-Nussa.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:29.617
Bienvenidos.

00:00:29.617 --> 00:00:30.950
Please join me in welcoming him.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.030

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.550
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.390
Today's talk is about
music, and it's not

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.000
about just enjoying music.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.750
It's about letting music be
the fabric that binds us.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.350
It's about music being a
tool to bridge countries,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.440
to build bilateral relations,
to build multilateral relations,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.630
to bring people together.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.760
Today's talk is also about Cuba.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.440
It's about what's
happening in Cuba.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.010
It's about why Cuba
punches above its weight

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.830
artistically and
creatively, and it's

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.100
about using the
internet as a platform

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.570
to share this content, this
culture, this rich, rich

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.570
musical history with
the rest of the world.

HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: [LAUGHS]

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:25.260
BRETT PERLMUTTER: Everyone
here is really anxious

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.950
to hear from you.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.120
We want to hear your music.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.460
We want to hear your stories.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.418
We're going to have a
lot of questions for you,

00:01:31.418 --> 00:01:33.960
but I'd be remiss to start
if I didn't tell the audience

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.300
a little bit about you.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.750
Harold was born in
Central Havana, Cuba

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.880
to a family of
esteemed musicians.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.490
He started playing piano when
he was only eight years old,

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.700
and after that he was
a part of many very

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.720
famous and prestigious Cuban
musical conservatories.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.870
After graduating from the
Instituto Superior de Artes,

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.970
the ISA, he toured with Omara
Portuondo of the Buena Vista

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.360
Social Club, and he worked with
the Cuban National Symphony

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.820
Orchestra before
releasing his first album,

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.550
"Canciones," in 2007.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.820
Now at a mere age
of 35 years old,

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.480
jazz pianist Harold Lopez-Nussa
has attained the kind

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.840
of international recognition
that most musicians only could

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.860
dream of--

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.040
first place at the Montreux
Jazz Festival solo piano

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.450
competition; a performance
at Paris's legendary Olympia;

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.270
yearly North American
and European tours;

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.540
and multiple album
releases to his name.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.020
Lopez-Nussa's music reflects
the full range and richness

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.440
of the canon of Cuban music
with its distinctive combination

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.470
of classical, folkloric,
and popular elements

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.520
as well as the embrace of jazz
improvisation and interactions.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.205
Lopez-Nussa chose the
new album's title,

00:02:51.205 --> 00:02:54.090
"Un Día Cualquiera," which
means "just another day,"

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.840
because, in his words, "the
idea is to put the music

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.430
and the trio together in
a studio and just play,

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.250
the way we three do
every day, any day,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.610
like a concert in the
living room of your house."

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.590
So welcome Harold
to Google's home.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.860

wonderful Google experience

00:16:26.498 --> 00:16:26.998

00:16:26.998 --> 00:16:28.982
So thank you for [INAUDIBLE].

BRETT PERLMUTTER:
Fabulous [INAUDIBLE]..

00:16:32.454 --> 00:16:41.382
You always said
[INAUDIBLE] Your last album

00:16:41.382 --> 00:16:44.854
before this was "El Viaje."

00:16:44.854 --> 00:17:00.726
So [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:00.726 --> 00:17:02.710
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA:
--Cuban government.

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:04.357
That's how allowed to--

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:05.190
[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:06.230
--Cuban artists.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:09.890
So that was a way
that I get this chance

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:11.910
to make a deal with
an American label

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:16.849
and have my first American
label album released, which

00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:18.819
was "El Viaje," "The Journey."

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:23.430
So I think that that was
incredible for Cuban people

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:24.900
and for Cuban
artists in my case.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:29.290
Musicians and painters,
writers, everybody,

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:32.670
we get more growth
from American artists.

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:36.030
We get more growth
from American people.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:40.460
And I think that's what almost
all the people in Cuba want.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.210
BRETT PERLMUTTER: And
what is "El Viaje"--

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:43.530
what's the trip?

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:44.946
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA:
Well, the trip

00:17:44.946 --> 00:17:48.060
is you can travel
with the music.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.670
You can travel.

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.660
That was the idea.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:57.680
We did this album with a
Senegal bass player and singer

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.410
that we met in Paris, and
all this thanks to the music

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:05.190
because music make us travel
physically and spiritually,

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:06.160
of course.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.210
So that was the point
with "El Viaje," so music

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.220
from many different places--

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.965
from Africa, from Nairobi,
from Cuba, of course,

00:18:13.965 --> 00:18:15.647
and of course from
here the jazz.

00:18:15.647 --> 00:18:16.980
BRETT PERLMUTTER: It's fabulous.

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.420
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: Thanks.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:21.750
BRETT PERLMUTTER: So let's
change topics slightly.

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.610
Actually I had the
privilege of seeing

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:27.900
you perform most recently in
Washington, DC at the Kennedy

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:31.140
Center for Performing Arts at
the Artes de Cuba Festival.

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.080
And you were there with
your brother and your uncle

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.470
and your father, if
I'm not mistaken.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:37.470
So it's a family affair.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:40.350
What is the role of
family, and how has that

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.750
created your musical identity?

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:48.000
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: Well,
it's really important for me.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.520
Have the chance
to born in Havana.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.350
My mother, she was
a piano teacher.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:53.640
My father, he played drums.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.470
My uncle, he played piano.

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:59.260
My grandmother, who teach me
a lot of things about music,

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.130
she was a piano player--
no professional,

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:02.520
but a great piano player.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.340
The piano that I have in
my house is from her today.

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.760
So they teach us--

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.020
they loved the
music, and I think

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.980
that I learned
from my grandmother

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.870
this that I try
to say every time.

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:17.700
Music puts people together.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.200
I went to many
concerts with her,

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.850
and I remembered that she
was telling me all the time,

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:28.160
you see all these people here
just listening to the music.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.490
This help the world.

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:32.730
And I am sure music
help the world--

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:35.820
help people be together,
sitting together no matter

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.910
your race, no matter your
religion, no matter anything

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:40.380
politic, no matter anything.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:45.120
Music is the universal language
and can put people together,

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.190
and no doubt about that.

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:54.640
And I grew up taking a lot
of advice from my family,

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.880
from my father, from my
uncle, from my mother.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.900
And now to be able to play
with my father and my uncle

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.910
in the same band,
it's wonderful.

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:06.060
It's something that I want to
do more and more because now I'm

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.100
sharing my music with
them, and they've been

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.480
playing my own compositions.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.930
For me, it's very special.

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.270
I was learning from them.

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:14.520
They are learning
my own compositions.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.990
This is something that
I really appreciated

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:20.412
and that I really loved to do.

00:20:20.412 --> 00:20:21.870
BRETT PERLMUTTER:
That's beautiful.

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:23.940
And are your kids
going to be musicians?

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:25.920
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA:
I don't know.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.200
I have two daughters, and
they dance all the day.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.440
So I don't know if they will
be dancing or musicians,

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.640
but they love music.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.840
BRETT PERLMUTTER:
Something related to art.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.423
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA:
That's true, yeah.

00:20:35.423 --> 00:20:36.790
BRETT PERLMUTTER: That's great.

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:39.330
So the other thing I wanted
to mention about the Kennedy

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:42.900
Center is, at Google we had
the great fortune to be able

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.770
to participate by
live-streaming the event--

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:45.895
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: Really?

00:20:45.895 --> 00:20:46.170
Wow.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.690
BRETT PERLMUTTER: --so people
could see it live on YouTube.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:51.930
And we actually had a live
stream set up in Havana

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:56.460
so people in Cuba could see the
live stream, which brings me

00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:00.990
to this general concept of,
how can the internet help

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:05.130
promote Cuban arts and Cuban
culture and Cuban music?

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:08.400
How can platforms
like Google or YouTube

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:12.692
help share what's so special
about what you're doing?

00:21:12.692 --> 00:21:15.150
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: It could
be like the most important way

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:16.149
to promote the art, man.

00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:16.950
It's the future.

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:19.890
I mean, this is the way
that things happen today.

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:23.520
And in Cuba we're
far away from that

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.270
because we don't have
internet connection.

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:28.640
It's very hard to get
internet connection

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.730
everywhere and all that.

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:35.100
So I remember that when I was in
Washington and my family was--

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.020
I didn't know that
was thanks to Google,

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:41.300
but thank you because my family
watched it, the concert that

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.890
happened at Kennedy Center,
in Cuba, and that was great.

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:44.530
BRETT PERLMUTTER: Fabulous.

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:45.010
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: Fabulous.

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:46.260
This is unique.

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:47.220
And this is the future.

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.410
You cannot stop that.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:51.660
It's wonderful.

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.870
The power to have
internet to promote art

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:59.180
is something that we
need to take with us

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:01.900
and do things with this.

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:05.890
BRETT PERLMUTTER: So if Google
could wave its magic wand

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:09.378
and grant all of your internet
wishes, what would they be?

00:22:09.378 --> 00:22:10.461
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: Sorry?

00:22:10.461 --> 00:22:14.310
BRETT PERLMUTTER: So
if we had the ability

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:17.700
to do anything in our magic
ball, if we had magic,

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:21.466
and if we could grant your
wish, what would your wish be?

00:22:21.466 --> 00:22:23.340
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: Oh,
put internet in Cuba.

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:24.950
BRETT PERLMUTTER: OK, [SPANISH]

00:22:25.931 --> 00:22:27.180
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: Por favor.

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.600
Please.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.800
BRETT PERLMUTTER:
[SPANISH] OK, cool.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.860
So I want to talk
about the roots

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:40.350
and the tradition of your
music and your compositions.

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:46.420
You come from a very,
very rich musical history

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:49.140
that I don't think
outside of Cuba people

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.620
understand the depth of.

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:56.800
And your music even has
traces of Afro-Cuban music.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:03.174
I think one of your
songs is [SPANISH]..

00:23:03.174 --> 00:23:05.340
Could you tell us a little
bit about the antecedents

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:06.540
of your own music?

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:07.831
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: Well, yeah.

00:23:07.831 --> 00:23:11.100
Definitely our music
have a lot of influence,

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.130
different influence, and
we have a great tradition

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:17.580
in Cuba about
traditional Cuban music

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:19.575
that we call popular music.

00:23:19.575 --> 00:23:25.260
And we have these Afro-Cuban
related to religious,

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.960
to African religions
Yoruba, Abakuá.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:31.230
The first song that we just
played is called "Elegua."

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:34.185
and Elegua is one of the
gods in the Yoruba religion.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.840
When they do a ceremony, they
sing for Elegua and they have

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:46.090
the batá drums playing a rhythm,
and they have people who sing.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:49.320
And this composition
that we did is--

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.770
we took this root
with this [HUMMING]..

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:55.430
The batá drums make
something like [HUMMING]..

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.580
And then they sing, [SPANISH].

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:02.770
We put some voice over there.

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:04.800
So we took that from
there, and then we

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.460
tried to put in our
way of today until it

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:10.320
gets more contemporary.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.170
That's from there and
then from the sun,

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:14.910
and from the cha-cha-cha,
from the bolero,

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:17.260
from many, many places.

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:20.370
So I think that our music
have a lot from there

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:22.020
and then, of course,
from the jazz

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:26.790
because we are in love with
jazz and we listen a lot.

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:30.090
I listened a lot to jazz
when I was a kid in my home.

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:33.102
And also with classical
great composers

00:24:33.102 --> 00:24:34.560
because the three
of us, we studied

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.340
in the school classical music.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.760
This is what we're
learning in Cuba.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:42.240
When you learn music,
it's just about classical.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.480
So the three of
us, we studied all

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:47.490
of the great classical
and European composers.

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:50.030
So I think it's a mix
between all of these,

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:52.362
and more things are
coming every day.

00:24:52.362 --> 00:24:53.820
BRETT PERLMUTTER:
That's wonderful.

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:58.160
So who are your
jazz inspirations?

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.100
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA:
Well, I have many.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.180
I remember more my
father used to listen

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:07.788
a lot of Miles Davis and
[INAUDIBLE] in my house.

00:25:07.788 --> 00:25:09.630
This gives me a lot
of inspiration--

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:12.600
Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.240
My uncle introduced me to
the world of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.520
He's a huge fan as well as me.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.965
And then a lot of Cuban
musicians I know from Benny

00:25:19.965 --> 00:25:22.990
Moré through Juan
Gonzalez, Bebo Valdés,

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:25.980
the father of Chucho Valdés,
two greatest piano player from

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:31.545
Cuba, from many, many musicians
that inspires us a lot.

00:25:31.545 --> 00:25:34.170
BRETT PERLMUTTER: So what was it
like to grow up in your house?

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:37.870
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA:
Oh, a little crazy.

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:42.330
We was born-- my brother,
he played drums with me.

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:46.000
We was born in a very little
apartment in Central Havana.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.600
So I remember that
we have the dining

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:52.275
room was the piano of my mother,
and then in a kind of mezzanine

00:25:52.275 --> 00:25:57.060
the drums of my father on the
bed of my mother and my father.

00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:01.700
So yeah, we have all day friends
of my father coming to my house

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:05.910
and play, some student from
mother coming to my house

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:06.810
and take lessons.

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:10.630
So music was like
part of our day.

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:14.410
Like play baseball,
eat, see television,

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:15.840
and listen to music.

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:16.757
It's something-- yeah.

00:26:16.757 --> 00:26:18.715
BRETT PERLMUTTER: It's
basically in your blood.

00:26:18.715 --> 00:26:20.440
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA:
Yeah, definitely.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:23.541
BRETT PERLMUTTER: So who here
knows the Buena Vista Social

00:26:23.541 --> 00:26:24.040
Club?

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:27.580
I think most, almost everyone.

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:30.880
Tell us about your
experience with Omara?

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:34.020
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: Well,
that was amazing for me.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:37.550
Omara, she was
famous in the world

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:39.250
thanks to Buena
Vista Social Club,

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:42.320
but she has been
famous in Cuba forever.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.040
So when I was a kid,
she was from forever.

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:52.030
She is like one of the greatest
artists in Cuba from all times.

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:56.420
I was very lucky to be able to
play with her, travel with her.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.620
I was traveling with
her for three years

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.160
all around the world.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.550
I was able to record
with her and invite her

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:04.850
to one of my CDs.

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:06.470
And she's a wonderful person.

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:09.070
She is so smart.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:10.870
She is so cute.

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:13.750
She's so talented.

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:17.130
That was amazing for me, and
I learned a lot of things.

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:22.810
I learned the respect for the
music at that level is like--

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:25.450
I remember sometimes
we're getting back

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:29.830
from three-month tour
to Cuba, and I was just

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:34.000
sitting in my sofa of my living
room and I put the television.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.540
I saw Omara live on the TV.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:36.440
I was like, wow!

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.230
How she can do that?

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:41.270
She's in the music all the time.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:46.900
So that's help,
and that gives me

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:50.130
a lot more respect for the music
and more love to the music.

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:51.202
Yeah, she showed me that.

00:27:51.202 --> 00:27:52.660
BRETT PERLMUTTER:
So that must have

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:55.590
been one of your most formative
experiences, working with her.

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:56.430
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: Definitely.

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:58.900
BRETT PERLMUTTER: What else was
another formative experience

00:27:58.900 --> 00:27:59.525
in your career?

00:27:59.525 --> 00:28:03.100
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA:
Oh, many things.

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.310
For example, right
now have the chance

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:08.740
to be able to play
in the States was

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:10.990
a dream for me for many years.

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:13.480
Took my music to the
American audience,

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:17.760
and now I have been able to
do it thanks to many people

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:18.730
who helped me--

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:23.560
great manager that I have
that is American, great people

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:26.770
who really support us
and help us to be here

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:29.830
tonight and tomorrow in
Iowa and then in Monterey

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.330
and then San Francisco.

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:32.470
And this is wonderful.

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:35.620
This is the most
important for me

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:38.950
is take my music to different
audience, see the reaction,

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:42.650
make new friends,
know new people.

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:45.970
That was always my
dream when I was a kid

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:48.190
and is still my dream.

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:51.130
Get more attention in my
music, this is something

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:53.120
that not many musicians can do.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:58.050
So I'm very proud and I'm very
grateful to be able to do that.

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:00.550
BRETT PERLMUTTER: So what was
your first visit to the United

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:02.100
States?

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:04.680
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: Well, with
Omara like some years ago,

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.650
maybe 10.

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:11.990
But then with my own [INAUDIBLE]
was like six years ago I think.

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:13.870
I made this little
tour, just my brother

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:16.570
and I. We even was not
able to have a bass

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:20.150
player with us because we
was in the very beginning.

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:22.885
So we did some
concert in California

00:29:22.885 --> 00:29:26.410
and we played in New
York for one day.

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:30.640
From there until today we
have been coming every year

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.650
like two, three, four times.

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:35.700
So I'm very happy to
be able to do that.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.450
BRETT PERLMUTTER: So
it sounds like you've

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:39.450
learned a lot from your
experience in the United

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:40.305
States.

00:29:40.305 --> 00:29:41.200
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: I'm sorry?

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.010
BRETT PERLMUTTER: It
sounds like you've

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:43.955
learned a lot from your
experience in the United

00:29:43.955 --> 00:29:44.050
States.

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:45.674
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA:
Yeah, I'm learning,

00:29:45.674 --> 00:29:50.410
and mostly I'm learning about
people in the United States

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:53.360
who are incredible.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:58.751
We are so close from the people,
the real people in the United

00:29:58.751 --> 00:29:59.250
States.

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:01.661
In Cuba we have a lot
of things in common.

00:30:01.661 --> 00:30:02.660
We love the same things.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:03.869
We love baseball.

00:30:03.869 --> 00:30:04.910
Baseball we love in Cuba.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:06.320
You love baseball here.

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:07.820
So we love music, of course.

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:09.050
We love jazz in Cuba.

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:11.510
You guys, you love Cuban music.

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:15.290
So it's many things in common.

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:19.404
So I'm very happy to
come here more and more.

00:30:19.404 --> 00:30:21.320
BRETT PERLMUTTER: And
we're happy to have you.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.760
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: Thanks.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.830
BRETT PERLMUTTER: So for
people from the United

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:27.680
States and people
watching around the world,

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.210
what should we learn from you?

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:32.560
What should we
learn from Cubans?

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:34.610
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA:
Well, I don't know,

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:39.450
maybe that we don't care about--

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:41.870
well, we care, but
even when we are not

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:46.400
able to get all
that we need, we are

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:50.497
able to be happy
with what we have.

00:30:50.497 --> 00:30:52.330
I'm sorry, I don't know
if I explain myself.

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:53.792
BRETT PERLMUTTER: Perfect.

00:30:53.792 --> 00:30:56.000
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: But
yeah, I mean, people in Cuba,

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.230
they share a lot of things.

00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:01.030
That's what I love
the more in Cuba.

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:02.440
They share sugar.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.560
They share salt.
They share chicken.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:05.390
They share music.

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:08.180
They share life.

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:11.480
Life is very close
from one for another.

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:15.230
I'm very close with all my
neighborhood over there.

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:20.270
Everybody knows me, say
hello to me in the streets.

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:23.850
For me, I have a lot of support.

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:26.720
I feel that I have a lot of
support from people in Cuba.

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.550
So this is something different.

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:31.284
The life is quite
different here.

00:31:31.284 --> 00:31:33.200
Sometimes it's not that
good because sometimes

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.090
your neighborhood,
he put the music loud

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:38.350
at 1:00 AM in the morning.

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:41.840
You can't say anything
because last weekend you

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.426
did the same thing.

00:31:44.426 --> 00:31:47.450
But well.

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:49.460
BRETT PERLMUTTER: So
you're on this tour.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:51.980
You're here in Google New York.

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:54.230
You said you're going to
California, to San Francisco,

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:55.688
and going around
the United States.

00:31:55.688 --> 00:32:01.220
You've just been in Spain,
in France, in Japan.

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.239
You're from Central Havana.

00:32:03.239 --> 00:32:05.030
Did you ever think you
would be doing this?

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:07.320
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: No, never.

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:11.600
That was always a dream, but no.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.700
That's more than
I was expecting.

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:17.450
So I'm very, very happy,
and I'm trying to do it--

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:21.570
I hope that I keep the
level to keep doing that

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:22.670
and to deserve that.

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:24.247
This is wonderful.

00:32:24.247 --> 00:32:25.580
BRETT PERLMUTTER: It's fabulous.

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:27.260
Well, I have one last question.

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:30.230
But before I ask it, I want
to ask folks from the audience

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:32.810
if they have questions
to please stand up,

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:36.380
and you can come up to the mics
and ask anything and everything

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:37.290
that you would like.

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.640
Please, if you just
go up to the mic

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:46.195
so your question is recorded.

00:32:46.195 --> 00:32:47.880
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:48.720
I'm Cuban.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.920
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: Oh, wow.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.599
AUDIENCE: I've
been once to Cuba,

00:32:51.599 --> 00:32:52.890
but my parents were born there.

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:53.610
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: Oh, wow.

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:55.680
AUDIENCE: And my
question is, what do you

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.939
miss most about Cuba
when you're abroad?

00:32:57.939 --> 00:32:59.730
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA:
When I am outside Cuba?

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:00.460
AUDIENCE: When you're traveling.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:01.560
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA:
Oh, my family--

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:02.760
my family and my friends.

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.900
I have two little daughters.

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.710
I have a wife and I
have a lot of friends.

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:09.050
And yeah, I miss them a lot.

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:13.420
AUDIENCE: And have your
daughters come to the States?

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:16.500
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: Yeah, the
bigger one, who have only five,

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:20.710
I took her like 20 days
ago with me for a week.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:24.180
So she was able to get
to New York, Boston.

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:27.470
She was getting crazy
with United States.

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:30.810
She was telling all
their friends over there,

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:33.940
oh, I was there.

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:35.960
AUDIENCE: Well, your
performance was incredible.

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:36.240
Thank you.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:37.140
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: Oh, thanks.

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:37.920
Thank you.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.086
BRETT PERLMUTTER: Thank you.

00:33:39.086 --> 00:33:39.602
Please?

00:33:39.602 --> 00:33:41.310
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
coming and giving us

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:42.135
such a great performance.

00:33:42.135 --> 00:33:43.270
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: My pleasure.

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:45.311
AUDIENCE: When I was
watching you play like this,

00:33:45.311 --> 00:33:46.320
it was totally crazy.

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:49.710
And I'm curious, how much is
improv versus you're going

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:50.970
to play exactly that stuff?

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:55.080
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: Oh,
there's a lot of improv, yeah.

00:33:55.080 --> 00:34:01.340
We have a song that
we do, just the song,

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:03.970
and then it's just
improvisation.

00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:07.260
So we took from there and
we tried to create things.

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:11.280
And of course when you do
this every day, sometimes

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:15.969
you do same thing, that same
phrase that you did yesterday.

00:34:15.969 --> 00:34:19.030
But we are always trying to
don't do the same things.

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:22.350
So this is the
complicated part, to be

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:25.140
able to create every
day a different phrase,

00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:28.439
a different freedom
in the improvisation.

00:34:28.439 --> 00:34:29.730
But there is a lot, definitely.

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:33.210
And with those guys who
knows me that well, for me

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:34.800
it's very easy.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.989
They always give me
something to create.

00:34:36.989 --> 00:34:40.800
So yeah, we listen to each
other a lot, and from there

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.040
we try to create and create.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:47.085
AUDIENCE: Was it hard to
learn music from your parents?

00:34:47.085 --> 00:34:48.960
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: No,
they helped me a lot.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.580
They helped me a lot.

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:52.060
My mother, she was
sitting with me

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:56.100
in the piano when I was a kid
trying to study and practice

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:57.060
with me a lot.

00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:00.090
I was like, argh, I don't want.

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:01.960
I want to play baseball.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:05.220
And she goes, no, you need
to do it one more time.

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:09.330
But thanks to that I am
able today to play piano.

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:12.990
But they support me a lot, not
just when I was a little kid.

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:18.000
Then when I was trying to
change from classical music

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.760
to play something else
like jazz or Cuban music,

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:21.900
they support me a lot.

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:24.360
I didn't have the
support from my teachers,

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.960
but I do have from my family.

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:30.030
So I'm very grateful
for all the support

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:32.060
that they give me until today.

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:33.400
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.240
BRETT PERLMUTTER: Thank you.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.340
I think we have another
question over here.

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:39.298
AUDIENCE: Are you playing
any shows in New York

00:35:39.298 --> 00:35:40.057
while you're here?

00:35:40.057 --> 00:35:41.390
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: No, not now.

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:44.000
We was playing at the
Jazz Standard tonight

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:44.959
and at the end of July.

00:35:44.959 --> 00:35:47.500
AUDIENCE: And my second is, I
was wondering if you could just

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.820
talk about the future of jazz
music and what you think,

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:51.060
like where it's going?

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:53.570
Because I feel like it's been
a medium that's kind of stayed

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:56.600
standing still for a long time,
and I'm wondering where do you

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:57.831
see it going in the future?

00:35:57.831 --> 00:35:59.330
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA:
Jazz in general?

00:35:59.330 --> 00:35:59.996
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:59.996 --> 00:36:01.370
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA:
Well, I think

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:04.830
that there's a lot of young
musicians trying things.

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:08.240
It's sometimes hard
because jazz is not

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:13.510
getting that big attention
in the world, unfortunately.

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:16.280
But there's still
great festivals

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:21.220
all around the world in Europe,
in Asia, here in the States.

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:24.100
And there is a lot of young
people trying to do things.

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:27.020
That's where we
are trying to take

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:30.700
from what we know
from our [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:32.870
and put new things into that.

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:35.830
So there is people doing
it here in the States.

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:39.940
New York is, of course,
it's the top of the top.

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:43.030
Here there is so
many jazz artists

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:45.080
from all around the world.

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.140
But there is people in Europe.

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:48.950
There's people in Cuba.

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:52.360
There's a lot of young people
doing things, incredible.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:56.190
Unfortunately not everyone is
able to take his art to here.

00:36:56.190 --> 00:37:01.870
But I think that I don't know.

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:04.660
I don't know for
sure, but we will try.

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:07.180
We will try to get
the jazz active,

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:11.020
of course, and get attention
from more people, yeah.

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:13.870
BRETT PERLMUTTER: I have
one last question for you,

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:17.590
and it's about the
last song that you're

00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:20.675
going to play for us, which I
believe is called "Hialeah."

00:37:20.675 --> 00:37:22.300
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA:
Oh, we just played.

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:23.560
BRETT PERLMUTTER: Oh,
you already played it?

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.720
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: Sorry,
I always change the--

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.380
BRETT PERLMUTTER: The order.

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:27.090
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA:
--the schedule.

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:27.520
Sorry.

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:28.395
BRETT PERLMUTTER: OK.

00:37:28.395 --> 00:37:29.530
So--

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:31.430
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA:
But yeah, "Hialeah."

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:36.520
"Hialeah" is a neighborhood
in Miami where a lot of Cubans

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:37.020
live there.

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:38.260
It's like a little Cuba.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:41.590
You go there and there's people
playing dominoes on the street.

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:42.340
Music is loud.

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:48.730
They share sugar and
chicken also over there,

00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:51.010
so it's almost like Cuba.

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:55.490
When I was there my first
time, they blew my mind,

00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:58.560
so I wrote this little
piece for Hialeah.

00:37:58.560 --> 00:37:59.792
And I call it like that.

00:37:59.792 --> 00:38:01.750
BRETT PERLMUTTER: And
what does it mean to you?

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:04.360
What is Hialeah and,
more broadly, Miami?

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:09.500
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA:
Oh, you know in Cuba we

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:12.310
listen a lot of bad
sins about Miami people.

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:14.620
They are the gang in Cuba.

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:16.940
Then again are
political over there.

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:22.030
And when I first visited
Miami I was like at home,

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:24.220
and I have so many
friends over there.

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:27.140
I have family, friends.

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:28.090
It's almost Cuba.

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:33.720
When I get off from the
plane, they speak Spanish.

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:37.870
They are close to United States,
but they are almost Cuba.

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:39.895
So I feel so well over there.

00:38:39.895 --> 00:38:42.890
And all the times that I get
there, I have a great time.

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:46.024
So I love Miami.

00:38:46.024 --> 00:38:47.440
BRETT PERLMUTTER:
Well, I actually

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.750
think that kind of brings
us full circle to where

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:52.660
we started, that your
life's experience,

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:55.390
your music is really
testament to the fact

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:56.829
that we have so much in common--

00:38:56.829 --> 00:38:58.120
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: Definitely.

00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.620
BRETT PERLMUTTER: --so much
to learn from each other,

00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:01.610
and so much to
share back and forth

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:03.610
and with the rest of the world.

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:06.387
So thank you for doing that
here with us at Google New York.

00:39:06.387 --> 00:39:07.720
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: My pleasure.

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.220
BRETT PERLMUTTER: And you
have one more song for us.

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:10.550
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: Oh, yeah.

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:12.460
So as I changed--

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:13.750
let me see.

00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:16.330
I think that we're going to
play a song by my brother.

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:17.580
The name is "Guajira."

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:22.792
And guajira is a kind of
music from the country--

00:39:22.792 --> 00:39:23.500
the countryside--

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:24.355
BRETT PERLMUTTER: Of Cuba?

00:39:24.355 --> 00:39:25.520
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: --so
the countryside of Cuba,

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:27.927
so like country music
from Cuba, I don't know,

00:39:27.927 --> 00:39:28.760
something like that.

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.400
So "Guajira," we're
going to play for you.

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.590
BRETT PERLMUTTER: All right,
well thank you so much.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:31.960
HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA:
No, thank you.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.020
Thanks so much.

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:33.730
It's a pleasure.

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:34.030
Thank you.

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:35.113
BRETT PERLMUTTER: Gracias.

00:39:35.113 --> 00:39:35.731
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:35.731 --> 00:39:36.730
I'll take this from you.

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:37.330
Thank you.
