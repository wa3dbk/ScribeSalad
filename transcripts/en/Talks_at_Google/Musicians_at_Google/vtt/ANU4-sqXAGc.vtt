&gt;&gt; Without further ado,

00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:13.300
let's bring out the band.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.200
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for One Republic.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.400
[applause and cheering]

00:00:17.400 --> 00:01:09.700
♪ [rock music]

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.567
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:11.567 --> 00:01:14.734
&gt;&gt; Mm. Feel right.
Just kidding.

00:01:14.734 --> 00:01:15.500
&gt;&gt; Welcome, guys.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.033
You know, I wanted to start off just by
saying -- I was talking a little bit --

00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:21.333
when you guys were
in the Green Room --

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.900
how much we, here at Google,

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.900
really appreciate your support in what
we're trying to do here with music.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.500
It's a humble and modest start.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.100
Our goal is really about kind of closing
that gap between you -- the artist

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.567
and your music -- and our millions
and millions of end users.

00:01:37.567 --> 00:01:39.633
So, since Day One,

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:43.633
when we called you guys up and pitched
this idea what we're working on,

00:01:43.633 --> 00:01:48.300
having not even had a chance to see it
or play with it or do a music search,

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.667
you jumped right on board,

00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:51.133
lended your support,

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:53.333
came down for an amazing,

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:55.667
amazing launch event in West Hollywood.

00:01:55.667 --> 00:01:58.600
And we really appreciate that. How
about a hand for these guys for that?

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.967
Really appreciate it.
[applause and cheering]

00:02:02.967 --> 00:02:04.300
That really makes this whole thing complete.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.567
Thanks a lot.

00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:07.166
So, you know,
what we wanted to do is,

00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:11.467
just open this up to a
little bit of a conversation.

00:02:11.467 --> 00:02:12.834
I'm excited about the new album.

00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:14.000
I definitely want to talk about that.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.200
But, I want to go back to the beginning for
some of the people here in the audience.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.867
Ryan, Zach -- maybe you guys can give us
a little bit of a peek into the early days

00:02:21.867 --> 00:02:24.934
of One Republic and how it came to be.

00:02:24.934 --> 00:02:28.200
And how you're sort of getting to today.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.834
&gt;&gt; Soccer.
It's all about soccer.

00:02:29.834 --> 00:02:32.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.467
Well, yes. I think a lot of people know,
but not everyone knows it.

00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:38.967
Ryan and I went to high school together
in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

00:02:38.967 --> 00:02:42.633
And it was senior year.

00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:45.233
I'd already been there one
year from the Chicago area.

00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:48.066
And, senior year, Ryan came in
from Oklahoma

00:02:48.066 --> 00:02:50.700
and scored three goals
on the first game.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.367
So, at that point,

00:02:51.367 --> 00:02:54.300
I was like, "Dude, I'm going to
hang out with this guy."

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.033
So, you know, at that point,

00:02:57.033 --> 00:02:58.633
we were in high school,

00:02:58.633 --> 00:03:01.700
and we had like dreams and aspirations --

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.900
talked about music and someday
like doing the band thing.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.233
And back then,
it was just high school like,

00:03:08.233 --> 00:03:10.066
"Let's do a band!" You know.

00:03:10.066 --> 00:03:12.300
After high school,
he went to separate college,

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.333
worked on songwriting and
a bunch of other things.

00:03:14.333 --> 00:03:17.333
I went to a different college.

00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:21.233
Actually tried engineering for
a couple years -- aeronautical.

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:23.333
And I didn't have the focus for that,

00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:28.333
so props to all of you all who are
engineers in this building. [laughter]

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:32.000
So then, after that,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.967
we kind of you know,

00:03:32.967 --> 00:03:35.867
Ryan worked on --
like I said -- songwriting.

00:03:35.867 --> 00:03:37.133
I couldn't figure out what I was doing.

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:40.500
I ended up in Chicago and --
fast forward --

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.133
Ryan called and was talking to
me about some of the people

00:03:44.133 --> 00:03:46.800
he had worked with -- Timbaland,
being one of them.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.300
So he had a really good start
to everything in terms of, you know,

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.266
"I know some people.
I know Timbaland,

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:54.567
blah, blah, blah.

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.233
And here's some songs
I've been working on."

00:03:56.233 --> 00:03:59.800
And I was completely on board, so.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.033
Then it went,
fast forward to L.A.,

00:04:03.033 --> 00:04:05.100
and I let someone else field that,

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:12.867
but L.A. was a whole another ball
of wax to conquer for us.

00:04:12.867 --> 00:04:14.066
&gt;&gt; So can you.

00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:14.800
&gt;&gt; What?

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.033
&gt;&gt; And so can you.

00:04:16.033 --> 00:04:17.033
&gt;&gt; And we'll see you there.

00:04:17.033 --> 00:04:20.000
[chuckles]

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.033
&gt;&gt; So, let's fast forward a little bit, right?

00:04:24.033 --> 00:04:25.266
"Dreaming Out Loud",

00:04:25.266 --> 00:04:27.867
incredible album --
one of my favorites.

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:31.667
And one of the things that I noticed
that just blew me away

00:04:31.667 --> 00:04:35.834
in surfing around online and looking
at your online presence.

00:04:35.834 --> 00:04:37.467
And naturally,

00:04:37.467 --> 00:04:39.500
I check out all your videos on YouTube.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.166
And I was sort of surprised,
but I guess I shouldn't have been.

00:04:43.166 --> 00:04:49.233
But, even these numbers start to kind of set
a new order of magnitude for the digital era.

00:04:49.233 --> 00:04:51.633
Where, you know, in the old days --
or I guess even today.

00:04:51.633 --> 00:04:54.567
We're still tracking gold and
platinum and diamond albums.

00:04:54.567 --> 00:04:57.100
But I noticed that "Apologize",

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.667
one of your awesome tracks
off of that album has, in fact,

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:05.533
now gotten over 130 million views
on YouTube,

00:05:05.533 --> 00:05:07.233
which is just incredible.

00:05:07.233 --> 00:05:09.867
I don't know if there's a number for that,
some kind of like,

00:05:09.867 --> 00:05:12.567
'sapphire' or.
&gt;&gt; Take back Garth Brooks.

00:05:12.567 --> 00:05:16.433
&gt;&gt; That's right.
I mean, it's a completely different order.

00:05:16.433 --> 00:05:19.333
&gt;&gt; He just said,
it's either adamantium or titanium.

00:05:19.333 --> 00:05:20.400
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.033
&gt;&gt; Diamond is technically ten million,
so it's probably adamantium.

00:05:24.033 --> 00:05:25.333
I think that's what it is.

00:05:25.333 --> 00:05:27.100
&gt;&gt; Well, we've got to come up with
something for it, because, you know,

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.567
this is the new world order.

00:05:29.567 --> 00:05:31.500
And you were telling me an
interesting story about that.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.533
In the early days of the band,

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:39.133
and using the web and the Internet
as really a key marketing component

00:05:39.133 --> 00:05:43.967
to getting OneRepublic, you know,
in the minds of your fans.

00:05:43.967 --> 00:05:45.734
Can you talk a little bit about that?

00:05:45.734 --> 00:05:53.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's kind of ironic that I somehow ended
up with a degree in advertising and marketing,

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.867
and I never thought I was
actually going to use it.

00:05:55.867 --> 00:06:01.266
And, you know, when you're broke,

00:06:01.266 --> 00:06:04.400
and you're trying to get
something off the ground,

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.834
'free' is always a really good incentivizer.

00:06:08.834 --> 00:06:12.333
So, when MySpace --

00:06:12.333 --> 00:06:16.333
Drew signed us up for MySpace when
it had what -- like four, five million users.

00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:19.567
&gt;&gt; That was like 2003 or 2004
or something.

00:06:19.567 --> 00:06:22.367
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It was kind of one
of those deals, kind of like--

00:06:22.367 --> 00:06:24.567
I remember the first time
somebody told me about Google,

00:06:24.567 --> 00:06:31.000
I was using, you know, back in --
that was my R.A. of my junior year.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.600
So it was like 2000,
something like that, '99.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.967
If you wanted to find something,
you'd go to Lycos,

00:06:35.967 --> 00:06:36.967
then you go to Yahoo,

00:06:36.967 --> 00:06:41.233
then you'd go to Microsoft, you know,
you go to all the different searches.

00:06:41.233 --> 00:06:44.133
And he said, "You got to use --
this kind of puts it all together."

00:06:44.133 --> 00:06:46.033
MySpace was kind of like
that for us musically,

00:06:46.033 --> 00:06:52.400
because it was free and
it had this sense of like,

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.767
the numbers were doubling every
month -- twice as many users,

00:06:55.767 --> 00:06:58.033
if not more.

00:06:58.033 --> 00:07:02.834
And the whole thought that I could just
have basically access to a database

00:07:02.834 --> 00:07:05.700
of tens of millions of people for free.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.266
So we just started working it every day.

00:07:09.266 --> 00:07:12.934
We would e-mail --

00:07:12.934 --> 00:07:16.300
this was before -- I didn't know how to
do spam or any of that, so I would --

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.934
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that was actually before.
&gt;&gt; That was before spam.

00:07:18.934 --> 00:07:22.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we lucked out.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.533
At the time that we kind of jumped on like,
Internet self-promotion as a band,

00:07:28.533 --> 00:07:37.834
it was right before that big wave of a
bunch of like really spam bots and like,

00:07:37.834 --> 00:07:41.133
pretty much everything that ran, you know?

00:07:41.133 --> 00:07:44.667
Like shameless self-internet
promotion into the ground.

00:07:44.667 --> 00:07:46.934
We sort of got in right
before that happened.

00:07:46.934 --> 00:07:49.633
And that was a big part of, you know,

00:07:49.633 --> 00:07:53.767
like our crusade like actually
have any authenticity.

00:07:53.767 --> 00:07:58.000
&gt;&gt; It was a new technology or a new,
you know,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.967
it was better than --
what was the thing before?

00:07:59.967 --> 00:08:01.066
Friend space, or?

00:08:01.066 --> 00:08:05.834
&gt;&gt; Well, there was MP3.com
and there was--

00:08:05.834 --> 00:08:09.100
&gt;&gt; Pure Volume,
and then MySpace.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.667
&gt;&gt; Yeah there was that.

00:08:10.667 --> 00:08:12.533
That sort of void.

00:08:12.533 --> 00:08:14.633
And we jumped on it.

00:08:14.633 --> 00:08:19.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it just kind of spread like,
by word of mouth.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.767
And since there wasn't much
spamming going on,

00:08:21.767 --> 00:08:24.033
everybody every time they
get an e-mail from us,

00:08:24.033 --> 00:08:26.166
they thought, "Oh, this dude
is e-mailing me, you know?"

00:08:26.166 --> 00:08:28.767
It was genuine. It was like
people reaching out to people.

00:08:28.767 --> 00:08:31.934
And so, we quickly climbed the --

00:08:31.934 --> 00:08:34.133
I remember the first day
we got 5000 spins in a day.

00:08:34.133 --> 00:08:36.900
I was like, "Oh, my God.
5000 people getting e-mails from like

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.033
Romania and stuff like that."

00:08:39.033 --> 00:08:41.600
And then, 50,000
and then 100, 000.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.333
And we were getting --
we didn't have a record deal,

00:08:43.333 --> 00:08:46.233
and we're getting 100,000 plays
a day on MySpace.

00:08:46.233 --> 00:08:48.300
So that was, at that point --

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.767
we were the top-ranked unsigned act
on MySpace for almost a year.

00:08:51.767 --> 00:08:52.266
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:08:52.266 --> 00:08:54.567
&gt;&gt; And every label started calling us.

00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:58.567
And we'd already been dropped
by a record label at that point. So we,

00:08:58.567 --> 00:09:01.834
yeah -- MySpace,
I've said this at the, you know,

00:09:01.834 --> 00:09:04.500
Google Music Launch the other day,
and I mean it.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.734
This band wouldn't be around if
it weren't for that technology--

00:09:07.734 --> 00:09:09.100
for that, you know, interface --

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:13.100
because that was the only validation
we had when we got dropped.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.133
We were like,
"Well, I guess that's it."

00:09:15.133 --> 00:09:17.700
And then, boom!
We exploded on the Internet.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.100
And it was like,
"Okay, it's working."

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.000
you know, screw the record labels --
people actually want to hear this.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.967
And yeah.
The rest is history.

00:09:24.967 --> 00:09:28.633
&gt;&gt; Well, the other funny thing
about certain building,

00:09:28.633 --> 00:09:35.066
like building up our grassroots
movement like from there is,

00:09:35.066 --> 00:09:44.266
it kind of was really difficult to go beyond
like a specific vehicle like MySpace,

00:09:44.266 --> 00:09:48.734
because we were completely unsearchable
before we changed our name,

00:09:48.734 --> 00:09:51.133
which was originally, "Republic."

00:09:51.133 --> 00:09:57.900
And had it not been for countless hours of
not being able to find ourselves on Google

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:02.400
because there's a lot more important stuff
in the world with the name 'republic' in it.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.033
&gt;&gt; China.
China being one of them.

00:10:04.033 --> 00:10:05.066
&gt;&gt; Like Republic of China.
[laughter]

00:10:05.066 --> 00:10:06.233
&gt;&gt; We literally had the discussion,

00:10:06.233 --> 00:10:07.133
&gt;&gt; Or Banana Republic.

00:10:07.133 --> 00:10:10.467
&gt;&gt; "How popular do we have to get
to be more popular than China?"

00:10:10.467 --> 00:10:11.667
[laughter]

00:10:11.667 --> 00:10:14.934
and the answer was two billions.
Yeah too popular.

00:10:14.934 --> 00:10:18.700
Billions, Billions of popular.
[laughter]

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:24.633
&gt;&gt; So thank you, Google, for motivating
the change to 'OneRepublic'.

00:10:24.633 --> 00:10:25.433
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:10:25.433 --> 00:10:28.700
&gt;&gt; Give yourselves a hand.
[applause and cheering]

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.467
&gt;&gt; So what's the strategy now?

00:10:31.467 --> 00:10:34.300
Next album is, "Dropping" what?
"Tomorrow"? Is that right?

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.734
Wake you up.
&gt;&gt; Tomorrow.

00:10:35.734 --> 00:10:37.567
&gt;&gt; Fantastic.

00:10:37.567 --> 00:10:42.667
Any inspiration now on how you guys
take your kind of 'digital crusade'

00:10:42.667 --> 00:10:45.700
forward in 2009, 2010?

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.467
Knowing everything you learned
from kind of the MySpace days

00:10:48.467 --> 00:10:53.900
and that experience to, is there another
sort of web assault in the works?

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.767
&gt;&gt; Well, we are -- some of you
may not know this,

00:10:56.767 --> 00:11:01.066
but we are sitting in the lobby of the
largest Internet company of the world, so.

00:11:01.066 --> 00:11:03.734
&gt;&gt; That's not a bad start.
&gt;&gt; It's a good place to start.

00:11:03.734 --> 00:11:09.500
&gt;&gt; And that's just our 9:30.
[laughter] Yeah.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.033
&gt;&gt; We go from here to Russia.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.

00:11:12.033 --> 00:11:14.300
&gt;&gt; Where we talk to the whole country.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:18.900
&gt;&gt; We're doing some Twitter stuff.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.166
We're doing some MySpace -- we've
kind of kept that relationship.

00:11:22.166 --> 00:11:24.500
So MySpace is launching it.
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.967
&gt;&gt; I mean, our goal at this point like --

00:11:26.967 --> 00:11:29.166
it's cool if you sell physical albums,

00:11:29.166 --> 00:11:31.400
because some people still,

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.567
you know, people obviously still
listen to that. It's nice getting a CD.

00:11:34.567 --> 00:11:37.033
I like that too.
But like,

00:11:37.033 --> 00:11:39.934
for us, our audience -- I mean,

00:11:39.934 --> 00:11:42.166
like the more we can plug into digital,

00:11:42.166 --> 00:11:43.633
you know, the better.

00:11:43.633 --> 00:11:46.567
I'm trying to get to a --
I've had this idea for awhile.

00:11:46.567 --> 00:11:49.400
And I know the technology exists
out there to make this happen.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.166
But I'd love to be at a place with us

00:11:52.166 --> 00:11:56.834
somewhere during the course of this
album where let's say, I mean --

00:11:56.834 --> 00:12:00.667
these are just some of the ideas
that we're trying to push forward for us.

00:12:00.667 --> 00:12:03.867
Let's say, you know,
you're halfway through a concert,

00:12:03.867 --> 00:12:07.633
or you're opening up for a much
bigger act and by the end of the show,

00:12:07.633 --> 00:12:10.767
right when you've got
everybody kind of worked up,

00:12:10.767 --> 00:12:12.467
you can huh?

00:12:12.467 --> 00:12:15.066
&gt;&gt; No somebody.
It doesn't matter.

00:12:15.066 --> 00:12:17.600
You know how many freaking smarter
people there are in this building than me?

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.433
Like they haven't thought of it?

00:12:19.433 --> 00:12:20.533
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:12:20.533 --> 00:12:22.266
&gt;&gt; Honestly.

00:12:22.266 --> 00:12:24.433
They already know what I'm about to say.

00:12:24.433 --> 00:12:26.500
Seriously, it's like Google ESP.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.367
&gt;&gt; And he's right, right?
We should have this.

00:12:28.367 --> 00:12:30.400
&gt;&gt; It's a new Googlebot.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.033
So I would love to be able to like say,

00:12:33.033 --> 00:12:36.400
you know, text these
three numbers to 1R1R,

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.767
and this album, you're sent a link --
automatically download it to your iPhone,

00:12:40.767 --> 00:12:44.100
to your, you know, Droid,
to whatever.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.967
And, you know, there's -- we definitely
want to be on the forefront of technology,

00:12:47.967 --> 00:12:51.633
because that's -- for us,
that was what created,

00:12:51.633 --> 00:12:54.000
you know, our universe at this point.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.834
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I think it's that
immediacy, you know.

00:12:55.834 --> 00:13:00.266
Like straight from a live performance
to the rest of the world

00:13:00.266 --> 00:13:02.233
that's not at the show, right?

00:13:02.233 --> 00:13:03.700
&gt;&gt; I was going to say,

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.734
when I was in high school,

00:13:04.734 --> 00:13:07.700
when I was in high school,there
was only, really, two big avenues

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.133
that I would ever find out about music.

00:13:09.133 --> 00:13:10.533
Obviously, one is friends.

00:13:10.533 --> 00:13:13.166
And word of mouth is always
going to be massive.

00:13:13.166 --> 00:13:14.800
The other was just radio, you know?

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.533
If you heard a song you liked,

00:13:16.533 --> 00:13:18.367
you would hope --
I always hope like,

00:13:18.367 --> 00:13:21.100
I hope the DJ comes on after that
and tells me who that was.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.300
If not, there's no way I'm going to know.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.800
I'm going to have to listen to the
radio again and wait for him to go,

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.934
"And that was the Swallow with their
new single Counting Blue Cars."

00:13:28.934 --> 00:13:31.767
And I'll be like, "Oh, I got it."
And I'd run to Best Buy, and get it.

00:13:31.767 --> 00:13:34.467
But now, music is everywhere.

00:13:34.467 --> 00:13:36.033
You could see a commercial.

00:13:36.033 --> 00:13:36.900
"I love that song," you know?

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.633
Who cares what the car is.

00:13:38.633 --> 00:13:40.333
Or watch CSI,

00:13:40.333 --> 00:13:41.367
or go online,

00:13:41.367 --> 00:13:44.300
or -- you're hearing music
constantly and everywhere.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.000
So, for us I think,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.266
one of the big things that we rely on is,

00:13:48.266 --> 00:13:49.800
for example, this Google thing.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.633
So that fans when they're
confused or when they don't know,

00:13:52.633 --> 00:13:54.834
"Whose song is that?"

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:56.100
"Apologize" was one of them.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.467
People loved it.
They didn't.

00:13:57.467 --> 00:14:01.033
We ran into the problem a lot where
people didn't quite know it was us.

00:14:01.033 --> 00:14:03.600
They were like,
"Oh, 'Apologize', that's your song?"

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.400
And now, relying on this immediacy,
this like --

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.233
because fans are hearing it
from all kinds of avenues,

00:14:10.233 --> 00:14:12.667
and they don't want to wait
too long to find out who it is.

00:14:12.667 --> 00:14:14.333
So they're going to run to the Internet,

00:14:14.333 --> 00:14:16.133
and they're going to want
that instant answer.

00:14:16.133 --> 00:14:17.934
So you guys are actually
helping us with that.

00:14:17.934 --> 00:14:19.700
Thank you.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.633
&gt;&gt; Awesome.
Well, we're super-excited about it.

00:14:21.633 --> 00:14:23.367
And you know, it's really
just the beginning,

00:14:23.367 --> 00:14:27.867
I think, for figuring out ways that we
can just connect the world faster.

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:29.934
You know, we're doing some of
those demos over in the lobby,

00:14:29.934 --> 00:14:33.633
and you can see how fast the Internet
traffic is moving around the world

00:14:33.633 --> 00:14:35.967
and how searches are
being done worldwide.

00:14:35.967 --> 00:14:38.400
We're just getting started here in the U.S.,
but I think this is a real --

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.200
it's a big, global opportunity as well.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.266
You know, I want to ask you
one last question.

00:14:44.266 --> 00:14:49.233
Just I'm curious because communication
is so pervasive now, right?

00:14:49.233 --> 00:14:50.667
There's smart phones.

00:14:50.667 --> 00:14:52.467
Every phone has a video camera.

00:14:52.467 --> 00:14:54.367
Everybody's recording
everything that's going on.

00:14:54.367 --> 00:14:55.700
It's basically like,

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.300
your life is always 'on' somewhere,
you know, in realtime.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.900
And what's your take on
that content, right?

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.567
Because you've got fans. I mean,
everybody's there with their glowing --

00:15:04.567 --> 00:15:06.600
you can see their blue screens
from their phone,

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.066
shooting pictures at concerts,

00:15:08.066 --> 00:15:08.834
shooting video.

00:15:08.834 --> 00:15:10.300
And it's flying all around the web.

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.600
Is that a good thing for you guys,
or how do you see that?

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.834
&gt;&gt; Honestly?

00:15:14.834 --> 00:15:18.467
Or like, I mean,
it's weird.

00:15:18.467 --> 00:15:21.834
From like, you know,
there's good and bad.

00:15:21.834 --> 00:15:27.967
It's really great for like,
to feed the need for information.

00:15:27.967 --> 00:15:30.533
Like, there's an interest out there,

00:15:30.533 --> 00:15:32.000
you know, that people are,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.433
you know, people are going to
want to see like,

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:40.433
whatever's going on with their
favorite band at any time if they can.

00:15:40.433 --> 00:15:42.300
It kind of bums us out a little bit,

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:46.500
just because I think it's
killing the art of storytelling.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.133
And you know,
just this sort of --

00:15:49.133 --> 00:15:52.967
&gt;&gt; Mystery is gone.
&gt;&gt; -- living in the moment.

00:15:52.967 --> 00:15:56.133
You know, if everything is done
for the sake of broadcasting it.

00:15:56.133 --> 00:16:03.400
But you kind of have to go with the
times and what people like doing.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.867
And so, yeah.

00:16:05.867 --> 00:16:10.900
Whoever can get on top of that
is kind of top dog in 2009.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:14.266
&gt;&gt; I think it's exciting and
terrifying at the same time.

00:16:14.266 --> 00:16:20.700
And I think there's a phrase
that my dad coined years ago.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:26.967
He had a friend who -- it was his best
friend who read five newspapers a day.

00:16:26.967 --> 00:16:29.767
Every morning, he read USA Today,
Wall Street Journal,

00:16:29.767 --> 00:16:31.600
New York Post,
I mean, da-da-da-da.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.567
And he always made a joke.

00:16:32.567 --> 00:16:36.266
He says he has IDP,
"Information Deprivation Paranoia."

00:16:36.266 --> 00:16:39.934
And literally, it sounds like a clinical
term, but I honestly think that --

00:16:39.934 --> 00:16:44.500
I think it's exciting.
I also think that it can get scary,

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.133
because everybody --
we are getting --

00:16:47.133 --> 00:16:49.700
I think there's an actual addiction
that's starting to take place

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.967
to being 'on' and not
being able to turn off.

00:16:51.967 --> 00:16:54.667
The other day actually,
I turned off my Blackberry,

00:16:54.667 --> 00:16:58.266
and I bought a cell phone.

00:16:58.266 --> 00:17:03.900
Because it was just getting like 250 e-mails
a day to the point to where it's like --

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.967
you start realizing that you live
most of your life

00:17:06.967 --> 00:17:11.100
finding out what other people are doing,
or responding to stuff, and like,

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.300
not enough time actually living your life.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.734
At a certain point, it's like,
"I'm going to the bathroom, tweet."

00:17:15.734 --> 00:17:18.000
I'm doing this, tweet.
[laughter]

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.567
And it's just 'this, this and this.'

00:17:19.567 --> 00:17:22.834
And at a certain point,

00:17:22.834 --> 00:17:24.200
I think it's necessary.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.200
I think we're willing to take --
as a band -- and being,

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:31.834
you know, it's kind of like if,

00:17:31.834 --> 00:17:35.266
you know, like even with music.
Production evolves.

00:17:35.266 --> 00:17:36.734
The sound of things evolve.

00:17:36.734 --> 00:17:40.000
In 1979, '80, '81,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.066
if you didn't have a disco song
on your album,

00:17:43.066 --> 00:17:44.667
you weren't really selling records.

00:17:44.667 --> 00:17:47.367
And so, you had acts that were not
disco acts that were putting out --

00:17:47.367 --> 00:17:49.767
that were accommodating that,
because that's where it was.

00:17:49.767 --> 00:17:52.834
And so, I look at it as that,
"it is where it is right now."

00:17:52.834 --> 00:17:57.433
And it's phenomenal to be
able to do a show and boom!

00:17:57.433 --> 00:18:00.166
-- it's everywhere, and the whole world
can see, because that's what they want

00:18:00.166 --> 00:18:01.500
and that works.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.934
I guess my only question and fear is,
I hope it doesn't get to a point,

00:18:05.934 --> 00:18:11.133
you know -- I don't follow Miley Cyrus,

00:18:11.133 --> 00:18:13.266
shockingly, but.

00:18:13.266 --> 00:18:14.066
I don't follow her.

00:18:14.066 --> 00:18:16.767
But the other day, when she made this
huge statement about, "I'm not tweeting,

00:18:16.767 --> 00:18:19.433
because I'm realizing that
I'm literally just like --

00:18:19.433 --> 00:18:22.500
at a certain point, you're like,
What am I doing?

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.834
Why am I doing this?

00:18:23.834 --> 00:18:27.500
And so, we kind of -- we've had this debate
with us, because we love technology.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.333
There's a certain point where,
if it gets invasive enough,

00:18:30.333 --> 00:18:31.233
it kind of freaks me out.

00:18:31.233 --> 00:18:33.967
It gets a little George Orwell
for me at a certain point.

00:18:33.967 --> 00:18:36.734
So yeah, that's our take.

00:18:36.734 --> 00:18:38.600
&gt;&gt; Well, I don't want to hog up
the microphone.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.934
What I'd love to do,

00:18:39.934 --> 00:18:43.500
in anticipation of getting you guys to jam

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:49.133
is turn to the crowd out here
for a few questions.

00:18:49.133 --> 00:18:53.467
&gt;&gt; So, as artists, does it bother you that
almost all the online music distribution

00:18:53.467 --> 00:18:56.767
is selling Lossy versions of your work?

00:18:56.767 --> 00:18:57.867
&gt;&gt; Sorry, selling what?

00:18:57.867 --> 00:19:00.867
&gt;&gt; Lossy versions, like compressed.
&gt;&gt; Oh, compressed versions.

00:19:00.867 --> 00:19:04.967
Yeah, I think it's, for audiophiles,
you know, especially drives them nuts.

00:19:04.967 --> 00:19:09.934
And, for us,
a very frustrating thing is,

00:19:09.934 --> 00:19:13.767
the amount of money
you spend on gear --

00:19:13.767 --> 00:19:16.100
on like microphones from the 40's
that can't be replaced

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.900
and like the best-sounding audio
equipment on earth --

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:23.500
only to have it crushed down
to a file this big,

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.133
because if you were to sit.
&gt;&gt; And that's the legal version.

00:19:26.133 --> 00:19:28.333
&gt;&gt; That's the legal version too.
&gt;&gt; That's not even counting like,

00:19:28.333 --> 00:19:32.433
all the people running around
with like whatever 64 meg like.

00:19:32.433 --> 00:19:36.967
&gt;&gt; You know what the thing is, though?
If that's what your paradigm is --

00:19:36.967 --> 00:19:44.066
if you're used to 192 -- or let's say,
3.5-megabyte file size of music --

00:19:44.066 --> 00:19:48.967
and you've never sat around listening
on Generac speakers to a,

00:19:48.967 --> 00:19:55.900
you know, hundred megabyte wav file,
which is what CDs essentially are,

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.166
you don't know the difference.

00:19:57.166 --> 00:19:59.066
And so, ultimately,

00:19:59.066 --> 00:20:01.400
from a perfectionist standpoint
and artistic standpoint,

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.767
it is frustrating,

00:20:02.767 --> 00:20:06.533
but fortunately, people want it.
CDs are still pretty decent quality.

00:20:06.533 --> 00:20:09.433
You can go out and buy a CD.

00:20:09.433 --> 00:20:13.633
&gt;&gt; If you're over the age of 20, 28.

00:20:13.633 --> 00:20:15.834
&gt;&gt; And you actually know what you are.
&gt;&gt; I remember that.

00:20:15.834 --> 00:20:16.433
&gt;&gt; That's the funny thing.

00:20:16.433 --> 00:20:19.166
The funny thing is-
It is going to be --

00:20:19.166 --> 00:20:22.700
I'm going to say five years --
five years from now,

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.200
there will be kids -- everyone in this
room will see at some point --

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.133
a nephew, a niece, a cousin,
who literally picks up a CD,

00:20:29.133 --> 00:20:31.700
and goes like, "What this?"

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.166
You know, like, you're going to
have that happen.

00:20:33.166 --> 00:20:36.900
I mean, like if you show a 13-year-old
now a cassette tape, it's,

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.734
"What the hell is this?"
You know what I mean?

00:20:39.734 --> 00:20:42.400
It's like when I saw an 8-track.
I was seven years old.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.233
And I was just like -- I didn't
even know what to do with it.

00:20:45.233 --> 00:20:48.433
I thought it was like an Atari
game or something. [laughter]

00:20:48.433 --> 00:20:51.734
You know, the fact that I remember
8-tracks is actually weird, but.

00:20:51.734 --> 00:20:54.400
Yeah, that's going to happen,
and eventually --

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.700
everything is cyclical, though.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.500
I mean, that's the same thing
with tweeting.

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:01.834
Any time you have like a convergence
of all these technologies

00:21:01.834 --> 00:21:05.166
that explodes into like this
Information Deprivation Paranoia,

00:21:05.166 --> 00:21:08.867
which most people in this room
probably have some degree of -- I do.

00:21:08.867 --> 00:21:10.633
Like, you get that e-mail,
read it right then,

00:21:10.633 --> 00:21:13.567
you got to respond, etc.
At a certain point,

00:21:13.567 --> 00:21:17.700
I think any time anything in technology
goes to an extreme

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.567
and speeds up and reaches
maximum velocity,

00:21:20.567 --> 00:21:22.467
there's going to be a recoil.

00:21:22.467 --> 00:21:26.100
And I'm really curious to
see what the recoil is.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.000
&gt;&gt; All analog.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.934
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's going to go back to LPs.
It's going to go back to something.

00:21:29.934 --> 00:21:30.867
I don't know what it is.

00:21:30.867 --> 00:21:33.867
Both musically,
and I think communicating.

00:21:33.867 --> 00:21:37.133
Watch two/three years from now,
all of a sudden, you know,

00:21:37.133 --> 00:21:38.767
the sale of pens go up,

00:21:38.767 --> 00:21:41.033
because people start writing letters again.

00:21:41.033 --> 00:21:44.500
I mean, honestly,
who knows.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:49.100
&gt;&gt; All right.
Anymore questions?

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.700
I think they all are dying
to hear you guys play.

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.667
And I really appreciate you
guys giving us the time,

00:21:54.667 --> 00:21:57.900
making the effort to come out
here and fly out and visit us.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.166
And I'm excited.

00:22:00.166 --> 00:22:02.633
So let's get to it guys.

00:22:02.633 --> 00:22:09.834

00:22:12.266 --> 00:22:14.533
Can I get some hot tea, man?

00:22:14.533 --> 00:22:18.300
Can you do a search for that for me, please?

00:22:58.333 --> 00:23:01.367
I actually got nauseous
for about ten minutes,

00:23:01.367 --> 00:23:05.333
seriously, after doing the Google Earth
thing that you guys have. [laughter]

00:23:05.333 --> 00:23:07.367
Anyone else get nauseous doing that?

00:23:07.367 --> 00:23:08.000
I'm not joking.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.900
I was like -- he's like,
"Now find Denver, and fly into it.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.967
And rotate 360-degrees."

00:23:12.967 --> 00:23:16.967
And I did it, and I was just like
"There's my house." [laughter]

00:23:16.967 --> 00:23:22.300
And yeah, guacamole was a bad idea.
[laughter]

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.767
&gt;&gt; Guacamole.

00:23:23.767 --> 00:23:27.600

You guys have really, really good food.
