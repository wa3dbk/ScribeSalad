00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.759
&gt;&gt;Female speaker: Hi everyone, I'm Heather
Stillman and on behalf of the Authors at Google

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:11.440
team here at Los Angeles, I'm honored to introduce
to you today, my cousin, Karen Krasne, the

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.340
owner and executive Chef of Extraordinary
Desserts.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.500
She will be speaking today about her recent
book, Extraordinary Cakes.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.360
Her cakes have graced the cover of Bon Appetite
and Forums recognized her as one of the country's

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.260
Ten Best Pastry Chefs.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:34.020
She has been featured in New York Times, Gourmet,
Sunset and the Los Angeles Times, among other

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.090
publications.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.390
In 1988, Karen opened Extraordinary Desserts
in San Diego.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:47.720
A year later the eatery was in such demand
that Karen was able to expand from ten seats

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:54.680
to sixty-five seats, and in 2004, she opened
a second location in San Diego's Little Italy.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.760
Karen graduated with a degree from the University
of Hawaii in Food and Human Nutrition, and

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.060
went on to study pastry making at Le Cordon
Bleu in Paris, France.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.109
She has brought some of these fabulous desserts
to share with us today, and now, Karen Krasne.

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:16.369
&gt;&gt;Karen Krasne: Thank you.

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:17.990
[Audience applauds]

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.049
&gt;&gt;Karen: So I'm just going to kinda start
with the concept of what Extraordinary Desserts

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.340
is and what it's become.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.969
When we started in 1988, We just did desserts
at our one location that now seats a hundred

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.320
and it's desserts seven
days a week.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.460
And then we opened a second location in Little
Italy, where we seat about 250

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.069
people, and both locations are open until
about eleven at night, midnight on the weekends.

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:51.539
And at the bigger location
we do have food and wine, paninis and alcohol

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.429
and things like that so that we don't just
have the desserts, so we've

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.740
become two different places that people love
to go to one or the other, and they're really

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.990
fanatical about which one
they prefer.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.069
So it's interesting because some like The
Original, as it's known, and some like The

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.069
New.

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.150
So I want to go
back a little bit on my background, I know

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.890
Heather touched on it.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:24.050
I am born and raised in San Diego, and I took
off at about seventeen for Hawaii, and somehow

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.409
got a degree about eight years later.

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:32.629
And it was Human Nutrition and
it was under the Tropical Ag genre at the

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.349
University of Hawaii, so I think that's where
a lot of my tropical

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:42.560
agriculture comes in here, and from there
you pretty much-- this was way way way back

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.159
in the old days, so you sort of
had to go and get a Master's in Public Health

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.970
or things like that and it just didn't sound
like that was good for me,

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.010
so I took off to France, and spent about a
year and half there at different schools,

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.299
Cordon Bleu was one of them.

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.140
And
then came back to San Diego and started making

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.540
cakes for like Nieman Marcus, some other very
high end establishments,

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.750
and just sort of dropped off, peddled, you
know basically peddling to them, and built

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.099
up a clientele enough that I
could open up a store that had ten seats.

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.739
And from there the ten seats grew to sixty-five,
and a hundred and then the

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.240
second store, and so on and so forth.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.120
So I don't know, we're in about twenty-two
years of business at this point, and

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.140
I decided to write the book, which took maybe
two years to write.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.770
And I felt that it was necessary to document
the

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.180
type of work that we do because it is so different
from what you see pretty much anywhere in

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.931
the States and then,
likewise in Europe, where I just was for a

00:03:45.931 --> 00:03:49.040
couple of weeks and just got back ten days
ago.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.311
So what I think
what we do that's so different is that we

00:03:52.311 --> 00:03:57.480
really tried to use a lot of color, and a
lot of fresh whatever is going

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.959
on in the market, in terms of flowers and
fruits, and what not, and we also try to do

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.670
a spin on flavors so that it's
not just the typical things you'd expect,

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.019
chocolate with raspberries, we infuse things,
we use herbs, we use a lot of

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:18.330
yuzu, we use Matcha tea, we tend to follow
the patterns of desserts that are going on

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:24.160
more, say, in the East coast,
because I am in New York quite a bit, and

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.650
then in Paris, where I think is where pastry
really has been born, and is

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:37.060
really studied, and has a metamorphosis beyond
anywhere else that I've ever seen.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.780
So I just finished a class over there which
we call stagez.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.040
And it was three days and eighty hours, I
mean three days,

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.500
eighty recipes, thirty five hours.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.840
And it was really really incredible what is
happening that is the same as it was

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.900
twenty-five years ago, but it's just become
more flavorful, more simplified, less sugar,

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.920
less fat.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.800
They're following
the same buzz words we're following here,

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.810
but it's introduced in a way that's a little
bit more elegant over there.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.010
Nobody feels that they're skipping or missing
something.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.540
So today I thought that I would make probably
the easiest

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.670
recipe in the book.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:26.020
The recipes tend to take about two or three
days for preparation, because they're cakes,

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.471
and then
crèmes and then different layers that you

00:05:28.471 --> 00:05:32.380
build on it and then you end up freezing the
product, and then you take it

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.340
out the day you're going to serve it and you
finish it up, so that it's nice and hard when

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.750
you finish it, so you get
really clean edges like these cakes over here.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.800
If you try to make a cake, and put the frosting
in it and put the next

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.900
cake layer on it, and frost it and put another,
and then you try to finish it, I mean it's

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.410
all gobbledy-gook and
uneven and you know people always wonder "how

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.200
are your cakes so perfect?"

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.690
It's because they had a stage where they
got to be frozen for eight hours to twelve

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.730
hours to overnight and that's one of the key
things in the book.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.690
But not
everyone has two or three days to make a cake

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.550
so there's a few things in the book, one is
the bread pudding.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.530
I'm also
gonna show you, not going to show you how

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.360
to make it, but this is an element in the
book, this white chocolate

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.130
mousse, instead of having to make the cake
that might take three days, you could just

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.791
make the mousse, and I've
simply either put it in a large form in a

00:06:24.791 --> 00:06:29.310
glass so you could use any kind of wine glass,
goblet, that kind of thing,

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.570
or these are simple votive candles that you
can pick up at Smart and Final.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.560
You can be as creative as you want with
some of the elements of the book and not have

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.530
to make cakes with them.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:45.620
So, I tried to break it down so that it does
seem like you wanna try for some of the hard

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.150
projects, but then at the same time, I don't
want to make it so, you

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.350
know, full of effort that you don't even want
to open the book.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:59.240
So, the bread pudding basically has about
5 ingredients in it, and so I take the cream

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:06.410
and the milk, I just put it
together in the pot, and I hope I have heat

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:16.520
going, let's see, it seems like it, okay and
then the sugar is going in

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:25.570
the bowl with the egg yolks, I don't know
if you all use vanilla beans or if you use

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:26.570
vanilla extract.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.590
If you're
using a vanilla bean, you definitely want

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.310
it at room temperature, so it's really nice
and pliable.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:37.000
And then when you
cut it open, you're going to use a sharp little

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.970
knife like this to cut it open, and then when
you scrape out the

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:44.330
meat, you use the back of the knife, not the
sharp, because you don't want the pith, which

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.660
would be like getting the
pith from an orange or a lemon that's kind

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:51.370
of bitter, so it's real important that your
knife is nice and sharp to cut

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:57.250
open the bean like this and then it's going
to expose this really glistening, sort of

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:58.840
dark meat.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.710
Those are the seeds
and are the most delicious part and the reason

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.690
why you pay so much for a vanilla bean.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:10.380
So, once I have that out, I
just go ahead and put it in the pot in the

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:16.120
cream and the milk, and then I put the whole
bean in there as well.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.460
And
then I've got my yolks and my sugar going

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.390
here and I just mix those up, and we're going
to wait for the cream and the

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:31.150
milk to come to almost a boil, and then we'll
pour that into the egg yolk mixture, we'll

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.300
strain it, and that's
basically the crème brulee.

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:39.010
So that's an element that you could take as
crème brulee and put in into little porcelain

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:44.860
dishes and bake it off in a water bath in
the oven, and you don't even have to go further

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.880
into this other aspect of
it.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:52.500
One of the things that I do use, that make
it a little bit easier for you, is they're

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:59.110
store bought croissants, and
you need about ten of this size.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:04.840
And, you know, if they're kind of beige-y,
not real baked off, go ahead and put them

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.630
back in your oven and bake them real firm,
because they're going to soak up all this

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:13.510
crème brulee and get nice and
crusty, and it's nice and juicy.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:20.860
So the flat ones that are not, you know, real
bronzed in color, you definitely want

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.530
to bake those again.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:28.180
And probably put them in at about, I don't
know, three fifty for about ten minutes, and

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.610
get them
nice and colored.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:34.070
And you'll see that they're, you can see inside
of the croissant, you see all the texture

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:35.070
in it.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:38.890
When they’re real mushy, you know, like
someone flattened 'em out, they're not going

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:42.280
to be as fabulous, so you
definitely want this puffier kind.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.280
Yes?

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.280
&gt;&gt;female #1: So how drastic is it between
using real vanilla versus vanilla syrup or

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.280
even fake vanilla
extract?

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:58.150
I can guess what you're probably going to
tell me, but...

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.280
&gt;&gt;Karen: I know.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:05.730
So the question is about a vanilla bean, versus
an extract, or fake vanilla or vanilla syrup.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.320
Well,
I mean, your desserts are only as good as

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.130
your product.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:14.840
So I don't know that in this it's a deal breaker
to use a

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:19.900
real vanilla bean but if you're making vanilla
ice cream, if you're making vanilla mousse,

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.070
if you're making vanilla
sauce, that would be when I would say you

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:25.170
should probably go buy the vanilla beans.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.779
But in this sort of a situation,
I am using such good chocolate, and this is

00:10:28.779 --> 00:10:31.900
valrhona, and I don't know if all of you know
about valrhona chocolate,

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:38.900
but it's from the Rhone region in the Val
area of France, and there's probably, I don't

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:43.840
know, twenty-five different
grades of chocolate, everything from fifty

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.630
percent all the way up into eighty-two percent,
and you can pick and

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:48.780
choose your flavors.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:53.980
We sell ten different styles at Extraordinary
Desserts, I am sure you can find it here at

00:10:53.980 --> 00:11:00.070
Surface, but it's excellent chocolate and
the one I am using today is sixty-one percent

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:05.660
and it just has a really true
chocolate flavor, no berries, or jasmine or

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.610
coffee notes in it, it's just real clear chocolate.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:14.310
Okay good, this
is-- thank you.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:15.310
[laughs]

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:18.110
[tapping on pot]

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:23.750
So, these are going to be our filler, the
chocolate and the croissants, and once this

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:29.040
is finished, we'll put half of
the crème brulee in the bottom, I use this

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:33.230
in the book, this kind of a mold, and you
can either use this kind of a

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:37.610
thing or you can use an oval.

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:44.260
Here's what this one comes up, it's great
for a brunch buffet, this is great family

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.260
style.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.590
It's really however you want to present it.

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:52.410
You can also build them in little dishes that
are porcelain like

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.800
that.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.600
Same kind of a thing, you just put the crème
brulee in, put the croissants in , then the

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.130
chocolate and then
layer them again like that, and then bake

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.960
it off and you're right there.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.910
So while we're waiting for this, I don't
know if anyone has any questions about desserts

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:13.840
in general, or have an issue with something
that's not working out,

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.510
but I'm not shy so....ask me.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:21.040
&gt;&gt;female: I have a question, you mentioned
that...first of all thank you so much for

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.040
being here.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.380
I
actually came to your store many many times.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.290
Is it working?

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:27.290
Okay.

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:32.120
Many many times in San Diego, um, but my question
was regarding to something you said earlier

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:37.730
about the trend now in Europe is to actually
reduce sugar, reduce fats in

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:43.180
the desserts, and what I saw is like cream
and sugar so this one is definitely not--

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.900
[Karen laughs]
Is your store now offering more these things,

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:46.900
I haven't been recently?

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:55.440
&gt;&gt;Karen: Yeah, it's, I mean we're definitely
offering more of vegan, gluten-free kinds

00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:00.860
of products because it's a
kind of huge buzz, in all of foods in general,

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:05.070
um, I mean in our downtown location we make
a lot of vegan foods

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:10.890
as well in the salty section of the store,
but there's always vegan cookies available,

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:13.490
and there's always
something that's gluten-free because it has

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:15.510
become such a big thing.

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:18.630
I'm not one that will just make something
vegan

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:24.920
or gluten-free just to be in the market, I
want it to be as good as the other product.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:29.680
And so then I might choose
either/or, and so it's taken me a little bit

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.020
longer to come up with those products that
I think are just as high

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:38.630
quality in flavor and texture, sugar free
is on my deck, and it's just kind of a scary

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:47.060
thing because you have to
use like malitol, which is uh, you know, I

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:52.060
don't even like the 'tol' at the end, you
know, so I kind of shy away

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:56.620
from it, but these products, like for example,
this is white chocolate mousse with berries

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.500
in it and it's gluten
free, so it just depends.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:03.190
It's not low in fat, it's high in flavor.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:04.259
[audience laughs]

00:14:04.259 --> 00:14:05.259
You know?

00:14:05.259 --> 00:14:07.460
Um, so again, it's just choosing which route.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:12.490
I think that being said, I think desserts
is about like

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:19.550
enjoying and over the top and it's not to
be done everyday, you know?

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:21.920
So when you go for it, you kind a want to
go

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:27.940
for it and you want to really get something
fabulous at the end of it.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.040
So.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:34.060
Okay, I've got hot cream and milk--

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.220
&gt;&gt;female #2: It just has to be hot?

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.561
&gt;&gt;Karen: Well, almost to a boil, sometimes
I don't like to bring it to a boil, because

00:14:39.561 --> 00:14:42.080
it creates a skin.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.270
Okay.

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:48.029
[sound of liquid pouring]

00:14:48.029 --> 00:14:54.440
Okay, this is not for the faint, this pot.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.200
So you just mix it up, stir it all together.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.180
&gt;&gt;Unknown speaker: Is it tough to make?

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:01.180
&gt;&gt;Karen: Sorry?

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:04.430
&gt;&gt;Unknown speaker: Is it tougher than it looks?

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:05.430
&gt;&gt;Karen: Nope.

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:12.060
You don't need, you know, you don't need a
mixer for this, this is like this is..."friends

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:17.660
are coming
over, oh my gosh, what am I going to make?"

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:18.660
[tapping sounds]

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:22.510
And then I need to strain it.

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:27.580
Oh my gosh, okay.

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:31.890
Well, okay, it's a double bowl, we'll deal
with it.

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.500
[audience laughs]

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.930
Deal with it.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:42.000
So I'm just gonna strain it through here,
and what that does it it collects all the

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.730
potential egg yolk
that didn't, that coagulated that wouldn't

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.850
be nice and creamy smooth.

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:52.330
Because let's say you do want this for crème
brulee, you don't want to make bread pudding,

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:56.529
you definitely want everything to be strained
out of here, and it's

00:15:56.529 --> 00:16:01.540
nice to have like at the end, you've got the
grains from that vanilla, all the seeds, and

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.040
it's good to have all that
in there and people see that you're using

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:07.040
real vanilla beans.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:12.110
So, I think this will be easy to see.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:20.380
So we're
going to put half of it into the bottom, and

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:33.160
then half of the croissants, and then I take,
this is two cups of

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:41.240
chocolate, so it's a lot of chocolate, so
even if your croissants aren't flavorful,

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.410
they will be.

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:44.270
[audience laughs]

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:48.170
And then I go ahead and I take the rest of
the croissants and I put it on, so it's like

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:49.680
you're building a sandwich.

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.700
&gt;&gt;female #3: Can I ask why you have the tin
foil on there?

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.750
&gt;&gt;Karen: Because otherwise, my crème brulee
is going to seep out.

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:59.600
So while we were testing this for the book,
we...it

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.970
seeped out a few times, and I'm like, hmm,
this isn't going to be good.

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:03.970
&gt;&gt;female #3: From where?

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:05.889
&gt;&gt;Karen: From the bottom, because it has a
push out bottom.

00:17:05.889 --> 00:17:07.199
&gt;&gt; female #3: Oh right.

00:17:07.199 --> 00:17:08.199
I forgot.

00:17:08.199 --> 00:17:21.539
&gt;&gt;Karen: And then, I'm gonna put this in here,
and then you just go ahead and fill up.

00:17:21.539 --> 00:17:24.829
So it seems like, oh my gosh
that's a lot of liquid but that's why it's

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:33.269
so wonderfully custardy and then the chocolate's
melted and, it's, we

00:17:33.269 --> 00:17:41.120
make this everyday at the store, and everyday
I walk by it and I go, hmm, is anybody looking,

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:45.720
and I like
grab-- because the best part is like this

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.460
real crusty.

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.460
And then that's it.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.720
You just put it in the oven.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.389
You bake it
off.

00:17:51.389 --> 00:17:56.730
You can cool it, and then it will pop right
out and turn into this, and then you can slice

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:59.629
it, and sauce it, and
serve it.

00:17:59.629 --> 00:18:10.110
So if I were having you over for dinner, and
I was going to plate the bread pudding, what

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:13.499
we do at the
store and what I like to do is to take some

00:18:13.499 --> 00:18:17.970
vanilla anglaise, which is in the book, and
the chocolate sauce, it's in

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:23.990
the book as well, and I just, I'm pretty simple,
I like to just sort of swirl them and marble

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:34.919
the plate, and then
take a scoop of the bread pudding that's nice

00:18:34.919 --> 00:18:48.980
and warm and you can also microwave this if
you want, it really depends

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:56.299
what size you want, you get a little bit larger
at Extraordinary Desserts, and then I tend

00:18:56.299 --> 00:19:06.090
to go in the yard and grab
whatever's growing, edible or not, and then

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:12.220
I put that on the side of the plate, and then
if you want, I mean, it

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:18.570
depends how fussy you want to get... if you
want to sprinkle the powdered sugar on the

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:19.570
side of the plate.

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:24.679
This is a
tea strainer, a fork, the sugar and you can

00:19:24.679 --> 00:19:27.460
do it on anything you like.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:34.940
And then, basically, you have a finished
product that you can serve, and then the same

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:41.460
thing goes likewise for if you're building
the mousse in the cup, it's

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:47.260
from the Yvoire, it's a white chocolate mousse
that's in a cake in the book.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:51.679
You can build your white chocolate
mousse, put your fresh berries in the center,

00:19:51.679 --> 00:19:54.890
and then some more white chocolate mousse
and then I finished it off

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:59.499
with some raspberry gelee, which could be
the raspberry sauce in the book with a little

00:19:59.499 --> 00:20:01.110
gelatin in it.

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:04.549
And then if
you want to put strawberries on it, and raspberries,

00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:15.049
or if you just want, you could take, a rose,
and my staff gets

00:20:15.049 --> 00:20:22.450
crazy, they love the flowers, so we just do
whatever however, there's no absolute.

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:27.279
It's just pick colors you like and
kind of go for it.

00:20:27.279 --> 00:20:32.070
And then I use that same gel that I used on
the top, and I just paint the strawberry so

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:35.429
it looks
like it's more luscious, and then you can

00:20:35.429 --> 00:20:40.239
put that on there, and if you're really going
for it, and it's Valentine's

00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:47.899
Day, and so you break out the edible twenty
three and three quarter gold leaf,

00:20:47.899 --> 00:20:50.659
[audience laughs]

00:20:50.659 --> 00:20:54.090
and then you end up with a cup like that.

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:59.139
So it's pretty easy, you can use the gold
on your plate, "Good morning

00:20:59.139 --> 00:21:01.649
honey, here's your croissant and your jam"
and put the gold on the croissant.

00:21:01.649 --> 00:21:02.649
[audience laughs]

00:21:02.649 --> 00:21:08.299
I mean you know, so the book is meant to give
you lots of artistic freedom, and just give

00:21:08.299 --> 00:21:12.950
you color options and ways
to think about presenting things that make

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:16.070
people really want to eat it.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:20.610
So, what else can I answer before we're
going to eat?

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:21.950
[audience laughs]

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:25.630
&gt;&gt;female #4: Hi, thank you for coming today.

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:27.350
I have two questions.

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:31.429
One is that I see you have
graduated from Le Cordon Bleu and you travel

00:21:31.429 --> 00:21:37.230
back to Paris frequently, where would you
recommend for a great

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:40.460
croissant or desserts in Paris?

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:43.720
&gt;&gt;Karen: Let's see.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:48.350
The one that I was at that was my favorite
this last time , I went and I bought four

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.799
pieces
of cake and I ate all four of them.

00:21:50.799 --> 00:21:51.799
[audience laughs]

00:21:51.799 --> 00:21:55.190
In the same few hours.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:22:02.489
It's called, Le Reve de Patisserie.

00:22:02.489 --> 00:22:04.440
And you can always email me, but that was
like my

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.859
very favorite and then of course I went to
a few more and bought a few pieces and ate

00:22:08.859 --> 00:22:12.429
those you know because I'm
dissecting, but that one was really wonderful.

00:22:12.429 --> 00:22:13.529
&gt;&gt;female #4: Awesome.

00:22:13.529 --> 00:22:15.460
I'll be there really soon so--

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:16.460
&gt;&gt;Karen: Great.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:20.850
&gt;&gt;female #4: The second question is, do you
use ultra pasteurized milk and cream and if

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:26.149
you do, do you
find a difference in the taste, in your desserts?

00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:29.490
&gt;&gt;Karen: Well, I'm not sure if it's ultra
pasteurized.

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:31.450
It's organic milk that we use.

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:37.440
We use all organic milk, and
for the heavy whipping cream, it is ultra

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.049
pasteurized.

00:22:40.049 --> 00:22:43.779
I don't know that it has a better flavor,
I know that the

00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:50.409
cream that we use has a higher fat content,
so that means it might have more flavor.

00:22:50.409 --> 00:22:54.230
I do like to use organic
products whenever I can.

00:22:54.230 --> 00:23:00.129
It was absolutely not affordable to have the
cream organic, we did the math on it, and

00:23:00.129 --> 00:23:02.470
it
became thirty five hundred dollars extra a

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.669
month to make that switch.

00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:08.970
And so, if I had to pass that on to my clients,
I'd have to probably be shutting my doors.

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:13.440
So you know, you just do what you can with
organics, but flavor wise, I

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:18.179
think we're pretty happy with the product
that we use, and it is ultra pasteurized.

00:23:18.179 --> 00:23:19.179
&gt;&gt;female #4: Thank you.

00:23:19.179 --> 00:23:20.179
&gt;&gt;Unknown speaker2: I have another question.

00:23:20.179 --> 00:23:23.139
How do you roll the chocolate like that?

00:23:23.139 --> 00:23:34.250
&gt;&gt;Karen: Well this we take a tray like, this
kind of a tray and we stick it in the oven

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:36.809
just to heat it just a
little bit till it's just kind of warm to

00:23:36.809 --> 00:23:42.309
touch, and then we have our liquid chocolate
and then we sort of put it

00:23:42.309 --> 00:23:47.590
over the top here and once it just starts
to cool, we can put it in the refrigerator,

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:50.999
we pull it out and we wait for
it to get a little bit like tacky, and then

00:23:50.999 --> 00:23:53.309
you use like a paint scraper.

00:23:53.309 --> 00:23:55.359
And, I think that's in the book.

00:23:55.359 --> 00:23:56.649
It is in
the book.

00:23:56.649 --> 00:24:02.519
Yeah, I'm like, I can't remember, what.

00:24:02.519 --> 00:24:04.770
Anybody else?

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:09.120
All right.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:16.279
So I think I am having a helper come and help
me plate, right?

00:24:16.279 --> 00:24:19.919
So, what I'll do too is I can start cutting
some

00:24:19.919 --> 00:24:22.970
of the cakes, 'cause I think we can do that
before--

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:23.970
&gt;&gt;female #4: Can we tell us what everything
is?

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:25.229
&gt;&gt;Karen: Oh that's a good point.

00:24:25.229 --> 00:24:30.090
[claps hands together] So the cake over here
on the far right is a Linzer, and it's

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:33.869
in the book and it's actually is in the holiday
section.

00:24:33.869 --> 00:24:38.629
The book is split between seasons,every quarter,
summer,

00:24:38.629 --> 00:24:40.470
winter, that sort of thing.

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:42.840
This is in winter.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:46.539
It's white chocolate buttercream with hazelnut
almond cakes with

00:24:46.539 --> 00:24:49.519
fresh raspberries and then a homemade raspberry
jam.

00:24:49.519 --> 00:24:55.559
So it has sort of an Austrian play on it with
all the nuts in

00:24:55.559 --> 00:24:56.559
it.

00:24:56.559 --> 00:25:01.090
It's a wonderful wedding cake because as it
sits out at room temperature, the nuts and

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:04.429
the white chocolate sort
of warm up, so it's a great cake to drive

00:25:04.429 --> 00:25:05.830
from San Diego to L.A.

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:08.080
It has no problem making that trip.

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.080
[audience laughs]

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.999
And then next to it are some of these white
chocolate mousses, with the raspberries on

00:25:12.999 --> 00:25:14.289
it.

00:25:14.289 --> 00:25:19.669
And then we have the bread
pudding, and this is probably the most popular

00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:24.100
cake at the store, it's called the Viking,
and it has a chocolate crème

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.720
brulee in the bottom of it, and then a milk
chocolate whipped cream, and chocolate pralines

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.029
in it, and chocolate
cake.

00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:35.580
It's called the Viking because it's pretty
intense, it's hearty, and again this is another

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:38.970
one that's really
easy to take from San Diego to L.A. and not

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:40.419
have any problem.

00:25:40.419 --> 00:25:43.840
I travel everywhere around the world with
a cake, I

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:48.149
mean, that's just what, if I'm going somewhere,
people , that's just sort of my calling card.

00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:52.690
So I tend to make
things that can make long drives, and the

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:56.570
ones that are the whipped creams and the fruits
and the berries, you can

00:25:56.570 --> 00:26:01.479
still drive that from San Diego up to this
area because it's only out for two hours,

00:26:01.479 --> 00:26:05.059
as long as it's not Santa Anna
and a hundred degrees out and you're stuck

00:26:05.059 --> 00:26:07.190
in traffic for four hours.

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:10.720
So even though they're cakes, they're not
that

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:11.720
fragile.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.720
You know?

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.830
You shouldn't be scared of them, in terms
of--

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:17.519
&gt;&gt;female #5: What is that in?

00:26:17.519 --> 00:26:18.519
&gt;&gt;Karen: What is what in?

00:26:18.519 --> 00:26:19.519
&gt;&gt;female #5: The cake when you are traveling.

00:26:19.519 --> 00:26:20.519
&gt;&gt;Karen: Oh, in a box.

00:26:20.519 --> 00:26:21.860
&gt;&gt;Unknown speaker: Just in a box?

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:27.609
&gt;&gt;Karen: Each of these cakes is on a cardboard
bottom, and then it is usually on a doily,

00:26:27.609 --> 00:26:30.620
cardboard round and then it
just goes in a cardboard box.

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:32.729
So it's pretty easy.

00:26:32.729 --> 00:26:38.330
I once went to Sydney for New Year's, and
the plane stopped in

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:44.039
Honolulu, I got out, checked into a hotel
for half a day, put the cake into the refrigerator,

00:26:44.039 --> 00:26:48.029
went for a run, came
back, got the cake, boarded the plane for

00:26:48.029 --> 00:26:52.460
Sydney and showed up for the New Year's party,
and it was the Linzer, and it

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:53.460
was perfect.

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:54.460
[audience laughs]

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:57.879
I got the flowers in Honolulu, I remember
that.

00:26:57.879 --> 00:26:59.120
So you can.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.129
Yeah, they travel.

00:27:00.129 --> 00:27:01.470
&gt;&gt;female #5: You have to do it as carry on?

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:04.799
&gt;&gt;Karen: They don't ship, but they do travel,
yeah.

00:27:04.799 --> 00:27:09.009
So unless there's any other questions, I'll
start cutting and--

00:27:09.009 --> 00:27:10.009
&gt;&gt;Unknown male speaker 2:Just one question,
I am curious , you said you went to school

00:27:10.009 --> 00:27:16.539
and how did you decide cakes
was the thing you wanted to do?

00:27:16.539 --> 00:27:23.999
&gt;&gt;Karen: Well, I think 'cause when I was in
college I was so entrenched in science, that

00:27:23.999 --> 00:27:28.059
this other side started
to happen, and I think from being-- my mom

00:27:28.059 --> 00:27:31.850
was a great entertainer, so I think that early
on in life, and my

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:38.200
grandmothers were as well, and I've always
been a vegetarian so learning to be a chef

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:42.590
with meat stocks and things
like that did not interest me.

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:45.210
And this just seemed like a painter's palette.

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:49.590
You know, all the color and after
having lived in Honolulu and then I lived

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:53.450
in Mexico, and as well in Paris.

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:57.659
I mean those are really very colorful,
bountiful places, smells and you know, so.

00:27:57.659 --> 00:27:59.379
&gt;&gt;Unknown male speaker 2: Now do you find
that a lot of inspiration for your designs

00:27:59.379 --> 00:28:09.649
that you make from places you
visit or where do you find a lot of inspiration?

00:28:09.649 --> 00:28:15.510
&gt;&gt;Karen: It's not good for me to be landlocked,
you know I do have to get out quite a bit.

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:20.489
I can find inspiration
pretty much anywhere I go, even if it's just

00:28:20.489 --> 00:28:25.139
a Sunday at home with some magazines, but
I really find the most

00:28:25.139 --> 00:28:27.039
inspiration in Asia.

00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:35.399
In Asian countries, I mean I love Bali, just
the use of the different freshly grown clove

00:28:35.399 --> 00:28:39.549
and
you know the coffee beans there, and the flowers

00:28:39.549 --> 00:28:44.200
and the essences and teas, that's a great
place, but really anywhere

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:48.909
where I get away from my regular day to day
job and people being able to call me with

00:28:48.909 --> 00:28:53.340
the random break downs of a
restaurant.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:29:00.090
Because I have a hundred ten employees, and
I'm a sole proprietor so it's kind of a heavy

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:03.879
burden on the
back some days, so if I can just get away,

00:29:03.879 --> 00:29:08.822
even just-- it took me four planes to get
back to San Diego from Paris this

00:29:08.822 --> 00:29:14.159
last trip, because it was just a real mess,
and I was fine, because I'm like reading my

00:29:14.159 --> 00:29:18.779
books, some new recipes, I
brought all these French books back and I'm

00:29:18.779 --> 00:29:23.700
like five hours in Madrid, not a problem,
you know, oh and overnight

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:31.029
in in New York, okay, so just being by myself
and quiet, is inspirational.

00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:32.289
So.

00:29:32.289 --> 00:29:40.789
&gt;&gt;Unknown male speaker 3: So the lemon ricotta
cake is by far my favorite, I like all the

00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:42.479
citrus flavors in it.

00:29:42.479 --> 00:29:47.119
Where did you start or what were your interests
when you started and how have they progressed

00:29:47.119 --> 00:29:48.230
over time?

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:50.950
&gt;&gt;Karen: Well, in terms of flavors?

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:52.239
&gt;&gt;Unknown male speaker 3: Yeah.

00:29:52.239 --> 00:30:00.119
&gt;&gt;Karen: The lemon ricotta is one of the older,
there's a family of ricottas, there's the

00:30:00.119 --> 00:30:03.340
lemon ricotta, the
passion fruit ricotta, and the blood orange

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:07.580
ricotta, and most of my cakes come from family
members or friends having

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:11.790
a birthday and I don't feel like bringing
the same stock cake, so I kinda have to come

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:13.389
up with something.

00:30:13.389 --> 00:30:17.139
So a lot of
the same cakes are used, but a lot of other

00:30:17.139 --> 00:30:20.710
different flavor conceptions are put together
with them.

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:27.190
I think when I
started, I probably was a little more straightforward

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:30.440
with my flavors because I was living in Mexico,
and it was

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:35.409
back before they were able to import a lot
of things, so I got lemon, and I was able

00:30:35.409 --> 00:30:40.770
to get hazelnuts, so my Linzer
was a little bit different, but the Linzer's

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:44.279
been around for about twenty-two years, the
lemon ricotta as well,

00:30:44.279 --> 00:30:45.440
because it was easy to do there.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:50.139
I think now I'm a little more, I get a little
more out there, but I still think of

00:30:50.139 --> 00:30:54.760
my general audience, and I mean , San Diego's
very different than Los Angeles, I mean, I

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:59.429
always call us a big
village, so I don't want to get too esoteric

00:30:59.429 --> 00:31:01.169
because that can scare people away.

00:31:01.169 --> 00:31:10.350
So, even Matcha tea mousse has been
an interesting concept and yuzu and I'm trying

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:14.090
to think, we don't do well with chestnuts,
making things with

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:19.279
chestnuts, and pear's not a big thing, so
I have to be careful.

00:31:19.279 --> 00:31:22.470
And if something doesn't sell, we don't make
it

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:23.470
again.

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:24.919
We eat it, then we're over it.

00:31:24.919 --> 00:31:27.419
&gt;&gt;female #6: So what about icings?

00:31:27.419 --> 00:31:31.590
When you're trying to decorate with icings,
do you use--

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:32.590
[unintelligible]

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:33.590
&gt;&gt;Karen: We don't work with that at all.

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:40.239
&gt;&gt;female #6: So what is your idea of what
is a good icing to decorate with versus [unintelligible]?

00:31:40.239 --> 00:31:51.159
&gt;&gt;Karen: Well, for icings we only either use,
and they're in the book, buttercream, and

00:31:51.159 --> 00:31:56.379
it's a French recipe actually
from Cordon Bleu, I have never done anything

00:31:56.379 --> 00:31:57.379
different from that.

00:31:57.379 --> 00:32:00.429
I've used that since 1985.

00:32:00.429 --> 00:32:05.849
Otherwise, we use
ganache, which is chocolate and cream, and

00:32:05.849 --> 00:32:10.289
then, we don't really use a lot of icings,
we use icing on our

00:32:10.289 --> 00:32:11.940
cupcake.

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:17.539
Icings are American baking and I'm just kind
of getting used to that a little bit, you

00:32:17.539 --> 00:32:20.070
know because homemade
desserts are coming back in, so I'm dabbling

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:23.820
with it a little, but it's not something that
I'm trained with

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:25.950
specifically.

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:31.119
Icing in France is usually powdered sugar,
egg white and a little lemon juice and you

00:32:31.119 --> 00:32:35.269
use that for
making fancy cakes that are fondant, so I

00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:37.080
don't use that a lot.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.500
And in American baking, we see it on a lot
of

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:44.889
cupcakes, we see it on a lot of our banana
cakes, carrot cakes, old fashioned kind of

00:32:44.889 --> 00:32:50.539
things, and I think it's very
safe to say that we're very different, .old

00:32:50.539 --> 00:32:51.539
fashioned's not our genre.

00:32:51.539 --> 00:32:58.990
&gt;&gt;Unknown male speaker 4: Are you ever going
to open a store in L.A.

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:01.659
&gt;&gt;Karen: I don't think so.

00:33:01.659 --> 00:33:05.779
[laughs] That's why I was encouraging you,
telling you how easy it is to take the Linzer

00:33:05.779 --> 00:33:09.399
too and from, and the Viking and yeah.

00:33:09.399 --> 00:33:10.399
Okay?

00:33:10.399 --> 00:33:11.399
All right.

00:33:11.399 --> 00:33:13.879
&gt;&gt;female #6: Can we take pictures before you
serve:

00:33:13.879 --> 00:33:15.369
&gt;&gt;Karen: OH yeah, yeah.

00:33:15.369 --> 00:33:16.369
Definitely take pictures.

00:33:16.369 --> 00:33:17.369
[Audience applauds loudly]

00:33:17.369 --> 00:33:17.371
Thank you!!
