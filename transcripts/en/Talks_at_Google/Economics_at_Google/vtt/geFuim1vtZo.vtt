[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.784 --> 00:00:13.748
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:13.748 --> 00:00:15.384
JOSH BROWN: Thank
you, thank you.

00:00:15.384 --> 00:00:16.695
SPEAKER: Thank you, Josh.

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:17.570
Thank you for coming.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.180
JOSH BROWN: What an
intro, thank you.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.429
SPEAKER: I worked on it a lot.

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:21.790
JOSH BROWN: Hi, Google.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.450
SPEAKER: All right,
well, before we

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.450
get into further
establishing all

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.259
of these credentials of yours
with Twitter and your books

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.490
and CNBC, if you'll
humor me, I hope

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.730
you'll help me copilot a
little infographic here.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.480
I don't know if you're
familiar with this,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.000
but I think it will spark
some topics of conversation,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.200
maybe some people for Q&amp;A
at the end of the show.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.800
So what this is,
is a visualization

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.760
for all of the
world's markets, OK?

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.910
And one square
here, at the top--

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.099
that's $100 billion, OK?

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.310
That's $100,000 million, right?

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.720
If my math is correct.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.780
All right, so it
goes through-- and I

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.530
don't want to spend
too much time on this,

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.390
but I do want to go
through a few things here,

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.515
because I think it's
interesting and it will set up

00:01:15.515 --> 00:01:16.480
with some good stuff.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.670
So here we have silver.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.840
World silver is $17 billion.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.180
This chart, incidentally,
was made by Jeff Desjardins.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.070
And I emailed him and
we have permission

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.980
to go through it at this talk,
so thank you very much Jeff.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.254
And it was made maybe six months
ago, but it's still roughly--

00:01:33.254 --> 00:01:35.170
JOSH BROWN: Probably
hasn't changed that much.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.520
SPEAKER: Not too bad,
not too much, right.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.353
JOSH BROWN: Maybe
crypto's a little smaller.

00:01:38.353 --> 00:01:40.720
SPEAKER: Maybe, or maybe
it's about the same,

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.950
since it's gone up and down.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:42.930
So there's crypto.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.500
OK, roughly-- Bitcoin, there,
is about $100 billion or so.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.000
And you can see
it's a certain size.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.760
And then as it
goes through, this

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.560
is next to the largest
companies in the world.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.310
We have Alphabet--

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.270
JOSH BROWN:
Congratulations on that.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.340
SPEAKER: Hey, thanks,
we made the list.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.890
JOSH BROWN: I always knew
you would, by the way.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.570
SPEAKER: Next we have
50 richest people.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.410
Bezos is in there.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.529
I think he just hit $100
billion if I'm not mistaken.

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:07.820
JOSH BROWN: Probably most of
this audience is in there.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.250
SPEAKER: Yeah, a couple
of us are in there too,

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.124
but we're not listed on
the chart [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:11.124 --> 00:02:12.505
JOSH BROWN: Well done.

00:02:12.505 --> 00:02:13.952
SPEAKER: As it
goes down, there's

00:02:13.952 --> 00:02:15.910
a few things I do want
to get to in more depth.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.430
But as we go down, we
have California's GDP.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.075
Remember, every
square-- $100 billion.

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:25.870
Fed's balance sheet is
about $4.5 trillion.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.962
And as we move through,
here's where I think

00:02:27.962 --> 00:02:29.170
it gets a little interesting.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.270
We have currency and gold.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.540
Both of these markets roughly
$7, $8 trillion dollars.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.629
So just to get the crypto
discussion out of the way--

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:39.670
or point out of the way--

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.240
I think maybe, in
general, the bull case

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.300
is that these little
dots here have

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.300
room to grow if it's going to
be some form of digital gold,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.960
right?

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.820
Even if it's a trillion
dollars, people

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.790
are hoping that that grows.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:54.790
Whether that'll happen--

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.305
JOSH BROWN: I am on
the other side of that.

00:02:56.305 --> 00:02:56.800
SPEAKER: OK.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.460
JOSH BROWN: So--

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.030
SPEAKER: You think--

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.160
JOSH BROWN: Let's
just go right in--

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.530
SPEAKER: Let's go right in.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.110
JOSH BROWN: --and break
everyone's hearts.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.026
SPEAKER: That's great.

00:03:02.026 --> 00:03:05.980
JOSH BROWN: I bought Bitcoin
last summer at about $2,300,

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.179
and it ran to $19,000
and I didn't sell it

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:10.345
because I got that argument.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.420
Maybe not what percentage of the
gold market should Bitcoin be,

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.180
but maybe I just
thought about it as--

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.550
this is going to be a
very important network

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.110
for transactions, and then
if the ownership of Bitcoin

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.420
represents renting a
piece of that network,

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.180
then there would be
some value there.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.270
And I did believe that, and not
because the price went down,

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.540
but I kept listening
to podcasts.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.160
And if you listen
to enough podcasts,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.680
you get so many opinions,
and so maybe mine

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.140
changed a little bit.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.020
I know it's a cliché to say
you're bullish on blockchain

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.790
technology but not
bullish on Bitcoin,

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.380
but I actually now think that
that's the most rational way

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.730
to think about it all.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.760
And the blueprint for
that is the fact that--

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.850
what Tim Berners-Lee built
and all the protocols

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.640
that we use for email and
for internet connection.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.090
They have no inherent
value on their own.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.290
HTTP is not worth anything.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.639
However, it's worth
everything, but the real money

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:15.430
has been made by
companies like Google that

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.709
built the layer on top
that actually makes

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.050
it usable for the consumer.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.620
So if you think about blockchain
as just another protocol--

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.120
maybe a very powerful protocol--

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.740
there's no guarantee that just
because Fortune 500 companies

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.410
start to adopt
blockchain, incorporate it

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.540
into their processes,
that that means

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.640
that a coin, for some reason,
has to go up in value.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.920
So I think a great example
from my world is Vanguard.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.762
Vanguard manages, I think, like
$4 point something trillion.

00:04:46.762 --> 00:04:48.220
They're doing
millions and millions

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.020
of transactions every day.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.510
Those transactions, at
the mutual fund level,

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.160
require something
called reconciliation,

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.140
which is basically people in an
office somewhere pushing paper

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.460
back and forth or moving
numbers around in databases.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.620
And if that work can instead
be done by a distributed

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.460
ledger where there is a
record of the buys and sells,

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.080
an outside person can't come
in and change the numbers

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.200
because everyone's got the
same record and it's global,

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.100
then maybe there needs
to be less people who

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.630
are taking basis points
in cost in the system.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.300
So maybe Vanguard shaves
a half a basis point

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.160
in the cost of
running a mutual fund.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.951
And that doesn't sound
like a lot of money,

00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:34.920
but it could be
billions of dollars.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.650
There's no coin.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.000
You don't need a coin for
any of that to happen.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.339
But there's a tremendous
corporate cost savings.

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:43.380
In the case of Vanguard,
the shareholders own it,

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.671
so it's not really a corporate.

00:05:44.671 --> 00:05:48.390
But if other corporations start
to use blockchain in things

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.060
like their supply chains-- which
they're all now talking about--

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.430
that's fantastic,
but that does not

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.460
imply that a digital
currency somewhere

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.820
has to spike in value as a
result of distributed ledger

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:00.420
technology.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.580
So again, I know it's a cliché.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.610
I know people are saying
that at conferences.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.254
But I actually think that the
cliché, in this case, is apt.

00:06:10.254 --> 00:06:10.920
SPEAKER: Got it.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.030
So it's safe to--

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.820
JOSH BROWN: So sell all
your stupid old coins.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.970
SPEAKER: So you're saying that
though blockchain technology

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.179
could be as transformative
as everyone may be saying,

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:22.178
it doesn't mean that if
you're holding on to one

00:06:22.178 --> 00:06:23.344
of these particular coins--

00:06:23.344 --> 00:06:25.260
even if it's Bitcoin or
Ethereum or Litecoin--

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.920
that you're going to get in
on that action, necessarily,

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.070
of the world being--

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.820
JOSH BROWN: Right.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.770
In other words, the story might
be so unglamorous and so unsexy

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.700
that the only place the
benefit of blockchain shows up

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.030
is in the earnings
reports of very

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.340
boring industrial companies
that are moving things

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.710
across the country
and finding ways

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.520
to keep records in a
lower-cost, more efficient way.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.410
And no one's going
to be partying

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.050
on a yacht as a result of that.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.435
It's not going to
be a hot thing.

00:06:56.435 --> 00:06:59.100
Ooh, I got in on block--
it's like, blockchain enables

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.820
us to save $10,000 a
day in shipping costs

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.804
at our loading dock.

00:07:03.804 --> 00:07:04.470
SPEAKER: Got it.

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.210
JOSH BROWN: You know
what I'm saying?

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.710
There's no rappers
talking about that.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.640
So I think separating
the two is--

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.900
it doesn't mean that I think the
coins have no value or that--

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.760
that's a whole other--

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.560
that could be like
five hours, we could--

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.794
that would sound like a 4:00
AM dorm room conversation.

00:07:22.794 --> 00:07:24.210
We're not going
to go there today.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:25.680
SPEAKER: That's why I said,
let's get that out of the way.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.190
So I don't want this to
be a Bitcoin talk, OK?

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:28.690
But--

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.360
JOSH BROWN: No, I'll tell you
what I think about Ripple.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.420
SPEAKER: [LAUGHTER] All right.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.510
JOSH BROWN: All right, go ahead.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:33.700
SPEAKER: I was ready for it.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.010
OK, no, let's move on.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.300
So there's gold, all right?

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.230
Around $7 trillion.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.490
So here we come to
the stock markets.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.570
And what I find
remarkable about this

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.390
is just how the United
States is well over a third

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.640
of the entire global
equities market.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.230
That's pretty wild to me.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:54.330
JOSH BROWN: So if you pop
this chart 120 years ago,

00:07:54.330 --> 00:08:00.620
in the year 1900, Great
Britain would be 25% of this.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:06.100
United States, I think,
would be maybe 15%.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:10.630
Now, Great Britain-- UK
stock market-- is 6%,

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.610
and the United
States came from 0%,

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.080
essentially, to half the world.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.280
And there are a lot of
implications embedded

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.810
in that data, but just
the fact that we've

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:25.660
seen one country go from being
so dominant in the world stock

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.200
markets to shrinking to
almost nothing, I think,

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.620
is remarkable.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.070
The other thing about
this is that China

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:38.500
would be much bigger if
the local companies that

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.860
can be traded only by locals
were open to the world.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.360
But China's exchanges
are not completely open,

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.420
so there's some
interesting nuance to where

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.040
the data probably comes from.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.120
SPEAKER: Got it.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.980
What I find interesting is
that for a lot of people,

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.907
they feel like maybe
the buck stops here,

00:08:53.907 --> 00:08:54.740
or with real estate.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.820
But there are some other
things to get into here.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.550
The global money
supply, I believe--

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.620
this green is from
earlier on in the chart.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.660
That's physical currency
there, and then you

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.570
have narrow money, broad money.

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.860
This is all the
checking deposits.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.540
All the money, basically--

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.550
physical and nonphysical--
in the world.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:17.590
Looking at about-- looks
like, oh, $90 trillion--

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.050
$120 trillion or so.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:21.312
So that's interesting.

00:09:21.312 --> 00:09:23.520
But as we go here, this is
what I wanted to get into.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.540
Here's debt, and it doesn't
all fit on the screen here,

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.780
but this is pretty big.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:31.760
$70 trillion--

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.710
JOSH BROWN: That's not
all sovereign debt.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:33.766
That's consumer debt--

00:09:33.766 --> 00:09:35.140
SPEAKER: Totally,
it's all debt--

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:35.440
JOSH BROWN: OK, corporate debt--

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.240
SPEAKER: --in the
world, that's right.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.610
But that is an eye-opener.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:42.690
And as I go down, this is
the end part of the chart.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.950
I freaked out a little
bit when I first

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.450
saw this chart, because--

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:47.845
then I come down here to--

00:09:47.845 --> 00:09:48.550
oh, pardon me.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:49.610
There is real estate.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.860
This reminds me of "Sim
City" when I was in college.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.110
I don't know if anyone
played that game, but there

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.019
we have commercial real
estate, agriculture

00:09:55.019 --> 00:09:56.185
real estate, and [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:56.185 --> 00:09:58.110
JOSH BROWN: See, for me it's
more like "Minesweeper."

00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:59.526
SPEAKER: "Minesweeper,"
that, too.

00:09:59.526 --> 00:10:01.570
JOSH BROWN: There are
the bombs, in that dead--

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:02.275
sure.

00:10:02.275 --> 00:10:03.500
SPEAKER: Totally.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.660
OK, derivatives-- this is
the bananas part, all right?

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.740
This says, on here--

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.377
they don't know
exactly how big it is.

00:10:12.377 --> 00:10:13.960
JOSH BROWN: Say your
thing, and then--

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:14.780
I know what you're going to say.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:15.280
Say your thing.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.450
SPEAKER: There's a
low-end estimate.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:17.616
There's a high-end estimate.

00:10:17.616 --> 00:10:22.160
And the thing is is you
just scroll, and scroll.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.410
JOSH BROWN: So let me add in--

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:23.650
SPEAKER: Talk to me, Josh.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:24.400
JOSH BROWN: --a caveat.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.191
SPEAKER: All right.

00:10:25.191 --> 00:10:27.010
JOSH BROWN: That's
notional derivatives.

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:27.730
SPEAKER: OK.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:29.820
I'm still scrolling.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.480
JOSH BROWN: Half of these
boxes offset the other half.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.060
That's what a derivative is.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:35.380
It's a contract.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.390
Both sides are
hedging or betting.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:40.300
So notional makes
something really big

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.550
seem bigger than it is.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:47.880
But a lot of the
derivatives that are here,

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.450
there's another
derivative in there

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:51.640
that is the offsetting bet.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.430
So this is not a one-way
bet that everyone is

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:56.380
making on one particular thing.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.740
This is millions and millions of
things with insurance companies

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:05.080
hedging and investment people
playing both sides and banks

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.640
betting on both sides.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.750
So it's probably less scary than
the amount of boxes implies.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.820
SPEAKER: I look at this
as almost the sportsbook

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.050
at the casino, is that right?

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:15.592
It's like I'm betting
that the game--

00:11:15.592 --> 00:11:16.591
JOSH BROWN: That's fair.

00:11:16.591 --> 00:11:17.440
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.110
JOSH BROWN: So
probably, the casino--

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:21.670
only for a portion
of the people that

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:22.879
are playing in these markets.

00:11:22.879 --> 00:11:25.128
A lot of the people that are
playing in these markets,

00:11:25.128 --> 00:11:27.030
you think about a
company like Cargill.

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:28.801
It's an agricultural company.

00:11:28.801 --> 00:11:29.800
They have a lot of risk.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.460
If it's a bumper crop,
prices will drop.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.250
If there's terrible weather,
there won't be enough supply.

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:39.310
And they've got to use
commodity markets to hedge

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:40.295
what their exposure is.

00:11:40.295 --> 00:11:42.670
You think about a bank doing
business all over the world,

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:46.030
like Citigroup, they've
got currency exposure.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:48.380
They have corporate
clients all over the world.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.320
So a lot of this stuff
is really companies

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.970
offloading risk, rather than
trying to take more risk.

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:55.900
And then there are
speculators in the market.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:01.290
So maybe the casino aspect of
it is not quite as pronounced.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:03.720
The one thing the media has
done with the term derivatives

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.940
is they've added a
connotation to it.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:06.960
It's kind of a loaded--

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.472
ooh, derivatives.

00:12:08.472 --> 00:12:09.180
That's code for--

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:09.990
SPEAKER: They took us down.

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:12.115
JOSH BROWN: That's code
for, I don't understand it,

00:12:12.115 --> 00:12:15.870
so it must be bad,
or these somehow

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.370
represent speculative bets.

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:22.554
When in reality, a lot of it is
attempting to minimize risks.

00:12:22.554 --> 00:12:23.220
SPEAKER: Got it.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:23.790
JOSH BROWN: Feel better?

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:25.470
SPEAKER: I do a
little bit, thank you.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:26.340
JOSH BROWN: That's
why I came today.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.170
SPEAKER: I did.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:29.610
Thanks for going through
that with me and humoring me.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.260
Hopefully that was
eye-opening for some people.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:38.035
I'm going to move
on, now, to you.

00:12:38.035 --> 00:12:43.010
OK, I hope this isn't too
personal of a question,

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:47.780
but what dark past or
VH1 "Behind the Music"

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:51.490
story leads to you becoming
the reformed broker?

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:52.820
What's reformed?

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.100
JOSH BROWN: Yeah, so I
did the book about it in--

00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:01.190
I wrote it in 2011, which
was about a year post leaving

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:02.540
the brokerage industry.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:06.080
But long story short, I come
from this really strange place

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.210
on the east coast
called Long Island.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:13.910
And in the mid-to-late-1990s,
every aggressive young male got

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.560
a Series 7 and became a broker.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.350
It's just what you did.

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:21.740
If you grew up in Nebraska,
you became a football player

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.080
and you were a Cornhusker.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.500
So for whatever reason, what we
did was we became stockbrokers.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.470
And it was the golden age
of being a stockbroker,

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:32.210
because it was pre-internet.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:36.020
It was pre-people having
access to building

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.370
their own portfolio.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:38.930
Charles Schwab was out there.

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:42.440
Used to call Charles Schwab,
and you would pay like $10

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.020
to get 15 stock quotes
read to you over the phone.

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.550
It's a true story.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.230
So people wanted
access to the market,

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:49.938
and the only way they
could really get it

00:13:49.938 --> 00:13:51.140
was via a stockbroker.

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:54.470
So there was some glamor
to being a broker,

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:56.960
and there were high-end
versions and low-end versions.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:02.270
And I was screwing
around in college.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:06.230
Didn't really have any serious
passion to do anything.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:09.530
And my dad said, you should talk
to my friend from the country

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:10.760
club that I play golf with.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.950
I think he makes a
million dollars a day.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:15.080
Go get a job with him.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.030
My dad, he doesn't
know anything.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:18.350
So I meet the guy.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:20.180
He hires me 15
minutes later, which

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.470
should have been a red flag.

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:25.460
But I am studying
for a Series 7, which

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.370
is a very low barrier to entry.

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:31.970
You need like a 60 IQ
to pass the tests--

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:33.630
also should have
been a red flag.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:35.300
But I passed it.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.800
They handed me a
telephone, and they

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.730
said, call these 500
people today, and I did.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.270
And out of the 500 people,
50 people would talk to you.

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:46.430
Out of those 50 people, 10
of them would have money

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:48.530
and would be interested
in hearing from you again.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:51.113
You would call those people back
a week later after you mailed

00:14:51.113 --> 00:14:53.250
them a brochure that
had a sailboat on it,

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:57.950
and you would sell
them Callaway Golf IPO.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.990
Snapple is coming public.

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:02.205
This is like '96, '97.

00:15:02.205 --> 00:15:04.430
So I was a cold caller.

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.790
Not able to sell stocks, but
introducing a senior broker.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.550
My senior broker
had five Porsches,

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.630
one for each day of the week.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:17.010
And prior to being a
broker, he was a bouncer.

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:21.740
I mean, when you're 20 or
21, you're like, all right,

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:22.830
this is amazing.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:24.320
Everyone's getting rich.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.614
The market keeps going up.

00:15:26.614 --> 00:15:28.280
And there were all
these IPOs, and we're

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.560
getting pieces of them and
we're helping people invest.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.930
And so I probably was
really, really good at it.

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.420
So nobody quits something
they're good at, right?

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.522
If you're good at something,
you keep doing it.

00:15:38.522 --> 00:15:40.730
And all the nagging thoughts
in the back of my head--

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:43.980
am I qualified to be telling
people how to invest?

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.130
I don't think I am, but
they're listening to me.

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:51.230
So I did it, and then
the financial crisis

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:53.500
was a wake-up call,
because everything I

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.670
had done for people--
and I did my best.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:58.521
Sell them the right stock,
mutual fund, whatever.

00:15:58.521 --> 00:16:00.020
But then you realize--
you look back

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.390
and you said, all
I really did was

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:06.950
sell people investments when I
should have been advising them.

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:08.340
So that was a
great wake-up call.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.640
And I met my partner,
Barry Ritholtz,

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.300
because he was the
guy writing the blogs.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.210
He started when you were
posting on GeoCities,

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:19.040
back when you would
write for 30 minutes

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.240
and then code for 30 minutes
to get it published-- '98, '99.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.740
But I met Barry, and Barry
was telling the truth.

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.770
And I said, I could
totally do that.

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:31.116
So I started the
blog 10 years ago.

00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:32.740
Millions and millions
of readers later,

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.540
I'm still doing it
pretty much every day,

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.670
although not while I'm out here.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:41.270
But on a daily basis,
I'm putting stuff out.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:44.720
And I'm like the worst nightmare
for traditional Wall Street,

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.760
because I know where all
the bodies are buried,

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.580
and I've spent much
of the last 10 years--

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:54.500
almost daily-- talking about the
ways in which traditional stock

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.600
brokerage, hedge
fund, et cetera--

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.030
all the pitfalls, all
the ways that people

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:00.320
spend more than they should.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.070
People lose money.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:02.210
People are tricked.

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:04.970
People are misdirected into
investments that are not

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:06.260
in their best interests.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.890
And I haven't made a lot of
friends south of 14th street

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:11.810
in New York, but all
over the country,

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:15.079
people get what I'm saying
and they agree with it.

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:19.130
And their enthusiasm for the
truths that I've been telling

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:22.619
have kept me at it.

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:25.560
And now I've broken into the
mainstream financial media,

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.980
which is an even worse
nightmare, because all

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:32.480
the advertisers are companies
that I'm then saying,

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.430
no, you don't really need that.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:37.467
But they keep booking
me, so I keep doing it.

00:17:37.467 --> 00:17:39.050
SPEAKER: Well, I
definitely appreciate

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:41.100
the candor you bring to
the "Halftime Report."

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:41.610
JOSH BROWN: Thank you.

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:43.609
SPEAKER: It's an awesome
show-- everyone on it--

00:17:43.609 --> 00:17:45.900
and I love what you do there.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.040
Can you tell me about--

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.370
you started to talk about
Ritholtz Wealth Management.

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.020
Who are your customers?

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.447
How does having a million
Twitter followers and this blog

00:17:54.447 --> 00:17:56.280
you've worked on for
so long-- how does that

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.694
fit into your business?

00:17:57.694 --> 00:18:00.110
Can you tell me anything else,
like assets and management?

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:03.330
JOSH BROWN: So we are
the strangest version

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:04.890
of our type of work.

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:07.420
Our friends call it Registered
Investment Advisory.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.180
Everyone's heard the term RIA.

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.740
Basically, we're non-brokerage.

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.020
Were fiduciary only.

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:18.520
Managing money for high networth
households and small pensions,

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:19.470
endowments.

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:25.040
And we're very strange in
that most RIAs in the country,

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.130
they look more like barbershops.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:29.110
It's usually a
sole practitioner,

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:31.060
maybe has a few
people-- or she has

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:35.380
a few people working for him
or her, but they're local.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:38.500
So they're in the office
complex that's on Main Street,

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.930
or they might even
have a storefront.

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:43.300
And all the customers come
because they play golf

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.550
at the country club where
all the other wealthy people

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:49.930
in town play, and it's very
familial and, you could say,

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:51.640
incestuous.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:57.220
And these are relationships that
are based on personality stuff

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:58.309
and geography.

00:18:58.309 --> 00:19:00.100
They're not really
based on-- this person's

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.260
a really good investor.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.940
I think we've broken that mold.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.640
Most of our clients are
nowhere near where we're based.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.560
We're based in New York.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.920
I think our biggest client
base is on the west coast--

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:16.960
up from Portland, all the
way down to San Diego.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.270
And then we've got big
pockets of clientele

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:21.370
in places like
Austin and Chicago.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.920
And a lot of clients
we've not met,

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.380
or we meet them six months
into the relationship.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.940
We're already
managing their money.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.370
They tend to be
more progressive--

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:33.400
a lot of people that
work in technology.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.290
And what they all
have in common is

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:39.520
that they're not hung up on
having a local office in town.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.670
They just want the best
people that there are.

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:45.280
And if that's a telephone or
a relationship on the web,

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.330
they're OK with that.

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:50.200
We bridge the gap
by doing content--

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.720
so Twitter, blogs.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:56.320
We have 5 of the top 20
independent financial advisor

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.180
blogs in the country.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.910
24/7 we're putting
out our thoughts

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:07.060
on markets, economics, the nexus
of politics with investing.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.280
And our clients know
where they can find what

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.510
our thoughts are at all times.

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:14.870
So we've built fans, and
fans have become clients,

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:18.400
and that is the best way to
build a business, I think,

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.110
in the 21st century.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:24.150
And I think as people
here are aware of--

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:27.340
and maybe in finance, it's
dawning on the industry--

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.980
the scarce resource
is not capital.

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:31.710
You just showed me a slide.

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:35.080
There's more capital out in
the world than ever before.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.160
The scarce resource
is attention.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.080
How do you get attention?

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:44.000
Well, I'm not pretty enough
to get a lot on Instagram.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.660
But on the web and
on Twitter, you

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.910
can get attention
by being helpful

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:50.770
and by saying things
that are true.

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:53.260
Maybe even things
that are uncomfortable

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.930
but that have to be confronted.

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:58.030
When you do a daily
investment blog

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:00.100
and you're giving people
the data that they

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.810
need to make smart
decisions, rather than

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:05.530
emotional decisions, you can
get a lot of positive attention

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:09.400
for putting that stuff out
there, not charging for it,

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.400
not keeping it
gated, and not acting

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.290
like you invented the truth.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:16.190
You're just presenting people--

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.940
here's the data.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:19.690
Here's the evidence for why
these types of investors

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:23.120
do better than those
types of investors.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.500
So if it's an attention economy
and you're out there earning

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:30.130
the right type of attention,
you can build an amazing brand,

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:31.780
and you can build
a fan base that

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.110
become clients of your service.

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:37.130
And we started the firm
less than five years ago.

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:40.900
We were just under $90 million,
four people managing it.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:44.030
We're 24 people less
than five years later.

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:46.570
We just broke $800
million under management,

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:48.670
and we've opened
offices in Chicago,

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:52.810
in Newport Beach, California,
Portland, Long Island, Florida.

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:55.420
And we're talking to advisors
all over the country that

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:59.740
want to be part of this movement
of evidence-based investing,

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:01.330
putting the customer first.

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:04.210
And all of this is happening
as a result of digital.

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:06.430
We don't take out newspaper ads.

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:09.720
All of this is because
of social media.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.620
SPEAKER: I would think
that on certain days--

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.600
when maybe something big
happens in the market,

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.635
for better or worse-- that it
saves a couple of phone calls

00:22:16.635 --> 00:22:18.010
from happening if
people can just

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:20.360
go onto these other channels
and see exactly what you think.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.943
JOSH BROWN: That's
such a great point,

00:22:21.943 --> 00:22:23.750
and this was not intentional.

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:25.960
We figured this
out along the way.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:29.830
Think about-- if you
have a wealth manager

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:33.070
and it's a good person,
someone you trust.

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:36.160
And then on a Tuesday morning,
think about an environment--

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.010
let's say, 2011.

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:40.930
You guys got to pay the bills.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:41.810
SPEAKER: I thought I
had this not happen.

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:43.851
JOSH BROWN: Think about
an environment like 2011,

00:22:43.851 --> 00:22:48.310
where the standard deviation
for the S&amp;P is off the charts--

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:49.960
it's like 40--

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.690
and the average annual
standard deviation is 20.

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:54.670
And 500 point swings
in the Dow are

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.530
happening multiple times a day.

00:22:56.530 --> 00:23:01.540
And news coming out of Europe
is rattling US stock markets.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.370
Is Greece going to
default on Friday?

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:04.190
Stay tuned.

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:05.920
I mean, that was
what was going on.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.680
And people with money at stake--
people with investment capital

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.080
at risk--

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.080
do I have to pay attention
to German bund auctions?

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.880
Is this where we are now?

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.550
It's not that we have the
answers to that stuff.

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:21.560
I think we do a really
good job with context.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.120
If your wealth manager is
not in the office that day

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.230
and you just want to--

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:28.450
you're reading and the app
is buzzing on your phone

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.690
and you're like, this
sounds really scary.

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:34.230
I hope my gal at
x, y, z firm, or I

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:36.815
hope my guy at whatever
firm is reading

00:23:36.815 --> 00:23:38.190
the same thing
I'm reading, and I

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:39.870
hope they have an answer to it.

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:43.470
Our clients don't have to wonder
if we're on top of this stuff

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:48.270
and we're paying attention,
because we are constantly

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:50.760
linking to sources
of information,

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.310
telling people what not
to pay attention to,

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:55.890
pointing out people that
are being hysterical

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:58.920
and trying to scare
the public for clicks.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.560
Not that we're the
police, but we're like--

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.700
don't read this guy.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:03.720
He's a nut.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.270
He's been doing this
every year for 20 years.

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:08.040
And that kind of thing--

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:12.390
not just for fans, but
for actual clients--

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:14.670
I think that's the
future of the industry,

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:17.040
and I really think
that financial advice

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:20.070
is a communications
business as much as it

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:23.260
is a financial business, right?

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.830
Because you could give
somebody the best portfolio

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:28.250
on Earth, but if they
can't stick with it,

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:29.820
you did nothing for them.

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:32.670
And so, so much of what
we're doing with content

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:36.840
is designed around, let's help
people not do the wrong thing

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.510
at the wrong time.

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:41.140
SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:44.170
I have to ask you about CNBC.

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:44.870
Let's go there.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:47.680
And I have a photo of
the "Halftime Report."

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.177
But the thing is is that I had--

00:24:50.177 --> 00:24:51.760
JOSH BROWN: I look
jacked in that one.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:52.400
SPEAKER: You do.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.566
JOSH BROWN: I don't always--

00:24:53.566 --> 00:24:55.310
maybe I'm flexing.

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:58.880
The guy on the other side of me
played for the Chicago Bears,

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.760
so he's definitely
stronger than me.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.420
I'm stronger than Jim,
though, I feel like.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:07.120
But Jim was on a
submarine for eight years

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.800
during the Cold War,
some weird thing.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:09.820
SPEAKER: Oh, for real?

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:11.770
JOSH BROWN: All good
people on the network.

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:14.800
SPEAKER: I had some other
questions prepared, but I mean,

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.137
I think the thing I
have to ask you about--

00:25:17.137 --> 00:25:18.220
and here's my next slide--

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.480
is Larry.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:23.890
I mean, I guess you were
coworkers with this guy

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:25.820
until just a few days ago.

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.040
Larry Kudlow is going to be--

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:29.590
JOSH BROWN: I am next in line,
by the way, when he gets fired.

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:30.670
SPEAKER: I thought it
was Cramer and then you.

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:31.961
JOSH BROWN: Cramer and then me.

00:25:31.961 --> 00:25:32.650
SPEAKER: OK.

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:33.520
So Larry Kudlow--

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.970
JOSH BROWN: By the way, my
partner, Barry Ritholtz,

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:40.210
was on "The Larry
Kudlow Show" every week

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:43.360
for three years heading
into the crisis.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:46.360
And Barry was the guy
saying, this housing thing

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.260
is totally unsustainable.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:52.090
All you have to look at is
average incomes are doing this,

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:53.990
and home prices are doing that.

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:55.990
So one of two things can happen.

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:58.420
Either average incomes
all of a sudden

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:02.690
double nationally to justify
what home prices have done,

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:07.002
or some radical thing happens
because an alien ship lands

00:26:07.002 --> 00:26:08.710
and hands everyone
the money that they'll

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:10.900
need to make their payments.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:12.820
And neither of those
two things happened,

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:14.120
so the third thing happened.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.330
But Barry was a frequent
guest on Larry's show,

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:17.440
and I've known Larry for--

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.540
I think he's a fantastic guy.

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:22.400
We are not on the same side
of the political spectrum.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.530
I think he's a good guy.

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:28.570
And I also think he's probably
a better voice than some

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:31.480
of the other voices that might
get into the White House,

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.750
so I'm really glad
that he got the nod,

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:38.290
and I hope he does good
work on behalf of America.

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:40.690
So that's my take on Larry.

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:42.360
SPEAKER: Hope so, too.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.910
Yeah.

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:46.320
JOSH BROWN: Very nice man,
and he loves the country.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.420
And even if you don't
like his economic policies

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:52.090
and you don't agree with
tax or tariffs or whatever,

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:54.180
he's a good person,
and I think he wants

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.731
what's best for everyone, so.

00:26:55.731 --> 00:26:58.230
SPEAKER: You're probably the
dozenth person that's said that

00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:59.530
on television about him, too.

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:00.850
I mean, he seems liked by all.

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:02.280
Everyone says, I don't agree--

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:02.936
not everyone.

00:27:02.936 --> 00:27:04.560
But everyone who
doesn't agree with him

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.310
says, I have the utmost
respect for Larry.

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:09.977
JOSH BROWN: Well, listen,
he's a free trade, cut tax--

00:27:09.977 --> 00:27:11.560
I mean, not everyone
agrees with that.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:15.360
But no one that has
met him personally--

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.740
he doesn't have enemies.

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.650
He has people that disagree
with him on policy.

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:22.260
There are legit
guys out there that

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.870
could be in that spot
that have enemies

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:26.790
because they're bad people.

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:30.390
So it's good that it's going
to be Larry rather than someone

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:34.260
dangerous, I guess,
is how I would say it.

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:38.190
Now, I disagree with a
lot of the economic stuff,

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:40.335
but everyone disagrees
with everyone, so.

00:27:40.335 --> 00:27:42.210
SPEAKER: Yeah, there's
not a lot of screaming

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:43.650
at each other on CNBC.

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:46.290
Sometimes, but not too much.

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:49.556
It's nice to go to a
channel and there's

00:27:49.556 --> 00:27:51.997
a more rational discourse.

00:27:51.997 --> 00:27:52.830
I have a few other--

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:55.170
I'll just throw it back
to this slide, here.

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:57.810
Before we move to the Q&amp;A
here in just a little bit,

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:00.480
I have a couple
other questions here.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.049
So who is the life of the
party off camera at CNBC?

00:28:04.049 --> 00:28:05.340
I imagine there's a green room.

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:08.430
Everyone's vaping--
someone's got to be.

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:09.640
David Faber, who is it?

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.070
JOSH BROWN: Is that what you--

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.990
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:12.642
JOSH BROWN: Vaping what?

00:28:12.642 --> 00:28:13.350
SPEAKER: Tobacco.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:14.224
It's New York, right?

00:28:14.224 --> 00:28:16.200
JOSH BROWN: Much
more molly than--

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.160
no.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.110
So Jon Najarian and
his brother Pete

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:23.490
are two of my favorite
people that I've ever met.

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:27.120
Both of them were
in the NFL briefly.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:30.420
And then they transitioned to
the options and futures markets

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:32.910
in Chicago, which is where
they learned finance.

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:35.070
Did very well for themselves.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:36.660
Now they're options specialists.

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:42.480
But exactly what they act like
on camera, they are off camera.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.490
Two of just the nicest,
best people I've ever met.

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:48.060
And they're a generation
or two older than me,

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:50.250
and I've learned
so much about how

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:54.630
to be an entrepreneur, how to do
media and be true to yourself.

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:56.550
And these guys come
on in ponytails.

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.970
They look like wrestlers.

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:02.260
But they are genuine, and
that really stands out.

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.800
And I think that's
why fans of CNBC

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:09.240
really like them and appreciate
what they bring to the table.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:13.260
And similar to
Larry, they're people

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.571
that-- everyone that's
met them likes them.

00:29:15.571 --> 00:29:16.945
So when I look at
them and I say,

00:29:16.945 --> 00:29:18.070
all right, I'm doing media.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:19.620
What is the right
way to do it so

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:24.180
that I can be taken seriously
and be myself and not

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:27.540
put on airs or act
like I know everything

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:30.840
or become pompous because
I'm on financial TV?

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.690
Those guys are really
great models for that.

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:34.687
SPEAKER: Nice.

00:29:34.687 --> 00:29:37.270
I think we're going to move to
the Q&amp;A portion of the program,

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:37.920
if that's all right.

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:38.740
This is fun, Josh.

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.380
JOSH BROWN: OK, what
should I ask you?

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.630
SPEAKER: Well, we're going
to open it to the audience.

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:43.520
If you'd like to
ask me something,

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.240
but I have to throw
this to you if you're

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.030
going to ask a question.

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:47.071
JOSH BROWN: What is that?

00:29:47.071 --> 00:29:50.310
SPEAKER: This is a microphone
inside of a foam Google square.

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:52.972
And whoever catches it-- if
you want to ask a question,

00:29:52.972 --> 00:29:54.180
you just hold the microphone.

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:56.010
And then when you
ask your question,

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:57.343
you throw it to the next person.

00:29:57.343 --> 00:29:58.800
Here it comes.

00:29:58.800 --> 00:29:59.770
OK, question for--

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:00.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:01.450
AUDIENCE: So we talk into this?

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:02.190
SPEAKER: Talk into it.

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:02.560
AUDIENCE: How are you doing?

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.855
SPEAKER: It's crazy, I know.

00:30:03.855 --> 00:30:05.480
JOSH BROWN: Yes, sir,
you with the box.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:08.140
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:09.140
Kind of an odd question.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.070
So I actually do a good
amount of investing.

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:14.310
I go out and raise capital
and match deals and dollars.

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:17.700
I spent a lot of
time in real estate

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:19.060
and look at the market a lot.

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:22.730
And my question is, I
started a REIT in 2010

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:25.760
when it was obvious that
the opportunity was there.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:29.920
Today, it feels like we're
much closer to the ceiling

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.050
than we are the floor,
which it kind of feels

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:33.500
like in the market as well.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.041
And my question-- which I know
is a bit of a vague question--

00:30:36.041 --> 00:30:37.960
is, what do you do when
everything in your gut

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:42.760
tells you that the risk
isn't there with the reward?

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:44.110
Where do you go?

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:48.110
How do you identify what
the next thing to do is?

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:52.060
Or do you just sit on capital,
waiting for the next 2010,

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.530
maybe missing some
more of the upside?

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:58.090
But what I found was by
having capital at that time,

00:30:58.090 --> 00:30:59.710
I was able to make
a lot of money.

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:01.210
While everybody was running
out of the building,

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:02.200
we were running in.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.500
JOSH BROWN: Yeah, but you had to
have been liquid at that time.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:04.670
AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:05.800
JOSH BROWN: You couldn't
have been fully invested

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.250
and then taken advantage
of the opportunity.

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:08.958
AUDIENCE: Understood,
and it's not about,

00:31:08.958 --> 00:31:12.070
necessarily-- it's not really
about knowing the exact ceiling

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:13.060
and the exact floor.

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:15.792
We happened to do it in 2010,
on the real estate market.

00:31:15.792 --> 00:31:17.500
But what do you do
when you start feeling

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.990
like you're almost there?

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:22.780
JOSH BROWN: So real estate is
very different than the stock

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:23.800
market question, right?

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.950
Because if you feel that
way with real estate

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:30.200
and you want to do something
to prepare for the down cycle,

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.740
you need months
and years in order

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:34.780
to start liquidating properties.

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:37.720
You can't just sell.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:38.950
Stock market is different.

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:41.170
If you want to be tactful
in the stock market--

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:44.350
a portion of our
client portfolios are.

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:46.597
So our investment beliefs--

00:31:46.597 --> 00:31:48.430
just to give you a
little bit of background,

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:50.440
and then I'll answer your
question specifically.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:53.290
Our investment beliefs
are that less is more.

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:56.350
There are simple
answers to complexities.

00:31:56.350 --> 00:32:00.310
Not every complexity needs to
be met with more complexity.

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:02.080
Cost matters.

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.710
After tax returns matter
a lot more than what

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:07.660
particular investment you buy.

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:10.090
So we've got this
overarching philosophy of--

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:13.270
let's not go in there and
twiddle the knobs every day.

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:15.670
Let's let markets
do what they do,

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:18.580
and let's build durable,
rules-based portfolios

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:20.241
where the rules
are set in advance

00:32:20.241 --> 00:32:22.240
and we're not using our
gut instincts for things

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.280
like market timing.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.100
Now, that works for, let's say,
80% of the client's assets,

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:31.270
and then maybe 10% or 20%
we'll manage more tactically.

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:34.090
That will also be
rules-based, but that's

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:36.220
going to be a function of trend.

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.790
And again, we don't have to
do this with real estate.

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:39.910
We're fortunate.

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:44.170
We can do this with
zero-cost treasury bond ETFs

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:46.810
and near-zero cost equity ETFs.

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:49.930
And we can say, in an uptrend
we want to be fully invested.

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:52.450
In a choppy market, we want
to do as little trading

00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:54.820
as possible so as
not to get whipsawed.

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:57.777
And in a defined downtrend--
and not a downtrend

00:32:57.777 --> 00:32:59.860
where I'm like, hey, that
looks like a downtrend--

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:04.210
but mathematically defined by
the slope of what the index is

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:07.570
doing on a monthly,
moving average basis,

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:09.400
we want to have less exposure.

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:13.240
Even if that means there
is this cataclysmic event

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.070
and then the market
rebounds and we're

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:19.540
forced to buy back and hire
as a new uptrend, that's fine.

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:21.130
We look at it as insurance.

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:23.650
It's not an alpha strategy,
what we're doing tactically.

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:27.370
But by marrying strategic,
long-term investing with

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:29.230
a tactical piece--

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:31.230
I talked all about
investor behavior.

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:32.200
It's not lip service.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.870
It's literally--
what we do is manage

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:35.600
the psychology of investors.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:39.160
So if what we need to do is
limit how much equity exposure

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:45.140
they have in a bear market,
it's OK if Jack Bogle disagrees.

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:47.240
I have to face investors.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.230
He doesn't.

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:52.610
So it's nice to have a
grandiloquent, overarching

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:54.110
philosophy of never do anything.

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:56.060
Just buy and close your eyes.

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:57.950
But I'm in the
business 20 years.

00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:59.370
I know that's not real.

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:04.640
So I think we've married the
two approaches that we just saw.

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.460
We just saw the Nobel
Prize for economics awarded

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:08.929
to-- for the first time ever--

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:10.670
three economists at once.

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:14.540
I forget the third guy, but
importantly, Bob Shiller--

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:15.409
he wins.

00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:20.239
His theory's about bubbles
and cycles driven by emotion.

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:22.940
He wins at the same time
as Gene Fama, who says,

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:25.310
there are no bubbles,
and markets are perfectly

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:27.199
efficient at all times.

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:30.679
How could they both win
and share the same prize?

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:34.130
Our portfolio
resembles that win.

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:37.670
So we say, in the strategic
portion of your portfolio,

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:40.130
the market's going to be
right more than it's wrong.

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:43.070
The market is
smarter than we are.

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:45.850
Just saying the market
is mostly efficient

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:48.850
is not the same as saying
the market's always right.

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:50.540
But we want to do as
little as possible

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:56.270
because, Gene Fama's math backs
up the capital asset pricing

00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:58.080
model and how the markets work.

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.470
But then part of us realized
that there are bubbles

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:03.380
and there are cycles and
there are emotional moments,

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:05.420
and the pendulum
does swing too far.

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.620
So that's why we marry
those two approaches.

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:11.030
So seeing those two gentlemen
step up and win the Nobel Prize

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:15.140
together perfectly aligns
with how we manage money.

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:17.690
It's perfectly intuitive to us.

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:21.197
So the answer to your question
is yes, you should sell.

00:35:21.197 --> 00:35:22.051
AUDIENCE: Perfect.

00:35:22.051 --> 00:35:23.030
I'm out.

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:24.560
JOSH BROWN: The answer to your
question's, how do you know?

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:25.520
You do not know.

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.710
You will not know.

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:29.870
But you have to
be willing to say,

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:33.270
if I feel this way and
I'm not rules-based;

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:35.190
and it's real
estate, not stocks--

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:37.274
there's no moving
average for a building--

00:35:37.274 --> 00:35:38.690
you have to be
willing to say, I'm

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:42.470
willing to forgo some upside,
even if it takes three years.

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:46.550
Because I think I would
have more regret--

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:49.070
and remember, all of this
is regret minimisation.

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:52.430
What would you regret more,
missing the next 20% up

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:57.830
and cap rates keep exploding,
or seeing a 20% downdraft

00:35:57.830 --> 00:35:58.810
and having no capital?

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:00.750
It sounds like you
already know your answer.

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:02.360
So you should start
to sell right now.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:02.660
AUDIENCE: Perfect.

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:03.880
JOSH BROWN: Like, leave
the room and just listen.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:04.200
AUDIENCE: I'm out.

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.060
I'm leaving.

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:06.050
JOSH BROWN: All
right, throw that box.

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:06.530
SPEAKER: All right, who's next?

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:07.113
Throw the box.

00:36:07.113 --> 00:36:08.810
Let's toss it back.

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:09.680
All right.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.780
AUDIENCE: So you were
talking about the housing

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:12.710
market earlier.

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:17.900
And so we're kind of seeing
now the market is getting just

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:20.720
super high-- housing,
adding the stock market,

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.590
and with the recent tax cut.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:25.820
And I know that
the administration

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:29.320
is pushing to roll back a
lot of the regulation that

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.695
was put in place,
like Dodd-Frank

00:36:30.695 --> 00:36:31.100
and all of that kind of stuff.

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:32.930
JOSH BROWN: Already
in progress, yeah.

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:33.770
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:36.230
How do you feel?

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:37.320
What's your take on that?

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:40.880
Do you think that the banks have
kind of learned their lesson?

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:44.212
Or do you think that greed
will take the day again?

00:36:44.212 --> 00:36:46.670
JOSH BROWN: We'll blow up again,
but it doesn't necessarily

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:48.830
have to be centered
around the banks.

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:50.630
We've had plenty
of financial crises

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:54.470
where the banks
were fringe actors.

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:56.720
They weren't necessarily
in the center of it.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.360
If you would've told me--

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.640
so September '08, Lehman
Brothers becomes the largest

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.765
bankruptcy in US history.

00:37:02.765 --> 00:37:06.320
It's like $200 billion or
whatever the number is,

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:09.875
dwarfing anything that
even comes close to that.

00:37:09.875 --> 00:37:12.680
It makes Enron look
like a walk in the park.

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:15.170
And then a month later,
two months later,

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:18.950
December, the Madoff
stuff starts to come out.

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:22.250
If you had told me in
that moment, right--

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:26.480
Bayer, AIG, Washington
Mutual, Wachovia, Merrill gets

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:30.650
rescued, Lehman doesn't,
Madoff, $50 billion Ponzi--

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:34.310
If you had told me
that within 10 years

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:36.650
we would be rolling
back financial regs,

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:39.650
I would say, no way.

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:42.830
What could possibly
be going on that we

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:46.280
would be anti-regulatory,
like voting in people that

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:49.280
want less regulation, right?

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.900
Well, I'll tell you
what could go on.

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:56.870
How about a nine-year nonstop
rally in stock prices?

00:37:56.870 --> 00:38:01.190
How about the too big
to fail regulations

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:04.010
that perversely cause
the four biggest banks

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:06.020
to get even bigger, right?

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:09.770
How about free money all over
the world as central banks

00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:12.350
essentially monetize debt?

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:14.300
In Japan, they're not
just buying bonds,

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.400
they're buying stock ETFs.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.620
Japanese central
bank is buying REITs.

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:19.910
Like, how about that?

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:22.790
Maybe that could cause
the kind of environment

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:25.490
where we're saying, we
need less regulation,

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:26.750
because everything's fine.

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:30.080
So the good thing about
Dodd-Frank and capital controls

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:33.140
and Basel III-- which is like
the global agreement on how

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:34.670
much leverage
banks should take--

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:37.850
the good thing about
all that, perversely,

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:39.680
is going to become a bad thing.

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.590
The good thing is that banks
have never had better balance

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:44.310
sheets, never.

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:46.550
They have never been
in better shape.

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:50.210
You look at leverage ratios,
you look at their ability to do

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:53.570
pretty much anything they
want and return capital

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:56.090
to shareholders-- big
dividends, big buybacks--

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:57.680
never been better.

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:00.020
So, of course, now
is a great time

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:02.400
to loosen up the regulation.

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:06.410
But we have not had a crisis
in 10 years, so that's why--

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:07.694
that's the new mode.

00:39:07.694 --> 00:39:09.110
The other thing
that's happened is

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:11.630
I think the Republicans
have done a really good job

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:16.940
at convincing blue collar
workers that somehow removing

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:19.730
restrictions on payday
lenders is good for them.

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:21.770
I don't know, it's very odd.

00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:23.690
But I think what
they've been able to say

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:28.470
to people is freedom is
being infringed upon--

00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:35.400
the freedom to drill an oil well
in your backyard, the freedom

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:39.840
to strip mine Yellowstone
Park, our freedoms are over.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:40.980
And it worked.

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:44.190
And not every regulation
is a good regulation.

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:47.294
And Dodd-Frank is-- we
call it Frankenstein.

00:39:47.294 --> 00:39:48.960
It's not [? pretty. ?]
It's not perfect.

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.630
But the fact that they've
been able to message

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:55.050
the American public, that by
allowing those regulations

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:59.010
it's hurting them, it resonated.

00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:00.870
So I'll see you in
the next crisis.

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:02.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.850
But the thing is we
would have one anyway.

00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:08.540
I can wheel off 25 crises
that have happened.

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:11.190
It doesn't matter, high
regulation, low regulation,

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:14.100
because risk finds a way
and everyone's memory

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:16.746
is wiped clean
relatively quickly.

00:40:16.746 --> 00:40:19.950
So I don't think we can
regulate financial crises out

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:22.150
of existence.

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:24.945
SPEAKER: OK, next question.

00:40:24.945 --> 00:40:26.820
You just handed the box,
you didn't throw it.

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:27.360
But that's OK.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:27.910
AUDIENCE: OK, that's fine.

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:28.510
SPEAKER: Let's move along.

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:29.718
AUDIENCE: I'll toss it later.

00:40:29.718 --> 00:40:31.300
Yeah, I'm interested
in your take

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:38.950
on the companies that don't use
advice or news to make bets.

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:42.640
They just use mathematics,
like Renaissance.

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.830
And a lot of the people
who run those companies,

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:48.130
they come from the same
places a lot of us come from--

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:51.230
academic, mathematics,
and computer science.

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:53.200
And as far as I
understand, they're

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:56.050
the most successful
traders on Wall Street.

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:58.395
JOSH BROWN: Yes, at the
current moment, absolutely.

00:40:58.395 --> 00:41:00.020
AUDIENCE: And so,
but it's interesting,

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:03.160
because they don't care
whether Steve Jobs dies.

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:04.744
They just trade
according to formulas.

00:41:04.744 --> 00:41:06.951
And I'm just curious about
what you think about that.

00:41:06.951 --> 00:41:09.610
JOSH BROWN: Right,
so if you walked up

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:14.340
to an average person,
a savvy person,

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:18.540
and you said, in 2011
I know for a fact

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:22.190
that Steve Jobs is going
to die in 30 days--

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:24.800
buy, sell, or hold Apple?

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:28.982
What percentage of people
would say buy Apple?

00:41:28.982 --> 00:41:29.950
AUDIENCE: A few.

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:31.810
JOSH BROWN: 10% maybe.

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:34.840
Everyone would say,
oh no, the magic man.

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:37.930
And I would've said that,
because I don't know anything.

00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:40.960
Apple was worth $300
billion when Jobs died.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:43.060
It's worth a trillion
dollars now almost.

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:46.840
So it's tripled under
the chief operating

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:49.280
officer as the new CEO.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.415
He's created more value
than Steve Jobs did.

00:41:51.415 --> 00:41:54.670
It makes no sense,
completely counterintuitive.

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:58.340
So an algorithm doesn't
care who's the CEO.

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:01.090
Now, that's not the same
as saying that algorithms

00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:02.644
won't react to news though.

00:42:02.644 --> 00:42:04.810
So many of the trading
algorithms are-- what they're

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:07.180
really doing is
scanning headlines

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:11.350
and they're looking for
things like bomb, White House.

00:42:11.350 --> 00:42:16.150
And so there was a hacking
attack on the "60 Minutes"

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:20.140
Twitter account and said a bomb
went off at the White House,

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:24.700
and the stock market
lost like 3% in minutes.

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:27.420
Now, that's not humans reacting.

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:28.950
It happened too fast.

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:31.680
So those are trading
algorithms that

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:36.910
have specific keywords
in their instructions

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:39.670
and they were fooled by
a hacked Twitter account.

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:43.570
So I don't know if
machine-trading hedge

00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:47.500
funds are quite as invincible as
they might look at the moment.

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:51.820
We're talking about
like Renaissance,

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:53.260
which is Jim Simons.

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:57.100
And it's an amazing story
and their returns are insane.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:58.780
No one even comes close.

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:00.610
And they don't talk
to Wall Street.

00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:02.020
They don't talk to analysts.

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:04.960
They don't attend conferences.

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:07.540
They definitely don't
watch me on CNBC.

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:10.720
They're PhDs running
around and codebreakers

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:14.560
and nontraditional
financial people trying

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:17.050
to reverse-engineer
what drives markets

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:21.820
and figure out micro-profits
on a minute-by-minute basis.

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:24.565
The thing with that is
that it's not novel.

00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:29.440
One of the best books ever
written about investing

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.280
is "The Money Game."

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:32.320
It was written in the 1960s.

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:34.234
And there's a chapter
with a computer,

00:43:34.234 --> 00:43:36.025
that all the Wall Street
people are in line

00:43:36.025 --> 00:43:38.740
and they want to put
some information into it.

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:42.950
Vonnegut wrote "Player
Piano" before the--

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:44.086
It's not a new thing.

00:43:44.086 --> 00:43:45.460
There's just a
new version of it.

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:47.680
And the reason why they
won't be invincible

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:50.500
is because anything
that's got success,

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:53.350
it will attract competition.

00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:55.150
And so now what you
actually have going on

00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:58.690
is a quant arms race
amongst hedge funds.

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:00.580
Steve Cohen is hiring quants.

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:03.130
Paul Tudor Jones
is hiring quants.

00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:06.490
All of the big hedge funds
are loading up their firms

00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:09.220
with data scientists,
data analytics people,

00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:12.370
and they will nullify
each other's edges.

00:44:12.370 --> 00:44:16.120
Like any other business,
competition eventually arrives.

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.640
So the thing with Renaissance
which has made them remarkable

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.290
is, they didn't
invent one algorithm

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:21.820
and then live with it.

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:24.580
They constantly are
coming up with new ways.

00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:26.570
That's the only answer.

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:29.572
It's a tough, arduous process.

00:44:29.572 --> 00:44:31.030
Most people won't
be able to do it.

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:33.610
And by the way, if you
wanted to give them money,

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:34.600
there's no 800 number.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.280
They don't want your money.

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:38.980
And so they're an
amazing success story.

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:41.200
There aren't that
many other companies

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.589
that will come along and
be able to replicate that.

00:44:43.589 --> 00:44:45.880
SPEAKER: Speaking of the
algorithms real quick, in case

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:46.921
there's another question.

00:44:46.921 --> 00:44:48.100
But I notice a lot with--

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:49.010
JOSH BROWN: Oh, wait.

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:50.884
We're all waiting, by
the way, on Wall Street

00:44:50.884 --> 00:44:54.790
for the Google hedge fund that's
rumored every six months or so.

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:56.500
And you guys probably
have more data

00:44:56.500 --> 00:45:00.910
about consumer activity,
business queries.

00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:03.440
So once the Google
hedge fund launches,

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:06.530
maybe that'll do even
better than Rentech.

00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:07.030
We'll see.

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:08.085
SPEAKER: No comment.

00:45:08.085 --> 00:45:09.376
JOSH BROWN: No, I know, I know.

00:45:09.376 --> 00:45:11.470
SPEAKER: [LAUGHS] What I
was going to ask about--

00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:13.312
when you see after
hours, maybe an earnings

00:45:13.312 --> 00:45:14.770
report for a company
happens and it

00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:17.200
does seem like there
may be certain keywords

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:20.410
in their report and you
see a tick down big time

00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:23.560
and then it recovers right away,
is that basically keywords,

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:25.810
algos, dropping it and then
real people going in like,

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:27.350
don't worry about it?

00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:27.850
Bye, bye.

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:31.120
JOSH BROWN: And just
saying it's an algo, that

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:35.290
doesn't imply it's a big firm
with a really sophisticated--

00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:38.680
there are platforms
now like Quantopian,

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:42.430
and they are trying to
democratize the use of data

00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:45.250
amongst regular investors.

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:48.460
So there are people that were--
they call themselves prop

00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:51.070
traders, they used to call
themselves day traders,

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:53.650
before that they were
the SOES bandits--

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:55.840
but there have always
been independent traders

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:57.490
trying to build their own edge.

00:45:57.490 --> 00:45:59.331
And a lot of them have
adopted software that

00:45:59.331 --> 00:46:00.580
allows them to write programs.

00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:02.163
It doesn't mean
they're sophisticated.

00:46:02.163 --> 00:46:06.040
It doesn't mean they're smart
programs or they've done well.

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:09.130
But, yeah, there are
absolutely moments where

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:12.280
you look at a tick down
or up in a security

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:14.350
and you know it's a machine.

00:46:14.350 --> 00:46:17.410
You know that's not a person
that's gone through even half

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:18.910
of a cycle of a thought.

00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:21.130
So it happens every day.

00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:23.240
So long-term investors
have it easy.

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:25.420
They can ignore all of that.

00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:27.010
SPEAKER: Any other questions?

00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:29.410
Toss that box, boom.

00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:30.320
We'll get you next.

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:31.690
AUDIENCE: Hi, Mr. Brown.

00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:35.260
What technology do you see,
or what emerging firms do

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:39.070
you see if you have names, that
you think may come and disrupt

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:42.630
these financial markets,
especially on the retail side?

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:46.990
Like for us, do we by
ourselves, invest--

00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:49.660
JOSH BROWN: So for
do-it-yourself traders?

00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:53.890
So I think what
software you use is

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:56.560
going to be a function of
how much time and attention

00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:59.035
you want to put into
doing your own trading.

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:05.020
So people ask me about
Robinhood everywhere I go.

00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:07.570
It's the app that lets
you trade stocks for free.

00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:10.480
And they've clearly built a big
audience amongst millennials

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:13.030
and they've opened
tons of accounts.

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:16.030
Like, no one's making any
money from that really,

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:19.330
which in this part of
the cycle, that's OK.

00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:23.230
The investors, the people that
back things like that, they

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:24.670
want to see user growth.

00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:26.652
They don't really care
what a user's worth yet.

00:47:26.652 --> 00:47:29.110
They figure if you-- remember
we taught that, the attention

00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:30.070
economy?

00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:34.050
Once we have scale and
attention from a lot of people,

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:36.340
we'll figure out a way
to make money from that.

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:40.240
So maybe Robinhood feels pretty
revolutionary in that they're

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.090
allowing young people
to open accounts,

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:44.317
buy fractional shares.

00:47:44.317 --> 00:47:46.650
So a share of-- how much is
a share of Google right now?

00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:49.780
$1,200-ish?

00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:50.360
I own it.

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:51.820
I don't look at every tick.

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:54.130
So let's say it's $1,200.

00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:56.860
Can somebody doing their
first stock transaction

00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:59.890
buy 100 shares at $1,200?

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:01.930
Probably not.

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:04.240
So the fact that they
can buy four shares

00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:07.060
by entering in a dollar amount
rather than entering in a share

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:08.080
amount--

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.070
it sounds weird.

00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:10.330
That sounds so simple.

00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:12.546
No one else did it
until they came along.

00:48:12.546 --> 00:48:14.170
They said, why can
you buy mutual funds

00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:17.410
in fractional shares, but
not individual stocks?

00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:19.690
So that feels like
somewhat revolutionary.

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:21.910
I don't know how
profitable it is,

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:25.000
but there's stuff like that
for the retail investor.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.720
And then some of the
algorithmic things.

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:30.522
Every week there's a new one.

00:48:30.522 --> 00:48:32.980
I don't know that any of them
have built a lot of traction,

00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:36.100
because there aren't that many
do-it-yourself investors who

00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:40.990
want to spend hours of
their day building trading

00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:42.070
algorithms for themself.

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:46.600
I think it's a very small
slice of the overall investor

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:47.620
universe.

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:50.030
So none really come
to mind specifically

00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:52.000
that have captured a big
amount of the market,

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.997
because the market is a
narrow market to begin with.

00:48:55.997 --> 00:48:56.580
SPEAKER: Nice.

00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:58.871
I think we had one final
question up here in the front.

00:48:58.871 --> 00:49:00.830
We got time for one more.

00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:01.499
Boom, OK.

00:49:01.499 --> 00:49:03.040
AUDIENCE: All right,
can you hear me?

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:03.070
SPEAKER: Yep.

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:04.570
AUDIENCE: All right, big
fan of "Halftime Report."

00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:06.340
JOSH BROWN: Thank
you, I appreciate it.

00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:07.131
AUDIENCE: No sweat.

00:49:07.131 --> 00:49:09.100
So just combining the
financial question

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:10.750
with the media question--

00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:12.280
it's a highly-opinionated show.

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:16.182
Do they give you any specific
instructions or cadence?

00:49:16.182 --> 00:49:17.890
Or are you waiting
for someone to tap you

00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:21.100
on the shoulder that said, hey,
that comment was out of line?

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:23.890
Or any of the suits
at NBC kind of

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:29.290
give you any frame of reference
in terms of what is off limits?

00:49:29.290 --> 00:49:31.870
JOSH BROWN: Well, CNBC has
a really big responsibility,

00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:34.740
because if people say
something on their air

00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:38.710
and it moves the price of
an investment instrument,

00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:42.220
they want that thing that
was said to have been true.

00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:43.930
And then each
individual person that

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:47.170
comes on the air, if they're
an investor and not just a TV

00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:50.680
personality, has their
own compliance regulations

00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:53.650
to contend with.

00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:56.480
So I can't speak
for everyone else,

00:49:56.480 --> 00:50:04.630
but I can tell you that I have
to disclose all of my holdings.

00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:08.800
And during the show they pop
it up, Josh owns these things.

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:11.680
What they don't want people
to do is say one thing

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.180
but do the other thing.

00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:16.990
So they don't want people to
come on and say, I love Target,

00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:20.680
and then be shorting the
stock after it pops up,

00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:21.740
for obvious reasons.

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:24.220
And I don't think there's
a lot of that going on.

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:27.400
It would be so counter
to your interests

00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:29.920
if you were doing media
on a regular basis

00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:33.520
to pull off one trade and try to
make a couple of percent on it.

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:35.270
So I don't think a lot
of that's going on.

00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:37.353
The other thing is we can't
talk about stocks that

00:50:37.353 --> 00:50:39.810
are below a certain market cap.

00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:42.310
So they don't want us going on
talking about a stock trading

00:50:42.310 --> 00:50:45.130
on the pink sheets
that could double

00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:47.530
based on a mention on TV.

00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:49.930
So if you watch a show, most
of what we're talking about

00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:52.390
are S&amp;P 100 companies.

00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:54.962
We really can't move
them with our remarks,

00:50:54.962 --> 00:50:56.170
unless there's news breaking.

00:50:56.170 --> 00:50:59.140
But that wouldn't be coming
from panelists like myself,

00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:01.030
that would be coming
from the reporters.

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:04.300
Separating who's a reporter
and who's a commenter

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:07.000
is important for the audience.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.900
Just like when you watch
political news or sports news,

00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:15.100
there are some people who are
stating a fact as a reporter,

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:17.184
and then there are people
who are on the fact.

00:51:17.184 --> 00:51:19.600
And I think keeping those two
things separate in your mind

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.070
is probably the
best thing you can

00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:23.830
do when you encounter
any kind of news program,

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:25.316
financial or otherwise.

00:51:25.316 --> 00:51:27.190
SPEAKER: That was a
great question to end on.

00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:27.689
Thank you.

00:51:27.689 --> 00:51:28.914
I think we're out of time.

00:51:28.914 --> 00:51:30.080
Thank you very much to Josh.

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:30.380
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:31.880
JOSH BROWN: Thank you
so much, everyone.

00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:32.546
I appreciate it.

00:51:32.546 --> 00:51:34.630
SPEAKER: I appreciate
you coming.
