00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.890
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So good afternoon everyone.
Welcome to another outstanding Authors at

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.980
Google talk. Today, we're very pleased to
introduce Jenny Blake. Jenny Blake is an author,

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.320
blogger, life coach, Googler, and yoga teacher.
Her book, "Life after College: The Complete

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:22.690
Guide to Getting What You Want," compiles
learning advice in bite-size nuggets for every

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.630
area of someone's life, and is based on her
popular blog, lifeaftercollege.org.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:36.020
She has also worked at Google for over five
years and currently serves as a Career Development

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:44.690
Program Manager, an internal coach and also
helps with us here on the Authors at Google

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.730
team. Throughout her life, she is guided by
philosophies to help others feel excited and

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.780
happy about their own lives.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.690
Jenny's book offers practical advice to the
post-college crowd. After reading the book

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.750
myself, I was particularly struck by a certain
quote, which I'll include here. "Life after

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.830
college is still about learning, learning
who you are, what you want, how to get it,

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.610
and perhaps most importantly, how to relax
and enjoy the ride."

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.030
Jenny's learning’s also continue as she
starts her three-month sabbatical and her

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.230
book tour, as you can see now, is making a
stop here at Google. As per our tradition,

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.280
we'll have some time for question and answer
at the end. And without further ado, let me

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.280
introduce Jenny Blake.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.280
[applause]

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.280
&gt;&gt;Jenny Blake: Thank you, Kurt.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.070
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Oh, you can-

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:37.420
&gt;&gt;Jenny Blake: Yeah. Woohoo. So excited to
be here. Thank you all so much for coming.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.760
I'm not sure, but I think this is the first
Googler speaking as an author at Google. So

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.490
thank you all for coming and for being here.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.049
I've been on sabbatical now for three weeks
and you will be proud to know that I've successfully

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.380
learned how to feed myself out in the wild.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.380
[laughter]

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.560
Thank you. I didn't say anything about cooking.
I toast and I microwave, but that's a start.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.450
Life does go on, even outside of these glorious
three meals a day. I thought about what might

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.371
be fun to talk about today. And I figure you're
all Googlers. I think you got life after college

00:02:11.371 --> 00:02:13.390
pretty figured out. You're doing great.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:20.080
So I wanted to share some of my tips and lessons
learned from the publishing process, itself.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.300
I've been amazed at how many people say to
me when I tell them I've written a book, "That's

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:33.000
amazing. I've love to write a book someday."
And as I often do on my blog, I take tips

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.420
and lessons from life experiences, whether
it's river rafting or now, in this case, publishing

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.570
a book.
[pause]

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.770
Before I jump into my ten lessons learned,
I'll just give you the super quick version

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.470
of how I got my book deal.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.571
At the end of 2008, I'd been blogging for
about a year, and I started writing a book.

00:02:55.571 --> 00:03:03.550
I had an idea. I was on the Training and Development
team at the time. So Steve, Kevin, Ian, you

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.910
guys remember we went away for the Christmas
holidays, 2008, I came back and our team meeting

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.010
we said, "What's your 2009 resolution?"

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.019
And I said, "To finish and publish my book."
And I was so happy, I was on a roll, I got

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:25.700
the first draft out there, I was stoked; so
excited. And then came this. My hair pulling,

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:32.730
frustrated, complete and utter book block.
I had been on a roll and I told myself, "I'm

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.110
gonna self-publish. Who needs to bother with
the whole traditional publishing route? I

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.890
got this. I'll self-publish. It'll be great.
I'll get the book out there." Really, I knew

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.230
that I was saying that because I was terrified.
I was scared, too. I had no idea how to go

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.400
about getting a traditional publisher, how
to find a literary agent.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.069
And then even if I did, I was so afraid of
rejection. And I was afraid that after all

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.269
this work of writing my book and getting the
draft done, that I would show it to these

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.569
publishing houses and they would say it was
the worst thing they'd ever seen and, "Go

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.080
away. Go home, you amateur."

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.110
That didn't end up happening. But that fear
was paralyzing for me.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:20.609
[pause]
Finally, in a very serendipitous meeting that

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.990
I'll explain in a little bit, I got motivated
to not finish my book, but I decided I've

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.539
gotta at least try.

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:34.009
I would so much rather be on the field playing
the game than in the stands, watching. And

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:38.490
just like out of high school, I had applied
to Harvard because I wanted to at least try.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.659
So it was a shot in the dark. I knew I probably
wouldn't get in. But I would know that I applied

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:47.240
and I gave myself the chance. I didn't get
in, by the way.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:55.710
Go, Bruins. UCLA for the win. Woohoo. So in
this case, I decided I've gotta try. And the

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.620
first step was writing a book proposal. I
still couldn't bring myself to open the Word

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.270
file with my book. It sat closed for six months.
But I could do a book proposal. And that's

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:12.020
basically a 35-page business plan. From the
book proposal, I found a literary agent.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.249
She didn't look quite like this with those
big 80s earrings, but close. And my literary

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:23.969
agent pitched to publishing houses. Some,
they were interested. I had a meeting at Random

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:28.889
House, very exciting. It was on the 18th floor
of this building overlooking Central Park.

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:35.860
Truly, an amazing moment being in a room with
all these executives asking me questions.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.599
It was crazy. It was fun. Chronicle Books
in San Francisco was also interested. They

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:47.610
were gonna make it a really nice gift book.
And then there was Running Press. In the end,

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:54.919
my agent pitched to 27 publishers. Actually,
it was 28 publishers. Twenty seven said no,

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:58.490
and one said yes. One's all it takes.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:05.689
So, Running Press agreed to publish my book
and I signed the contract on June 16th of

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:11.439
2010. So it's been a long road. It's been
two and a half years. When I wrote that first

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:19.419
draft in 2008, I was sure that my book would
be out by graduation 2009. Well, it's March

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:24.149
2011, so a couple years have passed. You can
see a few things happened in-between. And

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:29.021
that's what I want to talk about today. All
those highs and lows and what I learned in

00:06:29.021 --> 00:06:33.429
the process.

00:06:33.429 --> 00:06:37.349
It wouldn't be a Jenny Blake presentation
if there wasn't a gratuitous cupcake picture.

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:41.659
That's really why I put this slide in here.

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:42.659
[laughter]

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:48.740
Ten. Don't wait for permission. So often,
people are waiting for someone to wave their

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.259
magic wand and say, I hereby grant you the
permission to start that project that you've

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:58.550
been wanting to do. To go take those classes
you've been wanting to take. To start writing

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.369
the book. To start your blog. To do whatever
it is. Run a marathon.

00:07:03.369 --> 00:07:10.680
Whatever it is that you wanna do, don't wait
for permission. You would be so surprised

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:16.250
at how much you're capable of if you give
yourself the chance to try. And on that same

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.289
note, take your inner critic, those voices
that say you're not good enough, you're not

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:24.559
smart enough, you're too old, you're too young,
as a sign that you're exactly on the right

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:26.589
track.

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:33.589
It's hard to do, because they can be debilitating.
And I know that. That's why my book sat unopened

00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:38.009
for six months. But the fact that they're
there, means that you're on exactly the right

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:43.029
track. You're doing big things. You're getting
ready to take a big risk. And that's exactly

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:47.939
when all those voices come rushing in and
it's a great thing.

00:07:47.939 --> 00:07:54.599
In my case, there were, when I Googled, yes
Googled on Amazon, there were 20 other books

00:07:54.599 --> 00:08:01.210
with "Life After College" in the title, twenty.
Who was I to think that I had anything to

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:07.930
add to this already oversaturated genre? And
I thought I'm simultaneously too old. At the

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:13.839
time I was like, 25, too young and I've never
lived in Africa or done anything really crazy,

00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:15.249
out of the ordinary.

00:08:15.249 --> 00:08:20.800
And I just thought, "Who am I to write this
book?" And then one day, one of my friends,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:26.099
she's a blogger. She said to me, "Jenny, this
book may have been written, but it hasn't

00:08:26.099 --> 00:08:31.619
been written by you." And that gave me the
motivation to say, "Great. If I help two people,

00:08:31.619 --> 00:08:40.190
if I help one person, then it's worth it.
And I'm gonna enjoy the process."

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:45.700
Number Nine. Trust your gut. With a big creative
project, the only way to do it is through

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:50.279
your intuition. And you can see here, there's
a couple different routes to take. There will

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:57.130
not be any prescribed route that details exactly
how to go. So, you've gotta listen to your

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:00.260
gut and just take some chances.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:05.240
You'll know. In my case, when my gut was telling
me when I had book block for six months, I

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:11.180
can be a little thick-headed sometimes, so
finally after six months, I realized, "Oh,

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:16.750
it's because I'm not supposed to self-publish."
And I was thankful to come to that realization,

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:21.370
even though it took me a little while. And
I'm learning; it's still a learning process

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:25.440
for me and probably for all of you, to keep
trusting my gut and to learn to listen to

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.160
it more every day.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:36.230
OK. On this note, when the universe smacks
you upside the head, listen. As I said, sometimes

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:39.160
I can be kinda dense, all right?

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.160
[laughter]

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:45.180
I'm sure we all can. When I couldn't look
at my book and that was a horrible feeling.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:50.680
I felt like I was watching my dream die on
the vine because I couldn't muster the strength

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.670
to actually do something about it. And I just
felt horrible.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:59.329
So I decided, "Well, if I can't continue on
my path of being an author right now, I'll

00:09:59.329 --> 00:10:05.060
at least act as if, I'll pretend I'm a professional
speaker." So I went to this Northern California

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:09.961
Speakers Association meeting. And while I
was there, I met the author of the book, "How

00:10:09.961 --> 00:10:12.740
to Write a Book Proposal," Michael Larson.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:17.149
I sat at the same table with him at lunch
and he ended up giving me his copy of "How

00:10:17.149 --> 00:10:21.360
to Write a Book Proposal." So if that's not
a sign from the universe to get back on the

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:26.680
horse and get out there, I don't know what
is. And the fact that he said he'd be willing

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:32.680
to review my proposal with me that was all
the push I needed to get back out there and

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.850
keep going.

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:38.720
And what I call one of my "universe smacks
me upside the head" moments. Like, "You idiot,

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:45.399
get back out there." And I did and I'm so
thankful.

00:10:45.399 --> 00:10:52.390
Number Eight. I heard this first from a coach
a couple years ago. Avoid the tyranny of the

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:57.820
how’s. You will not see the whole path.
It is absolutely inherent to a big goal or

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:03.240
a big project, even working at a company like
Google, you will not see the whole path of

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:07.029
how you're gonna get to the end result.

00:11:07.029 --> 00:11:11.240
At best, you might see a couple steps in front
of you. Certainly having the vision for what

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:16.050
you want, the desired outcome is important,
but don't feel like you have to see the whole

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:22.750
path, step by step, just in order to get started.
Oftentimes, I work with a lot of coaching

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:27.139
clients and I see this a lot on my blog, people
who are so worried about how they're gonna

00:11:27.139 --> 00:11:28.959
do something that they never start.

00:11:28.959 --> 00:11:37.700
And document; it's totally fine to worry about
how you're gonna do something, but don't let

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:43.560
that hold you back. And don't let that fear
and those gears churning, paralyze you from

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:48.640
taking action. I always recommend people make
a list. What are all the how’s that you

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.379
don't know right now?

00:11:50.379 --> 00:11:53.800
And if you can at least frame them as questions,
the answers will come, but don't feel like

00:11:53.800 --> 00:12:00.400
you have to have them all upfront. As my dad
recently said to me, "You probably don't even

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:05.889
wanna see the whole path." He said, "If someone
had told you two and a half years ago what

00:12:05.889 --> 00:12:09.620
you would have to go through and how much
work it would take to get this book out, you'd

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.800
have been pretty scared."

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.220
And that is absolutely true. I would have
been completely intimidated by the amount

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:20.050
of work it was gonna take and commitment and
drive and the emotional ups and downs and

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:26.550
the fear of putting my ideas out there for
judgment. It's a lot. And so, maybe we take

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:31.389
this as a good thing that we don't know how
it's all gonna work.

00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:39.970
This is one of my favorite slides. Fight for
what you believe in. Trust your instincts.

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:44.990
I was really lucky. Running Press gave me
a ton of freedom with the content of the book.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:49.060
They really let the book be my own. The biggest
piece of feedback they had was when I turned

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:55.379
in a 450-page draft, and they said, "No way,
get this down to 300. I don't care how you

00:12:55.379 --> 00:13:01.500
do it. I don't care what you cut. Three hundred
or less. Then it came time to working with

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:02.500
the cover.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.500
[laughter]

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:10.850
You know where this is going, right? OK, good.
Authors don't have final say over the cover

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:15.350
of their book. They don't have final approval.
In the contract, it says you get "meaningful

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:23.600
input." OK, yes. Everyone interprets this
differently. And in my case, we'd been looking

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.480
at concepts for the cover, but I hadn't really
seen much.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.629
And then all of a sudden, one day they sent
me a cover and said, "Here's your cover and

00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:37.970
we sent the book to press. It's shipped."
I was not pleased with this cover to put it

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:44.499
lightly. And I handled it really maturely,
as any mature, grown adult would by hysterically

00:13:44.499 --> 00:13:46.600
crying for three days straight, three.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:54.010
Hysterical, I call them projectile tears,
flying off my face at every moment. Here I

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:59.470
was, I'd been working so hard for two and
a half years, and then all of a sudden, my

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:05.110
project, my baby, that I had been slaving
over was wrapped up in this bow that I, to

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:12.370
be honest, was embarrassed by. And I didn't
know what to do so I was ready to give up.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:18.019
I wrote back. I said, "I'm not happy with
this. Let me outline the reasons why." And

00:14:18.019 --> 00:14:23.810
it was too late. They had already sent it.
And that was on a Friday. On Sunday, I went

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:27.459
for a walk with my dad. I've never been so
sad. We go for these weekly walks with our

00:14:27.459 --> 00:14:32.740
dog, talk about life. We talked about the
book at every single step.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:38.649
And he said, "Jenny, this is not when you
lay down and give up. You are at the very

00:14:38.649 --> 00:14:43.890
end of this project. You get up and fight.
You don't just lay down. This is the time

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:48.449
you have got to do something. Get your lawyer
on the phone. Talk to your agent." My dad

00:14:48.449 --> 00:14:53.800
went crazy. And at the time, as any kid reacts
to their parent, I was like, "Dad, come on.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:58.139
Give it a break. I give up. It's over." I
was bumed.

00:14:58.139 --> 00:15:04.339
But when I got home, I said, "He's right.
I've gotta do something. I have to keep fighting."

00:15:04.339 --> 00:15:09.069
I thought I had put in a fight. I didn't.
I emailed my literary agent and thankfully,

00:15:09.069 --> 00:15:15.680
she emailed the publisher and they revised
the cover a couple days later. I've never

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:20.170
been so nervous to open an email 'cause I
knew that the next cover that came in was

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:23.139
gonna have to be it, 'cause we were already
gonna be behind schedule.

00:15:23.139 --> 00:15:31.670
So, without further ado, I'll show you before.
A little chaotic and I wasn't thrilled with

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:34.989
the dead pig on the bottom, or the phone that
already looked ten years old. I mean, hello.

00:15:34.989 --> 00:15:37.119
Android, iPhone, give me something to work
with here.

00:15:37.119 --> 00:15:38.119
[laughter]

00:15:38.119 --> 00:15:44.360
OK. So that was the old one and then here
is the new cover, which we're all so happy

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:49.649
with. And I'm so grateful that Running Press
said, "We don't want to have an author who's

00:15:49.649 --> 00:15:52.889
embarrassed by their book, either. That's
not good for us." So thankfully, they worked

00:15:52.889 --> 00:15:56.619
with me and I took this as a sign.

00:15:56.619 --> 00:16:00.009
The process was so smooth up to this point.
I needed something big like this, so I had

00:16:00.009 --> 00:16:04.839
a great book publishing story to tell and
it was a reminder to fight for what you believe

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:09.550
in.

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:15.689
Number six. Build and lean on your support
network. It absolutely has taken an army to

00:16:15.689 --> 00:16:21.160
get this project out there to the world. Yes,
there have been many nights and many weekends

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:26.690
where I've been holed up in my apartment working
on my laptop in my condo on the balcony. But

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.619
it takes an army.

00:16:28.619 --> 00:16:35.399
And there were so many times that I was down
and discouraged. And my mom, my dad, friends

00:16:35.399 --> 00:16:41.390
like Tara and Julie, who were there to pick
me up when I was down and say, "How can I

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:49.220
help? How can we celebrate? What can I do?"
So I really encourage you to lean on your

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:50.220
support network.

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:54.290
Ask for help. People want to help. And the
same is true at a company like Google. We

00:16:54.290 --> 00:17:01.089
have so many people, brilliant minds in one
place. Lean on your network. Reach out to

00:17:01.089 --> 00:17:05.680
people you don't know. I've been absolutely
blown away and humbled by the response on

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.149
the internet this week.

00:17:08.149 --> 00:17:12.449
And on the first day, the book actually shot
up to number eleven in Career Guides because

00:17:12.449 --> 00:17:20.059
of my support network. And I'm as proud of
that as I am the book itself.

00:17:20.059 --> 00:17:28.789
Number five. Recognize and appreciate the
beauty in imperfection. What you see here

00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:35.710
is a picture and I brought the live copy.
All those yellow post-its are typos that I

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:36.779
found.

00:17:36.779 --> 00:17:37.840
[laughter]

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:44.130
And yes, my friends will be the first to tell
you that I'm a recovering perfectionist and

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:51.240
not recovering very quickly. But I care. I'm
a perfectionist because I care. So when I

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:56.539
saw these typos, sure, I could've gotten really
discouraged and really upset. But as my dad

00:17:56.539 --> 00:18:03.649
says, "That's how all the demons get out."
So it's actually a good sign and it happens.

00:18:03.649 --> 00:18:08.040
I used to read books and say, "Oh God, how
can there be typos. So unprofessional. They

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:13.340
have like, two years. Can't you get the typos
out? I mean, how hard can it be?" Having been

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:18.110
through the process and seeing how tight those
deadlines are and how many different people

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:22.120
look at the book, I can completely see how
it happens.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:27.080
And I don't have the final copy. I'm not able
to make those final edits. So, at some point,

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.789
the book's gotta ship, thankfully. Because
otherwise, I think I'd be writing this book

00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:38.090
the rest of my life. So now, I figure it's
a fun game. You can see I don't know how many

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:41.870
post-its are on here. Maybe nine or ten. So
it's like a scavenger hunt. You can see if

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.070
you find all the typos.

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:50.670
There's one, even, on the first page. That's
like, even a better good luck sign.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:51.830
[laughter]

00:18:51.830 --> 00:19:00.039
Four. Behold the magic of serendipity. I've
had so much fun with serendipitous meetings

00:19:00.039 --> 00:19:04.860
throughout the course of this project. There's
two stories that I wanna share on this point.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:09.919
One, when I went, so a lot of people don't
know that looking for a literary agent, there

00:19:09.919 --> 00:19:10.919
is no science.

00:19:10.919 --> 00:19:17.159
There is no magic. It's total chaos. You basically
come up with a query email, little bit about

00:19:17.159 --> 00:19:22.100
me, little bit about my project. And you start
going through a directory of 400 names and

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:27.399
you just start emailing people. That's how
it works unless you have personal connections.

00:19:27.399 --> 00:19:33.260
I had found four and sometimes people will
email 50 agents and not hear back from any;

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.260
I was lucky.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:39.929
I emailed about ten and I heard back from
four who wanted to work with me. I had a contract

00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:44.169
ready to go from this guy in New York, and
we showed it to a family friend, who's a lawyer.

00:19:44.169 --> 00:19:52.010
He was looking at the contract and he said,
"This is a little vague. I'm not so sure.

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:58.830
I know a literary agent. How would you feel
if I put you in touch with her?" At that point,

00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:59.830
I said, "Sure. Why not?"

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:02.390
So he put me in touch with her. She got back
to me within an hour. I was actually travelling

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:08.000
in Dublin for work at the time. And she said,
"I wanna work with you." Little did I know,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.820
she's a veteran of the industry, she's been
in the business 20 years, used to work for

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:14.970
Rolling Stone, and I ended up going with her.

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:22.940
And that happened solely through this power
of serendipity. My other story is, and this

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:28.600
is a screen shot from the book trailer video
that we did, that's at lacbook.com, if any

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:34.010
of you want to check it out. It was a dream
of mine to have a book trailer video and they

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:39.760
can cost ten, fifteen thousand dollars at
a minimum, to have a professional film and

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:40.760
edit.

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:48.399
So in December, I had just turned in, this
last November, was when the final, final book,

00:20:48.399 --> 00:20:54.010
I turned it in and it went to press. And I
thought, "You know, now might be a good time

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:59.100
to leave the house, and maybe even go on a
few dates." So I signed up for OkCupid. I

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:03.049
was like, "Jenny, he's not gonna come out
of your couch or your computer. Leave the

00:21:03.049 --> 00:21:04.049
house."

00:21:04.049 --> 00:21:05.049
[laughter]

00:21:05.049 --> 00:21:09.899
I know, proud of me, right? It's a start.
It's a start. Went on a few online dates.

00:21:09.899 --> 00:21:17.640
None of them worked out, but one of the people
that I met turns out to be a four-time, Emmy-winning

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:24.610
movie producer. We decided he had the guts
to say, "I'm just call this one at friends."

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:25.649
We ended up hanging out.

00:21:25.649 --> 00:21:26.649
[laughter]

00:21:26.649 --> 00:21:31.279
I know, 'cause that's hard to say. We hang
out and he said, "I'd be happy to help you

00:21:31.279 --> 00:21:35.740
film your book trailer." So there I was, from
having going on what I call a "failed online

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:43.310
date," it's actually very successful and it
turned out to film and do this amazing book

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:44.410
trailer video.

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:49.850
Three. Forget the marathon mindset. Focus
on sprints and recovery. This is a concept

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:56.789
from Tony Shorts, who, a lot of his principles
are in our Managing Your Energy course. He

00:21:56.789 --> 00:22:01.799
says so often, people treat their careers
and their work and their projects like a marathon.

00:22:01.799 --> 00:22:04.580
Go, go, go. Wake up.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:09.250
Spend a huge, long day at the office. Go home.
Work some more and do it again the next day.

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:15.299
We have this marathon mentality that we're
in it for the long haul. And instead, he recommends

00:22:15.299 --> 00:22:21.590
focusing on sprints and recovery instead.
Go really hard. It's inevitable. We're gonna

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:26.669
have periods of time where we're really driving
forward and doing those sprints.

00:22:26.669 --> 00:22:32.110
But it's imperative that we build in time
for recovery. I know this because I've had

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:40.159
many, what I call, "hot mess hair-pulling"
moments where I've been burnt out, exhausted,

00:22:40.159 --> 00:22:46.250
and totally wiped out and unable to do any
work, even if I wanted to. The last one happened

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:48.360
three weeks before the book came out.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:54.299
I'd been wrapping up at Google and as the
wrapping up at Google and the book stuff was

00:22:54.299 --> 00:23:00.799
ramping up higher and higher and higher, and
I'd been working since December around the

00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:05.250
clock, nights and weekends every day. And
I was loving it because this is fun for me.

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:09.190
But, I hadn't built in any time for recovery.

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:13.230
So, three weeks ago, it just snuck right up.
I guess at this point, it's more like six

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:19.390
weeks ago. But it snuck up from behind and
just kicked me in the butt. And there I was,

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:26.649
unable to do anything and I was so nervous.
The book was gonna be out three weeks from

00:23:26.649 --> 00:23:30.370
when it was all happening and I didn't know
what to do.

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:35.740
And I just felt like this is not good timing.
I'm on the last mile of this marathon and

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:42.140
I don't have time for this. So that's exactly
when you need to make the time. And I'm thankful.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:46.539
At least I got it out of the way so that now
I can actually enjoy the book being out. So

00:23:46.539 --> 00:23:50.590
build in time for recovery. It's so important.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:24:00.519
Two. This is my most "woohoo" point. Meet
halfway between hard work and receiving. A

00:24:00.519 --> 00:24:07.130
project like this, and it goes for careers
in general, absolutely involves hard work

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:15.640
and commitment and drive and perseverance
and grinding it out, absolutely. And there's

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:21.110
a part of it that's about receiving and just
letting things happen as they will.

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:25.880
As my friend Tara says "lifting the oars."
You can paddle, paddle, paddle so hard, but

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:31.210
sometimes you need to stop, lift the oars,
and let the boat go where it's gonna go. And

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:36.320
that's how I feel about this book. That, yes,
I've been working around the clock to do as

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:40.889
best a job as I can on writing, editing, and
promotion.

00:24:40.889 --> 00:24:44.960
But at some point, I'm gonna have to let go
a little bit and let this have a life of its

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:49.929
own and hope that it does.

00:24:49.929 --> 00:24:55.889
Finally, take pride in the journey. There
is so much to be said for being on the field,

00:24:55.889 --> 00:25:02.900
playing the game, like I said earlier. It
almost doesn't matter what the outcome is.

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:06.573
When I was doing my book signing over the
weekend, I truly felt like this is a top of

00:25:06.573 --> 00:25:08.150
the mountain moment.

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:12.809
But I spent two and a half years winding my
way up and around the mountain. And I did

00:25:12.809 --> 00:25:19.529
enjoy it while it was happening and that's
so important 'cause why would we do it otherwise?

00:25:19.529 --> 00:25:25.299
So really focus on, be proud of yourself for
doing everything you're doing. Take pride

00:25:25.299 --> 00:25:30.490
in the journey and know that the more pride
you take in the journey and the more you enjoy

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:35.019
that, the less the outcome actually matters.

00:25:35.019 --> 00:25:39.279
I say in the conclusion of the book, "The
fact that you, reader, are holding this in

00:25:39.279 --> 00:25:44.980
your hands, that's success alone." My biggest
fear, before I got the book deal, was that

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:49.820
even if I got a book deal, I wouldn't be able
to sell more than two copies, one for each

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.279
parent.

00:25:51.279 --> 00:25:52.750
[laughter]

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:57.179
Thanks to Books Inc., even just here today,
we have proved that wrong. Thank goodness.

00:25:57.179 --> 00:26:04.179
So to me, it wasn't about book sales. It was
that the fact that this physical product exists,

00:26:04.179 --> 00:26:08.649
that's plenty and everything else is icing
on the cupcake.

00:26:08.649 --> 00:26:12.850
[whispering] The cupcake, yes.
[laughter]

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:17.919
Another quote that I love, "A professional
writer is an amateur who didn't quit."

00:26:17.919 --> 00:26:23.380
And that's truly how I feel. There is no magic,
other than these great little serendipitous

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:30.970
moments. I'm not superhuman. I'm not different
than any of you. I just took one step after

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:37.179
another and didn't give up. For as many times
as I wanted to give up, I kept going. And

00:26:37.179 --> 00:26:41.330
that's why I'm able to say that I have this
book out today.

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:46.529
So I'm gonna put up my contact information
and I'll tell you a little bit about the book.

00:26:46.529 --> 00:26:53.080
It's funny, I gave this talk at my first bookstore
signing last week at Kepler's in Menlo Park

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:58.010
and my mom said, "That was a great speech,
but you didn't tell us about the book." It's

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:05.360
like, you gotta at least tell people what
the book is. So, this is for you, mom.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:10.830
My book, I wrote this book because I wanted
to write a book that I would like to read.

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:18.380
I am a self-help junkie, self-admitted. I
read almost 200 personal development books

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:23.659
and it started because I took a leave of absence
from UCLA at the start of my junior year and

00:27:23.659 --> 00:27:25.730
came home to work full-time at this start-up
company.

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:33.320
I was lost, confused. So I read and I researched
and I looked up information on everything

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:39.460
under the sun: time management, productivity,
personal growth, happiness, leadership. You

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:45.169
name it, I've read it. And after reading all
those books, I wanted to produce something

00:27:45.169 --> 00:27:51.330
that was both a guide, but also I call it
a portable life coach.

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:56.750
So there's a chapter for every area of someone's
life, things like work, money, dating and

00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:02.400
relationships, friends and family, fitness
and nutrition, organization. And within each

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:08.549
chapter, there are snippets of tips, quotes,
advice from college graduates, coaching exercises,

00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:11.250
and recommended reading.

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:14.679
And what I'm noticing in a lot of the Amazon
reviews, people are saying, "This book is

00:28:14.679 --> 00:28:18.919
great. Not just for college grads, but anyone."
I've had people all the way up in their 60s

00:28:18.919 --> 00:28:23.320
say, "Oh, this arrived for my son and I've
been flipping through and I love it." So my

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.320
hope is that you feel free to check it out.
They did a great job.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:32.169
It's actually bigger than your standard paperback
and there's little red headings and places

00:28:32.169 --> 00:28:40.160
to write. So I'm so thrilled with how the
book actually came out. And my goal was, it's

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:45.220
basically to say you're the expert on your
life. I trust that you're all smart and resourceful.

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:48.970
You know how to Google things like 401K and
filing your taxes.

00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:54.740
I didn't want to bother anyone with that.
Instead, my goal was to share my own tips,

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:59.440
nuggets from other people, and then really
put the power in your hands to focus on the

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:05.230
big picture of your life. To think about,
it's a self-help book. I had to give it some

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:08.080
audacious title like, "The Complete Guide
to Getting What You Want."

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:13.940
It's a perfect infomercial and ready to go.
But truly, the reason I say that it's complete

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:19.420
is because I'm gonna help you facilitate a
process where you can think and vision and

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:25.299
dream for every area of your life. One of
the things that I've noticed most as a coach,

00:29:25.299 --> 00:29:28.820
and the receiving end of many coaching sessions,
is that it's very rare.

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:35.460
We don't often ask each other, what do you
really want? Tell me what your dream home

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:42.779
looks like. It's not common for us to envision
the highest goals that we have and the highest

00:29:42.779 --> 00:29:48.370
vision for our lives. And so, my hope is to
help facilitate that process for people and

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:52.950
to give a book where you can dive in at any
point and come back and revisit it, over and

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:54.440
over again.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:30:00.620
That's all I got, so thank you so much. And
I'll take questions. There's a mic over here

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.389
if you have questions.

00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:03.389
[applause]

00:30:03.389 --> 00:30:08.080
All right, don't be shy.

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:19.659
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: Do we have to
go to the mic?

00:30:19.659 --> 00:30:35.820
&gt;&gt;Jenny Blake: I'll repeat the question. Go
ahead.

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:57.220
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: Well actually,
I was gonna share a serendipitous story, 'cause--

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:58.620
&gt;&gt;Jenny Blake: Oh, thanks.

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:04.419
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: last week, a
friend of mine that I met through a mutual

00:31:04.419 --> 00:31:18.299
friend emailed me and said, "Hey, Phil told
me that you were interested in meeting my

00:31:18.299 --> 00:31:30.960
life coach, Jenny." And the girl's name is
Christy [inaudible]. So actually you know

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:42.269
I was coming here today with my friends
&gt;&gt;Jenny Blake: Oh, my gosh.

00:31:42.269 --> 00:31:50.020
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: and people were
like let's go see this talk and so, I looked

00:31:50.020 --> 00:32:00.909
back in my email and I was like, "Is this
the same person?" And it was, so it was just

00:32:00.909 --> 00:32:02.139
really cool.

00:32:02.139 --> 00:32:05.230
&gt;&gt;Jenny Blake: That's so cool.

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:18.220
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: And I didn't
realize that's what was going on, so, serendipitous

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:19.220
story.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:30.860
&gt;&gt;Jenny Blake: That's very cool. And on that
note, Christy was one of my earliest blog

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:34.720
readers, when it was just my parents and Christy.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.720
[laughter]

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.610
And so, she has stuck around for over three
and a half years now. And we first met in

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:40.169
person at South by Southwest last year in
Austin, Texas. So, amazing, nice to meet you.

00:32:40.169 --> 00:32:41.169
Thank you for coming.

00:32:41.169 --> 00:32:42.169
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: [ inaudible]

00:32:42.169 --> 00:32:43.169
&gt;&gt;Jenny Blake: That's so cool. I love it.
I love it. Other questions? Fun stories?

00:32:43.169 --> 00:32:44.169
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: We can use the
mic so [inaudible].

00:32:44.169 --> 00:32:45.169
&gt;&gt;Jenny Blake: Yeah. And then use the mic
for people on VC and the recording. Neat?

00:32:45.169 --> 00:32:46.169
Do you wanna go to the mic?

00:32:46.169 --> 00:32:47.169
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #3: [inaudible].

00:32:47.169 --> 00:32:48.169
&gt;&gt;Jenny Blake: OK. It's just time to make
you do some work. I'm here holding this thing

00:32:48.169 --> 00:32:49.169
all day. OK.

00:32:49.169 --> 00:32:50.169
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #3: So I know you've
had a major sprint and you're taking a little

00:32:50.169 --> 00:32:51.169
rest now, but do you have any plans for a
second book?

00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:52.169
&gt;&gt;Jenny Blake: Haha.
[laughter]

00:32:52.169 --> 00:32:53.169
Plans for a second book. Truly, I think people
have said, "Oh, it's like having a baby. You

00:32:53.169 --> 00:32:54.169
have to forget the pain involved in order
to do it again." That's probably gonna be

00:32:54.169 --> 00:32:55.169
true. I have, gears are turning for a second
book. Yes. And I don't know exactly what it'll

00:32:55.169 --> 00:32:56.169
be, but I know I have one in me. And having
been through the process now, I at least feel

00:32:56.169 --> 00:32:57.169
like, at least I'll mostly be tackling the
big ideas and less of the how’s. So yeah,

00:32:57.169 --> 00:32:58.169
thanks for asking. But until then, I'm taking
a little break. Hi.

00:32:58.169 --> 00:32:59.169
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #4: I'm Tara.

00:32:59.169 --> 00:33:00.169
&gt;&gt;Jenny Blake: Tara of "lift the oars." Wisdom
of greatness.

00:33:00.169 --> 00:33:01.169
&gt;&gt;Tara: I'm "life the oars" lady and I actually
stole that from Oprah and Byron Gates.

00:33:01.169 --> 00:33:02.169
&gt;&gt;Jenny Blake: OK, great. We're in the presence
of greatness.

00:33:02.169 --> 00:33:03.169
&gt;&gt;Tara: [inaudible], I'm not, I'm a junkie
just like Jenny. I would like to say, what's

00:33:03.169 --> 00:33:04.169
your most memorable piece of feedback you've
gotten from the book so far?

00:33:04.169 --> 00:33:05.169
&gt;&gt;Jenny Blake: Oh, that's such a great question.
OK, the most memorable piece of feedback.

00:33:05.169 --> 00:33:06.169
Last night. Last night I couldn't sleep. I
think 'cause I was so excited to see all you

00:33:06.169 --> 00:33:07.169
guys. It was about 2 am and someone tweeted
and they said, "Jenny, I just picked up your

00:33:07.169 --> 00:33:08.169
book. I've read ten pages in and I can already
tell it's gonna change my life."

00:33:08.169 --> 00:33:09.169
And it just, it's so touching and so inspiring.
That's exactly why I did this. That's what

00:33:09.169 --> 00:33:10.169
makes the entire journey worth it that people
say things like that. And to be able to have

00:33:10.169 --> 00:33:15.740
that kind of impact on one person, let alone
multiple, is completely humbling for me and

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:17.360
totally amazing.

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:22.289
So, it's moments like that and there are many
more where that came from, but that's the

00:33:22.289 --> 00:33:27.250
first one that comes to mind. That someone
I've never met, on Twitter, who I didn't pay

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:33.389
to be my friend is saying that this book is
already changing her life and that she's only

00:33:33.389 --> 00:33:39.220
ten pages in. I am, it's beyond my wildest
dreams to be able to have that kind of impact

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:46.399
with this book. So, thank you. Great question.
Yeah. Great. Keep 'em coming.

00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:51.771
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #3: So how did you
find that tweet?

00:33:51.771 --> 00:33:53.549
&gt;&gt;Jenny Blake: Oh, this is from a great question
of how did I find that tweet. Well, I was

00:33:53.549 --> 00:34:01.630
on my Google Android and I used a Twitter
program that shows me my @replies.

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:02.909
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #3: OK.

00:34:02.909 --> 00:34:03.909
&gt;&gt;Jenny Blake: Yeah.

00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:04.970
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #3: [inaudible].

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:06.260
&gt;&gt;Jenny Blake: Yes. Hi Steve.

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:19.260
&gt;&gt;Steve: Hi. You talked about a lot of different
sections of the book and advice to give to

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:26.950
different parts of life. Which one of those
was the hardest for you to write or did you

00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:28.251
learn the most or you grew through writing
the most?

00:34:28.251 --> 00:34:29.251
&gt;&gt;Jenny Blake: Yeah. Love this question. Well,
it will not be a surprise to anyone who knows

00:34:29.251 --> 00:34:31.540
me; the hardest chapter to write, hands down,
dating and relationships.

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:33.140
[laughter]

00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:40.540
Cue endless laughter. All right. The point
is, and I said this, I talked to a group of

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:45.260
new grads earlier this morning. A big project
involves trade-offs. And my trade-off has

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:49.630
been working full-time at Google and then
nights and weekends on my projects, for the

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:50.630
most part.

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:55.910
Of course, I do leave the house from time
to time. I'm not a total hermit. But, dating

00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:59.910
and relationships, I hadn't over the last
three years. I hadn't been in any significant

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:05.240
relationships where it was like a serious,
committed thing. And so, I was drawing upon

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:10.570
my own wisdom, some dating experiences. It
wasn't just my own personal challenge.

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:16.410
It was that of all chapters, people are in
such different places after college in terms

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:22.040
of dating and relationships. Some are single
and loving it; single and hating it; dating

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:30.060
casuall; in a relationship; engaged; married;
divorced. And my question was, how can I possibly

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:34.060
write a chapter and I have bitten off a lot
with this book talking about every area of

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:38.380
someone's life for all of after-college, like
I had my hands full as it was.

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:44.300
How do I provide tips and exercises that aren't
totally cliché, that add value, and that

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:50.110
are gonna work across the board? And that
was a big challenge for me. Thankfully, I

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:55.420
had enough cobbled together and one person
actually told me this was their favorite chapter.

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:58.680
So, something I did worked, which is good.

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:04.600
And one of the most popular exercises that
I had posted on my blog is a break-up processing

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.080
template. Yes.

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.080
[laughter]

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:14.100
I'm famous, infamous, for templatizing everything.
You'll be proud to know it's in Google Docs

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:18.490
in Spreadsheets. And it's a template. If you're
breaking up with someone and it walks you

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:23.560
through some ways to process. So anyway, I
think that, yeah, people get a lot out of

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.910
that. Check it out.

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:30.920
There's also decision-making, budgeting. I
have lots of other templates, but that's one

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.810
of my favorites. Any other questions? All
right.

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:38.020
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: Hello, Jenny.

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:39.620
&gt;&gt;Jenny Blake: Hi.

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:45.500
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: What is your favorite
kind of cupcake?

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:51.670
&gt;&gt;Jenny Blake: Oh. I love it. I'm so glad
you asked. This is a very important question.

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:57.220
What is my favorite kind of cupcake? Red velvet
is my benchmark cupcake in that, if I go to

00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:02.000
a cupcake shop, I always have to have the
red velvet to assess where that cupcake shop

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.720
falls among all others that I've been to.
And then I also like to try whatever might

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:09.800
be unique to that cupcake place.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:15.420
So, vanilla with sprinkles, blueberry crumb
cake. I once had a cupcake with glitter on

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:20.960
it, actual glitter. That was at Delish in
Austin, Texas. So I would say red velvet,

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:26.041
definitely. And then if you go to Sprinkles,
their vanilla cupcake is also divine. Or,

00:37:26.041 --> 00:37:30.690
Crumbs in New York, their cupcakes are the
size of your head with like, every candy from

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:35.090
the shelf just shoved on top; delicious.

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:38.270
[pause]

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:44.140
And by the way, cupcakes are one of my values
that are in the book in the Life chapter,

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:49.840
under my list of personal values. Cupcakes:
fun, celebration, indulgence. We should all

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:54.930
have more cupcakes in our lives. I think that's
a great place to end. Thank you all so much

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:57.610
for being here. I'm gonna sign books in the
back.

00:37:57.610 --> 00:37:58.610
[applause]

00:37:58.610 --> 00:37:58.613
Thank you. Thanks.
