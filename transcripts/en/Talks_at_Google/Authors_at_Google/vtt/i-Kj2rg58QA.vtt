CARLA NAUMBURG: My
name is Carla Naumburg.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.290
I'm a clinical social
worker, and a writer,

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.960
and a mother of two young kids.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.900
And I wrote this book called
"Parenting in the Present

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.960
Moment."

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.668
So today we're going
to talk a little bit

00:00:13.668 --> 00:00:15.000
about mindful parenting.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.100
And the plan is that I'm going
to talk for 30 to 40 minutes,

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.850
and then I'd love to
answer any questions.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.900
And we can have a discussion
about some of the stuff I've

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.852
written in the book.

00:00:22.852 --> 00:00:25.060
I believe there's another
talk happening in this room

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.737
when I'm done.

00:00:25.737 --> 00:00:27.320
So if you'd like me
to sign your book,

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.278
I think there's some
books for sale down there.

00:00:29.278 --> 00:00:31.030
And then we can go
outside, and I'm

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.610
happy to sign it just to let
the next talk come on in.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.460
So whenever I start
talking about parenting,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.360
my favorite thing to talk
about, and think about, and do

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.090
is sleep.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.740
So I always start with a
little passage about sleep

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.444
from the book.

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:47.360
I'm going to do a little
reading from the book

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.720
today and a little talking.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.680
"So I'm lucky enough to
be a fairly good sleeper,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.650
or at least I was
before I had kids,

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.740
which is fortunate, because
I need a lot of sleep

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.790
to function.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.650
One or two nights without
my full eight hours and I

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.780
become a grumpy, dysfunctional
red hot button just asking

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.320
to be pushed.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.060
I knew this about myself long
before I became a mother,

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.730
and I was terrified
about what was

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.800
going to happen to me once
my first child was born.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.390
It's not surprising, then,
that I spend most of my first

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.950
pregnancy obsessed with sleep,
not just my own but also

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.120
my baby's.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.900
Sleep is the panacea of
parenthood, the altar at which

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.830
all exhausted parents worship.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.590
And I must have read
seven or eight books

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.890
about how to get a baby to
sleep through the night, four

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.440
words that became my constant
prayer through the first weeks

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.410
of my daughter's life
before I even gave birth.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.760
So every sleep expert has
different advice, of course,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.810
but one thing became
abundantly clear to me,

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.990
I had to figure out how
to get this kid to sleep.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.420
By the time our
daughter was born,

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.460
my husband and I
had acquired a crib

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.380
without a drop side, of
course, a firm mattress that

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.150
fit precisely in
the crib to avoid

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.570
the risk of the
baby getting stuck

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.400
between the mattress
and the bars,

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.880
a co-sleeper for
next to our bed,

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.342
a pack and play for traveling,
a vibrating bouncy chair for nap

00:02:00.342 --> 00:02:03.065
time, a swing in case the baby
didn't like the bouncy chair,

00:02:03.065 --> 00:02:05.690
a standing fan for her bedroom--
we'd read an article somewhere

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.600
that those reduce
the risk of SIDS--

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.520
a white noise machine
in case the fan wasn't

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.780
loud enough, light blocking
shades for the windows,

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.370
a space heater so
we could perfectly

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.050
regulate the
temperature of her room,

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.290
a baby monitor, and special
sleep sacks that should

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.120
be used instead of blankets.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.120
We congratulated ourselves
on not succumbing

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.230
to the video monitor.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.140
We weren't going to
be those parents.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.680
By the time my
daughter was born,

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.950
I was an expert in
sleep training and sleep

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.240
safety who had never
actually put a baby to sleep.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.190
And I had all the knowledge
and gear to prove it.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.260
The first few weeks
of life with a newborn

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.850
were rough to be sure,
with long, exhausting days

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.950
and hourly wakings every night.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.150
But when she was six
weeks old, our daughter

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.280
slept through the night.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.670
Eight hours of uninterrupted
slumber filled bliss.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.420
It was heavenly.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.540
It was lifesaving, and it
had nothing to do with me

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.050
and all of my obsessive
reading and buying.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.660
As I would come to learn
over the next weeks, months,

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.870
and years, my
daughter is a sleeper.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.390
She's a shockingly picky
eater and potty training

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.410
was no walk in the park.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.220
But that kid can sleep."

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.520
So I always start out
talking about this,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.730
because I think my
approach to sleep really

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.130
characterized my first
couple of years as a mother.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.930
I was constantly researching
and thinking about

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.240
and worrying about every
possible thing that

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.800
could happen to my
child or my family

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.672
and then deciding I needed
to understand it and fix it.

00:03:26.672 --> 00:03:28.130
And this was all
before I even knew

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.302
it was going to be a problem
for us, so spending all my time

00:03:31.302 --> 00:03:33.010
sort of running around,
putting out fires

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.450
before they were even burning.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.200
And a part of this is
because of who I am.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.120
I'm an anxious person.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.370
I like to be on top of things.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.699
I like to have information
and solve problems.

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:42.490
Part of this, I think,
is a natural outcome

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.670
of being a parent in
the age of social media

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.844
and constant information.

00:03:45.844 --> 00:03:48.260
Because every day there's a
new article on the "Huffington

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.390
Post" about the latest study,
about the latest thing that's

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.010
going to screw up your kid if
you don't fix it right away.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.330
And I bought into all of
it hook, line, and sinker.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.450
The thing about trying to
solve every problem even

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.300
if it's not actually a problem
is that you get worn out.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.331
And you get exhausted.

00:04:02.331 --> 00:04:03.330
And you get overwhelmed.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.850
And you get stressed out.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.620
And all those things
happened to me.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.270
And so I took it out on my kids.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.780
Why?

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.727
Well, because honestly they were
the people I was with the most.

00:04:12.727 --> 00:04:14.560
And if we're also going
to be really honest,

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.380
little kids as adorable,
and lovely, and sweet

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.562
as they can be, are
super annoying sometimes.

00:04:20.562 --> 00:04:22.520
Even when they're doing
the developmental stuff

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.430
they're supposed to
be doing, it's hard.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.570
Any parent can tell you this.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.155
So what happened was I
started yelling at them.

00:04:29.155 --> 00:04:32.950
Now, I wasn't much of a yeller
before I became a mother.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.860
But the stress was too much,
and I was taking it out on them.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.410
Now, I knew that I
wasn't alone in this.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.950
Our parenting generation,
we're a bunch of yellers.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.170
I remember really understanding
this the first time

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.210
when I read an article
in "The New York Times"

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.380
a couple years ago
that said, we are

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.610
generation of devoted parents.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.400
We buy the organic food, and
we get them the perfectly

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.730
carved wooden little blocks.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.079
And we make sure we're
at their soccer games.

00:04:57.079 --> 00:04:58.120
And we do all this stuff.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.411
We're constantly praising them.

00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:00.590
We're so devoted to them.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.712
But man, we yell at them.

00:05:02.712 --> 00:05:03.910
And so I read this article.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.460
It made me feel a little bit
better that I wasn't alone.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.810
I wasn't the only one.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.940
But I also knew how I felt when
I lost my temper with my kids.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.780
And I saw how it
was impacting them.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.500
And I knew it wasn't good
for our relationship.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.314
So I decided that I needed
to put a stop to it.

00:05:21.314 --> 00:05:22.730
And I remember
when that happened.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:23.290
It was one night.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.460
It was a really bad night.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.130
I had blown up at them,
and I finally just put them

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.540
in front of the TV.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.160
I thought, you
know, them watching

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.910
TV is much better than
me yelling at them.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.540
And then I sort of
silently berated myself

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.310
for being that parent
who couldn't parent

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.270
as well as a TV could.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.580
And then I sat down at
Google-- yes, Google--

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.260
typed into the search bar, "How
do I stop yelling at my kids?"

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.779
Literally, I typed those words.

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:47.070
Now here I am, a social worker.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.340
I have devoted my entire
professional career

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.727
to understanding people,
and human development,

00:05:51.727 --> 00:05:53.810
and relationships, and how
to manage our emotions,

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.700
and how to recognize them,
and what to do with them when

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.040
they become overwhelming.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.410
And in that moment, in
the fog, and fatigue,

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.360
and exhaustion of
parenthood, I literally

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.095
couldn't solve this problem.

00:06:03.095 --> 00:06:05.370
So I turned to Google.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.970
And there were thousands of
articles, and lists, and blog

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.910
posts, and suggestions
about what to do

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.304
when you want to stop yelling.

00:06:12.304 --> 00:06:13.720
And some of them
were really good.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.940
Take a few deep breaths.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.770
Do some jumping jacks.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.470
Go for a walk around the block.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.510
My favorite one--
scream into the toilet.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.470
I remember reading that
one and being like,

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.732
I deal with poop all day
long, and you want me

00:06:27.732 --> 00:06:28.940
to go scream into the toilet?

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:29.924
No.

00:06:29.924 --> 00:06:33.950
But nonetheless, I made my own
little list of suggestions,

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.200
hung it on the wall, and
decided I'm going to do this.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.270
I'm not going to
yell at my kids.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.686
I'm going to take
my deep breaths.

00:06:38.686 --> 00:06:40.300
I'm going to stretch,
whatever it is.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.790
Well, you all know how
this turned out, right?

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.010
Within a day or two,
I lost it with them.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:46.720
I felt horrible.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.670
By the time I remembered to do
my little list, it was done.

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.840
I already had my mommy tantrum.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.194
It's pretty frustrating.

00:06:53.194 --> 00:06:54.360
But, you know, I'm stubborn.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.620
I wasn't going to give up.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.286
But this time I decide
I'm going to turn

00:06:57.286 --> 00:06:58.550
to the academic literature.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:59.216
I'm an academic.

00:06:59.216 --> 00:07:00.870
I understand how
this stuff works.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.390
When I need real
answers, I'm going

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:03.848
to turn to the
heavy-hitters, and I

00:07:03.848 --> 00:07:06.480
know I can think my way
out of this problem.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.520
So I start reading all
these studies related

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.150
to parent behavior and child
discipline, all this stuff,

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.410
whatever.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.420
And at the bottom of
every single one of them--

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.378
you know how they always
have that section that

00:07:17.378 --> 00:07:19.820
says "suggestions
for future research"?

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.070
They all said something
along the lines of,

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.320
this parent could probably
benefit from mindfulness

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.089
and meditation.

00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:27.630
So I want to read
you a short passage

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.822
from the book about just
how I felt about that idea.

00:07:31.822 --> 00:07:36.850
"There was no way I was going
to meditate-- absolutely not.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:40.110
I tried meditation once before
in college in hopes of scoring

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:43.160
an easy PE credit
required for graduation.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.200
I will never forget
sitting on that hardwood

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.650
floor in the middle
of a stinky gymnasium.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.980
A tall, thin man dressed all in
white with a long wispy beard

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.610
instructed us to cross
our legs, close our eyes,

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.910
breathe deeply, and
clear our minds.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.870
I crossed my legs, and it
all went downhill from there.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.100
Clear my mind?

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.740
What did that mean?

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.400
I didn't really understand how
I was supposed to clear my mind,

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.222
so I decided to
think about black.

00:08:07.222 --> 00:08:08.930
Because black-- there's
nothing in black.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.316
So if you think about black,
clearly your mind is clear.

00:08:11.316 --> 00:08:12.662
But then I thought about it.

00:08:12.662 --> 00:08:13.870
You know, I visualized black.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.495
But then I thought, well, black
isn't really my favorite color.

00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:18.100
I like blue a lot better.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.460
But I can't decide if I
like turquoise or sapphire,

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.070
and the next thing I knew, my
mind was anything but clear.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.070
And then within minutes,
all I could think about

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.230
was how much my butt
hurt and my nose itched.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:31.131
So in my mind, meditation
was for hippies

00:08:31.131 --> 00:08:32.630
who didn't have
their shit together.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.046
And mindfulness was just a
fancy word for reformed hippies

00:08:35.046 --> 00:08:36.919
who barely had
their shit together.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:38.789
I was happy to spend
an hour each week

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:40.559
in the confines of
the therapy office,

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:43.394
but meditation was an entirely
different proposition.

00:08:43.394 --> 00:08:45.510
It was just one step
away from shaving my head

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.630
and handing out
flowers at the airport.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.850
I was a type-A, take control,
get things done kind of girl,

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:53.680
and there was no way I was going
to spend my precious parenting

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.530
time chanting and
lighting incense sticks."

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:59.980
So as you can tell, I had a lot
judgments and misconceptions

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.390
about mindfulness
and meditation.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:02.740
And I was just not educated.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.780
I had no idea.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.014
But the thing is, it
wasn't getting better.

00:09:07.014 --> 00:09:08.680
I didn't know how to
change the problem.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.721
I didn't know what to do.

00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:11.850
And these ideas kept sort
of popping up in my life.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.220
People were
suggesting them to me.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.910
And finally, I
thought, all right.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:18.400
I'm going to figure out
what this is all about.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.900
So I signed up for an eight-week
mindfulness-based stress

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.930
reduction course,
also called MBSR.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:24.810
I'm sure many of you
have heard of it.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:26.700
This is a curriculum
that was originally

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.620
developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn
in the late 1970s.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.870
He was working at the
University of Massachusetts

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:34.380
out in Worcester, Mass.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.215
And it's an exploration of
mindfulness, and meditation,

00:09:37.215 --> 00:09:40.010
and basic yoga.

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:41.610
And when Jon Kabat-Zinn
created this,

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.150
he did two really
brilliant things.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:44.610
He's really a
pioneer in bringing

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:48.181
all of these practices and
all this wisdom to the West.

00:09:48.181 --> 00:09:49.680
The first thing he
did was he really

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.696
stripped it of any religious or
spiritual background, language.

00:09:54.696 --> 00:09:55.820
He took all that stuff out.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.490
Because he understood that
a lot of folks in the West

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.710
would really struggle with
that stuff, because he

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:02.764
was coming from a
Buddhist background.

00:10:02.764 --> 00:10:04.180
And he took all
that language out.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.380
The practices were
very similar, though.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.040
The next thing he did was
he started gathering data.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.112
So when every new group
of folks would come in,

00:10:11.112 --> 00:10:12.570
in the beginning,
most of them were

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.840
struggling with chronic pain.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.631
And he was using
mindfulness and meditation

00:10:15.631 --> 00:10:17.090
to help them deal with this.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:18.173
He would gather some data.

00:10:18.173 --> 00:10:20.460
He'd take some
baseline surveys of how

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.310
they were doing,
how their pain was,

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:23.950
and then they'd go through
this eight-week course,

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:25.324
and then he'd get
some more data.

00:10:25.324 --> 00:10:28.820
And over time, he really amassed
an amazing body of information

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.602
about how effective mindfulness
and meditation can be.

00:10:31.602 --> 00:10:33.560
And so now when you go
on the "Huffington Post"

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.476
and you see an article
that says, "mindfulness

00:10:35.476 --> 00:10:38.180
cures psoriasis," it's because
they put a bunch of people

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:42.150
through an eight-week MBSR
course and got some data.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.840
So I started going
to these classes.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.780
And what I found
is that everything

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.290
I had thought I knew about
mindfulness and meditation

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.350
was completely wrong.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:53.640
It is actually an incredibly
pragmatic, and clear,

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.750
and useful, and skillful way
to approach life and parenting.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.295
And so I want to
read you-- well,

00:11:02.295 --> 00:11:04.670
first I want to talk to you
about what my experience was.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:08.220
And what I noticed is that
when I was meditating, which

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.100
I started doing at home,
much to my own surprise,

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.686
I was a lot less
reactive with my kids.

00:11:13.686 --> 00:11:15.060
I would get less
angry with them.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.320
I would get less frustrated.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.220
I was more patient.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.820
I felt less of a need to
micromanage everything

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.127
they were doing.

00:11:21.127 --> 00:11:23.460
And I didn't really understand
that connection at first,

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.150
but I saw that it was happening.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.100
And that red hot
glowing button I sort of

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.870
mentioned at the
beginning with the sleep,

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:31.430
if I was like this
glowing button that

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:33.846
was really super sensitive,
and bright, and red, and angry

00:11:33.846 --> 00:11:35.434
all the time, when
I was meditating,

00:11:35.434 --> 00:11:37.975
that button got a little smaller
and a little less sensitive.

00:11:37.975 --> 00:11:40.380
It wasn't that it
went away completely,

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.340
but I was a lot calmer.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.310
And I remember the first time
I really noticed a difference.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:48.470
And I want to read
that to you here.

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.760
"So I still remember
the first time

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.070
I attempted to practice
mindfulness in response

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:54.450
to my own yelling.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:57.140
I wasn't able to stop my
tantrum before it started,

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.434
but I tried a different
approach after it happened.

00:11:59.434 --> 00:12:00.850
I went into the
kitchen, which was

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:03.980
my standard retreat from a
difficult parenting moment.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.480
And instead of
scouring the cabinets

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.650
for a handful of chocolate
to shove in my mouth,

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:10.530
I put my hands on the counter
and took a few deep breaths.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.720
Almost immediately, the dam
of guilty thoughts burst open.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.910
'I'm a terrible mother.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.170
I can't believe I
lost my temper again.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.490
The poor girls look so scared
and I just kept yelling.'

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.820
And then for the first time,
I realized what I was doing,

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.260
and I stopped.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.040
I just stopped.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.260
I remembered what my
MBSR instructor had said.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.130
'Our thoughts are just thoughts.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.490
They're not reality, and
we don't have to treat them

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:35.700
as though they are.

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.480
We can choose how much to
engage with them or not.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.140
We can let them go.'

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.980
The idea of my thoughts
were nothing more

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.150
than cars I could either
choose to get into

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:47.330
and cruise around in for a while
or rides I could pass up on

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.790
was a revolutionary
perspective for me.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:52.380
My years of social work
training had drilled into me

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.050
the importance of our thoughts.

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:56.840
They were the essence of who we
are, or so I had been taught,

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.339
and they needed to be explored,
and weighed, and considered,

00:12:59.339 --> 00:13:00.980
and understood,
and struggled with.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.479
Well, I had done
all of that, and it

00:13:02.479 --> 00:13:04.380
had been useful to a point.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:07.080
So in that moment, I
tried something different.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.960
I let those thoughts
go, and I tried

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.360
to implement what I was
learning about kindness,

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.730
and compassion, and curiosity.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:16.500
'OK,' I thought to myself,
'you yelled your kids.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.140
It's happened.

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:17.710
It's over.

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:19.100
What are you going to do now?

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.280
What do they need?

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.120
What do you need?

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.603
What can you do differently?'

00:13:22.603 --> 00:13:24.760
I don't remember how
I answered myself.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.660
Maybe I was hungry, or
stressed, or the girls

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.361
were over tired,
or getting sick.

00:13:28.361 --> 00:13:30.110
Maybe I took some deep
breaths and offered

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:31.818
to read them some
books or let them watch

00:13:31.818 --> 00:13:33.720
a show so I could have a break.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.180
What I do remember
is how I felt.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:39.560
Before when I would
freak out and then

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.450
berate myself for losing it,
I felt stuck, and helpless,

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:43.520
and terrible.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.060
My mood worsen, and I
just couldn't get myself

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.930
into a better space no
matter how hard I tried.

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:51.390
More often than not, I would
unleash that terrible mood all

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:53.417
over the girls all over again.

00:13:53.417 --> 00:13:55.250
But this time, when I
tried to pay attention

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:58.090
to how I was feeling, when I
tried to be nice to myself,

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:00.400
and interested in what
happened, my experience

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.870
was completely different.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.380
I felt like I could breathe.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.920
I felt like I could take a
moment to see what was going on

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.100
and get some clarity
on the situation.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.789
I felt like I had options and
could go back to my daughters,

00:14:10.789 --> 00:14:12.330
not only with a much
better attitude,

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:16.530
but with a willingness
to reconnect with them."

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.010
So you may notice in that
scenario I don't actually

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:21.510
remember what I did, like
what my intervention was

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:22.470
with my kids.

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.970
And this is an important point
about mindfulness and mindful

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:26.450
parenting.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:29.160
It's not about what
we do specifically.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.930
But there is an assumption,
an underlying assumption,

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:35.070
that when we can take a
moment, pay attention to what's

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:36.960
happening for
ourselves and our kids,

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.430
we're going to make a more
effective and empathic choice

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:41.640
in parenting, whatever
that is for us.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.110
And this is important because
mindful parenting is often

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:46.880
confused with theories
like attachment parenting.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.200
And attachment parenting is
a specific parenting theory

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.990
that talks a lot about how and
where your child should sleep,

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:54.304
and how you carry them,
and how you feed them.

00:14:54.304 --> 00:14:55.970
That's not what I'm
talking about today.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:59.100
I'm talking about sort of
the head space that we are in

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.930
and how changing
that perspective

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:05.340
can positively impact the way
we interact with our children.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:11.600
So I've thrown around this
word "mindfulness" a lot,

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.695
and I want to take a minute
to actually define it.

00:15:13.695 --> 00:15:15.320
And there's a definition
I really like,

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.800
which is sort of a hybrid of
Jon Kabat-Zinn's work and Amy

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:19.610
Saltzman's work.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:21.860
Dr. Amy Saltzman is a
physician and a teacher,

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.000
and she's right around
the corner in Palo Alto.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.990
And so the definition
I like is about

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:30.960
choosing to pay attention to
the present moment with kindness

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.544
and curiosity so we can then
choose our next behavior.

00:15:33.544 --> 00:15:34.210
So that's a lot.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:36.110
And we're going to tear
it apart a little bit.

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:38.193
The first part is about
choosing to pay attention,

00:15:38.193 --> 00:15:41.230
making a choice of what
we want to focus on.

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:43.150
Because most of
us, I would argue,

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.565
spend most of our day
following our attention around.

00:15:45.565 --> 00:15:47.280
It sort of gets
dragged from place

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.050
to place by our smartphone
that's glowing or buzzing,

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:52.570
or by a kid that's screaming,
or by a dinner that's burning,

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:54.570
or an urgent email that's
coming in, and all of a sudden

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:55.540
we have to attend to this.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:56.998
And then we have
to attend to that.

00:15:56.998 --> 00:15:59.030
And it's not often
enough that we say,

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.070
this is what I'm going
to focus on right

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:04.360
now, making an intentional
choice to direct our attention.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.320
So choice is really important.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.460
The next piece is
about paying attention.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.100
We use these words all the
time including in parenting.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:14.810
I am constantly telling my
girls, please pay attention.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:18.385
But I'm not sure I ever stop
to tell them what that means.

00:16:18.385 --> 00:16:19.840
That's a big concept.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.740
There are some big
ideas in there.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.460
And I never really
sat down and said,

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.970
here's what it means
to pay attention.

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:28.720
You face the thing you
want to pay attention to.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.010
Maybe you look at it.

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:31.480
You make a choice
to listen to it.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.320
Maybe you're smelling
it or touching it.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.028
And when you notice
your thoughts wander,

00:16:35.028 --> 00:16:37.422
you bring them back to the
thing you're focusing on.

00:16:37.422 --> 00:16:39.130
I don't think I've
ever said that to them

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:40.110
until very recently.

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:42.020
And we just assume that
our kids know what it means

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.145
when we say, pay attention.

00:16:45.317 --> 00:16:46.900
So paying attention
is the next piece,

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.108
so choosing to pay attention.

00:16:48.108 --> 00:16:50.030
Present moment, let's
talk about this.

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:52.440
If you ask most people
what mindfulness

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.350
it is, they will say, it's
living in the present moment,

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:57.930
which sort of conjures these
scenes of like being on a beach

00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:00.130
and frolicking in the
waves or something.

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:00.960
That's lovely.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:01.460
It's great.

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.001
It's not what I'm
talking about here.

00:17:03.001 --> 00:17:05.251
What I'm talking about
is making a choice

00:17:05.251 --> 00:17:06.750
to pay attention
to what's happening

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:08.319
right here in the here are now.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.104
Now in this moment,
in this room,

00:17:10.104 --> 00:17:12.520
maybe it's the thoughts in my
head, the sound of my voice,

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.339
looking at all of you, worrying
if I'm in the camera or not,

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:17.490
all of these things.

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:19.609
There are a couple reasons
why this is important.

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:21.609
But the most important
one is the present moment

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:23.359
is where the action is.

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:26.500
It's the only place where
we can affect change, where

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.057
we can make a different choice.

00:17:28.057 --> 00:17:29.140
The past already happened.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:29.580
That's done.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:30.740
Nothing we can do about that.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.230
And we can spend
as much time as we

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:34.021
want planning for the
future, but you never

00:17:34.021 --> 00:17:35.249
know what's going to happen.

00:17:35.249 --> 00:17:37.290
So the present moment,
that's where the power is.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:38.414
That's where the energy is.

00:17:38.414 --> 00:17:40.470
That's where we
can do something.

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:43.000
The bummer is our brains
are terrible at being

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.100
in the present moment.

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.474
They don't want to do it.

00:17:45.474 --> 00:17:47.140
They want to remember
the past, and they

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.910
want to plan for the future
and everything in between.

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:53.580
Here's the best explanation
I found for why that is.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.340
A bazillion years ago,
those of us who could

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.520
remember that when Uncle
Joe wandered into the cave

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.000
and even got eaten by
a saber tooth tiger,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.020
and then could make a plan
to not go in that cave,

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.907
we're much more likely
to survive and reproduce

00:18:06.907 --> 00:18:09.240
than those of us who were
just sort of wandering around,

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.930
and they smell something
good coming out of the cave.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:12.880
And they wander in the
cave, and they're done.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.120
So this ability to
remember the past

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.400
and make a plan for the
future served us very well.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.690
It still serves us
really well today,

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:23.850
because if you can remember that
your child has a nut allergy

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.730
and make a plan to bring a
nut-free cupcake to a birthday

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:29.390
party, you have avoided
both an allergic reaction

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:30.640
and a nasty tantrum.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.770
So that's great.

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:35.890
The problem is our brains aren't
very good at turning that off.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:39.030
And so we are constantly
remembering, and regretting,

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:42.410
and worrying, and wishing,
and hoping, and planning,

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:45.430
and then we miss what's
happening right in front of us.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:47.860
A really common example
of this in my house

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.950
is when I ask my kids to put
their shoes on in the morning.

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:53.070
Any of you who have
children with feet

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:54.990
who wear shoes on
a regular basis

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:58.320
will know that this
is no simple thing.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.110
It's so easy.

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:00.740
It never happens that way.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:03.809
So I will say to my kids,
please go put your shoes on.

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:05.350
And then I go in
the kitchen, and I'm

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:07.681
finishing up their lunches,
getting us out the door.

00:19:07.681 --> 00:19:09.930
And then about half the time
I yell around the corner,

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:11.940
put your shoes on!

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.540
Now I have not bothered
to peek around the corner

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:17.020
to see if they are
putting their shoes on.

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.120
We live in a tiny house.

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.286
It's not like I have to
walk over to the other wing.

00:19:20.286 --> 00:19:22.380
I literally have
to go like that.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.160
But I don't do it.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.626
Because I'm already
decided based

00:19:24.626 --> 00:19:26.750
on past experience and my
worries about the future,

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.810
they're clearly not
putting their shoes on.

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:31.257
But the thing is, about half
the time, they actually are.

00:19:31.257 --> 00:19:33.090
And so what happens is
then they yell at me,

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:34.950
we are putting out shoes on!

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:37.330
And then I yell back at
them, don't yell at me!

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.820
And yes, the irony of yelling
at my kids not to yell at me

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:40.720
is not lost on me.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.000
But this is where
we are sometimes.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.610
And so in that moment, if I
had literally taken two seconds

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:49.830
to come back to the present
moment, to look at my children,

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:53.730
we could have avoided not only
a really unpleasant interaction,

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:55.407
but also avoided
this dynamic where

00:19:55.407 --> 00:19:57.240
they know mom's going
to yell at them again,

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.950
so they don't have to
listen to me the first time.

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:02.750
And I would argue
that much of parenting

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.380
would be so much easier
if we could take the two

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.300
seconds to literally
look at our kids and tune

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.220
into them, which is
a hard thing to do.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.170
It shouldn't be, but it is.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:14.750
All right, so we're
choosing to pay attention

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.525
to the present moment with
kindness and curiosity.

00:20:17.525 --> 00:20:19.130
The other word
that Jon Kabat-Zinn

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:22.410
uses for this perspective
is nonjudgmental,

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:24.660
because most of the
time what happens

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:27.450
when we tune into the
present moment is we

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:30.070
want it to be different.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.530
If it's bad, we want it
to stop or get better.

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:34.920
If it's boring, we want it
to get more interesting.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.240
And if it's good, we
want it to last longer.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.680
This is what we do.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.181
It is so rare that we
say, ah, this is great.

00:20:42.181 --> 00:20:42.680
I'm good.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.224
I'm just good.

00:20:44.224 --> 00:20:46.265
Because then all of a
sudden, I'm like, actually,

00:20:46.265 --> 00:20:47.250
I'm a little cold.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.550
It's a little cold in here.

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:49.490
And I don't know.

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:50.730
The seats are kind of
distracting, because there's

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:53.313
no pattern to the red and blue
that really bothers-- you know,

00:20:53.313 --> 00:20:55.380
the mind just goes
on and on and on.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:59.550
People don't like being
alone in their thoughts.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:01.917
There was actually
a recent study,

00:21:01.917 --> 00:21:03.500
I believe it was out
of Massachusetts,

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.180
maybe it was somewhere else,
where they gave people choice.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:09.050
They could either sit
alone with their thoughts,

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:12.170
or they could give
themselves a painful shock.

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:15.339
Most of the time people
wanted to shock themselves

00:21:15.339 --> 00:21:17.130
instead of being alone
with their thoughts,

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:18.622
because we don't
like our thoughts.

00:21:18.622 --> 00:21:19.580
We want them to change.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.619
We want them to be different.

00:21:21.619 --> 00:21:23.410
It's so challenging
for us to approach them

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:25.230
with kindness and curiosity.

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:27.624
And so, an example
of how this really

00:21:27.624 --> 00:21:29.040
comes into play
with parenting, is

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.930
when I'm trying to teach
my daughter to ride a bike.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:34.054
I have decided that
my kids have to be

00:21:34.054 --> 00:21:36.220
able to ride a bike if they
have any chance of being

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.428
happy and successful in life.

00:21:37.428 --> 00:21:39.200
Because clearly if
you can't ride a bike,

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.741
I might as well give
up on parenting.

00:21:40.741 --> 00:21:42.650
There's just no point.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:44.252
I don't know how.

00:21:44.252 --> 00:21:45.210
I'm worried about this.

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:46.700
I'm anxious.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:47.880
This is a thing.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.010
So we take our kids
out to ride bikes.

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:51.630
And my daughter says,
you know, Mommy,

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:54.050
I really want you to
hold onto the handle bar.

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:54.940
Walk alongside me.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.340
Hold onto the handlebar.

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:57.770
I'm like, no, she's
never going to learn how

00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:58.920
to ride a bike if I do that.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.090
She's got the training
wheels on there.

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:00.790
She'll be fine.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:01.581
This is ridiculous.

00:22:01.581 --> 00:22:02.332
I'm not doing it.

00:22:02.332 --> 00:22:04.540
And then she's like, please
hold unto the handlebars!

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:05.750
No, you can ride.

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.970
You're not going to fall.

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:06.960
If you fall, it'll be fine.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:07.920
You're like two
feet off the ground.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:08.430
It's fine.

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:09.590
You'll be fine.

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:10.640
So what happens?

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.370
She flips out and
gets off the bike.

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:16.449
And we are no closer to
learning how to ride a bike.

00:22:16.449 --> 00:22:18.240
But when I can get
interested, and curious,

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.020
and accepting of her
experience, and say, all right,

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.500
this is my kid is
right now-- she

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.152
needs me to hold onto the
handlebar-- we go down

00:22:25.152 --> 00:22:26.110
the street a few times.

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:27.485
And then she says,
I'm good, Mom.

00:22:27.485 --> 00:22:28.730
Take your hand off.

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:30.440
And we're a whole lot closer.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.530
But that means I have to notice
and let go of all those worries

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:35.080
and fears swimming
around in my brain

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.810
and get interested and
accepting of her experience.

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:39.716
That's hard.

00:22:39.716 --> 00:22:41.590
So the kindness and
curiosity is a big thing.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.510
Now, it's not only about
being kind to our kids.

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:46.260
It's about being
kind to ourselves.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.760
And if you remember back to my
little scene in the kitchen,

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.640
after I yelled at my kids,
the first thing I did,

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.070
my natural reaction, was to
berate myself and get angry

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:55.370
with myself.

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:58.520
So what happens when we
do that is we get stuck.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.700
How many of you have
ever sort of really

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.515
felt horrible and ashamed or
embarrassed and then been like,

00:23:03.515 --> 00:23:04.390
well, that was great.

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:07.480
I feel super energized
to go make a change now.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.269
It doesn't happen that way.

00:23:09.269 --> 00:23:11.310
When we're in a place of
shame and embarrassment,

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:13.430
we feel stuck, and we can't
make a different move.

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:14.804
We can't make a
different choice.

00:23:14.804 --> 00:23:17.370
We just keep reenacting the
same dysfunctional patterns

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:18.740
that we always have.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.839
When we can be kind to ourself
and forgiving and accepting,

00:23:21.839 --> 00:23:23.630
that empowers us to do
something different.

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:25.379
And there's some great
research coming out

00:23:25.379 --> 00:23:28.340
of Texas and Massachusetts
looking at self-compassion

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.920
and how that really
actually helps

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.605
people make a different
choice, make healthier choices,

00:23:32.605 --> 00:23:34.980
sort of behavior in ways that
are more congruent with who

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.742
they want to be.

00:23:36.742 --> 00:23:38.450
All right, so the
kindness and curiosity.

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:40.391
And all this leads
up to the pot of gold

00:23:40.391 --> 00:23:42.140
at the end of the
parenting rainbow, which

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.810
is making a different
choice about how

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:45.730
we want to behave next.

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:47.540
That's the point of all this.

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.820
Because like 99% of
parenting is about how

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:52.980
we respond to our children.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:56.130
But most of the time, we're
not responding, we're reacting.

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:58.211
Kid does X, I do Y. Kid
does something good,

00:23:58.211 --> 00:23:59.710
I kiss or tell her
I'm proud of her.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:00.209
I love you.

00:24:00.209 --> 00:24:02.620
Kid does something bad,
I bite her head off.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.939
This is not how I want
to parent my kids.

00:24:04.939 --> 00:24:07.230
But the more we do it, the
more likely we are to do it.

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:08.620
Because we're creatures
of habit more,

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:09.480
and the more we
practice something,

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.470
the better we get at it,
even if it's something

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:14.090
we don't really want to
be practicing at all.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:16.057
But when we can approach
the present moment

00:24:16.057 --> 00:24:17.890
where we can make a
change, and we can do it

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:20.310
with kindness and curiosity
that frees us to do something

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:23.370
different, we're much more
likely to respond to our kids

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:25.650
the way we want
to, whatever that

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:28.180
may be for you and your family.

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:31.560
All right, so that's the
sort of mindfulness piece.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.580
And so mindfulness is really
about this internal experience

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.350
of paying attention
in a specific way.

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:39.360
But when we're talking
about mindful parenting,

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.443
it's not just about paying
attention to ourselves.

00:24:41.443 --> 00:24:43.290
It's about paying
attention to our kids.

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:44.910
We're in this relationship.

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:47.880
So the question is, what should
we be paying attention to

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.752
in addition to our thoughts?

00:24:49.752 --> 00:24:51.210
Well, I would argue
that you really

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:53.550
need to pay attention to
what your kids are eating,

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:56.186
super important that they
have a healthy diet but also

00:24:56.186 --> 00:24:57.560
a healthy relationship
with food,

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.950
so they don't end up
with an eating disorder.

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:01.550
Also it's really
important to make

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:03.560
sure your kids get
on a sports team,

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.060
because they need to know how
to interact with other people.

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:07.610
They need to know how to
follow directions, listen

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:09.450
to what the coach says,
play with other people.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:11.050
But you don't want them
playing too many sports,

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:12.510
because they need down time.

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:14.030
They need quiet time to
be with their thoughts,

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:15.030
learn how to be bored.

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:16.060
Because if your
kids can't be bored,

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:17.851
it's going to be a big
problem because life

00:25:17.851 --> 00:25:18.960
is so boring sometimes.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.980
You should probably make sure
they learn a language too,

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:23.360
because the research on language
development in your brain,

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.430
I mean, it's just fantastic.

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:25.750
And we're like this
global economy.

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:26.580
They've got to be--
I mean, they're

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:27.420
just not going to
function if they

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.810
can't speak another language.

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:31.130
Along those lines, they
need to play an instrument.

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:33.310
I mean, just really-- again,
the brain development piece,

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:34.930
they have to be able
to play an instrument.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.470
I mean, you guys know
where I'm going with this.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:37.560
The list goes on and on.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.860
And if you do research on
what you should be teaching

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:42.240
your kids, quit your jobs now.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.810
Hire a staff.

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:46.910
Because you will need them.

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:48.860
The underlying message
behind all of these,

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:52.920
like your kid needs to do x
or y, is that if you do this,

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.640
they will grow up to be healthy,
productive, successful adults.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:59.280
And if you don't, their
lives will be terrible.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.584
I don't buy any of it.

00:26:01.584 --> 00:26:02.500
I don't buy any of it.

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:03.083
We don't know.

00:26:03.083 --> 00:26:04.870
I mean, my dad stuck
me in piano lessons.

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:05.669
I hated it.

00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:06.210
I can't play.

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:08.370
I still don't know
what a chord is.

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:10.147
You never know.

00:26:10.147 --> 00:26:12.230
Maybe you want to expose
your kids to these things

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:14.271
or if something works for
your kid, that's great.

00:26:14.271 --> 00:26:17.310
But I'm going to tell you-- and
the research is very clear--

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.800
that the single most
effective choice

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.380
we can make in doing
our best to set

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:25.720
our kids on a path for
resiliency, happiness, success,

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:29.040
productivity, insert your
word of choice there,

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.440
is to have a healthy,
resilient, engaged relationship

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.150
with our kids.

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:35.705
That is the best chance we have.

00:26:35.705 --> 00:26:38.080
Now, I'm not going to stand
here and tell you that if you

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.070
do that, your kid will be fine.

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:41.640
Parenting, and
child development,

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.880
and human development
is far too complex

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:46.090
to make an if/then
statement like that.

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:49.290
But it's the best
chance we have.

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:52.841
It sounds so easy,
and it's so hard.

00:26:52.841 --> 00:26:55.090
Not only do we not get to
pick our kids temperaments--

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:57.000
it's not like we get to
date kids, and be like,

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:57.920
oh, you're too quiet.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:58.790
You're too loud.

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:00.000
Ehh, doesn't work for me.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:00.750
You poop too much.

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:01.850
I can't do that.

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:03.710
You get the kid you get.

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:05.460
And as I've read in
"Pinkalicious" far too

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:08.069
many times, you get what you
get and you don't get upset,

00:27:08.069 --> 00:27:09.610
except for when you
get really upset.

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:11.540
Then you start breathing,
and it gets better.

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:14.450
But the other thing that's
really hard about kids

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:17.250
is if you think about it,
within the span of an hour,

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:19.950
we are their friends, their
cheerleaders, their chefs,

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:22.360
their jailers, their best
friends, their coaches,

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.420
their teachers,
their chauffeurs,

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.830
their disciplinarians.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:26.989
It is exhausting.

00:27:26.989 --> 00:27:29.030
And in the midst of all
this, they have the nerve

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:31.238
to keep growing and changing
and figuring things out,

00:27:31.238 --> 00:27:32.700
and we can't keep up with that.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.794
It's really hard.

00:27:34.794 --> 00:27:37.210
Layer on top of that, we all
come from different cultures,

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:39.460
different religions,
different personal styles,

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:41.064
different family structures.

00:27:41.064 --> 00:27:43.105
So all of these ideas that
people throw out there

00:27:43.105 --> 00:27:45.740
at you about how to have
healthy relationship,

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.360
it's hard to know
what the answer is.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.240
I've got a few ideas.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.850
Of course I do, I wrote a book.

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:52.910
People with books have ideas.

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:55.900
And so the three main
chapters in my book

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:57.917
that are sort of the
bulk of this perspective,

00:27:57.917 --> 00:27:59.625
the first one is about
staying connected.

00:27:59.625 --> 00:28:02.060
This is about our
relationship with our kids.

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:05.165
And I think the basics of this
is that your children need

00:28:05.165 --> 00:28:06.832
to feel safe.

00:28:06.832 --> 00:28:09.290
And this is something that many
parenting books gloss over,

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:11.580
because they assume that
if you have the money

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:15.670
to buy a parenting book and
read a parenting book, the worst

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:17.362
problem you have is time out.

00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:18.070
How do you do it?

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:19.380
Do you do it at all?

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:20.037
It's not true.

00:28:20.037 --> 00:28:21.620
We know that millions
of American kids

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:23.610
don't feel safe at home.

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:25.250
So I'm going to
leave it at that.

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:26.500
But if you have
questions about safety,

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.583
if you want to talk about
it, find me on Facebook.

00:28:28.583 --> 00:28:30.830
We'll talk about it.

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:32.990
Safe, seen-- our kids
need to feel seen by us.

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:36.485
They need to know that we know
who they are, and we love them

00:28:36.485 --> 00:28:38.400
and accept them for it.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.826
This is the work of a
lifetime, and most of us

00:28:40.826 --> 00:28:41.700
will never get there.

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:44.070
But that doesn't
mean we stop trying.

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:47.530
Safe, seen, soothed-- OK,
I'm running through these,

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:48.060
I know I am.

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:51.380
But there's more in the book,
and we can talk about it later.

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:54.590
Soothe-- our kids need to know
how to manage big emotions.

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:57.189
Most of us don't know how to
manage big emotions, which

00:28:57.189 --> 00:28:58.230
is why we drink too much.

00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.840
We eat too much.

00:28:58.840 --> 00:28:59.500
We shop too much.

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:00.291
We gamble too much.

00:29:00.291 --> 00:29:01.924
We yell too much.

00:29:01.924 --> 00:29:03.340
So to the extent
that we can start

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:06.419
teaching our kids about this
right now, that's a big deal.

00:29:06.419 --> 00:29:08.710
And I have some ideas in the
book about how to do that.

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:09.780
And the last one is supported.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.530
And when I talk about
supporting our kids,

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:13.600
I mean supporting them
as opposed to controlling

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.736
them or micromanaging them.

00:29:15.736 --> 00:29:17.360
Again, this is a very
hard thing to do.

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.943
Because when your kid spills the
beads across the wooden floor

00:29:19.943 --> 00:29:22.010
for the eighth time in a
day, all you want to do

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:24.960
is grab the necklace and
say, I'll make it for you.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.280
But that's not what they need.

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.970
So safe, seen, soothed,
and supported--

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:28.950
I like my little s's.

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:30.524
It helps you remember things.

00:29:30.524 --> 00:29:32.690
So the first part of this
mindful parenting business

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:34.780
is about staying
connected to our kids.

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.950
But as I've said time
and again, it's hard.

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:38.240
So we need to stay grounded.

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.090
We need to take
care of ourselves.

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:42.570
Most parenting books gloss
over this with the sleep

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:43.810
when the baby sleeps.

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:45.630
That's the self-care
piece they give you.

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:47.070
So if your kid's not
a baby, I'm sorry.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:48.153
We have no advice for you.

00:29:48.153 --> 00:29:49.790
Just give it up.

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:51.960
Also, if your kid sleeps
in the car like mine did,

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:54.210
and you're driving, and you
cannot sleep when the baby

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:57.107
sleeps, you're probably screwed.

00:29:57.107 --> 00:29:58.940
No, no, I go into this
in a lot more detail.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:01.611
And what I talk about in
this is self-awareness,

00:30:01.611 --> 00:30:03.860
getting to know ourselves
and understanding ourselves.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.901
And one of the things I
learned about myself when

00:30:05.901 --> 00:30:08.550
I became a parent is I need
a huge amount of alone time

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:11.040
and downtime during a
day in order to be able

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.810
interact kindly
with my children.

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:16.870
And so I started writing,
because I needed to be alone.

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:19.250
And now I can be in a much
better place with my kids.

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.166
That's an example of the
self-awareness piece.

00:30:21.166 --> 00:30:23.280
Self-compassion
we've talked about.

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.920
Self-care-- here's
the one thing I'm

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.122
going to say about self-care.

00:30:27.122 --> 00:30:28.580
In a lot of places
in this country,

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:31.517
self-care gets confused
with self-improvement.

00:30:31.517 --> 00:30:33.100
So when you have a
chunk of free time,

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:34.580
you are out training
for marathon.

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:36.440
You're making a
quilt for your child.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.060
You are making cupcakes.

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.970
You're learning a new skill.

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:43.180
Now, if those things nourish and
rejuvenate you, that's great.

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:44.410
Go do them.

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:47.790
But if you're doing them out
of a sense of compulsion,

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:50.350
and you'd rather actually
be staring at the wall,

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:52.090
go stare at the wall.

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:53.696
Take care of yourself.

00:30:53.696 --> 00:30:55.320
You wouldn't say to
your kid if they're

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.929
feeling sick and
exhausted, quick,

00:30:56.929 --> 00:30:58.220
let's go do some math homework!

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:00.020
That will make you
feel so much better.

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:01.360
You'd say, why don't
you lay on the couch,

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.695
and I'll bring you a blanket
and your favorite toy,

00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:05.335
and I'll read you a story.

00:31:05.335 --> 00:31:09.167
Well, what if we did that for
ourselves when we're worn out.

00:31:09.167 --> 00:31:10.000
Go lay on the couch.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.210
Wrap yourself in a blanket.

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:13.470
Read a good book,
whatever it is for you.

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:16.330
So we really need to reexamine
our definition of self-care.

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:20.530
And finally, again, support--
we can't do this alone.

00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:22.630
It is not possible to
raise a child alone.

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:26.470
And yet, so many mothers in
my generation where this as

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:27.894
like a badge of pride.

00:31:27.894 --> 00:31:29.310
Oh, my kid was
puking all weekend,

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:30.500
and my husband was out of town.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:31.150
But it's fine.

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:32.550
I got it.

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:33.200
It's like, no.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.950
Let your friend
bring you some soup.

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:36.950
Because then they know
that when they need that,

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:38.262
you're going to do it for them.

00:31:38.262 --> 00:31:40.220
And one of the things
that happens with support

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.600
is most of us go into
parenthood assuming

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.230
that all the friendships and
relationships we had before

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:47.850
are going to support us
after we become a parent.

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:49.590
And it's not necessarily true.

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:50.587
Relationships change.

00:31:50.587 --> 00:31:52.670
And then all of a sudden,
the people in your life,

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:55.450
it's like a random coworker,
or this person on your street,

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:57.130
maybe it's the
pediatrician you happen

00:31:57.130 --> 00:31:58.890
to get assigned to
at the practice--

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:00.970
and we just run with it
because we're too tired

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:02.479
and overwhelmed
to make a change.

00:32:02.479 --> 00:32:04.770
But we need to make a conscious
choice and think about,

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:06.728
are the people in my life
who are supporting me

00:32:06.728 --> 00:32:08.091
actually supporting me?

00:32:08.091 --> 00:32:10.090
And do I need to find a
parenting support group?

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:12.170
Do I need to seek out
some new friendships?

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:14.320
What do I need to do?

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.570
All right, so if staying
connected with our kids

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:19.936
and staying grounded are two
sides of a scale that we're

00:32:19.936 --> 00:32:21.310
constantly trying
to get balanced

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:23.970
but it never quite
works, staying present,

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:26.630
which is my last big chapter,
is the solid grounding

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:28.920
keeps that scale upright.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.220
This is the mindfulness piece.

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:32.450
It is crucial to all of this.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:34.160
None of it works
without the mindfulness.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.270
Because let's say
you decide you're

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:36.910
going to take your kids to
the aquarium for the day.

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:37.970
You're going to
have this great day.

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:39.120
You're going to
connect with them.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.180
And then you spend
the whole time

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:42.263
stressing about a fight
you had with your partner,

00:32:42.263 --> 00:32:44.460
how you're going to pay
the rent this month.

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:45.560
You're going to come
out of it, and your kids

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.130
aren't going to feel any
more connected to you.

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:48.760
You're not going to feel
any more connected to them.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:49.930
You're just going
to be stressed out.

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:51.805
So don't even waste the
money on the aquarium

00:32:51.805 --> 00:32:52.630
in the first place.

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:54.129
Just stay home and
stress out there.

00:32:54.129 --> 00:32:56.370
It's a lot cheaper.

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:58.120
And same thing with
your staying grounded,

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.180
your self-care-- in
my town, everybody

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:01.140
goes to get pedicures.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.670
This is like the thing you do.

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:04.640
I finally discovered
after like five pedicures

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.595
that I don't like
strangers touching my feet.

00:33:06.595 --> 00:33:08.040
And I was like, oh,
maybe I won't do that.

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.640
But I would go to
these pedicures,

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.615
and I'd be on my phone,
making my to-do list

00:33:11.615 --> 00:33:13.490
for all the things I
was going to get done as

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:15.040
soon as the pedicure was over.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.136
And then I'd be like, oh,
the birthday party, what

00:33:17.136 --> 00:33:18.360
are we going to do about that?

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.590
And I haven't really
planned summer camp

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:20.930
and all of these things.

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:23.280
And then I'd come
out there as wired

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.579
and wound up as when I went in.

00:33:24.579 --> 00:33:25.620
I didn't feel any better.

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:27.494
And then I had the
stranger touching my feet.

00:33:27.494 --> 00:33:29.190
It was like a total
waste of time.

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:32.290
So when you can be in
the present moment,

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:35.920
even if it's for like two
minutes several times a day,

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.870
it's going relax you, help
you feel more calm, soothed,

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:41.130
controlled, on top of things.

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:44.570
Here's the hard part about
mindfulness-- I can't give you

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:45.880
a pill for this.

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.590
There's no like perfect
secret trick, like do this

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:49.340
and it'll be done.

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:53.150
You'll be like this
mindful awesome person.

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:55.410
And mindfulness is
actually very easy to do.

00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:57.940
It's very hard to
remember to do.

00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:59.360
So the trick with
staying present

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:02.280
is to try to create a
structure in your life

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.864
that's going to make it easier
for you to remember to do this,

00:34:04.864 --> 00:34:07.113
which is why when you go
away on a meditation retreat,

00:34:07.113 --> 00:34:08.540
it's like this
beautiful building.

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.040
And it's very
uncluttered and clean.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.000
And there's like the
Buddha smiling at you.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.250
There's always a field.

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:16.241
They always find a
beautiful field to stare at.

00:34:16.241 --> 00:34:17.699
Because they know
that you're going

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:19.150
to have an easier,
better time at this

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:21.600
retreat if you're not staring
at a pile of dirty laundry

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.201
the whole time.

00:34:24.201 --> 00:34:26.409
But most of us can't go away
on retreat all the time.

00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:27.560
This is not a possibility.

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.980
So what can we do in our lives?

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:32.199
We can slow down.

00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:33.940
And there's no trick
to slowing down.

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:34.949
You just have to
decide it's something

00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:37.670
you want to do, and see if you
can add in five minutes here,

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:39.991
five minutes there, or
decide it doesn't really--

00:34:39.991 --> 00:34:42.449
you're not going to fight with
your kid over their clothes,

00:34:42.449 --> 00:34:43.500
because it's not worth the time.

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.860
And if they really want
to wear pajamas to school,

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:47.590
they're going to wear pajamas
to school, whatever it is.

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:49.340
But are there ways
that you can slow down?

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:51.239
Because one of the things
I've noticed about myself

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:53.745
as a parent is I just start
hurrying even when I'm no tin

00:34:53.745 --> 00:34:54.320
a rush.

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:54.810
It's like, come on.

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:55.280
Let's go.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:55.530
Let's go.

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:55.810
Let's go.

00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:56.230
Let's go.

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:57.150
And we have plenty of time.

00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:58.006
Why am I doing that?

00:34:58.006 --> 00:34:58.630
I have no idea.

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:00.213
And then I have to
be like, slow down.

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:06.940
Simplifying your life
makes it much easier

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.160
to slow down and be mindful.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.270
And the best example
I have is sippy cups.

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:13.510
These are going to
the death of me.

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:15.650
For a long time, we had
like eight different types

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:16.469
of sippy cups.

00:35:16.469 --> 00:35:18.760
And of course, my girls are
like I want the Lalaloopsy.

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:19.920
I want the Hello Kitty.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.295
And the Lalaloopsy
takes a straw.

00:35:21.295 --> 00:35:22.711
And the Hello Kitty
needs a valve.

00:35:22.711 --> 00:35:24.400
And I'm raahh,
freaking out, because I

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.314
can't find the right
top for the right cup.

00:35:27.314 --> 00:35:29.230
And then one day-- it
took me like three years

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:31.710
to get to this stroke of
brilliance-- I was like no.

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:34.750
We're going to have one kind of
sippy cup with one kind of top.

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:36.840
And you get what you get.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.510
And then my girls know it's
Hello Kitty or nothing.

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:40.300
That's not so bad.

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:41.240
She's cute.

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:45.910
So all of a sudden, that whole
piece of stress wasn't there.

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:49.480
So simplifying is a great idea.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:53.337
Savoring-- this is a big word
in the mindfulness world.

00:35:53.337 --> 00:35:54.170
What does this mean?

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:56.850
It means being fully in the
moment with all of our senses

00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:58.602
and truly appreciating it.

00:35:58.602 --> 00:36:01.060
Now what happens when there's
a cute moment for most of us?

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:03.030
We pull out our phones, because
we've got take a picture of it,

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.850
because it's so cute.

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:04.780
We've got to capture it.

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:06.920
And then you look at it, and
the colors aren't quite right.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:07.720
OK, I'm going to
put it on Instagram.

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.390
I'm going to put a filter
on it, because that's

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:10.473
going to look really good.

00:36:10.473 --> 00:36:12.384
And then you send
it over to Facebook.

00:36:12.384 --> 00:36:13.550
And then you're on Facebook.

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:14.480
And oh my gosh!

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:15.420
My friend had a baby.

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:16.087
That's adorable.

00:36:16.087 --> 00:36:17.670
And then you're like
clicking through.

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:18.740
And it's like the dancing cats.

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:20.000
And I'm a sucker
for dancing cats,

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.250
so I have to watch that video.

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:22.930
And then I've totally
missed the moment.

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:25.930
It is gone because I had
to take a picture of it.

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:28.250
And so when I think
about savoring,

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:30.780
I think about taking a
picture with my mind.

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:34.459
And the idea, the memory I
have of this is one morning,

00:36:34.459 --> 00:36:36.000
I'm sitting there
drinking my coffee.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.791
I look over at my kids,
and they're playing

00:36:37.791 --> 00:36:39.630
with stickers on the couch.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:40.790
And my first thought was
like, (FRANTICALLY) oh my god!

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:41.880
They got stickers on the couch.

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:42.826
They're going to get the
stickers all over the couch!

00:36:42.826 --> 00:36:44.840
I'm not going to get the
stickers off the couch!

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:45.830
And then I thought
about it for a minute.

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:47.165
It's a shitty IKEA coach.

00:36:47.165 --> 00:36:47.790
What do I care?

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:48.998
We can change the slip cover.

00:36:48.998 --> 00:36:50.030
It's like $50.

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:51.550
But nonetheless, I
was like, OK, I'm

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:52.890
going to let them play
with the stickers.

00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:53.973
And then I just sat there.

00:36:53.973 --> 00:36:56.430
And I was like, I have
a hot cup of coffee.

00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:58.940
The sun is shining
in the window.

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.680
My kids are sharing
their stickers.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:04.320
None of the stickers have been
torn, so nobody's flipping out.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.890
It was like a little
commercial for a happy family.

00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:08.660
And I just sat there
and noticed it.

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:10.330
And it was lovely.

00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:13.474
And three years later,
I remember that moment.

00:37:13.474 --> 00:37:15.140
And we've had a million
of those moments

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:19.240
that I don't remember because
I rushed through them.

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:22.010
That's what savoring
is all right.

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:25.240
So we have slowing down,
simplifying, savoring,

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:27.010
and my favorite--
this is my S word.

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:28.634
I'm sure somebody
else came up with it,

00:37:28.634 --> 00:37:30.210
but I did to-- single-tasking.

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:32.590
So we are a nation
of multitaskers.

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:35.210
How many job descriptions have
we all read where it's like,

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:36.430
multitasking a plus!

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:37.760
This is a good thing.

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.310
OK, so what we know
from the research

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:42.320
is we are actually not
capable of multitasking.

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.367
The word they use this
task switching now.

00:37:44.367 --> 00:37:46.200
So what that means is
we're doing one thing,

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.750
and then we're like
watching "Law &amp; Order,"

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:48.940
and then I'm
cutting the carrots.

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:50.950
And so I'm like, what
happened to the murdered guy?

00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:51.920
And then I'm going
to cut the carrots.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:52.940
And then my kid comes in.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.930
And she's flipping out, so
I'm going to fix that problem.

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:56.130
And then I'm going
to cut the carrots.

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:57.755
And I'm so proud of
myself, because I'm

00:37:57.755 --> 00:38:00.389
this super productive person
who can do all these things.

00:38:00.389 --> 00:38:01.430
And then I cut my finger.

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:02.380
And then the carrots
are on the floor,

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.629
and I never hear the end of
the "Law &amp; Order" episode,

00:38:04.629 --> 00:38:06.650
and it's not on Netflix
so I can't see it.

00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:09.250
And my kid's problem
never gets resolved.

00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:12.950
It didn't actually work, but
I'm also multitasking-- no.

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:14.380
We can't do it.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.830
What we know is that our
brains jump back and forth.

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:18.970
We never focus on
one thing fully.

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:20.680
And then we need a
few seconds in between

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:24.380
to readjust to the new thing,
so it's super ineffective.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.140
And it's super inefficient.

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:28.310
And it's really not that
possible to be mindful

00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:29.740
when you're multitasking.

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:34.230
So trying to do one thing
at a time is a great idea.

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:38.070
So we have staying connected
to our kids, staying grounded,

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:39.127
and staying present.

00:38:39.127 --> 00:38:41.460
And whenever I give this talk,
the question I always get

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:44.057
is, how do I get started?

00:38:44.057 --> 00:38:46.390
And there are a bunch of
different ways, recommendations

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:47.570
I have.

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:49.636
Because me standing up
here and saying to you,

00:38:49.636 --> 00:38:52.090
just go be mindful,
it's cool, just do it,

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:54.120
is kind of like
saying to your kid,

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:58.390
just go out on that soccer field
during that championship game,

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:01.280
kick the winning goal
when you have never

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:03.470
practiced a day in your life.

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:05.450
And that's what I did
to myself that day

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:08.380
when I sat down and Googled,
how do I stop yelling?

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:10.940
Trying to be mindful when
your kid is exploding right

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:13.490
in front of you, making a
serious behavioral change

00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:17.050
in your own experience
during a time of crisis,

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:21.426
is not possible if you haven't
been practicing all along.

00:39:21.426 --> 00:39:23.050
So the trick with
mindfulness is you've

00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:24.900
got to start when it's easy.

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:28.954
Because as Karen Maezen Miller,
who is an amazing Zen Buddhist

00:39:28.954 --> 00:39:31.120
priest and a mindfulness
teacher and a mother, says,

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.525
life is suffering enough.

00:39:32.525 --> 00:39:34.650
Don't make it worse with
your mindfulness practice.

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:37.090
I'm paraphrasing her.

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:38.330
So start when it's easy.

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:40.538
So what I like to do, there
are two different things.

00:39:40.538 --> 00:39:42.310
One is my informal
mindfulness practice.

00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:44.060
I pick a couple times
during the day when

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.219
I'm doing something
I enjoy, that I

00:39:46.219 --> 00:39:47.760
know I'm going to
be doing every day,

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.360
and I make a point to
pay attention to it.

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:52.474
So this is when
I'm in the shower,

00:39:52.474 --> 00:39:54.390
because what happens
when I'm in the shower is

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:56.348
I get to the end of the
shower, my hair is wet.

00:39:56.348 --> 00:39:58.745
I have no idea if I
washed it, not a clue.

00:39:58.745 --> 00:40:00.120
So I've started
paying attention.

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:01.360
And what I find is
that taking a shower

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.620
is this awesome experience.

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:03.670
I have hot water.

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:05.250
That's a great thing.

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:06.920
And I can get clean
and not stink.

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:08.847
This is also a very great thing.

00:40:08.847 --> 00:40:10.180
So I pay attention to my shower.

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:12.280
And then I pay attention
to reading to my kids.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.630
We do it every night.

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:16.720
Because the mind is an
amazing, amazing thing.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.830
I could sit there
next to my kids,

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:21.450
read the entire storybook to
them, get to the end of it,

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:24.990
and I have no idea what
happened, not a clue.

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:27.680
How my mind can read the
words, say them out loud,

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.640
and not hear a single
one of them is beyond me.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:30.320
But it does.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.810
It happens all the time.

00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:34.380
So I've noticed that when
I actually pay attention

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:37.160
to the storybook, children's
literature today is amazing.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.540
The pictures are fantastic.

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:39.500
The stories are good.

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.360
And if they're not,
the book disappears.

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.901
And when I'm sitting there with
my kids on either side of me,

00:40:43.901 --> 00:40:45.949
like snuggled up, it's
this beautiful moment.

00:40:45.949 --> 00:40:48.490
And we all feel a little calmer,
and a little more connected,

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:50.110
and a little happier at the end.

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:52.460
So if you can find a couple
of practices every day,

00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:54.710
that's something you're going
to do every day that you

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:56.810
enjoy, pay attention to it.

00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:59.792
Within about 30 seconds,
your mind is going to wander.

00:40:59.792 --> 00:41:01.500
And when you notice
your mind wandering--

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.927
that's what Sharon Salzberg
calls the magic moment,

00:41:03.927 --> 00:41:05.510
because it's the
moment you can choose

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:06.250
to do something different.

00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:08.630
You choose to let go of that
thought, whatever it is,

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:11.090
come back to your experience.

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:13.835
The other one is
formal meditation.

00:41:13.835 --> 00:41:16.335
If informal mindfulness, the
paying attention in the shower,

00:41:16.335 --> 00:41:19.550
is like walking up the stairs
to get a little more exercise

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:21.550
or parking on the other
side of the parking lot,

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:24.010
formal meditation is
like going to the gym.

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:25.880
We're practicing
paying attention.

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:28.119
We're practicing being
bored and being OK with it.

00:41:28.119 --> 00:41:28.910
Because guess what?

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:30.873
Parenting is boring
a lot, for any you

00:41:30.873 --> 00:41:33.670
who have ever played Chutes
and Ladders-- boring, right?

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:35.760
So we're practicing
getting bored, being bored,

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:36.730
and being OK with it.

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:39.770
We're practicing noticing
big emotions come across us

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:41.800
and being OK with
those, letting them go.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.874
We're practicing not getting
hijacked by our own thoughts.

00:41:44.874 --> 00:41:46.290
So there are four
traditional ways

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:49.070
you can do this-- standing
up, sitting down, laying

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:50.460
down, or walking.

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:53.210
If I lay down to meditate, I
fell asleep and I miss pick up.

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:55.680
Yes, that happened once.

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.690
I am not hardcore
enough to stand up.

00:41:57.690 --> 00:41:59.550
So I usually sit down.

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:02.380
And when I just can't
sit still, I walk.

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:03.940
And what I do is
I find my breath.

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:04.540
I notice it.

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:06.606
And if you all do this
right now, just notice.

00:42:06.606 --> 00:42:08.230
Where do you feel
your breath the most?

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:09.280
Is it at the tip of your nose?

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.370
Is it coming into your mouth?

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:11.078
Is it your chest?

00:42:11.078 --> 00:42:12.120
Is it your belly?

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.639
And then just keep noticing it.

00:42:13.639 --> 00:42:14.805
You don't have to change it.

00:42:14.805 --> 00:42:17.096
You don't have to count your
breaths or breathe deeply.

00:42:17.096 --> 00:42:18.037
You just notice.

00:42:18.037 --> 00:42:20.620
And if you're anything like most
of us, within about a breath,

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:22.464
your mind will wander.

00:42:22.464 --> 00:42:24.130
And then you notice
your mind wandering,

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:25.740
and you come back
to your breath.

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:28.330
And you do it again,
and again, and again.

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:32.130
And what most people say is,
I'm a terrible meditator,

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:34.950
because I can't keep
my mind on my breath.

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:37.121
It's not about how many
breaths you can keep it for.

00:42:37.121 --> 00:42:39.370
It's about how often you can
notice that your mind has

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:40.740
wandered and bring it back.

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:41.920
When you're lifting
weights, you don't

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.420
expect to stand
there for 20 minutes

00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:45.080
holding weights up in the air.

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.040
You just keep lifting.

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:50.100
With meditating, you just
keep breathing and noticing.

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.780
And over time, this
will make it easier

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:55.900
for you to not be such a big
red hot button in reaction

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:56.982
to your kids.

00:42:56.982 --> 00:42:59.190
And even if you feel like
your meditation session was

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:01.109
terrible, hang in there.

00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:02.900
See what happens in
the heat of the moment.

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:04.155
It makes a difference.

00:43:04.155 --> 00:43:06.280
So those are my thoughts
on mindfulness and mindful

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:06.820
parenting.

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:08.910
It looks like we have a few
minutes for questions, which

00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:10.140
I would be happy to answer.

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:12.780
And thank you all for your
time and your attention.

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:15.600
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.820
AUDIENCE: What you said is
more about managing yourself

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:22.950
than managing your kids.

00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:24.110
CARLA NAUMBURG: Yes.

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:27.530
AUDIENCE: Which is quite
insightful, and I love it.

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:32.260
But is there any research
showing the other way,

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:34.090
that is, can kids be managed?

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:36.780
Can kids be-- like,
[INAUDIBLE] occasions

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:39.780
you said that we all
experience, that I just

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:44.320
felt the kids were unreasonable,
or not listening, or not doing

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:49.050
what they should do, or having
emotion, acting up, not doing

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:50.460
what they're supposed to do.

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:53.430
And also, the most frustrating
thing is it's unreasonable.

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:56.410
You don't know why they don't
do what they're supposed to do.

00:43:56.410 --> 00:43:59.610
So is there any research
showing that there's also

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:02.076
a managing the kids side?

00:44:02.076 --> 00:44:04.200
CARLA NAUMBURG: So you're
asking about the efficacy

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.030
of mindfulness with children?

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:08.250
Is that kind of what
we're looking at?

00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:13.010
AUDIENCE: Not-- whatever
methodology, but meaning

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:16.180
essentially training the
kids or educating the kids

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:18.720
to be more cooperative.

00:44:21.549 --> 00:44:23.340
CARLA NAUMBURG: That's
the golden question,

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:25.344
if I had the answer to that--

00:44:25.344 --> 00:44:27.010
AUDIENCE: So if they
don't listen, other

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:29.960
than I take a deep
breath, I manage myself,

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:33.887
is there any technique or any
fact at all that [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:33.887 --> 00:44:34.720
CARLA NAUMBURG: Yes.

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:35.590
AUDIENCE: I keep on
thinking, when I was a kid,

00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:36.980
I always listened
to my parents--

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:40.220
the discipline or, of course,
a different culture, that is,

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:46.549
whether any discipline, any
control of kids would be--

00:44:46.549 --> 00:44:48.840
CARLA NAUMBURG: So questions
about behavior management.

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.720
AUDIENCE: Maybe that's
just wishful thinking.

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:51.760
Maybe you can't.

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.630
CARLA NAUMBURG: No, I
think there are some ideas.

00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:57.320
First of all, I don't want
us to underestimate the power

00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:58.255
of managing ourselves.

00:44:58.255 --> 00:44:59.880
And they did a really
interesting study

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:02.070
with some folks where
they took some parents who

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:04.410
identified their children's
having behavioral problems,

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:05.610
whatever that is.

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:08.469
And they put the parents through
the eight-week MBSR course.

00:45:08.469 --> 00:45:09.760
This is not a parenting course.

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.200
They did not talk
about parenting.

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:14.220
They taught the parents to
meditate, practice mindfulness.

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:16.140
And what they found
coming back a year later

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:17.765
is that those parents
who stuck with it

00:45:17.765 --> 00:45:19.990
reported that their kid's
behavior was significantly

00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:21.027
improved.

00:45:21.027 --> 00:45:22.360
So let's not underestimate that.

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:25.590
Having said that, behavior
management is a huge question.

00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:27.410
And there are as many
experts with opinions

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:29.570
as there are children
with problems or children

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:31.153
who are normal and
don't have problems

00:45:31.153 --> 00:45:33.740
and still-- there's
a whole range.

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:37.214
And what I would
say is, this is not

00:45:37.214 --> 00:45:38.880
going to be the answer
you want to hear.

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:40.110
It depends on your family.

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:41.640
It depends on your child.

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.860
It depends on who
the parents are,

00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:46.640
who the teachers are, whoever's
involved, and what works,

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:47.570
and what you're
comfortable with.

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:49.180
Some people are
comfortable with time outs,

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:50.054
and that's effective.

00:45:50.054 --> 00:45:52.512
And some people just aren't.

00:45:52.512 --> 00:45:54.990
Some people are comfortable
with redirection,

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:57.510
and some people feel like
that's not stern enough.

00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:59.430
I mean, there's a
range of options.

00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:01.390
So I think that's sort
of a bigger question.

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:03.973
But there are certainly a lot
of people with a lot of opinions

00:46:03.973 --> 00:46:04.675
about that one.

00:46:04.675 --> 00:46:06.154
But thank you.

00:46:06.154 --> 00:46:07.570
AUDIENCE: As a
prospective parent,

00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:09.486
what would be the things
that you think, other

00:46:09.486 --> 00:46:14.260
than preparing and practicing
mindfulness and looking

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:16.120
into things like your
books, your talks,

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:17.536
all those kind of
stuff, are there

00:46:17.536 --> 00:46:20.430
any other avenues that are
less specific to mindfulness

00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:22.300
that you'd recommend
looking into?

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:24.340
CARLA NAUMBURG: Getting
ready to have a kid?

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:26.970
Yes.

00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:31.992
I would suggest you spend time
with people who have children.

00:46:31.992 --> 00:46:34.200
And the thing is, that's
not really what you actually

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.700
want to do when you're
getting ready to have a kid,

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:38.410
because you want to go out
and live this child-free life,

00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:41.760
which you should also do.

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.970
I would suggest you spend
a lot of time trying

00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:50.840
to let go of the illusion
of control, which is so

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:54.320
easy to say and so hard to do.

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:57.720
Here's the tricky thing--
looking back, I'm like,

00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:58.970
oh, I wish I had known this.

00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:01.345
I wish somebody had told me
all of these things about how

00:47:01.345 --> 00:47:03.280
I would feel, and what
I need to be doing,

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:05.760
and the fact that kids will
projectile vomit everywhere

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:06.570
all the time.

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:08.640
Like, I wish somebody
had said to me,

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:11.070
you need to prepare yourself
to manage a lot of vomit.

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:13.660
And the thing is,
I'm sure they did.

00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:14.410
I'm sure they did.

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:15.490
And I said, oh yeah, I'm good.

00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:17.160
I've got little
brothers and sisters.

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:18.091
I've got cousins.

00:47:18.091 --> 00:47:18.590
I am good.

00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:19.930
I'm good with this.

00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:21.680
And it's a thing
that everybody has

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:26.720
to go through, because
every child is different.

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:28.950
Here's what I would say--
get yourself a good support

00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:30.490
network.

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:32.470
Find the people who are
going to stick by you.

00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:34.511
And it's a little hard to
know, because you never

00:47:34.511 --> 00:47:36.660
know how people are going
to react when they become

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:38.160
a grandparent, or
an aunt and uncle,

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.150
or when their best
friend has a kid

00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:40.399
and they don't have a kid yet.

00:47:40.399 --> 00:47:42.841
You never really know, but
just like the support network.

00:47:42.841 --> 00:47:45.090
And then the other thing,
which I just heard yesterday

00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:47.299
at a talk I did, is if you
get paternity leave, which

00:47:47.299 --> 00:47:49.715
I think here at Google they
have a very generous paternity

00:47:49.715 --> 00:47:50.466
leave, take it.

00:47:50.466 --> 00:47:51.360
Take all of it.

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:53.720
Take every last day
of it-- not only

00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:57.160
because your wife, or spouse,
or parenting partner, whoever,

00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:00.180
will love you and it will
help your marriage immensely.

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:02.140
But the research
down the road on how

00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:04.530
it's going to impact your
involvement in your child's

00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:06.760
life and the equity in
the relationship in terms

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:09.180
of child care is astounding.

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:10.762
So take your paternity leave.

00:48:10.762 --> 00:48:13.220
And then just be prepared to
be more tired than you've ever

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:15.352
been in your life and
know it'll get better.

00:48:15.352 --> 00:48:16.885
Does anybody else--
I'm sure there

00:48:16.885 --> 00:48:18.885
are parents in the room--
have any other advice?

00:48:18.885 --> 00:48:21.632
Because I know I'm
missing something.

00:48:21.632 --> 00:48:22.340
My sister's here.

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:22.890
She's like, yeah.

00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:23.890
I could a lot of advice.

00:48:25.507 --> 00:48:26.340
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:27.464
That was an excellent talk.

00:48:27.464 --> 00:48:29.640
I'm actually in complete
agreement with everything

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:30.140
you said.

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:30.780
CARLA NAUMBURG: Oh, thanks.

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:33.640
AUDIENCE: But implementing
some things I find challenging.

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:38.140
So, for example, you mentioned
taking care of yourself, which

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:40.200
you think is important.

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:43.880
But with the two young kids,
and the heavy work schedules,

00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:45.610
and their individual
schedules, do

00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:49.320
you have any helpful tips
on how you can find time

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.009
to take care of yourself?

00:48:51.009 --> 00:48:53.050
CARLA NAUMBURG: Yes, I do
have some helpful tips.

00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:54.091
This is a great question.

00:48:54.091 --> 00:48:56.450
It's one that many
of us struggle with.

00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:58.950
One, and this is, I
think, more of an issue

00:48:58.950 --> 00:49:01.720
with moms than dads, is we
have to let go the guilt

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:03.380
about taking care of ourselves.

00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:06.240
We see it as like super
indulgent, and it's not.

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:08.949
It's basic self-care like
breathing and eating.

00:49:08.949 --> 00:49:10.240
And we wouldn't say, it's cool.

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:11.285
I'm taking care of a kid.

00:49:11.285 --> 00:49:13.451
I'm just not going to eat
for the next three months.

00:49:13.451 --> 00:49:15.360
So don't do that
with your self-care.

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:16.985
The other thing I
would say is we often

00:49:16.985 --> 00:49:19.490
assume that self-care
takes hours at a time.

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:21.680
It's like, I need an
afternoon to go for a hike,

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:24.240
or run, or play golf,
or whatever it is.

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.360
Often it's not that.

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:26.080
It's 10 minutes.

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:28.030
It's half an hour
here and there.

00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:30.990
I will frequently arrive
at pick up for my girls

00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:34.070
10 minutes early and sit
in the car and breathe.

00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:35.550
And that's all I
can get in a day,

00:49:35.550 --> 00:49:37.660
and it makes a huge
difference, as opposed

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:39.450
to when I'm like
checking my emails,

00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:40.930
and thinking about my to-do
list, and then I run in.

00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:42.390
And all of a sudden,
it feels like my kids

00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:44.260
are an intrusion on
my life, because I'm

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:46.240
right in the middle of
trying to do something.

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:49.390
So just giving yourself a
little time to sort of switch,

00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:51.550
and then also figuring
out what matters for you

00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:53.320
in terms of self-care.

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:54.890
Like everybody's got advice.

00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:56.056
You have to be doing yoga.

00:49:56.056 --> 00:49:57.180
You have to be eating kale.

00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:57.970
I hate kale.

00:49:57.970 --> 00:49:59.070
I don't want to eat kale.

00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:01.470
But I need to be eating
kale to take care of myself.

00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:03.610
Like, there's a laundry
list a mile long

00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:05.724
of what people say
you should be doing.

00:50:05.724 --> 00:50:08.140
And figuring out what actually
works for you is important.

00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:11.660
So for me, it's sleep and
really long walks alone,

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:13.120
which I have to make time for.

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.610
And I know I'm not as productive
in my professional life

00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:17.240
because I go for
a 45 minute long

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:18.640
walk most days of the week.

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:20.180
I'm lucky to have
the flexibility.

00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:22.720
But I know I'm also
less crazy with my kids.

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:25.050
And that's a trade off
I can, I'm lucky enough,

00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:26.320
and I'm willing to make.

00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:29.110
My vet, he goes and spends
an hour on the trapeze

00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:30.280
every Friday.

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:32.280
This is like my hell on earth.

00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:34.070
This sounds horrible.

00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:37.030
But it's what lets him
parent effectively.

00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:39.160
So I think taking some
time to figure out

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:40.322
what is it that you need.

00:50:40.322 --> 00:50:41.780
And if you can't
do it for an hour,

00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:43.740
can you do it for 10 minutes?

00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:46.510
But again, and the thing about
little kids is, they get older,

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:47.840
and it gets better.

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:50.489
So now my kids are almost
five and 6 and 1/2.

00:50:50.489 --> 00:50:52.280
And I can say, Mommy's
going to go meditate

00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.930
in the other room
for 20 minutes.

00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:55.590
Please, please leave me alone.

00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:58.264
And I would say four out
of 10 times, they do it.

00:50:58.264 --> 00:51:00.180
And four out of 10 is
so much better than zero

00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:02.470
out of 10, which is
where I was for years.

00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:05.239
So it gets better, I promise.

00:51:05.239 --> 00:51:07.655
AUDIENCE: You are talking about
just different strategies,

00:51:07.655 --> 00:51:10.070
like jumping jacks, screaming
into the toilet, walks,

00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:13.410
deep breaths, pushing the wall--
is there anything else that you

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:17.470
can recommend for when
we're in the moment

00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:18.812
and the tantrum is right there?

00:51:18.812 --> 00:51:19.645
CARLA NAUMBURG: Yes.

00:51:22.530 --> 00:51:24.070
There are many, many strategies.

00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:24.950
And you can find them online.

00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:26.025
Literally just sit down
and Google, how do I

00:51:26.025 --> 00:51:27.430
stop yelling at my kids.

00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:29.740
But the trick is,
you have to notice

00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:31.385
that it's about to happen.

00:51:31.385 --> 00:51:33.510
And for some of us, that
noticing is in our bodies.

00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:34.551
It's like they get tense.

00:51:34.551 --> 00:51:36.320
Our stomach gets all knotted up.

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:38.007
The shoulders go
up, whatever it is.

00:51:38.007 --> 00:51:39.590
Or it's the thoughts,
like, oh my god.

00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:40.160
I'm so pissed off.

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:40.868
This is horrible.

00:51:40.868 --> 00:51:42.280
It has to end, whatever it is.

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:44.610
But if you don't
notice it, you're

00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:46.240
not going to make the change.

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:48.994
And if you don't practice
noticing in the easy moments,

00:51:48.994 --> 00:51:51.410
you're not going to be able
to notice in the hard moments.

00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:52.993
So I have to come
back and say, again,

00:51:52.993 --> 00:51:55.760
the best thing you can do is
start some sort of meditation

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:56.682
and mindfulness.

00:51:56.682 --> 00:51:58.140
Because I don't
want to say to you,

00:51:58.140 --> 00:51:59.990
just go notice when
you're about to explode,

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:01.781
because that is setting
you up for failure,

00:52:01.781 --> 00:52:03.140
just like I did for myself.

00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:05.840
So really, if you could start
practicing, even five minutes

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.447
of meditation a
day, you're going

00:52:07.447 --> 00:52:09.030
to get so much--
like you're literally

00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:11.380
strengthening those neural
pathways in your brain.

00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:12.990
It's going to get
so much better.

00:52:12.990 --> 00:52:15.610
AUDIENCE: Any advice on
teaching children mindfulness

00:52:15.610 --> 00:52:17.870
or doing mindfulness
activities together with them?

00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:19.410
CARLA NAUMBURG: That's
fabulous, advice on teaching

00:52:19.410 --> 00:52:20.010
children mindfulness.

00:52:20.010 --> 00:52:22.510
I have a book coming out about
this at the end of December.

00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:24.640
Thank you so much for that.

00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:26.180
It's called "Ready,
Set, Breathe."

00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:28.057
It's going to be published
by New Harbinger.

00:52:28.057 --> 00:52:29.640
And what I would say
is the first step

00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:32.680
to teaching kids mindfulness
is to practice it yourself

00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:34.280
and talk to them about it.

00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:35.780
They will get curious.

00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:38.010
There are also many excellent
picture books for kids.

00:52:38.010 --> 00:52:39.680
So if you go on
Amazon and just Google

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:42.680
"mindfulness, meditation,
picture book, kids," whatever

00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:44.680
it is, you will find
great books that

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:46.760
will start to introduce
the concept to kids.

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:48.570
So those are where
I would start.

00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:49.820
But find me on Facebook.

00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:52.510
Shoot me an email, and I can
send you some more stuff.

00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:53.260
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Thank you so much.

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:54.343
CARLA NAUMBURG: Thank you.

00:52:54.343 --> 00:52:58.110
[APPLAUSE]
