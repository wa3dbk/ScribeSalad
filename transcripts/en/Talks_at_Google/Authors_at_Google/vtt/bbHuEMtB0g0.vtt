00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.759
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Good afternoon. The term
"peer pressure" often carries negative connotations

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.089
of teens engaging in behaviors they otherwise
might not, or families going into debt to

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:14.049
keep up with their more affluent neighbors.

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.550
But in her book, "Join the Club: How Peer
Pressure Can Transform the World," Pulitzer

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.099
Prize winning journalist Tina Rosenberg, argues
there are powerful, sometimes overlooked,

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:29.439
benefits of peer pressure; that if peer pressure
can be an enticement for delinquent behavior,

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.450
it can also be an enticement for positive
behavior.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.850
The fearless Tina Rosenberg has spent her
career tackling some of the world's most difficult

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.460
problems. Her powerful 1995 book, "The Haunted
Land" won both the National Book Award and

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.370
Pulitzer Prize for examining Europe after
the fall of the Iron Curtain.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.780
She was also the first freelance journalist
to receive a MacArthur Fellowship Award. Imagine

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.420
Junior High kids out behind the gymnasium,
or in the locker room or bathroom, and instead

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.970
of smoking, they're talking about how they
can stay focused and get good grades in school.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.820
Or, imagine a discussion around a village
well that centers on taking one's medications

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.860
faithfully to overcome disease. These are
the types of clubs she talks about and I suspect

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.250
that after hearing her, you will also want
to join the club. Tina Rosenberg.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.910
[applause]

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:38.800
&gt;&gt;Tina Rosenberg: Thank you, Phil. Thank you
Google for having me here today and to you

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:46.990
all for coming to this talk. How many of you
have children? Anybody? This is a younger

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.780
crowd than I'm used to talking to.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.330
Well, even if you don't have kids, you probably
know all about peer pressure. It's something

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.950
to worry about, right? We all know that if
our kids have problems, if they get drawn

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.350
into drugs, have a brush or two with the law,
if they're acting out, even if they just go

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.080
to the wrong parties, that's due to peer pressure.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.599
But what if our kids do fine? What if they're
studying hard and acting respectfully and

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:16.200
spending their spare time volunteering? The
credit goes to your children, right? And to

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.959
you for excellence in parenting. That can't
be the result of peer pressure, can it? My

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.000
book is about something we’ve been familiar
with all our lives, but I hope it will provoke

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.650
you to take a new look.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.579
We all know how mighty peer pressure is and
we're accustomed to being afraid of it. But

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:39.439
I argue that peer pressure can also be a powerful
force for good. In the book, I tell stories

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:44.290
of people in the United States and abroad
who are using peer pressure to solve problems

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.439
that could not be successfully attacked by
other means.

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:52.609
The case we all know is Alcoholics Anonymous
and it's a good example of what I'm talking

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:57.440
about. You help people to change their behavior
by giving them a new peer group, one that

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.749
supports them and holds them accountable,
one that they identify with.

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:07.019
The thesis of my book is that people are unlikely
to change their behavior because they receive

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.709
new information, or because you've told them
something that scares them to death. The most

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.859
effective way to persuade someone to change
is through identification.

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:21.660
Provide them with people just like them, who
have already made this change. I think we

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.260
can all imagine at a gut-level how effective
this can be for solving issues of personal

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.439
resistance to temptation. But the uses of
peer pressure are far broader.

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:35.540
And because of its effectiveness of scope,
this "join the club" strategy, which I also

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.559
call the social cure, opens up exciting new
possibilities for solving social problems

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:46.730
that we have come to think of as unsolvable.
Let me give you a few examples. In the late

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.859
1990s, teen cigarette smoking was astronomically
high in the United States.

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:59.599
In 1997, 36.5% of all high school seniors
smoked. This was really important because

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.439
young people are practically the only people
who start smoking. If you don't start by the

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:08.790
time you're 24, you're probably not gonna
start. And no one knew what to do about it.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.569
We had tried stressing to kids how dangerous
cigarettes are, bombarding them with information.

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.579
We had tried appealing to fear, putting up
rows of gravestones on the billboards, telling

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.430
them "smoking kills." And none of it was working.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.020
There was a headline in the Washington Post
in 1998 that said, "Officials seek a path

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:32.450
to cut into haze of youth smoking. The bottom
line, no one knows what works." Then the state

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.910
of Florida found something that worked spectacularly
well. It hired an advertising agency by the

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.949
name of Crispin Porter and Bogusky.

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:43.840
This agency had no experience at all with
public health, but it did know how to sell

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.169
to teenagers. Its staff sat down and looked
at the problem, not from a public health perspective,

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:55.270
but from the perspective of an ad man. Why
do teens start smoking? A cigarette, after

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.220
all, is a repulsive product.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.300
No one would buy a cigarette for itself. Once
you start, you continue to smoke because you're

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.699
hooked. But why do teens start in the first
place? The answer is that for teens, a cigarette

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:14.270
is not a delivery system for nicotine. It's
a delivery system for rebellion. It's a way

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.889
for teens to tell adults, "I'm autonomous.
You don't tell me what to do."

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.810
It's a way for teens to look cool to their
peers and feel cool to themselves. That's

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.060
why the usual strategies don't work. Teens
already know that cigarettes can kill them.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.330
In fact, teenagers overestimate the dangers
of smoking. They think cigarettes are even

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.900
worse than they are.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:40.220
Clearly, that's part of their appeal for teenagers.
So, Crispin Porter's people thought, "What

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:46.389
if we make not smoking a way to rebel, with
the tobacco companies as the target?" They

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:51.080
designed a series of TV spots, most of them
written by teenagers themselves that showed

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.289
kids rebelling against these corporate manipulators.

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:59.280
They filmed teenagers making prank phone calls.
For example, to the advertising agencies that

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.319
worked on tobacco accounts. They filmed a
road trip, a group of kids who drove from

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:08.270
Florida up to Richmond, Virginia, which is
the headquarters of Phillip-Morris.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.300
And when they got to Phillip-Morris, they
stop at the gate and they ask the guard if

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.449
they could see the Marlboro Man. And the guard,
who was clueless, told them, "Oh, I'm sorry.

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:21.169
You can't see him. He's just died." And in
fact, the actor who played the Marlboro Man

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:25.280
in Phillip-Morris' TV commercials had just
died of lung cancer.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:31.199
And they got this all on film. Accompanying
the media spots was clubs that kids could

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:36.889
join, clubs whose focus was rebelling against
the tobacco industry. These clubs staged pranks

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:41.750
and actions. After Florida, the strategy went
national and I followed one group of kids

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.469
in South Carolina who were doing the same
thing.

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:48.289
This group was called Rage Against the Haze,
which gives you some idea of the tenor of

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:52.740
it. And they stage events at high school football
games and do things like take over the smoking

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.979
section at Shoney's restaurants. They never
attack smokers. They never say you shouldn't

00:06:57.979 --> 00:06:58.979
smoke.

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:03.900
Or worst of all, they never say that cigarette
smoking is only for grown-ups. They just point

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:10.009
out to teens how the cigarette manufacturers
are manipulating them. This worked. It was

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:14.139
the first time in history that anything had
worked. Over the next two years, Florida saw

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:18.030
the single biggest drop in teen smoking that
the United States had ever seen.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:24.169
The strategy went nation-wide two years later.
And until 2007, teen smoking nationwide continued

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:29.660
to drop. Florida's teen smoking rate was cut
in half in a decade and many other states

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:34.069
did just as well.
[pause]

00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:38.229
Now that's an example of the social cure working
at a very personal level.

00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:42.949
But it has also accomplished social change
on a very grand scale. Let's look at another

00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:46.979
success of the social cure, a very different
kind of success, and one that's probably more

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:52.360
surprising, which is the fall of Slobodan
Miloševi? in Serbia.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:57.730
In October of 1998, 1998 evidently being a
very good year for the social cure, a group

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:02.860
of about eleven students at Belgrade University
started to meet to plan to get rid of Miloševi?.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:07.360
They called themselves "Otpor," which in Serbian
means "resistance." And they didn't do any

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.490
of the things that normal political movements
do.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:15.560
Otpor did not see its job as giving Serbs
information about how terrible the dictatorship

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:20.440
was. Serbs already knew that. It was their
lives. They were living it. Lack of information

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:27.029
was not the problem. Instead, these students
defined their task as motivating people to

00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:28.740
do something about it.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:34.390
Serbs under Miloševi? were fearful and passive.
They felt powerless. They thought of themselves

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:39.520
purely as victims. The challenge for Otpor
was how to overcome this mentality. How do

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.480
you get people out of their houses and into
the street?

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.570
They decided to try to motivate people by
providing them with a new group to join that

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:53.350
would allow them to think of themselves as
daring heroes, instead of as passive victims.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:58.420
They did it by making their movement the coolest
club to belong to. Like the students in Florida,

00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.420
they used pranks.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:04.090
They didn't use any speeches or marches. Instead,
their bread and butter was street theater.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:08.830
They adapted the sensibility of a TV show
they had all grown up watching, Monty Python's

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:13.900
Flying Circus. One of their most famous pranks
was to roll an oil drum down a major pedestrian

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:18.000
street in Belgrade, with Miloševi?'s picture
painted on the side.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.940
Serbs could insert a coin in the slot and
then could earn the privilege of taking a

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:26.980
bat and whacking the oil drum. The police
didn't know what to do about this. They couldn't

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.900
let it go. They couldn't permit people to
take a bat to the face of Miloševi?. But

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:35.520
when they arrested the barrel, because the
actual people had all fled, the government

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.520
looked ridiculous.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:42.950
Otpor also decided that it could use danger
to its advantage. When the organization realized

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:48.220
that its members were very likely to get arrested,
but that rarely were they arrested, even held

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:53.830
overnight, it decided to begin to provoke
arrest. Every time any of its members were

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:58.950
arrested, Otpor would gather other members,
lawyers, and opposition journalists, to gather

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.660
outside the police station.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:04.960
If they had to, the group would stay for hours,
making enough noise so the detainees inside

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.100
could hear them. The detainees would come
out of the police station two hours later,

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:13.590
or nine hours later, and be met by a crowd
of supporters. They'd give interviews to the

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.600
journalists and then go tell their stories
over beer.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:21.340
The effect of this was that young men started
to compete to get arrested. I met a young

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:25.780
man in the city of Novi Sad who had a competition
with another Otpor member there. He had been

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:32.430
arrested at least 17 times. "You are a kid
in the countryside," said Vesna Dozet, who

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:34.520
was Otpor's Belgrade office manager.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:39.310
"Your parents are unhappy. They have no work
and no money and they're getting drunk. Then

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:43.540
you join Otpor. You are still some kid from
nowhere, but now they've given you a cell

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:48.290
phone. It's your job to go to the bus station
and give a code to the driver to pick up a

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.720
package of posters from Belgrade.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.870
Then you spirit it away and give it to your
friends and they put up the posters during

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:59.710
the night. Young people become partisans.
You were never a part of anything and all

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:04.000
of a sudden, you feel that you're a part of
something." Life under Miloševi? was very

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.070
boring.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:11.440
Otpor allowed people to become their own James
Bond. Using pranks like these, and the coolest

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:17.130
black t-shirts and great design, Otpor grew.
In October 1998, the group started with eleven

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:22.520
members. Two years later, it had at least
70,000. People were joining so fast that Otpor

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.120
couldn't register them all.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:29.810
And Miloševi? fell. This was not Otpor's
victory alone by any means. But it provided

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:35.300
Serbia with a crucial model of nonviolent
discipline and the ground troops of the revolution.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:42.620
Most important, it broke the country's fear.
So, here are two examples: one is a program

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:48.920
run by the Department of Health in Florida
that aims to change personal behaviors; the

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.050
other was run by an underground political
movement and aimed to build national political

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:58.230
activism in Serbia to topple the dictator.
These two examples are about as different

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:04.360
as they can be in almost every way, but they
are at bottom the same idea. They work because

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:10.350
they appeal to what motivates us the most,
our desire to belong. We crave the respect

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:14.940
of our peers and a connection to the group.
Whatever the prevailing social norm of the

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.980
group is, we tend to follow it.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:21.610
If we are uncomfortable following it, we will
often change groups in order to find one that

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:27.740
we are comfortable with. Both the anti-smoking
campaign and Otpor gave kids a new group to

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:34.550
belong to and a new activity that made them
feel respected and feel admired.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:39.130
Our willingness to change our lives in order
to win peer approval is greater in some groups

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:44.220
than in others. For teenagers for example,
the respect of peers is as important as food

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:50.440
and oxygen. For soldiers, well, think about
this for a minute. Armies have always run

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:55.240
on young men drafted to fight for a cause
that they may not fully understand and probably

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.750
don't consider their own, yet they will come
out of the safety of the fox hole to charge

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.410
up Hamburger Hill.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:07.130
Why will they do this? Everyone knows the
answer. They do it for their buddies. They

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:12.170
do not want to be seen as cowardly in their
buddy's eyes. They wanna be heroic. And because

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:18.010
their friends see them that way, they see
themselves that way. Another group of people

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:22.140
with whom the social cure works particularly
well is very poor people.

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:26.100
And I'm talking about the poorest people in
the world. The parts of the world that face

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:30.190
the greatest problems are also the parts of
the world that have the fewest resources to

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:34.730
be able to deal with them. People who live
in rural villages in the Third World, for

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:39.370
example, don't have the financial capital
to spend money to solve social problems.

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:43.290
Because they don't get good health care or
good education, they also tend to lack the

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:49.810
necessary human capital as well. But one kind
of capital they have in abundance is social

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:55.001
capital, their bonds with each other. Poor
people usually have far more of this in fact

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:56.001
than wealthier people.

00:13:56.001 --> 00:14:00.860
Middle-class Americans are particularly lacking
in social capital. We can thank the American

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:05.690
dream of the big house in the suburbs, car
commuting, and the family swing set in the

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:09.949
backyard that's used by only our children.
It has been a part of the American dream since

00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:14.880
the 1950s to structure your life so you see
the fewest amount of other human beings.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:19.880
But for those living in rural villages or
urban slums, other human beings are often

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:26.180
all they have. To see what a crucial resource
social capital can be, we need look no further

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:32.760
than what has been the most important idea
in development in the last 40 years, microcredit.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:37.440
Let's go back to the 1970s and look at what
Muhammad Yunus did in Bangladesh with Grameen

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:43.740
Bank. Yunus did not invent the idea of tiny
loans to tiny entrepreneurs. Other groups,

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:48.390
for example Axion in Brazil, were already
doing this although I'm sure Yunus didn't

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:50.191
about it at the time.

00:14:50.191 --> 00:14:55.070
The genius of what Yunus did was not to invent
micro credit, but to figure out how to use

00:14:55.070 --> 00:15:01.560
it on an enormous scale. Now why wouldn't
banks lend money to destitute women in villages?

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:06.490
It would never had occurred to banks to do
so, mainly for two reasons. First of all,

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:09.890
these women had nothing that banks would ever
consider collateral.

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:14.580
And second of all, the transaction costs of
determining each borrower's credit worthiness

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:18.760
would have been an astronomical percentage
of the tiny loans that the banks were going

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:25.720
to give them. What Yunus did was figure out
that the women did have collateral and he

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.910
found a way to shift the transaction cost
of determining credit worthiness from the

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:33.250
shoulders of the banks onto the shoulders
of the borrowers themselves.

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:39.040
What was the most valuable thing these women
had? Their social standing in the village.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:44.490
Grameen used this. It formed women into groups
of borrowers, say five people in a group.

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:49.850
Initially, Grameen operated under the principle
of joint liability. If one person in the group

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:54.050
did not repay a loan, then no one else in
the group could get another one.

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:59.190
But Grameen gradually stopped enforcing the
rule of joint liability. And in the year 2001,

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:04.610
it did away with it entirely. Joint liability
proved not to be necessary. The risk of losing

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:09.940
social standing and the respect of their peers
was enough to keep women repaying their loans.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:14.500
So Grameen and other micro lenders did not
have to worry about identifying collateral

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:20.120
or determining credit worthiness. Peer pressure
did that job for them. This made giving out

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:26.730
huge numbers of loans cost effective. Peer
pressure is what makes micro credit work.

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:31.160
Peer pressure has also been used in other
ways to solve the problems of the rural poor.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:36.290
Forty years ago, in the eastern part of Maharashtra
state in India, a husband and wife pair of

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:41.850
Indian doctors decided to try to do something
to improve rural village health.

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:46.600
The project, which is called the Comprehensive
Rural Health Project in the city of Jamkhed,

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.510
has become one of the most successful and
long-lasting community health worker programs

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:57.030
in the world. It has greatly improved many
aspects of life in the villages where it works.

00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:01.600
It has brought better health, but also has
made people more prosperous and helped to

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:08.490
soften the caste system.
[pause]

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:13.120
The pair of doctors, whose names were Raj
and Mabelle Arole, realized that they could

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:17.510
not recruit doctors to go to rural villages.
Doctors simply would not stay.

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:22.410
They tried for nurses. And they found that
nurses wouldn't stay either. Next, they decided

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:28.630
to use auxiliary nurses, who are younger women
with less training than nurses. One day in

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:34.050
1971, Raj Arole was visiting the village of
Saket, where Jamkhed had an auxiliary nurse.

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:39.120
The nurse was very good at curing illnesses,
but she had not been able to convince villagers

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:44.450
to change their ways in order to prevent disease.
Prevention is the very foundation of rural

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:49.650
health: boiling water, breastfeeding, improving
the variety of foods that mothers give their

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:54.550
children, vaccinations, eliminating standing
water, disposing of waste.

00:17:54.550 --> 00:18:00.500
These are the important things and these require
behavior change. The mayor of Saket told Arole

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:04.720
that the problem was the nurse was too foreign
and too young. She had no children of her

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.410
own and therefore, had little credibility
with village mothers.

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:12.960
Then the mayor mentioned a woman from a nearby
village, named Mrs. Jashabi, who was employed

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.630
by the government as a promoter of family
planning. When he watched her work, the mayor

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:23.070
said, he marveled at her ability to connect
with and explain things to village women.

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:28.700
Part of the reason, he said, is that she was
one of them. Mrs. Jashabi had only gone to

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:35.340
school for four years. It suddenly occurred
to the Aroles that instead of being a handicap,

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:41.440
perhaps her lack of education was an advantage.
Mrs. Jashabi understood how to reach the people

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.760
who most needed reaching, illiterate poor
village women.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:49.490
She knew how they thought and lived, because
she was one of them. The Aroles then made

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:54.040
a very curious decision. They would go completely
in the opposite direction from doctors and

00:18:54.040 --> 00:19:00.030
nurses. They asked villages to choose a woman
from each village who was capable and intelligent,

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:02.150
but who was completely downtrodden.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:07.660
They chose women who were largely illiterate,
destitute, married with children. One woman

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:11.510
I met had been married at the age of two and
a half. And all of the women I met had been

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:17.860
married by 13. Most were from the untouchable,
or Dalit, caste. Some were even cured leprosy

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.230
patients, women whose fingers were still mangled.

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:25.170
The Aroles reasoned that these were the women
who would care most about the health of the

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:30.610
poorest of the poor. The Aroles found that
training the women in the skills they needed

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:35.280
was not hard to do. The hard part was giving
these women confidence, the confidence to

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.890
speak up and to believe they had something
important to say to their fellow villagers.

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:44.770
Remember, these were women who traditionally
had to walk with a little broom to erase their

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:53.520
footprints as they walked lest others be contaminated
by them. The solution was peer pressure. Each

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.620
new trainee was sent to the village of a more
experienced community health worker.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:01.720
There, she could see the woman who started
out just like herself had become bold and

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:06.340
assertive. She could see that it could be
done. After the initial training, the women

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:11.370
came back to the main campus of Jamkhed every
Tuesday to stay overnight. They study a new

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:15.710
health topic every week, but probably more
important, they renew their bonds with the

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:19.530
sisterhood of community health workers.

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:23.440
The Jamkhed villages that I visited look like
they're from a different century than the

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:28.810
villages nearby. Indian statistics have long
shown that Jamkhed villages are far healthier

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:33.490
than their neighbors. I attended one of the
Tuesday meetings of Jamkhed and I asked the

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:38.110
health workers, "What are the biggest health
problems in your villages?"

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:44.640
The three they mentioned were diabetes, arthritis,
and hypertension. These are rich country diseases.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:49.400
Only the luckiest die of such illnesses in
rural India. But in villages in the Jahmked

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:53.430
program, there is no more malaria, no more
active leprosy and tuberculosis, very little

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:54.550
diarrhea.

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:58.880
Women no longer die in childbirth. Birth weights
have risen because pregnant women know what

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.930
to eat and there's no more nonsense about
starving them. Jamkhed villages have clean

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:07.620
water, drainage systems for eliminating standing
waste water. They have planted millions of

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:14.290
trees and have gardens, so they can eat spinach
and papaya with their sorghum bread.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:19.110
This model is particularly interesting because
of its potential to do things that go beyond

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:24.690
the provision of health. It could be aimed
at bringing other kinds of services to rural

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:29.240
areas of poor countries that lack them. I
could imagine, for example, how village men

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:33.840
might be trained as agricultural extension
agents to bring improved farming practices

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.250
to their villages.

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:39.160
Or, and this could be the most important thing
they could do, they could start chapters of

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:45.130
Alcoholics Anonymous. People could be trained
to bring social norms to their villages that

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:49.660
express the modern world. For example, better
treatment of girl children, ending abuses

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.190
of brides and reducing domestic violence.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:57.130
They could learn to help their fellow villagers
to start small businesses and get loans. In

00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:02.960
all these cases, the best people to spread
credible messages in villages are the villagers

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:09.860
themselves. And the best teachers for them
are their peers in the program. If you had

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:15.110
asked me a few years ago to name a way that
peer pressure could be used for positive ends,

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:20.290
I might have said "Alcoholics Anonymous" and
not been able to think of anything else.

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:26.900
Now I see it everywhere and I see potential
uses for it everywhere. It's obvious, I think,

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:32.150
how the social cure can be used in intimate
struggles of addiction or temptation. But

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:38.400
some of these very personal battles now have
national implication. Take health care for

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.400
example.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:44.820
One of the most expensive problems in health
care in America is also one of the most ignored.

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:50.000
And that is poor treatment adherence. Simply
put, we are very bad at doing what doctors

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.740
tell us to do. We have trouble taking our
medicines correctly or on time, even when

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:58.100
those pills are making a difference between
life and death.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:04.130
We have even more trouble adopting healthy
habits, like eating better or exercising more.

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:08.400
Doctors are very uncomfortable dealing with
adherence and most of them don't deal with

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:13.970
it. Some of them just fire patients who don't
follow advice. Yet, this is a problem that

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:18.730
is costing us billions of dollars a year and
is responsible for untold amounts of sickness

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:19.730
and death.

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:24.920
The looming disaster of diabetes in America
is really going to be an adherence problem.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:31.320
We need to deal with adherence and so far,
not much we have done had proven to work.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:36.470
There is, however, proven strategy and it
is in widespread use around the globe, practically

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:38.790
everywhere but in the United States.

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:44.230
It is called DOTS, which stands for Directly
Observed Treatment Short Course. The short

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:48.820
course is a misnomer because DOTS was invented
to help tuberculosis patients complete a six

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:55.070
month course of treatment, which is not short.
Without DOTS, many TB patients stop taking

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:58.980
their pills before they were cured because
they didn't like the side effects, because

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:04.050
their lives were chaotic, or simply because
they started to feel better.

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:09.130
DOTS does something very simple. It provides
TB patients with a buddy, a friend, a family

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:14.060
member, or a health care worker, who comes
to the patients house every day to watch the

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:19.640
patient take her pills. It is a very cheap
strategy. In fact, it is often free. And it

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.640
works.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.770
People who otherwise don't take their pills
will do so when someone comes to their house

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:29.809
to support them and hold them accountable.
When DOTS arrived in Ukraine, the cure rate

00:24:29.809 --> 00:24:36.820
for tuberculosis rose from 57%to 81%. When
DOTS arrived in China, the cure rate in DOTS

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:40.260
areas went from 50% to 94%.

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:44.880
It is now the world standard for treating
tuberculosis. And creative organizations,

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:49.510
such as Partners in Health, are using DOTS
to help treat other diseases as well. For

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:56.970
example, to help patients take their AIDS
medicines on time. Why don't we use DOTS in

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:58.620
America?

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:03.450
We give people bottles of pills with "take
with food" on them. Why don't they also say

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:09.340
"take with spouse," or "take with child?"
A seven-year old would love this job. Some

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:13.770
people are starting to do this. Partners in
Health in Boston is using DOTS to help its

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:18.600
most difficult patients, the emergency room
frequent flyers, stick to their treatment

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.600
plans.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.880
And it is working. These patients are healthier
and they're saving a lot of money because

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:30.190
they spend a lot less time in the hospital.
The story of Otpor is the clearest illustration

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:34.900
of the versatility of the social cure, of
the variety of social problems that it might

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:35.900
be able to attack.

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:41.860
This story is not just a Serbian story as
a group of former Otpor leaders are now travelling

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:46.780
the world training democracy movements. Their
first successes came with training the leaders

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:50.679
of the Rose Revolution in Georgia, and the
Orange Revolution in Ukraine.

00:25:50.679 --> 00:25:55.090
And they have gone on now to train democracy
activists from nearly 40 countries around

00:25:55.090 --> 00:26:00.360
the world. One group the Otpor leaders trained
was Egypt's April 6th Movement. And many of

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:05.960
the tactics that we could see in Tahrir Square
came directly from Otpor.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:11.190
But the potential uses of the social cure
are broader than toppling dictatorship. Think

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:18.050
for a minute about what it was that Otpor
was aiming to create in Serbia. Democracy

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:23.300
wasn't their direct product. That was only
their indirect aim. What Otpor aimed to do

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.679
was to create protagonists.

00:26:25.679 --> 00:26:30.590
It created activists, people who were willing
to abandon their couches and go out into the

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:35.470
street and take risks until they had accomplished
their goal. That goal happened to be getting

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:40.380
rid of Slobodan Miloševi?. But it could've
been many other things. They could have aimed

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:46.320
instead at saving Darfur, or reducing climate
change, or fighting corruption.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:50.800
I do wanna be cautious here. It is easier
in some ways to mobilize people in life or

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:56.290
death situations than to accomplish more ordinary
political change among comfortable middle-class

00:26:56.290 --> 00:27:01.920
people in a democracy. But there are ways
that the social cure can create catalysts

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.000
for other goals.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.211
I don't have to tell you how important the
ability to mobilize people can be.

00:27:07.211 --> 00:27:15.160
[pause]
I want to briefly mention one of the most

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:20.540
intriguing examples of the uses of the social
cure that I have found. And that is its potential

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:26.260
use in fighting terrorism. First, a little
background.

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:31.860
Why do people join cults? It is largely due
to peer pressure. This has been studied over

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:37.840
and over again. Young men joined gangs, for
example, because their friends do. It is almost

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:42.650
entirely because their friends do. The same
is true with cults. This has been studied

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:45.809
with the Baader-Meinhof Gang, the Moonies
and other groups.

00:27:45.809 --> 00:27:49.900
People do not fall in with a cult because
they're interested in the cult's ideas. It

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:54.770
works the other way around. You meet someone
who brings you into the group. That group

00:27:54.770 --> 00:28:00.140
is so strong, so cohesive, attractive and
persuasive, that gradually you start becoming

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:03.200
alienated from everyone else who thinks differently.

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:08.200
Your social circle starts to narrow to the
group itself. You exist in a cocoon. This

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:13.670
is classic group dynamics theory. There is
a persuasive argument that Islamic terrorism

00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:19.950
works the same way. Marc Sageman, who was
a forensic psychiatrist and former CIA agent,

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:25.679
who has studied who become a Jihadi, concludes
that the vast majority of young men who become

00:28:25.679 --> 00:28:29.720
terrorists get radicalized far from their
roots.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:34.630
They are, for example, from Morocco or Egypt,
attending University in Europe. Or, they may

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:40.100
be European-born to immigrant families. The
powerful social norms of their communities

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:45.360
are far away. Adrift with no anchor, they
fall in with the radical group. The vicious

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.210
circle of the group dynamic radicalizes them
further.

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:55.010
Soon, one of the members makes contact with
Al-Qaida or goes to work on his own. Now what

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:59.850
if that vicious circle could instead become
a virtuous circle? If negative peer pressure

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:04.850
is so important in radicalizing young men,
perhaps positive peer pressure can steer them

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:07.710
down a different path.

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:12.040
In a rough neighborhood of South London, there
is a place that tries to do just this. It

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:18.070
is a group called STREET, which stands for
Strategy To Reach, Empower, and Educate Teens.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:22.720
It was founded by an extraordinary man named
Abdul Haqq Baker, who was the former chairman

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.670
of the local mosque, which is called the Brixton
Mosque.

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:31.080
Baker is a Londoner, born to Nigerian and
Ghanese parents. He converted to Islam from

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:36.210
Catholicism in his early 20s. He's also a
PhD in Political Science from the University

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:42.660
of Exeter. His dissertation was about how
convert communities can work to prevent terrorism.

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:47.500
The mosque serves a largely Afro-Caribbean,
largely convert population. And many of those

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:52.970
who are not converts immigrated to Britain
from other countries. Among its worshippers

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:58.830
were Zacarias Moussaoui, the 20th hijacker,
and Richard Reid, the shoe-bomber.

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:04.679
But neither of those men was radicalized at
the Brixton Mosque. The mosque is Salafi.

00:30:04.679 --> 00:30:10.360
It is fundamentalist, hardline, but absolutely
non-violent. Reid left the mosque because

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:15.190
he was dissatisfied with its non-violence.
Moussaoui was kicked out for his aggressive

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:16.190
views.

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:21.610
When these two men dropped out of sight, only
to surface later committing acts of terror,

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:25.429
Baker realized that he needed more than a
mosque. He needed a place where the people

00:30:25.429 --> 00:30:31.059
who were most at risk for radicalization would
go if he wanted to do something about Islamic

00:30:31.059 --> 00:30:32.059
violence.

00:30:32.059 --> 00:30:38.410
So, he started STREET. STREET, in some ways,
is a traditional anti-gang organization. It

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:43.559
offers its clients soccer, boxing, a place
to hang out, and it can hook them up with

00:30:43.559 --> 00:30:48.630
job training or schooling. Many of its clients
come straight from prison. And it has been

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:53.740
the destination of choice for London probation,
for Muslim offenders who were paroled and

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:56.340
considered susceptible to terrorist messages.

00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:04.300
But what sets STREET apart from other anti-gang
initiatives, is that it has a de-radicalization

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:10.690
unit. If a client mentions a particular Al-Qaida
video, or a radical tract, the staff members,

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:15.240
most of whom are also fundamentalist Salafi's,
will watch it or read it with the client.

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:19.850
They point out the Islamic fallacies and just
as important, they point out the propaganda

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:25.540
techniques that that video or tract is using.
They show the clients how they are being manipulated,

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:32.429
just like teenagers in Florida. STREET's motto
is "For you, from people like you."

00:31:32.429 --> 00:31:37.350
The idea is that the staff should mirror the
client to the greatest extent possible. Many

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:41.740
of the staff, in fact, were clients. They
share the client's hardline views and they

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:47.020
share the client's grievances. They have street
cred. Where they part ways is at the last

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.020
step.

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:52.020
They do not believe that Islam is in a war
with the West. They do not believe that violence

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:57.240
is the response. They seek to give young men
who were tempted by terrorism, a new peer

00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:06.690
group of people who are like them in every
way but one. Does this work?

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:12.950
Well, we don't know for sure. It is hard to
prove a negative, terrorist incidences averted.

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:17.530
Baker will also not talk about specific cases.
He feels his first commitment is to his clients

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:21.490
and they would consider it a betrayal for
him to use their stories.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:25.720
But I have talked to the people who work with
STREET in official Britain, including probation

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:31.540
officers, who thought the group was very effective.
London probation was actually trying to enlarge

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:36.620
STREET so it could take more and more of the
young men coming out of prison.

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:40.490
Now we will never know if STREET is effective.
The new coalition in government in Britain

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:45.640
decided it could not work with Salafi groups
and so, it has cut off STREET's funding. The

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:49.780
government did not understand that holding
fundamentalist, religious views is a very

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:54.460
different thing than espousing violence, and
that people who hold these views may be the

00:32:54.460 --> 00:33:02.230
very people who are most effective at preventing
young men from falling into terror.

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:06.750
It is logical, really, that peer pressure
can get us out of so many bad situations,

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:11.850
because peer pressure is what gets us into
them in the first place. If you knock on doors

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:16.700
in housing projects in poor neighborhoods
in America and ask mothers and grandmothers

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:21.470
what it is that they're most afraid of, chances
are they will say that it's peer pressure.

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:28.660
"My son is a good boy," the mother will tell
you. "But he runs with a bad crowd." Peer

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:33.470
pressure helps fill prisons. It keeps emergency
rooms busy treating high school students who

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:37.530
can't tell a friend that he's too drunk to
drive, and young men who must maintain the

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:42.429
respect of their group by answering every
perceived slight with violence.

00:33:42.429 --> 00:33:46.630
Peer pressure crowds bankruptcy courts with
people who did nothing wrong other than want

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:54.679
to buy what others already had. The smoker,
dying of lung cancer at 75, sixty years after

00:33:54.679 --> 00:33:59.240
he smoked his first cigarette has something
in common with the woman dying of AIDS at

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.830
the age of 25.

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:08.899
In a sense, they're both dying of peer pressure.
We are all good boys at risk of the bad crowd.

00:34:08.899 --> 00:34:13.300
Peer pressure is a mighty and terrible force,
so powerful that for the vast majority of

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:17.889
people, the best antidote to it is more peer
pressure. There are many different stories

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:22.960
of salvation in my book, of people weighing
babies together, doing math problems, playing

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:28.329
soccer, making prank phone calls, getting
arrested or sharing pot luck suppers.

00:34:28.329 --> 00:34:33.869
A lifeline can take many different forms.
What matters is that at the other end, someone's

00:34:33.869 --> 00:34:38.799
hand is there. Thank you very much.

00:34:38.799 --> 00:34:40.039
[applause]

00:34:40.039 --> 00:34:51.169
Now I'm pleased to take any comments or questions.

00:34:51.169 --> 00:34:52.409
[pause]

00:34:52.409 --> 00:35:04.619
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Thank you for speaking
today. And my question has to do with social

00:35:04.619 --> 00:35:06.470
media. We're a technology company--

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:07.470
&gt;&gt;Tina Rosenberg: I noticed.

00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:12.460
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: [chuckle] and I
curious if you've seen any examples of positive

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:16.239
peer pressure using social media or if you
envision anything like that happening?

00:35:16.239 --> 00:35:22.520
&gt;&gt;Tina Rosenberg: That's a very good question.
And as I was working on the book, I was thinking

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:30.369
very carefully about this. And the answer
is I don't think so yet. I may be proved wrong

00:35:30.369 --> 00:35:32.950
about this, and I'll be happy to be proved
wrong.

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:37.589
It's a bit complicated. There's certainly
examples of social media alone, being able

00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:42.570
to exert negative peer pressure on people.
For example, Islamic chat groups over the

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:47.259
internet that are a very powerful force. that
can be a very powerful force in radicalizing

00:35:47.259 --> 00:35:52.390
young men, even without having other people
face to face with them.

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:58.170
The chat group serves as a substitute social
group. And then we have the example that you

00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:03.240
see most strongly in Japan of suicide groups
that meet over the internet and radicalize

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:09.650
each other, get each other, increase the acceptability
of suicide as a social norm, by belonging

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:13.619
to this internet chat group where everybody
is there precisely because they're interested

00:36:13.619 --> 00:36:16.119
in committing suicide.

00:36:16.119 --> 00:36:23.220
But I have yet to see really good examples
of it working in the other direction. I think

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:29.660
social media can be very useful to helping
to support a social cure because it's a very

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:33.690
good way to communicate with your membership.
It's a very efficient way to tell people what's

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:35.569
going on.

00:36:35.569 --> 00:36:40.720
For example, in Egypt, this was used quite
a bit. The face group, the famous face group

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:45.869
of April 6 Movement was very useful to tell
people about what was happening. But the revolution

00:36:45.869 --> 00:36:49.440
didn't happen online. The revolution happened
because they were excellent at organizing

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.069
in the street.

00:36:51.069 --> 00:36:55.941
The other thing social media can do is it
can help you learn. It's a very good way,

00:36:55.941 --> 00:37:00.960
especially if you live, for example, in a
repressive country, to be able to find out

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:04.200
about the experiences of other people who
have used this.

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:10.160
And Otpor, for example, has found that their
books and pamphlets and materials, which are

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:15.009
translated into all sorts of different languages,
are very, very frequently downloaded in countries

00:37:15.009 --> 00:37:20.849
like Iran and other places where they might
not have other ways of learning about how

00:37:20.849 --> 00:37:22.680
to effectively do a revolution.

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:29.369
But the question is can it be in itself a
social cure? There is some evidence that in

00:37:29.369 --> 00:37:36.470
health, you can have an internet buddy and
it helps you. For example, there are experiments

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:41.109
that set up a person with diabetes with another
person with diabetes. And they never meet,

00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:45.720
but they check in with each other over the
internet a couple times a day, perhaps.

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:50.069
Have you taken your walk today? Are you having
any problems with these medications? Yes,

00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:55.670
I had the same problem. And that can be useful
in helping people to adhere better to their

00:37:55.670 --> 00:38:00.940
treatment plan. But the evidence so far is
that it doesn't work as well as a face to

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:03.369
face program.

00:38:03.369 --> 00:38:06.200
However, we have to take into account that
there are an awful lot of people who just

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:10.650
aren't gonna get to a face to face program,
but they will sit down at their computer every

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:15.329
day. In fact, they're doing that anyway. So,
let's not let the perfect be the enemy of

00:38:15.329 --> 00:38:16.329
the good.

00:38:16.329 --> 00:38:20.309
I think if these programs can reach people
that otherwise can't be reached by face to

00:38:20.309 --> 00:38:25.890
face programs, then yes. I think they can
be useful but not quite as useful as the real

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:26.890
human touch.

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:30.660
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Thank you.

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:32.579
&gt;&gt;Tina Rosenberg: Mm-hmm.

00:38:32.579 --> 00:38:42.799
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: I'll just talk
out loud. But if we're all good boys, using

00:38:42.799 --> 00:38:47.318
your term, why does it seem like the negative
influences of peer pressure are so much more

00:38:47.318 --> 00:38:48.318
pervasive than the positive examples?

00:38:48.318 --> 00:38:49.318
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: Can you repeat it?

00:38:49.318 --> 00:38:50.509
&gt;&gt;Tina Rosenberg: The question was, if we're
all good boys, why are the negative forces

00:38:50.509 --> 00:38:54.700
of peer pressure, why do they seem to be more
pervasive than the positive forces?

00:38:54.700 --> 00:39:00.039
Well, there's several reasons. First of all,
like I said in my opening example of the talk,

00:39:00.039 --> 00:39:04.140
when it's positive we don't think of it as
peer pressure. We think of it as us. My kids

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:07.829
are doing great in school. I don't think it's
because they're running with a great crowd.

00:39:07.829 --> 00:39:11.729
I think it's 'cause I have great kids, or
I'm a great parent.

00:39:11.729 --> 00:39:16.440
So, you tend to discount it. The negative
part, you look for what the bad influences

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:22.410
are. So, I think that's part of it. I think
the other part is that we tend not to notice

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:28.599
positive peer pressure so much because that's
the expectation we have of our lives. And

00:39:28.599 --> 00:39:31.269
the news is when you get the negative part.

00:39:31.269 --> 00:39:36.500
And there's a third reason, which is that
for teenagers, and often peer pressure is

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:42.299
really talked of in terms of teenagers, the
negative forces can be more powerful for biological

00:39:42.299 --> 00:39:46.680
reasons. I mean, teenagerdom is when you're
supposed to be rebelling against your parents

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:50.319
and it's also a time when your brain is not
fully formed and mature.

00:39:50.319 --> 00:39:54.190
And the last part of your brain to mature
is the part that regulates judgment, which

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:59.680
is a fact no parent would ever have any doubt
about. So, I think teenagers are particularly

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:03.859
susceptible to negative peer pressure and
it might be a little harder to do the positive

00:40:03.859 --> 00:40:04.859
part with them.

00:40:04.859 --> 00:40:10.089
But for adults, I don't think it is. I think
you can really find that for adults, positive

00:40:10.089 --> 00:40:15.519
peer pressure can be even more powerful than
the negative. Yes.

00:40:15.519 --> 00:40:21.170
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: It's a question
about children. So, I have a seven-year old

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:27.690
and I can see how he's susceptible to peer
pressure. And the question is what I should

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:33.720
nurture, like independent mind-set on him
while I still can, or it's not gonna happen.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:34.800
[Tina Rosenberg laughs]

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:41.180
&gt;&gt;Tina Rosenberg: Is it a lost cause? My response
to that is what you do probably has very little

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:45.480
effect in either direction unfortunately.
Parents, we like to think that we can have

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:49.140
a lot of influence over our kids, but I'm
not really sure that that's true.

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:54.019
I think, however, that if there's one important
thing you can do for your child it is steering

00:40:54.019 --> 00:40:58.680
him towards a peer group that is a healthy
one. And how do you do that? I mean, you obviously

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:04.339
cannot choose your child's friends, but you
can introduce your child to different clubs,

00:41:04.339 --> 00:41:08.779
to different activities that he might like,
to different groups of kids that he might

00:41:08.779 --> 00:41:09.779
like.

00:41:09.779 --> 00:41:14.401
And gradually, that kid will start making
friends in those groups. In my opinion, that's

00:41:14.401 --> 00:41:16.619
the most useful thing a parent can do.

00:41:16.619 --> 00:41:18.790
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: Thank you.

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:25.140
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: I was just wondering
if the research you've done affects your opinion

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:31.420
of culture, which is maybe peer pressure on
a larger scale and maybe the usefulness, or

00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:32.420
uselessness of it.

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:36.789
&gt;&gt;Tina Rosenberg: That's a good question.
I mean, what is culture? And in the book,

00:41:36.789 --> 00:41:41.839
I define it as however a group expresses its
groupness. What are the rituals and things

00:41:41.839 --> 00:41:47.890
that a group does that set us apart from people
outside the group? And it's value-neutral.

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:52.410
I mean, culture isn't a good thing or a bad
thing. And I think it's also something that's

00:41:52.410 --> 00:42:00.569
invisible from within. For example, if I were
a professional woman in Minnesota, I might

00:42:00.569 --> 00:42:08.009
be wearing no make-up to work, a long skirt,
big chunky square glasses, big chunky square-heeled

00:42:08.009 --> 00:42:10.359
shoes, and that would be perfectly normal.

00:42:10.359 --> 00:42:14.979
If I were a professional woman in Caracas,
Venezuela, I would dress quite differently.

00:42:14.979 --> 00:42:23.079
I would wear false eyelashes. I would wear
a tube top that shows prominently the results

00:42:23.079 --> 00:42:27.069
of my breast enlargement surgery, a short
skirt and high heels. And I would think that

00:42:27.069 --> 00:42:28.069
was perfectly normal.

00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:32.690
And if I saw the woman from Minnesota, I would
think, "What are you thinking?" And vice versa.

00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:38.589
But we cannot see that from inside. You only
see, you only consider it to be culture when

00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:40.769
it's someone else you're looking at.

00:42:40.769 --> 00:42:48.380
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: Culture and this
whole group thing, humans are very social

00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:52.779
creatures and it's one of the things that
kinda defines us. And I feel actually, I worked

00:42:52.779 --> 00:42:56.160
in Human Social Behavior prior to coming to
Google.

00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:01.289
And this whole thing of positive peer pressure,
it seems like it's been part of us since the

00:43:01.289 --> 00:43:05.240
beginning. It actually seems like it's something
that evolved for us, evolved to make things

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:06.240
better.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.240
&gt;&gt;Tina Rosenberg: I think that's right.

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.509
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: It's something
that has been positive from the start. And

00:43:09.509 --> 00:43:15.249
I think it's good that you're reminding us
of us. Many people seem to be unaware of that.

00:43:15.249 --> 00:43:17.200
This is something that helps us a lot.

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.170
&gt;&gt;Tina Rosenberg: I think you're right. I
think it's part of our evolutionary structure

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:24.450
because it used to be that our groups were
our family, extended family. And so, if you

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:26.759
were nice to your group, your genes would
have a much better chance of being passed

00:43:26.759 --> 00:43:27.759
down.

00:43:27.759 --> 00:43:34.670
And we retain that. I do think that on the
positive side, there is resurgence in the

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:39.680
United States of the idea that we need to
be around other humans. And you see it in

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:46.369
many ways. For example, in real estate prices
the traditional suburbs that require a car

00:43:46.369 --> 00:43:51.400
and have no walkability, have no town center,
the price per square foot of land in those

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:56.349
suburbs is dropping, where the price per square
foot of land in new walkable suburbs, or cities,

00:43:56.349 --> 00:43:57.460
is rising.

00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:03.680
And part of that is oil prices. But part of
it is this feeling that I think is very strong

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:09.849
among young people that we don't wanna be
isolated anymore. We really want to have contact

00:44:09.849 --> 00:44:14.249
with other people and we need that. And it's
part of what keeps us healthy. There's a lot

00:44:14.249 --> 00:44:18.950
of research that shows that our social bonds
are something that help to maintain our health

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:19.950
for us.

00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:26.700
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: There's one other
thing I wanna discuss. You mentioned how we

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:32.390
have social capital and it's more prevalent
in poor people than middle-class or rich people.

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:38.269
And do you think there's, I think this is
completely tied to people's happiness. I notice

00:44:38.269 --> 00:44:42.229
most people who are middle-class or even rich,
don't tend to be very happy with what goes

00:44:42.229 --> 00:44:46.329
on in their life, while someone in some area
of the world, well, they're just doing simple

00:44:46.329 --> 00:44:49.390
things but have people around them to be very
happy.

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:54.099
Now do you think there's any way we can reach
out to maybe our supposed civilized world

00:44:54.099 --> 00:45:00.069
who think they're so high up and say, "Hey.
We've got the cure for happiness. It's right

00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:01.069
here within us."

00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:06.089
&gt;&gt;Tina Rosenberg: There's a lot of research
going on now about happiness this whole new

00:45:06.089 --> 00:45:11.380
branch of social science, happiness research.
And they find that actually income does not

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:13.009
determine happiness, you're right.

00:45:13.009 --> 00:45:18.730
It's not that poor people are happier, but
they're not considerably less happy than wealthier

00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:24.670
people as long as your basic needs are met.
If you're starving to death then you're not

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:30.289
gonna be as happy. So, I think there is a
lot to that. One very interesting piece of

00:45:30.289 --> 00:45:34.930
evidence is studies of people who win the
lottery.

00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:38.869
People who win the lottery don't generally
do very well afterwards. They tend to be much

00:45:38.869 --> 00:45:43.329
less happy. And there was a very interesting
study that compared the happiness levels of

00:45:43.329 --> 00:45:47.849
people who won the lottery to people who had
accidents that put them in a wheelchair for

00:45:47.849 --> 00:45:49.469
the rest of their lives.

00:45:49.469 --> 00:45:54.130
And they found that the people in the wheelchairs
were happier than the lottery winners. And

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:59.089
the speculation is that one reason for that
is lottery winners tend to buy a big mansion

00:45:59.089 --> 00:46:04.260
on the hill and isolate themselves. And they
also tend to get very suspicious of people

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:06.969
around them because all of a sudden everyone
wants a piece of them.

00:46:06.969 --> 00:46:12.339
So, winning the lottery can actually make
you less happy in part by isolating you from

00:46:12.339 --> 00:46:14.250
a social group.

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:16.589
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: One more question.

00:46:16.589 --> 00:46:17.589
&gt;&gt;Tina Rosenberg: Please.

00:46:17.589 --> 00:46:21.809
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: Besides social
media, do you see any role of technology that

00:46:21.809 --> 00:46:27.369
can augment peer pressure in positive ways?

00:46:27.369 --> 00:46:40.950
&gt;&gt;Tina Rosenberg: [pause] That's an interesting
question. I think that for many groups that

00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:49.319
form, it's obviously very important to have
technology to be able to communicate to their

00:46:49.319 --> 00:46:50.710
members.

00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:59.010
But social media and technology are platforms.
They're like sky writing or traveling minstrels

00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:04.789
or anything else. You can use them for good
or for bad. So, I would say that these are

00:47:04.789 --> 00:47:11.970
really value-neutral. And they can increase
our social bonds in some ways, but I think

00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:14.700
in some ways they also serve to decrease their
social bonds.

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:18.259
Witness the number of people walking down
the street now who are only looking down at

00:47:18.259 --> 00:47:26.150
their thumbs. We tend to do, to look less
at people around us. That's not a very original

00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:27.299
observation, but.

00:47:27.299 --> 00:47:29.711
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: Thank you.

00:47:29.711 --> 00:47:38.829
&gt;&gt;Tina Rosenberg: Thank you. Anyone else?
Thank you so much for coming today. It's been

00:47:38.829 --> 00:47:39.829
a pleasure.

00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:39.830
[applause]
