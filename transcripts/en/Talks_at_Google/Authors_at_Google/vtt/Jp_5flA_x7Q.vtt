&gt;&gt; Scott: On behalf of BGN and the Gayglers,
I welcome you to this at Google

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.100
presentation of None on Record.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.700
Today, our presenter is Selly Thiam.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.480
I'll just let her take over.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.980
Thank you.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:13.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:20.480
SELLY THIAM: Thank you, Scott, for having
me today.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.990
Can you guys hear me okay?

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.740
[PAUSE]

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.490
[hums]

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.740
Is this better?

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.490
[PAUSE]

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.240
Testing.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.240
Okay, there I am.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.000
Okay.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.700
So I'm actually going to tell you a little
bit about None on Record.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.300
None on Record is an audio-based oral history
project, and it started in 2006.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.070
And what we do as a team is we travel through
Diaspora communities in North America and

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.680
Europe, and also on the continent of Africa
to interview LGBT Africans.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.870
But before I get into kind of the specifics
of how None on Record began and what we actually

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.120
do, I have to actually play some of the voices
of the people that we've met along the way

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.470
in the last four years since we've been collecting
oral histories.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.690
So this is -- this is a brief cross-section
of some of the people that we've interviewed.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.940
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:17.690
&gt;&gt; A lot of us can't go home and be who we
are.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:25.400
And we are in exile in some way because of
that and that doesn't make any sense to us

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.770
as Africans.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.420
&gt;&gt; I couldn't walk to the shop without hearing
at least one person, some car going past 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.740
– going 'beep, beep'; 'Isn't that her?'

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.760
Yeah, bitch.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.060
We're going to get you; you're a woman.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.950
Faggot.
&gt;&gt; He said, you know you can go to the jail

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:42.290
for your life.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.390
I said if you bring me in jail for my life
gay, I accept it.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.610
&gt;&gt; I'm lesbian.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.700
I don't care what other people do behind closed
doors.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:58.700
It's, it's, it's their -- it's who they are
and this is who I am.

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.369
Let's, let's, let's love each other.

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.729
&gt;&gt; And immediately when we jump on stage and
grab that mic, we'll sing this song.

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.549
[SINGING]

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.350
And, the whole crowd would just jump and get
a standing ovation.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.590
And, you know, what this people, they know
who they are and they know where they stand.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.520
&gt;&gt; I'm disillusioned because I'm living in
South Africa, and there is so much that's

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.140
going wrong.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.910
There's so much that has been promised that
isn't happening.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.130
&gt;&gt; If they want me to go back to my country,
I will go back to my country.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:36.130
And I will still doing what I starts doing
before I came here because they're still killing

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.030
gay people, lesbian people, and it's getting
worse.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.950
&gt;&gt; You are nothing without the community.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.640
And we're responsible to the ancestors, where
we must respond to those -- and when I say

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.390
ancestors, they're not dead.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.349
They're alive and they're watching you.

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:57.130
&gt;&gt; I've had to sort of let go of the fact
that maybe I won't be on the family tree [laughs]

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.359
and that's okay.

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:07.359
&gt;&gt; But I'm African, I'm a lesbian, and I'm
an AIDS activist.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:11.370
[music ends]

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.540
SELLY THIAM: So None on Record began as a
documentary.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.270
I started collecting oral histories partly
because I am actually of Senegalese origin;

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.520
I was born here in the United States.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.360
And it, it began as a documentary, but what
has, what has become is a network of people

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.810
all over the world who are activists, who
are artists, who are organizers, who are none

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.730
of that who have gotten caught up in very
difficult situations and had to show extreme

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:36.129
bravery.

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:43.129
But to really sort of give you the background
and the context, I have to show you a picture

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.530
of this woman.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.870
This is Fanny Ann Eddy.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.560
She was a very prominent activist in Sierra
Leone.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.319
She was murdered in the offices of the Lesbian
and Gay Association in Freetown, Sierra Leone,

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.060
in 2004.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.360
She was murdered a few months after returning
from the UN, where she gave a speech about

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.560
the rights of queer Africans on the continent,
protecting the lives of queer Africans.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.060
She was murdered and the details of her murder
are very horrific.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.390
Her throat was cut.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.450
And she was raped.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.420
Her tongue was removed from her mouth.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.249
So in 2004, this hit the international news.

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:23.610
And an article was written, and it was published
in the Chicago LGBT newspaper.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.569
So when I saw the picture, this is actually
the picture I saw in the paper, this is the

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:29.900
first time I was actually seeing a West African
lesbian.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.469
And the impact of her murder and the -- the
symbolism of her murder within an African

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:38.330
context, had a profound impact on me.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.689
And I didn't have any journalism training
at the time.

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:42.370
I didn't know how to do any audio recording.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.770
I didn't know how to mix audio, but I knew
there was something that I wanted to do.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.719
And, when you sort of decide that there's
something you want to do, I think that, circumstance

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:54.259
of the universe creates a way.

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:58.939
And so, I met this woman Notisha Massaquoi,
who is also from Sierra Leone.

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:02.680
She was born in Sierra Leone, and she was
raised in Toronto, Canada.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.930
I went to a conference about violence in Third
World communities and she gave a speech about

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.650
a friend of hers who had been murdered in
Sierra Leone in the offices of the LGBT Association

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.169
there and happened to be Fanny Ann Eddy.

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.900
So when I returned to Chicago, I decided that
I would drive to Toronto and I would interview

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:20.509
this woman.

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:25.300
So she was very gracious and let me into her
home in Toronto.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.309
And this was the first interview that I took
for the None on Record project.

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:31.739
[PAUSE]

00:05:31.739 --> 00:05:38.739
&gt;&gt; NOTISHA MASSAQUOI(on audio tape): I was
very connected with Fanny Ann Eddy who founded

00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:41.229
the Sierra Leone Lesbian and Gay Association.

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:45.110
She did a lot of activist work internationally.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:51.279
She spoke at the UN about rights for queer
Africans across the continent.

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:58.279
And someone broke into the office of the organization
and stabbed her and mutilated her body, which

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:08.539
had such an enormous impact and really changed
my life.

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:15.539
I had to sit down and assess what was I doing
here in Canada with all of these privileges

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:19.759
and all of these rights.

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:23.889
In Canada, we could get married as gay people.

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:30.889
We have streets and bars and all kinds of
things that we can engage in without worrying

00:06:31.059 --> 00:06:33.279
about dying.

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:39.639
And she was in Sierra Leone doing this work,
knowing that she could go to jail just for

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:42.009
loving another woman.

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:46.699
I felt my silence enabled her to be murdered
in that way.

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:49.779
All of our silence enabled her to be murdered
in that way.

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:53.779
She was so out and so public and she was out
there by herself.

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:58.169
And if we were all out there to support us,
they'd have to kill all of us.

00:06:58.169 --> 00:06:59.229
You know what I mean?

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:02.659
Not just, okay, there's only one we can target,
let's get her.

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:08.710
It was at that point that I was just really,
really driven and committed to doing this

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.960
work.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:13.669
SELLY THIAM: Since then Notisha Massaquoi
actually has become our president of our board

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:19.559
of directors, but she was the first interview
that None on Record collected.

00:07:19.559 --> 00:07:25.139
And she was actually the first interview to
be broadcast on National Public Radio in 2007.

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:31.279
So it was kind of -- it's an important story
to me as a person who was born in Diaspora

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:34.860
because we both felt so disconnected from
what was going on the African continent.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.539
There wasn't a lot of information coming in
at the time about the organizing that was

00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:43.259
happening there, but there was a lot of organizing
happening there.

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:49.139
Since then more information has come, has
come to -- to the, to the forefront.

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:55.449
But we both at that moment, after the interview,
kind of before it even got put on Public Radio,

00:07:55.449 --> 00:07:59.809
knew that something was happening, that we
would be part of creating something.

00:07:59.809 --> 00:08:04.309
And so I came back to the States, shocked
myself by having it on Public Radio.

00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:05.899
She didn't really know what NPR was.

00:08:05.899 --> 00:08:10.619
Because of my youthful disposition she thought
it was a college radio station.

00:08:10.619 --> 00:08:16.610
So when her, when her interview was actually
broadcast her uncle called her from Chicago.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:20.319
So I mean I tried to explain what NPR was
but I should have probably used things like

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:22.979
CBC or something like that.

00:08:22.979 --> 00:08:25.779
Her uncle called her and he didn't get upset.

00:08:25.779 --> 00:08:32.779
He just said, "You really, you really portrayed
the family very well.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.940
And I was very proud of you to tell these
stories."

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.620
So that was, that was my first interview.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.220
And None on Record was born.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.830
So then I decided I wanted to find more queer
Africans.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:47.120
And I didn't know where any were besides Notisha.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:54.120
So I began to do Google searches, do different
kinds of research, and I came upon this person,

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.340
Nick Mwaluko.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:02.000
Nick actually was born in Tanzania and was
raised in Kenya.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.830
Nick also was born biologically female, and
since moving -- well, before moving to the

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:13.360
United States transitioned into becoming a
male but was living his life as a male in

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.560
Kenya.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:21.240
What actually happened was when he moved to
the States, the relationship between masculinity

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:26.660
for him in Kenya was very different than how
he was -- he wasn't seen as a man here.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:31.510
So he started to kind of have this reaction
that he wanted to be able to feel like he

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:32.740
was a man again.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:38.940
He also has a very interesting story because
he came to New York to, to study play writing

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.340
at Columbia University.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:41.660
He got an MFA in play writing.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:48.660
And he also wrote and directed a beautiful
play called 'Why Africa', about a Kenyan chief's

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.510
daughter who falls in love with a white Peace
Corps volunteer.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.640
And actually that's how I found Nick; I went
to see his play.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:59.310
And then sort of stalked him for awhile until
he gave me an interview.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:09:59.560
[laughs]

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.170
And he's an extremely private person, so I
was very surprised when he

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.070
invited him into his house in Washington Heights.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.830
So let's hear some of that story.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:11.160
&gt;&gt; Can you describe how to was to maneuver
as a man in Kenya?

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.970
&gt;&gt; NICK MWALUKO (on audio tape): There's certain
duties that you don't do if you're a man,

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:15.550
and certain friends.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:20.360
And you don't really, like, come up to a woman
and you're friends and you hang out together

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:20.610
in the village.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.590
You go to a woman for a specific reason --
 I mean it's for romantic reasons, do you

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.970
know?

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:25.300
So it was easy.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.490
I understood the zones.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:27.370
I understood the space.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:28.620
I understood how to conduct the space.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.090
I had trousers I wore.

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:31.880
I wore always an over vest.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.190
So I … you do what you do -- your hair is
short.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:35.490
You rarely talk.

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:41.200
You -- whenever you have a conversation, you
don't look the other guy in the eye.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.730
Sit with your legs apart.

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:44.390
There's like certain things you need to do.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:45.860
It's easy to perform it there.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.740
So there's new tactics, new strategies.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.570
And, and plus I had friends who showed me
the way.

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:55.110
A lot of them were very, very generous in
helping me navigate this.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:11:01.380
And they used to say, "You are my brother,
you are my son, you are my best friend who's

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.170
a guy."

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.230
And so there's like this is a mistake.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.220
And we're going to help you rectify the mistake.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.190
So I came to the States.

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:11.540
I didn't come specifically to transition,
but butches made it very difficult for me.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:11.860
[laughs]

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.339
&gt;&gt; SELLY: And describe that some.

00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:16.090
&gt;&gt; NICK: There, there -- where I grew up there
were no butches.

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:19.500
And so if somebody looked like me, they were
a boy.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.460
There was nothing to contrast, nothing to
compare with.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.850
So that was – so it was kind of easy.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:31.850
So I came to the States, and people were like,
"No, no. You're butch and you're that."

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.590
And I said, "Well no, I'm a man."

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:35.990
And I knew and when I made love with women,
I was a man.

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:41.690
&gt;&gt; SELLY: So when you do go back to Kenya,
how do you think that's gonna go?

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:45.700
&gt;&gt; NICK: I don't know, I don't know.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:49.940
&gt;&gt; SELLY: Do you want to go back one day?

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.250
&gt;&gt; NICK: Oh yeah, sure.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:52.880
I will -- I'll go back.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.860
It's my home.

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.890
SELLY THIAM: So I interviewed Nick in 2007,
and he has not gone back to Kenya yet.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:00.210
He has not returned.

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:06.980
Partly because he's, he's physically transitioned
so much that he is a little bit nervous about

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:12.680
how he will be received by his family, which
is understandable.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:17.480
He, also, in some ways was – he'll tell
 -- he tells the story much better than I,

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:22.350
but a part of his coming to the States was
so he would return money to his family in

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:26.500
the village and he did actually spend a lot
of his money going through his transition.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:30.170
So there's some, some issues around that as
well.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:35.870
But Nick's story of isolation is one that
I heard a lot in the Diaspora, particularly

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:40.480
in North America and parts of Europe.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.920
And it wasn't really the last time I would
hear these stories because it was sort of

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:49.190
a theme that sort of went through all the
countries that I've had the opportunity to

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:50.110
visit there.

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:55.440
So I know when I hear this story, I often
ask myself what it must be like to not be

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.740
able to return home.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:03.740
And it's something that I don't know personally,
but I feel, I feel very much compassion for

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.890
what Nick has to go through in this area.

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:07.820
So I'm actually gonna move.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.690
We're gonna go to a different country.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:13.330
We're gonna go to South Africa.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:18.690
In 2008, I believe, we received our first
grant, which was amazing to us that people

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:24.620
were giving us money to do this at this point,
and it funded our trip to South Africa.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.040
I -- actually, Notisha Massaquoi went with
me to South Africa.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:31.560
And when we got there, we knew no one in South
Africa, we did not know how we were going

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.920
to do this work, we did not know who we were
going to meet.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.530
And we were very fortunate to meet a woman
named Thokozani Ndaba, who is somewhat of

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:40.650
a socialite and who knew everyone.

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:45.500
So we met the person who was plugged in, and
then she introduced us to everyone that we

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.340
needed to know.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.230
So we met this woman named Beverly Ditsie.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:51.529
And at the time, I didn't realize how important
this interview was going to be.

00:13:51.529 --> 00:13:53.990
Beverly Ditsie, this is a picture from 1990.

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:58.570
And she was very much, she was part of the
organizing committee that organized the first

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:00.940
Pride March on the African continent in 1990.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:05.220
And it was at the sort of the end of apartheid,
the country was changing.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.170
She was about 19 years old.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:14.170
And South Africa being a multi-racial country,
she was part of an organizing committee that

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.730
was white, was black, was South Asian.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:23.180
People coming from other countries to support
the organizing of this march.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:27.930
So she simply said, once she looked at the
line of speakers, "There are no Africans,

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:32.930
there are no black Africans speaking, so we
should probably get some to speak."

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:34.450
And they said, "Yeah, you should do it."

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:40.290
So this is kind of what happened after she
decided to take that on.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:46.170
&gt;&gt; BEVERLY DITSIE: I didn't even get asked
to speak at the first Pride March.

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:52.750
I think it, it's one of those things where
I asked them why it was that there was no

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:57.060
woman of color, girl of color, who's gonna
be part of the representation.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:01.670
Because if it's only gonna be white people
up on the podium in, in the first Pride March

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:05.550
in Africa, then what it is white influence
nonstop.

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:07.410
So I think I just asked.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:10.210
I was like, wouldn't it help us to have a
black person?

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:16.480
It was like, "Yeah, yeah. Yah!! You want to
do it? You want to make a speech?"

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.630
So I made a speech.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:24.630
Those cameras, those cameras around me didn't
mean anything until it hit the news.

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:33.610
Whoa, church groups, school groups, parents
groups, teachers groups, you name it.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:39.790
Everywhere was like a whole petition to get
me killed, to get people like me.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:43.110
It was like we understand when it's these
white people.

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:46.540
We understand it's a very white thing to be
doing.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:47.410
So we understand.

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:52.200
But when you stand up and tell us it's also
African, oh, you're starting to insult people's

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:57.160
sensibilities, and you're shaking their moral
ground, and you're shaking their own firm

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.060
beliefs.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:01.670
It was a frightening time.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:06.839
The threat to my family, threat to my mother,
the threat to my grandma and my sister.

00:16:06.839 --> 00:16:13.410
Guys coming around my house wanting to teach
me I'm a woman, and that was something I did

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:14.350
not expect.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:18.350
Like I couldn't walk to the shop without hearing
at least one person or some car going past

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:21.839
and going beep, beep. "Is that her? Yeah,
bitch, we're going to get you.

00:16:21.839 --> 00:16:23.110
You're a woman.

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:23.360
Faggot."

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:24.350
You know or whatever.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:30.400
Every time I heard noises outside I kept thinking,
am I being attacked?

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.520
Because people were threatened.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:35.270
They would say to me, "We're coming for you."

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:38.730
That actually got my parents completely and
totally supporting me.

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:42.480
Because the implications were if they don't
support me, then who is?

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.170
Who is going to? Who's gonna?

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:44.770
You know.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.060
So my grandma became my rock.

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:51.850
That is why when eventually the big group
of men surrounded my house and said, "We're

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:57.360
coming to get her" and they tried to walk
through the gate, and she said, "Walk in.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.550
Just try it. Just try it."

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:02.970
And she called to my Great Aunt Kate, "Bring
the thing."

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:09.249
She's talking about, like, a thick iron thing.

00:17:09.249 --> 00:17:14.179
I mean, if she had a baseball bat, it would
be a baseball bat.

00:17:14.179 --> 00:17:16.589
But they thought there was something else
going on.

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:22.629
And they kind of stopped and when the momentum
in the group dynamics, when the momentum's

00:17:22.629 --> 00:17:27.129
gone, and somebody goes, "Maybe we should
leave."

00:17:27.129 --> 00:17:28.329
They left.

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:32.440
So I was escorted for about two weeks after
the march.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:38.619
My mom would put on her Converse, her Chuck
Taylor's, and she'd put on her jeans.

00:17:38.619 --> 00:17:41.440
And she's say, "All right. You need to go
there? Let's walk."

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:47.200
I was scared all the time.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:54.200
So yeah, just pushed so hard and stuck out
like a sore thumb.

00:17:56.889 --> 00:18:02.809
And said, "All right. Look, I'm here and I
ain't moving. I ain't budging."

00:18:02.809 --> 00:18:06.009
SELLY THIAM: Because of activists like Bev
Ditsie and Simon Uncoli, South Africa eventually

00:18:06.009 --> 00:18:09.929
passed one of the most progressive constitutions
in the world.

00:18:09.929 --> 00:18:13.590
They allow for gay marriage and protection
of rights for LGBT people.

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:19.070
But even with the very progressive constitution,
the amount of violence that LGBT people face

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.940
in the townships and across the country is
staggering.

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:25.450
Not to mention just the violence against women
in general.

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:29.340
I'm not sure if you've all heard of the corrective
rapes that happen to a lot of the lesbian

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.539
women who live in the townships and other
parts of the country.

00:18:32.539 --> 00:18:39.440
But we did meet a lot of women who did tell
us these stories of being put into these situations

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.649
of corrective rapes by people they had grown
up and seen most of their lives.

00:18:43.649 --> 00:18:48.419
So there's still a lot of -- and also gay
men and trans-people also face a lot of the

00:18:48.419 --> 00:18:49.919
same forms of violence there.

00:18:49.919 --> 00:18:53.610
So there's a lot of work to, to be done still.

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:57.080
And the organizing in South Africa, it's,
it's amazing.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:01.039
I mean, there are so many people who are organizing
around LGBT equity there.

00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:05.629
And so it was, it was an incredible place
to be, to see this happen on the African continent.

00:19:05.629 --> 00:19:08.200
So since then they've had many Gay Prides.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.509
They've turned – they start as marches,
of course, and have turned into these huge

00:19:11.509 --> 00:19:15.149
Pride events with beer commercials and half-naked
people.

00:19:15.149 --> 00:19:22.149
And Bev Ditsie herself said she doesn't go
anymore because it's lost its political message.

00:19:23.159 --> 00:19:26.369
But she was very instrumental in making that
happen.

00:19:26.369 --> 00:19:32.730
So through this work, I want to say, collecting
oral histories for two years and traveling

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:39.490
to different countries, I started to really
ask myself what does it really mean to go

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:41.529
somewhere and collect a story?

00:19:41.529 --> 00:19:45.330
Because usually these interviews are about
two hours long, and then I cut them down to

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:47.190
these, these vignettes that you're listening
to.

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:50.730
This is from different parts of interviews
that I have with people so it takes a while

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:51.809
to produce them.

00:19:51.809 --> 00:19:54.139
But then I would distribute them, or they
would go on Public Radio.

00:19:54.139 --> 00:19:59.499
Or someone else will want to distribute them,
but I kept thinking to myself that what does

00:19:59.499 --> 00:20:02.049
it mean to go somewhere and then just take
the stories from that place?

00:20:02.049 --> 00:20:05.429
I mean, what else, what else can we do to
give back?

00:20:05.429 --> 00:20:10.590
So actually after coming back from South Africa,
and Thokozani Ndaba, who I mentioned earlier,

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:16.080
who plugged us into this community became
our first -- she began to lead our first satellite,

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.909
which is None on Record in South Africa.

00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:22.369
So what she does there is she works with a
lot of the young women in townships, she collects

00:20:22.369 --> 00:20:27.999
oral histories from a lot of Africans who
have immigrated to South Africa, and she also

00:20:27.999 --> 00:20:30.580
is learning and teaching a lot of production
skills.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:36.539
So I'm gonna play an interview that she actually
recorded in Capetown and edited herself.

00:20:36.539 --> 00:20:41.049
So South Africa actually is our first satellite;
Canada became a satellite later.

00:20:41.049 --> 00:20:47.330
I'm gonna play an interview from Canada after
this and soon later this year we'll be starting

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.570
work in Nairobi.

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:53.690
So it's become like I said in the beginning,
it was a documentary that has become a network.

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:59.190
And is also a way for people, because I had
also no formal training to sort of teach these

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.399
like citizen journalism models.

00:21:00.399 --> 00:21:02.480
Like how do you collect your own history?

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.929
How do you find ways to tell an alternative
story?

00:21:05.929 --> 00:21:11.570
So with that I'm going to play Carlos Idibouo,
who was part of our Seeking Asylum project.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:13.539
He is from the Ivory Coast.

00:21:13.539 --> 00:21:18.159
He now lives in Montreal; at the time he lived
in Toronto.

00:21:18.159 --> 00:21:22.899
As we were traveling, we heard a lot of stories
from people who had to -- had to flee their

00:21:22.899 --> 00:21:26.289
home countries and Carlos had a similar situation.

00:21:26.289 --> 00:21:32.019
So he was part of our Seeking Asylum project
where we, we specifically focused on people

00:21:32.019 --> 00:21:36.409
who were looking for refugee, refugee status
or were trying to attain refugee status or

00:21:36.409 --> 00:21:38.600
asylum in the United States.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.900
So I'm gonna play Carlos'. OK?

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:48.900
&gt;&gt; CARLOS IDIBOUO: (audio tape) We start organizing
ourself in 2003, because we have so many capable

00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:52.820
dying from AIDS.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:58.570
Almost every month, some people call me to
tell that, okay, this person died and that

00:21:58.570 --> 00:21:59.619
was really too much for me.

00:21:59.619 --> 00:22:03.440
All the services were directed to the straight
community.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:07.879
And when we talk about the work we're doing,
we're like, okay, that's not really important.

00:22:07.879 --> 00:22:14.879
Because we already have a very big program
about HIV, so you guys don't really need a

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:16.409
special program for your community.

00:22:16.409 --> 00:22:22.580
But those people didn't know what's were the
realities for the gay and lesbian people in

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:23.009
Africa.

00:22:23.009 --> 00:22:27.499
Many people experience homophobia in hospital,
especially for the transfer status people.

00:22:27.499 --> 00:22:34.499
Any time they go there, they are targeted
with the nurses, with doctors, so they just

00:22:35.049 --> 00:22:37.610
decide to stop going to hospital.

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:43.519
And because I was traveling a lot for some
workshop, for some conference across Africa,

00:22:43.519 --> 00:22:50.330
I wasn't always there to go with them to hospital,
and they were very scared to go alone.

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:54.929
So their health was getting very bad.

00:22:54.929 --> 00:23:01.929
And in two months, five people who were living
with me died from AIDS.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:09.200
In this same time, just because of homophobia,
just because they're scared to be rejected

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:14.059
by their family, the other members of their
condition; they didn't want to come out, to

00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:20.499
speak, to talk at the radio, to talk on the
TV, to do some interviews with some newspaper.

00:23:20.499 --> 00:23:21.600
So I was alone.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:25.590
And that was really, really too much for me.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:30.840
When I finished work, and I go home, sometimes
I find some letters under my door saying that,

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:36.950
"Okay, you should move from here because we
don't need gay people to be our, our neighbor."

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:40.929
So in three months, I moved like four times.

00:23:40.929 --> 00:23:45.029
And I said, "Okay. I think it's time for me
to move somewhere."

00:23:45.029 --> 00:23:48.149
I didn't know exactly where to go.

00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:55.149
But I got two scholarship for the Out Games
in 2006, and the AIDS conference here in Toronto.

00:23:57.049 --> 00:24:02.409
And so when I came, I didn't plan to stay
in Canada.

00:24:02.409 --> 00:24:05.230
I don't even know where I am.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:08.119
I don't know what is going on here.

00:24:08.119 --> 00:24:15.119
But with struggling a lot, doing activism
in Africa, I think what I did gave me the

00:24:16.169 --> 00:24:20.269
strength to stay here in Canada.

00:24:20.269 --> 00:24:27.269
And what I was thinking about through this
process was all the work I did in my country

00:24:28.889 --> 00:24:30.249
in the gay community.

00:24:30.249 --> 00:24:33.460
Who is gonna continue this work?

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:35.299
People are dying.

00:24:35.299 --> 00:24:39.190
And I left the situation like that to come
here in Canada.

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:42.690
I felt guilty about that.

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:49.690
Years are passing, but homophobia is still
getting high and they're still killing gay

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:56.629
people, lesbian people, in so many countries,
the governments doesn't care.

00:24:56.629 --> 00:25:00.989
They even establish some laws against gay
and lesbian community.

00:25:00.989 --> 00:25:05.340
They're still, they're still doing that, and
it's getting worse.

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:09.460
So I think there is a lot of work to do in
Africa and here.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.859
But I still thinking about Africa.

00:25:11.859 --> 00:25:14.269
I still thinking about Ivory Coast.

00:25:14.269 --> 00:25:19.239
SELLY THIAM: So when we took this interview,
he hadn't received his refugee status in Canada.

00:25:19.239 --> 00:25:23.279
And a few months afterwards, he did receive
it.

00:25:23.279 --> 00:25:27.859
And he actually moved to French-speaking part
of Canada, so that he could do more organizing

00:25:27.859 --> 00:25:29.940
in the French community there.

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:35.029
He's thriving but he still feels very much
like he wishes that he could go home and do

00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.789
the work there.

00:25:35.789 --> 00:25:38.769
I'm going to play one last interview before
I wrap up today.

00:25:38.769 --> 00:25:42.049
This is Victor Mukasa.

00:25:42.049 --> 00:25:48.320
And Victor describes himself as a gender nonconforming
person.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.779
Victor was born female as well.

00:25:51.779 --> 00:25:58.779
And has transitioned into -- he uses pronouns
"him," "he," – into being male.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:06.080
Victor is really interesting because he was
a very prominent LGBTI rights defender in

00:26:07.409 --> 00:26:09.230
Uganda.

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:14.769
He started several LGBTI organizations there
and was very vocal.

00:26:14.769 --> 00:26:20.799
And what happened was a young school girl
committed suicide after she was abused, sort

00:26:20.799 --> 00:26:25.820
of physically attacked, after a group of students
found love letters that she and another young

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.090
woman were sharing.

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:34.019
So Victor got on the, on the radio in Uganda
and decided to speak out, which caused huge

00:26:34.019 --> 00:26:34.919
controversy in the country.

00:26:34.919 --> 00:26:39.980
People would come outside the radio station
and wait for him to attack him.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:43.220
Radio stations got fined for having him speak
on the sta – on the radio.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:50.080
In 2005, the police raided his house, and
took things from his house trying to prove

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.739
that he was a lesbian.

00:26:52.739 --> 00:26:55.840
And at that point, he decided that he had
had enough.

00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:01.070
And he decided to sue the Ugandan government
and so this is Victor's story.

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:08.070
&gt;&gt; VICTOR MUKASA: (audio) In 2006 when I moved
here, prior to that, I was in hiding in Uganda

00:27:10.889 --> 00:27:17.889
because around that period, I was suing the
government of Uganda for infringing on my

00:27:19.049 --> 00:27:22.299
rights after the government agents raided
my house.

00:27:22.299 --> 00:27:25.999
When they came to my house, they just, they
just broke into the house.

00:27:25.999 --> 00:27:31.470
And then if, if you looked at my house that
day it was like it had been annihilated, had

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:35.749
been hit by the tsunami, because everything
was upside down.

00:27:35.749 --> 00:27:42.269
And, and they had taken documents from my
organization, CDs, and they claimed to be

00:27:42.269 --> 00:27:46.460
looking for things that, that can prove that
I am a lesbian.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:51.350
So for me that was not okay, even if on the
other hand, I was used to being treated that

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:53.369
way by the Ugandan government.

00:27:53.369 --> 00:27:58.399
But being an activist and knowing that we
can do activism through so many ways, I felt

00:27:58.399 --> 00:28:04.669
that I was ready at that point to take another
step and that is, sue the government for violating

00:28:04.669 --> 00:28:05.549
my rights.

00:28:05.549 --> 00:28:09.369
And also on behalf of others who had been
treated like that.

00:28:09.369 --> 00:28:12.139
Life wasn't very easy for me.

00:28:12.139 --> 00:28:19.139
So I had to live in hiding, and see natural
light only once in a while.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:24.399
If I had to -- being a biological female,
sometimes I needed things specific for females.

00:28:24.399 --> 00:28:31.399
And it was hard to me to send taxi men, like
cab drivers, for say sanitary towels and that

00:28:33.009 --> 00:28:33.999
kind of things.

00:28:33.999 --> 00:28:35.440
So life became so difficult.

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:40.519
And I felt that I needed some air to breathe,
and I needed to walk on a street once again

00:28:40.519 --> 00:28:43.999
in my life since I had been in hiding for
a whole year.

00:28:43.999 --> 00:28:48.549
And so I, I decided that I'd leave the country.

00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:53.220
And so I left in June just for me to stretch
a little bit.

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:57.559
I, I decided to stay and wait for the lawyers
to call me back.

00:28:57.559 --> 00:29:02.840
And so that took me a whole year of waiting
in Johannesburg.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:03.570
&gt;&gt; Did you just win the case now?

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:03.970
VICTOR: Yeah, we just won.

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:10.970
About two hours ago I received a call from
Uganda and they're telling me that the government

00:29:11.429 --> 00:29:12.409
has been condemned for the URS violations
against me.

00:29:12.409 --> 00:29:19.409
I was told that the judge has used standing
human rights instruments to let the government

00:29:22.499 --> 00:29:25.929
know what rights they have violated.

00:29:25.929 --> 00:29:32.929
Shows that the judge judged fairly because
in a country like Uganda, if a judge is not

00:29:34.799 --> 00:29:41.799
strong to stand for the truth, you cannot
judge a case in favor of a homosexual, or

00:29:42.259 --> 00:29:48.159
a gender nonconforming person because who
knows what is going to happen to her now after

00:29:48.159 --> 00:29:49.879
she's made such a judgment.

00:29:49.879 --> 00:29:52.229
Yes, but the case has been won.

00:29:52.229 --> 00:29:53.479
It's celebrations in Uganda.

00:29:53.479 --> 00:29:59.389
I mean, Capetown, I just wish I was there
in Uganda, but in my heart, I'm celebrating.

00:29:59.389 --> 00:30:05.669
SELLY THIAM: So Thokozani actually flew to
Capetown and took this interview in December

00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:08.309
of 2008, when Victor had won the case.

00:30:08.309 --> 00:30:14.769
So it was a huge victory for him, and for
the LGBTI community in Uganda.

00:30:14.769 --> 00:30:15.989
He still lives in South Africa.

00:30:15.989 --> 00:30:21.269
He works for the International Gay and Lesbian
Human Rights Commission for the East Africa

00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:23.350
division, and has been doing work there.

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:28.749
And of course, has been speaking out about
the more recent issues of the anti-homosexuality

00:30:28.749 --> 00:30:33.109
bill in Uganda, and working with people who
are still in the country -- although a lot

00:30:33.109 --> 00:30:36.519
of people have had to leave -- still in the
country who are organizing an opposition to

00:30:36.519 --> 00:30:36.929
that bill.

00:30:36.929 --> 00:30:38.889
So I'm actually gonna stop now.

00:30:38.889 --> 00:30:43.769
But I do want to say that this was the first
interview that Thokozani took for the South

00:30:43.769 --> 00:30:44.379
Africa satellite.

00:30:44.379 --> 00:30:48.249
And I really am very happy that we got Victor
on record.

00:30:48.249 --> 00:30:51.899
It was a very good interview, very timely.

00:30:51.899 --> 00:30:55.009
So we are still collecting.

00:30:55.009 --> 00:30:57.710
We're setting up satellites in different parts
of the world.

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:00.509
And we probably will be collecting for a long
time.

00:31:00.509 --> 00:31:07.009
And we distribute online through our website,
which is NoneOnRecord.com is our online distribution.

00:31:07.009 --> 00:31:12.389
And when we do collaborations with organizations,
we also distribute through their sites, so

00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.869
we support them with their technical needs
and distribute their own site as well.

00:31:12.869 --> 00:31:13.499
So I'm going to stop now to allow for Q&amp;A,
if anybody has any questions about None on

00:31:13.499 --> 00:31:13.749
Record.

00:31:13.529 --> 00:31:17.210
&gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why don't we take one question and
then we'll entertain questions at the reception?

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:18.210
&gt;&gt;Hi, thanks for coming.

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:25.210
It was real interesting, and

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:32.489
I think it's really great work.

00:31:32.489 --> 00:31:35.929
I'm curious what's the meaning of the name
"None on Record"?

00:31:35.929 --> 00:31:37.200
SELLY THIAM: Okay.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:42.869
The third interview I did was with a priest,
Nigerian priest, by the name of John, who,

00:31:42.869 --> 00:31:48.599
when I asked him if he had any names for LGBT
people from his ethnic language, which was

00:31:48.599 --> 00:31:51.869
Yoruba, he said that he had none on record.

00:31:51.869 --> 00:31:55.340
It was very profound because it was a long
silence and then he said, "No, I have none

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:56.799
on record."

00:31:56.799 --> 00:32:00.249
And so for a long time I didn't really know
what I was going to name the project as we

00:32:00.249 --> 00:32:07.109
got more interviews, but that moment was always
in my mind, when I was thinking about the

00:32:07.109 --> 00:32:09.809
level of silence around some of these issues
and these identities.

00:32:09.809 --> 00:32:11.179
And so subsequently, we named the project
None on Record after that interview.

00:32:11.179 --> 00:32:16.899
&gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thank you all for coming. And there
is wine and cheese in Bakerfield which is

00:32:16.899 --> 00:32:20.559
just out those doors.

00:32:20.559 --> 00:32:23.299
SELLY THIAM: Great.

00:32:23.299 --> 00:32:27.269
Thank you for having me.

00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:29.109
[APPLAUSE]
