00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.049
&gt;&gt;Marissa: Good morning. Thank you guys, all,
for coming. We are very excited today to be

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.170
welcoming the Barefoot Contessa, Ina Garten,
here to San Francisco.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.170
[applause]

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.100
&gt;&gt;Ina: Not nearly as excited as I am to be
here.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.670
&gt;&gt;Marissa: And Ina's here for the Fancy Food
Show, but we were lucky to snag her for a

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.320
visit here today. And so, by the way, we also
have-- she has a new cookbook out called "How

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.300
Easy Is That?" And so, there's a hundred of
those available if you wanna snag one. Ina

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.019
will sign cookbooks afterwards and you can
come up and meet her and ask her your questions.

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:38.870
We also have the questions on the Dory Page,
but we're really, really excited to have you.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.269
So, I'm gonna go ahead and go through a little
bit of your background which I think everyone

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.539
here is probably already familiar with, but
I think there's some really great parts to

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:53.819
it. So, Ina and I met last April at a women's
event and we got to hear a little bit about

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:58.819
our stories, each other's stories and it was
just really fun. And we've met again since,

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:04.729
through our friend, Juliet du Baubigny at
Kleiner Perkins, one of our original VC firms

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.170
because Juliet turns out to be Ina's neighbor--

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.770
&gt;&gt;Ina: Next door neighbor of all things.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:10.770
&gt;&gt;Marissa: in the Hamptons.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.770
[Marissa laughs]

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.990
And so, I went to see Juliet this summer and
we were going to dinner at her neighbors'

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.870
and it turned out to be Ina, so we met again
there. And so, I actually have had dinner

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.049
and brunch in Ina's famous kitchen.

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.049
[Marissa laughs]

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.049
&gt;&gt;Ina: It was one of my--

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:27.049
&gt;&gt;Marissa: And it was really, really amazing.

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:28.049
&gt;&gt;Ina: great pleasures. It was one of my great
pleasures to say to Juliet, "Oh, I know Marissa."

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.049
[Ina and Marissa laugh]

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.610
&gt;&gt;Marissa: I had one of the best coffee cake
I've ever had with sugar rolled into the crust;

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.909
it was amazing.

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.140
[Ina and Marissa laugh]

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.359
But Ina's story is really fascinating because
she started off working in the White House.

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:46.861
&gt;&gt;Ina: I did. Nuclear energy policy. How light
is that?

00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:50.049
&gt;&gt;Marissa: I was gonna say, it's amazing.
Budget analyst, writing the nuclear energy

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.509
budget and policy papers on nuclear centrifuge
for Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.119
[Ina and Marissa laugh]

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.840
&gt;&gt;Ina: You know, science, cooking; it actually
is related.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.840
[laughter]

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.460
Except, instead of hydrochloric acid, you
end up with coffee cake.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.659
[laughter]

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.590
&gt;&gt;Marissa: I think we can all appreciate that.
All of us here like to apply science in unusual

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.590
ways.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.590
&gt;&gt;Ina: It's more fun.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.740
&gt;&gt;Marissa: So, and then as she was working
there, saw an ad for a specialty food store

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.640
that was for sale in the Hamptons called "The
Barefoot Contessa," and she bought the store

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.300
and scaled it. And so, much like we've scaled
Google, Ina scaled it from a 400 square foot

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.770
shop to now over three thousand square foot
shop. It moved twice and was this very, very

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.940
successful business. She sold it to two of
the employees in 1996, and then wrote a cookbook.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.210
And I actually want Ina to tell the story,
but I think it was really interesting about

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.600
how you made the bridge from the store to
the cookbook.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.570
&gt;&gt;Ina: Actually, Marissa and I were talking
about this, I always wanted to-- I'd been

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.130
doing the store for about 20 years and I thought,
"You know, it's really time to do something

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.490
else." And for a couple of years, I was saying,
"Well, what is that? What is that? I've gotta

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.720
know what it is." And a friend of mine said
to me, "Type A people think they can figure

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.980
out what they're gonna do next while they're
doing something, and they can't."

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:03.980
[chuckles]

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.190
She said, "You have to quit. You just have
to do nothing for a year." And so, that's

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.500
when I thought, "OK, I'll sell the store to
two employees, the chef and the manager, and

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.831
then I'll just have nothing to do."

00:03:13.831 --> 00:03:15.800
[laughter]

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.440
If you think that's easy, it's not. I built
myself an office upstairs in the building

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:27.120
that we had, where the store was and I sat
there for a year with nothing to do. My husband,

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.270
Jeffrey, is at Yale, and he would leave on
Monday and come back on Friday. And when he

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.781
left on Monday one week, I said, "I have nothing
to do."

00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:36.781
[laughter]

00:03:36.781 --> 00:03:40.700
I said, "Wait a minute." I looked at my schedule.
I said, "I have a manicure on Wednesday and

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.110
that's it."

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.220
[laughter]

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.360
But it really was out of sheer, total boredom.
One day I'd been baking a thousand baguettes

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.070
and running a store with a hundred employees,
and the next day had nothing to do. After

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.260
about, I think, nine months, out of sheer
boredom I thought, "Well, I have to do something."

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.340
And Jeffrey said, "Stay in the game. You love
the food business. Just do something in the

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.550
food business." And I thought, "Well, I never
wanted to write a cookbook" cause I thought

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.610
it would be boring, but, "OK, maybe I'll write
a cookbook just so I have something to do

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.280
tomorrow." And it never would have happened
if I hadn't started and then it turned out

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.209
cookbook writing is really interesting.

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.770
&gt;&gt;Marissa: And of course…

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.693
&gt;&gt;Ina: So, it was very good advice.

00:04:21.693 --> 00:04:23.100
&gt;&gt;Marissa: … the cookbooks led to the television
show--

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.100
&gt;&gt;Ina: Television show, yes--

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.780
&gt;&gt;Marissa: which I heard that you actually
turned down the proposal the first time around.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.050
&gt;&gt;Ina: Over and over and over again.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.050
[laughter]

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.161
Food Network was at a moment--and Marissa
knows this-- Food Network was at a moment

00:04:35.161 --> 00:04:39.990
when they had the French chefs with the big
toques and everybody, and there was nothing;

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.910
triple-layer mousses and there was one woman
at Food Network who said, "I think it should

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.800
be of people that do home-cooking, people
who really understand how people cook at home."

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:58.660
And she went out and found four people. She
found Rachel Ray, Paula Dean, Giada and me,

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.570
and to this day, that really is the basis
of Food Network. And I just said, "No, no,

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.930
no, no, no, I could never do that. Cooking
on television? Forget it." So, she went away

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.061
and came back about six months later with
a better offer.

00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:13.061
[laughter]

00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:16.740
And I thought, and I said, "No, no, no. I'm
not negotiating. I really don't want to do

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.441
this." She came back six months later with
a better offer--

00:05:19.441 --> 00:05:20.441
[laughter]

00:05:20.441 --> 00:05:24.190
and I was like, "No. Go away."

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.250
[laughter]

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.791
And in the meantime, a friend of mine who
had gone to Australia and seen a TV show,

00:05:28.791 --> 00:05:34.780
a cooking show, that he thought was interesting
and so I went to Food Network and said, "Could

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.650
you get me a copy of this show so I could
see it?" And it was fantastic. And I said,

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.030
"But I still don't wanna do a TV show."

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.030
[laughter]

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.270
And so, the Food Network went to London, found
the producer, hired them and called me and

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.360
said, "They're coming to East Hampton. Now
will you do it?" And I was like, "Whoa." So,

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.180
I agreed to do 13 shows, thinking that would
solve that and here we are nine years later.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.540
[Ina laughs]

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.600
&gt;&gt;Marissa: And an Emmy. I mean, I will say
that actually, the Emmy is as sharp, heavy,

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.940
and pointy as you'd expect.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:06.940
[Ina laughs]

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:07.940
&gt;&gt;Ina: It is.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.990
&gt;&gt;Marissa: One of the dinner guests managed
to see it tucked deep in the corners amidst

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.990
some papers in Ina's office.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.990
&gt;&gt;Ina: Oh, really?

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.990
&gt;&gt;Marissa: We all went in and held it, so--

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.820
&gt;&gt;Ina: It has a twin. It has a twin sister
now.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:15.820
[laughter]

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:16.820
A second one.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.710
&gt;&gt;Marissa: A pair of them. And I will say,
I mean, Ina obviously is just phenomenally

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.370
popular, admired all over. The first day that
I met her, as I said, we were at this women's

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:31.260
event and it happened, and just by happenstance,
Oprah Winfrey happened to be there. And when

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:37.160
I first met Ina, Oprah Winfrey, there was
a fan of Ina's that was so excited to see

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.740
Ina; she shoved Oprah out of the way.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:40.740
[laughter]

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:41.740
She was like, "Oh my God! Ina Garten!" And
I was like, "That was Oprah."

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.740
[laughter]

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:50.330
&gt;&gt;Ina: And there I
was standing on the podium and Oprah's next

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.600
to me and she didn't speak to me the whole
time. I thought, until a few nights ago, I

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.600
never understood why.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.090
[Ina laughs]

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:05.419
&gt;&gt;Marissa: So, that's a little bit of background.
So, we have some questions. I have some questions,

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:08.580
here. We have questions from our group and
we also can take questions from the mic. So,

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:14.199
if you wanna ask Ina a question, you can come
here. We have mics in the center and on the

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:15.290
side here if you wanna ask a question.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:20.210
&gt;&gt;Ina: I'll bet there's an algorithm for hearing
the most popular question. Where else?

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:21.210
[Ina laughs]

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.760
&gt;&gt;Marissa: And actually, the question I was
gonna start with is at the top of the Dory,

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.500
so I will just go to that, which is, "Well,
my question was do you have a favorite dish

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.900
that you just love to make?" And I know it's
hard; it's almost like asking someone to pick

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:34.900
a favorite child.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:39.780
&gt;&gt;Ina: Child. No, no no. It's actually, I
have a few. I have a few, but my go-to meal

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.560
when somebody's coming, they've never been
there before and I've got a million things

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:49.440
going on, is a meal that's in my Parties book,
which is rack of lamb and orzo with roasted

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.900
vegetables and it's so easy and it's absolutely
delicious and nobody can believe that you,

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.100
I mean, everybody thinks you worked all day
on it.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.100
[Ina laughs]

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:04.030
&gt;&gt;Marissa: So, I guess that's the go-to. What
do you think makes a good chef? It's hard,

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:06.770
but what are the qualities?

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:12.229
&gt;&gt;Ina: That's a really interesting question.
I just think if people that really, I think

00:08:12.229 --> 00:08:17.970
what-- I'm not a restaurant chef, I'm not
brilliant cook. I just think I really care

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:22.940
about flavor and the texture of how things
taste. And so, I think if somebody's really

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.620
interested in that, you're willing to just
keep going until it's exactly the way you

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:31.430
want it to be, rather than settling. And somebody
once said to me, and it's really amazingly

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:36.570
true, "There are two ingredients that everybody
has in their house that is very often the

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.169
difference between something that's fairly
ordinary and something that's absolutely delicious,

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:41.669
and it's salt and pepper."

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:42.669
[audience chuckles]

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:47.680
It's -- most things aren't seasoned properly
and I think that really makes a huge difference

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:52.800
and I'm not happy unless it tastes fantastic.
So, I think that's really what makes a good

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:58.809
chef -- is a real passion for a really satisfying,
delicious, and it can be also a very simple

00:08:58.809 --> 00:08:59.809
meal.

00:08:59.809 --> 00:09:02.720
&gt;&gt;Marissa: Sure. So, is that what you would
say the biggest mistake most chefs make is

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.720
not seasoning properly?

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.889
&gt;&gt;Ina: Biggest mistake: salt. It's amazing
what a difference it makes. The other day,

00:09:05.889 --> 00:09:11.839
I was testing a recipe for braised lamb shanks
for my next book and I said to my assistant,

00:09:11.839 --> 00:09:15.430
"Taste it and see what you think." And I hadn't
tasted it – the finished -- ; it had just

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:20.230
come out of the oven and she said, "Mmm, it's
OK. It's not great." And I tasted it and I

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:24.550
said, "OK, I'll be right back." Salt, pepper
and a splash of white wine and I said, "Taste

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:27.410
it now." And she was like, "Oh my God! This
is the best thing I ever ate."

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:28.410
[laughter]

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:33.040
And it was the same dish. It was so amazing
what that, so I think that's the biggest mistake.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:37.260
&gt;&gt;Marissa: Very cool. So, let me have a couple
of, I think I have a quick question just to

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.260
pick your brain.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:39.260
[Ina laughs]

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.260
So--

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.260
&gt;&gt;Ina: Let's see, the smartest people on the
planet.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:42.260
[Ina laughs]

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.260
[audience laughs]

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.260
Just go ask anything.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:50.990
&gt;&gt;Marissa: One was three cooking utensils
that are the most important to you.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.990
[pause]

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:57.610
&gt;&gt;Ina: Good, sharp knives. Critical. Doesn't
have to be a hundred knives; it has to be

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:04.350
three really, good knives. I love a zester,
like those rasps because I usually think that

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:10.839
the zest on a lemon or an orange or something
has more flavor than the juice itself. And

00:10:10.839 --> 00:10:15.809
half-sheet pans; I have a stack of them. Everything
goes in a half-sheet: brownies, roasted carrots,

00:10:15.809 --> 00:10:20.399
rack of lamb, everything. I mean, obviously
you need more equipment than that, like an

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:21.399
oven.

00:10:21.399 --> 00:10:22.399
[laughter]

00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:25.279
But, I mean, those are things I literally
couldn't live without.

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:32.300
&gt;&gt;Marissa: So, another question from the Dory.
Say it's your last day. It's kind of morbid,

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.300
but--

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.300
[Ina laughs]

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.300
What would your meal be?

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:39.390
&gt;&gt;Ina: Well, that's interesting because I
actually was asked this question. Somebody

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:46.860
auctioned off a cocktail party or something
for benefit, and these young women came; they

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.339
were just adorable. And they said-- one of
them was British-- and she said, "What's your

00:10:50.339 --> 00:10:52.179
hangman’s meal?" And I was like, "What's
that?"

00:10:52.179 --> 00:10:53.179
[laughter]

00:10:53.179 --> 00:10:56.040
It turns out it's the same thing; it's your
last dinner. And I said, "I don't know what

00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.709
it would be, but I know it would have really
good Chateau de Camp Sauternes with every

00:11:00.709 --> 00:11:01.709
single course."

00:11:01.709 --> 00:11:02.709
[laughter]

00:11:02.709 --> 00:11:07.420
So, the first one might be foie gras. I know
it's completely not PC, but it would be foie

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.749
gras. The second one would probably be a lobster,
like a grilled lobster thing, which is great

00:11:10.749 --> 00:11:15.130
with Chateau de Camp. And the third one would
be a very thin French apple tart with Chateau

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:16.130
de Camp. So, I think--

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:17.499
[laughter]

00:11:17.499 --> 00:11:22.639
the prison would be really out of a lot of
money if I ordered that as my last meal.

00:11:22.639 --> 00:11:25.779
&gt;&gt;Marissa: We'll go ahead and take a question
from the audience.

00:11:25.779 --> 00:11:31.329
&gt;&gt;audience #1: Hi. Hello. I'd like to ask
about copyright intellectual property issues

00:11:31.329 --> 00:11:40.179
in writing a cookbook. I've got a wonderful
pile of recipes from aunts and Mom and acquaintances

00:11:40.179 --> 00:11:41.470
and can you use those in a cookbook?

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:45.879
&gt;&gt;Ina: As long as they're not copyrighted,
yes, absolutely. Sure.

00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:46.879
&gt;&gt;audience #1: Thanks.

00:11:46.879 --> 00:11:48.829
&gt;&gt;Ina: That shouldn't be any problem. I would
probably ask their permission just to be nice.

00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:49.829
[laughter]

00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:51.660
&gt;&gt;audience #1: Some of them are so old. They're
30 years old and I have no idea where they

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.660
came from.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:53.660
[Ina laughs]

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.769
&gt;&gt;Ina: Well, yeah. Absolutely you could--

00:11:55.769 --> 00:11:56.999
&gt;&gt;audience #1: Thanks.

00:11:56.999 --> 00:12:00.069
&gt;&gt;Ina: and that would be wonderful to publish
all those old recipes.

00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:01.699
&gt;&gt;audience #1: Thank you.

00:12:01.699 --> 00:12:05.259
&gt;&gt;Marissa: And we have a lot of people who
are interested in the actual filming of the

00:12:05.259 --> 00:12:07.760
television show. So, is it actually filmed
in your kitchen?

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:13.889
&gt;&gt;Ina: It is filmed in my house. It actually
is and we've been doing it there, originally

00:12:13.889 --> 00:12:19.339
in my house and then I built this huge barn,
which Marissa knows, next door. So, my commute

00:12:19.339 --> 00:12:21.399
to work is about 50 yards.

00:12:21.399 --> 00:12:23.110
[Ina laughs]

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.759
And yeah, we do film that. I just think it
always feels like a set and I love when we

00:12:26.759 --> 00:12:32.989
do the parties. It's a real party. They're
my friends and I tell the director, "Just

00:12:32.989 --> 00:12:36.779
leave us alone." We just have to have a good
time; you can't fake it. If you're not having

00:12:36.779 --> 00:12:41.600
a good time, it doesn't look like a good time.
So, it's really wonderful. I love the people.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:47.569
It's the same producer that originally started
and yeah, it's great. And I get to cook in

00:12:47.569 --> 00:12:48.569
my own kitchen.

00:12:48.569 --> 00:12:49.709
[Ina and Marissa laugh]

00:12:49.709 --> 00:12:53.350
&gt;&gt;Marissa: And then a compliment in the form
of a question of, "Does Jeffrey know he's

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.579
the luckiest man in the world?"

00:12:55.579 --> 00:12:56.579
[laughter]

00:12:56.579 --> 00:13:02.209
&gt;&gt;Ina: The dirty little secret is I'm high
maintenance.

00:13:02.209 --> 00:13:03.209
[laughter]

00:13:03.209 --> 00:13:06.459
He was stopped at a restaurant recently and
someone said, "Do you know that you're the

00:13:06.459 --> 00:13:10.019
best fed man in America?" He didn't take that
quite as a compliment.

00:13:10.019 --> 00:13:11.749
[laughter]

00:13:11.749 --> 00:13:21.180
&gt;&gt;Marissa: And everyone here knows, but we
had Ina do our Thanksgiving Doodle and so--

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:22.879
&gt;&gt;Ina: That was so much fun.

00:13:22.879 --> 00:13:26.550
&gt;&gt;Marissa: The original idea was well; we
knew we wanted to maybe have a chef cook the

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:33.899
Doodle. And then we thought, "OK. What chef
is really popular who would be cooking a Thanksgiving

00:13:33.899 --> 00:13:38.170
dinner?" And so, we asked Ina to do it. She
obliged and so then we were so inspired by

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:41.879
it that we realized we didn't just want to
run it on Thanksgiving Day; we wanted to do

00:13:41.879 --> 00:13:43.221
it in the lead-up to Thanksgiving.

00:13:43.221 --> 00:13:44.280
&gt;&gt;Ina: So people could shop for the ingredients.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:48.819
&gt;&gt;Marissa: So people could shop for the ingredients
and do the recipes. And so, our Doodler staff

00:13:48.819 --> 00:13:55.569
was also in the kitchen and has also done
a photo shoot with Ina. And so, one of the

00:13:55.569 --> 00:13:58.399
questions is, "What was it like being involved
in the Google Doodle?"

00:13:58.399 --> 00:14:03.869
&gt;&gt;Ina: Well, I mean, it started out with an
email from Marissa and she knows I was walking

00:14:03.869 --> 00:14:07.139
around all day going, "Oh my God!"

00:14:07.139 --> 00:14:08.139
[laughter]

00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:11.370
It was wonderful. It was absolutely wonderful.
It was in the middle of my book tour and the

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:17.269
only day that we could find to do it was a
Sunday. So, I mean, they flew in and it was

00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:24.809
Preston and Mike Dutton. Preston Hershorn
and Mike Dutton if they're here. And, oh,

00:14:24.809 --> 00:14:25.809
there they are.

00:14:25.809 --> 00:14:26.809
[laughter]

00:14:26.809 --> 00:14:29.899
And it was so much fun and you just think,
"Oh, we'll just whip something up." And as

00:14:29.899 --> 00:14:34.910
we all know from the photo shoot, it's never
"you just whip something up." We had two turkeys

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:39.089
ready; we had two of everything. And it was
a real exciting day. It was wonderful.

00:14:39.089 --> 00:14:40.889
&gt;&gt;Marissa: It was a beautiful day.

00:14:40.889 --> 00:14:44.980
&gt;&gt;Ina: And it was fun to see the photographs
that we were taking. The photographer had

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:50.249
the digital image, and then to see Mike and
Preston move it into the actual Doodle. So,

00:14:50.249 --> 00:14:53.440
it was thrilling. It doesn't get any better
than that.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.580
&gt;&gt;Marissa: We had a great response to that.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:55.580
&gt;&gt;Ina: Did you have a great response?

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:56.580
&gt;&gt;Marissa: We had a great response to that.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.580
&gt;&gt;Ina: OK, good.

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.290
&gt;&gt;Marissa: I mean, probably you saw some of
that, too, but we were out on NPR, like hundreds

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:02.389
of mentions all over the Web--

00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:03.389
&gt;&gt;Ina: Oh how fabulous.

00:15:03.389 --> 00:15:04.389
&gt;&gt;Marissa: and let alone the tweets, right?
The tweets just were I think, probably numbered

00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:05.389
in the hundreds of thousands.

00:15:05.389 --> 00:15:07.480
&gt;&gt;Ina: I saw there was a panic somewhere.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.480
[laughter]

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.230
That was good. That was a good description.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:16.769
&gt;&gt;Marissa: So, one of the questions is, "Since
you're here in the Bay area, are there any

00:15:16.769 --> 00:15:19.379
restaurants that you love going out to here?"

00:15:19.379 --> 00:15:23.220
&gt;&gt;Ina: Well, I love being here because the
food is amazing. I mean, just from the farmer's

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:27.759
market at the Ferry Building, but I have to
say secretly, the best meal I've ever had

00:15:27.759 --> 00:15:32.359
was at Marissa's house and it was the chef
at Quince, which is just fantastic.

00:15:32.359 --> 00:15:33.359
[laughter]

00:15:33.359 --> 00:15:38.350
It was really stunning; both the food and
the wine, it was just incredible. Thank you.

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:40.959
&gt;&gt;Marissa: This is Michael Tusk, one of the
local chefs. He did a really good job. His

00:15:40.959 --> 00:15:42.809
pasta is just to die for. That's what he's
most known for.

00:15:42.809 --> 00:15:49.119
&gt;&gt;Ina: It was just fantastic. And last night,
we went to Tyler Florence's restaurant, Wayfare

00:15:49.119 --> 00:15:53.559
Tavern, which was great. Which was great.
Everybody, I love, there's something just

00:15:53.559 --> 00:15:59.489
so democratic about food here. It's just available
to everybody and I've always loved Zuni Cafe.

00:15:59.489 --> 00:16:04.029
And the first time I went there, we took a
taxi from the hotel to the cafe and the taxi

00:16:04.029 --> 00:16:07.700
driver said, "Oh, you've just gotta get the
roast chicken and the Caesar salad." And I

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:11.361
thought, "How great is that?"

00:16:11.361 --> 00:16:12.361
[laughter]

00:16:12.361 --> 00:16:14.869
And here, everybody always telling we're going
to Wayfare Tavern and they were like, "Oh,

00:16:14.869 --> 00:16:17.970
you have to get the fried chicken and you
have to put the lemon on it. It's really important."

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:19.040
I was like, "That's good."

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.889
[laughter]

00:16:20.889 --> 00:16:23.040
So, I just love that it's available to everybody
who really cares about good food and it shows.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.239
&gt;&gt;Marissa: We've got a live question.

00:16:24.239 --> 00:16:25.279
&gt;&gt;Ina: Oh. Hi.

00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:26.839
&gt;&gt;audience #2: Hi Ina, and thanks so much
for coming. This is really fun.

00:16:26.839 --> 00:16:27.839
&gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you for inviting me.

00:16:27.839 --> 00:16:34.680
&gt;&gt;audience #2: So, I think it's safe to say
that you've been a really big inspiration

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.980
to a lot of people who either haven't cooked
before or who just want to enhance their skills

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:37.980
and whatnot and become better chefs.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:38.980
&gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:40.769
&gt;&gt;audience #2: But what I'm curious to find
out is what inspires you and if you could

00:16:40.769 --> 00:16:46.519
walk us through the process of what it's like
to come up with a new recipe and put something

00:16:46.519 --> 00:16:47.519
together?

00:16:47.519 --> 00:16:54.379
&gt;&gt;Ina: You know, a friend of mine always said,
and I think it's really true, "You can't have

00:16:54.379 --> 00:16:58.639
ideas sitting home by yourself." You have
to get out there, especially in this design

00:16:58.639 --> 00:17:02.740
world and the world of food; you have to see
what's going on. One thing that I learned

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:06.300
about having a specialty food store is the
food that you eat at home is very different

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:10.750
from the food you eat in a restaurant. And
so, it's home cooking that I'm really interested

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:14.760
in. When I first started, I would do like,
veal with morels in the store and nobody would

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:15.760
buy it.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.760
[laughter]

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.850
And then I remember putting out a huge platter
of chicken that had fresh herbs on the platter.

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:24.040
It looked just gorgeous. Nobody bought one
of them. So, I took the platter, I went back

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:28.500
into the kitchen and I came out with chicken
in those little, red paper cups that you get

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.880
French fries in and lined them up on the counter
and they just flew out of the store. So, I

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.960
thought, "OK, it's about home cooking." And
so, what I like to do is go to specialty food

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:43.390
stores, but even sometimes I go to Milan and
see the colors of the new fashions. And one

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:49.730
year, I remember when I was doing my first
book, they were doing cantalope and azure

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:55.210
blue and raspberry together and I thought,
"Oh, that's good for the colors of the book."

00:17:55.210 --> 00:18:00.500
And that's what I did. So, I think about something
that I would wanna eat and I say this-- I'm

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:05.980
like an idiot savant about what people want
to eat-- nobody wants to eat fish eyeballs

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:06.980
in foam.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:07.980
[laughter]

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.900
You wanna eat roast chicken and rack of lamb.
And so, I start with an idea of what I want

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:16.690
it to taste like and what I want the texture
to be, and if I don't I never get where I'm

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:21.250
going. But if I do, it's that little ping
in my head that says, "OK, that's exactly

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:25.470
what I was looking for." And it could take
two tries or it could take 25 tries, but I

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:26.919
don't stop until I get there.

00:18:26.919 --> 00:18:32.350
&gt;&gt;audience #2: And then you've [ ] a lot of
books, TV show, what's next for you?

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:36.320
&gt;&gt;Ina: I always say this; if it just stays
just the way it is right now, I'll be very

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.679
happy. And then something comes along the
screen and I go, "Oh, that might be fun."

00:18:39.679 --> 00:18:40.679
[laughter]

00:18:40.679 --> 00:18:41.679
But it's gotta be fun.

00:18:41.679 --> 00:18:43.919
&gt;&gt;audience #2: Thanks.

00:18:43.919 --> 00:18:46.039
&gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you. Hi.

00:18:46.039 --> 00:18:50.510
&gt;&gt;audience #3: Thank you very much for coming.
My question is actually very similar to hers.

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:58.540
I think that you've all given us a very inspirational
story for how you've gotten to where you are

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:03.850
now, but I think a lot of us are curious to
know what's on the horizon? If there are any

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:07.450
things, a direction for your next cookbook,
or if there's something aside from writing

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:14.110
cookbooks or appearing on TV that you'd like
to do with the inspirational journey that

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:16.010
you've already gone on?

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:19.660
&gt;&gt;Ina: I just always, I keep doing, I get
up in the morning, I think, "What would be

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:23.950
interesting to do today?" And it's just, for
me, just putting one foot in front of another

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:28.250
and doing what I think is really interesting
and challenging myself. And I always feel

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:29.250
like the rest of it follows.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:35.190
&gt;&gt;audience #4: I have two teenage daughters
who are 15 and 17 and I'm realizing they're

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:39.000
gonna go off to college soon and I haven't
done a very good job of teaching them how

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
to cook.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
[Ina laughs]

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.169
We normally go to Panda Express, but--

00:19:43.169 --> 00:19:44.169
[Ina laughs]

00:19:44.169 --> 00:19:47.300
I'm working on that. I'm working on that.
I was just wondering if you have any tips

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:52.660
on teaching our children, our teenagers how
to cook so that they like it, so that they

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.420
don't associate it with a chore--

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.420
&gt;&gt;Ina: Work.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:58.779
&gt;&gt;audience #4: and any particular tips or
recipes that you have for teenagers.

00:19:58.779 --> 00:20:03.659
&gt;&gt;Ina: Well, I think now it's not the situation
where mom's at home all the time and teaching

00:20:03.659 --> 00:20:07.991
everybody how to cook and enjoying it and
transferring that pleasure. I actually think

00:20:07.991 --> 00:20:13.220
Food Network has been amazing because kids
all watch Food Network. And particularly,

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:17.759
I like that boys, eight year old boys are
cooking because of Bobby Flay and Emeril and

00:20:17.759 --> 00:20:22.740
all the guys who are. It's fun. They just
see that its fun, that it's really exciting

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:27.899
and I think the biggest lesson, is that if
you cook, everybody shows up. And it's that

00:20:27.899 --> 00:20:33.309
simple. It really is, so if you enjoy everybody
showing up, they'll learn to cook.

00:20:33.309 --> 00:20:34.309
[laughter]

00:20:34.309 --> 00:20:35.309
&gt;&gt;audience #5: Hey.

00:20:35.309 --> 00:20:36.309
&gt;&gt;Ina: Hi.

00:20:36.309 --> 00:20:37.309
&gt;&gt;audience #5: Thanks for coming.

00:20:37.309 --> 00:20:38.309
&gt;&gt;Ina: Sure.

00:20:38.309 --> 00:20:43.649
&gt;&gt;audience #5: I have a two part question.
So, I just read Anthony Bourdain's book, "Medium

00:20:43.649 --> 00:20:48.081
Raw", and have related to your fish eyes and--

00:20:48.081 --> 00:20:49.480
&gt;&gt;Ina: Yeah. Blerg.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:55.771
&gt;&gt;audience #5: First, what's your take on
Anthony Bourdain and what's he like in person

00:20:55.771 --> 00:20:56.771
if you ever met him?

00:20:56.771 --> 00:20:57.771
[laughter]

00:20:57.771 --> 00:20:58.771
Just cause I love him, and second--

00:20:58.771 --> 00:20:59.771
&gt;&gt;Ina: I love Anthony Bourdain.

00:20:59.771 --> 00:21:00.771
[laughter]

00:21:00.771 --> 00:21:05.370
&gt;&gt;audience #5: Do you think home cooking can
be as high culinary as these crazy creations

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:12.250
such as making foams and eating eyeballs and
other kind of small plate type things where

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:15.380
you pay a lot of money?

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:20.659
&gt;&gt;Ina: Well, a lot of this really molecular
gastronomy requires equipment and I would

00:21:20.659 --> 00:21:27.250
never have that equipment cause nobody has
it. I think home cooking is much more satisfying,

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:33.279
more traditional. I think people go out sometimes
for a satisfying meal, but also to be challenged.

00:21:33.279 --> 00:21:39.159
So, I think that-- I went to a restaurant
with a friend of mine and she ordered oyster

00:21:39.159 --> 00:21:43.740
ice cream and I was just like, "Oh God, nobody
ever needs to eat oyster ice cream."

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:44.740
[laughter]

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:51.240
So, this doesn't inspire me to wanna make
it at home, but I think you certainly can.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:56.139
But you always have the feeling, I remember
when I was first married, I read an article

00:21:56.139 --> 00:22:01.350
for young brides, which was eons ago, that
said if you spend the entire day making dinner

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:06.730
for your husband, he can't possibly appreciate
it enough. And it’s not his fault, it's

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:10.740
your fault. So, if you spend the entire day
making dinner for your friends or your family

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:14.180
or whatever, they can't possibly appreciate
it enough. They're gonna eat it in half an

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:18.669
hour no matter what it is. So, I think the
simpler it is, the more satisfying it is to

00:22:18.669 --> 00:22:23.460
them, but also to you. So, I think, and actually
I think Anthony Bourdain's fantastic. I love

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.710
what he does. I actually haven't met him,
but I love his work and he's fantastic.

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:26.710
[Ina laughs]

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:32.799
&gt;&gt;Marissa: I think it's interesting because
one of the things we do here at Google is

00:22:32.799 --> 00:22:34.480
we have this thing we call "Dog Food."

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.480
&gt;&gt;Ina: Dog Food?

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.480
[Ina laughs]

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.929
&gt;&gt;Marissa: Meaning to eat your own dog food.
So, one of the things we do is similar to

00:22:38.929 --> 00:22:43.279
you having just one oven and trying to put
yourself in the space of the users is--

00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:44.279
&gt;&gt;Ina: Yes, yes.

00:22:44.279 --> 00:22:45.279
&gt;&gt;Marissa: we make a point of using all the
Google products.

00:22:45.279 --> 00:22:46.870
&gt;&gt;Ina: That's really nice. Exactly the same
thing--

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:50.870
&gt;&gt;Marissa: So, like everything, Google Docs
runs on, we do all of our doc work on Google

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:51.870
Docs--

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:52.870
&gt;&gt;Ina: Yeah.

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:53.870
&gt;&gt;Marissa: and Calendar and Android phones
and so--

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:55.059
&gt;&gt;Ina: That's funny; eat your own dog food.

00:22:55.059 --> 00:22:58.351
&gt;&gt;Marissa: everyone uses the products so they
can really be in the place of the user, and

00:22:58.351 --> 00:22:59.880
in your case, of the viewer, the person trying
to cook.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.990
&gt;&gt;Ina: I think that's a really important point.
And actually, once I figured out a recipe,

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:09.260
that's just the beginning of how I test the
recipe. I then hand the recipe, once I figured

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:13.210
exactly what I want to do, I hand it to my
assistant and I say to her-- she's never with

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:17.750
nothing else other than a printed page-- I
say, "Make this." And I sit there and watch

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:20.049
her. And she does the craziest things--

00:23:20.049 --> 00:23:21.049
[laughter]

00:23:21.049 --> 00:23:25.120
that would never occur to me to do. And so
then I write the recipe around that because

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.950
that's what somebody at home is gonna do.
And I've been in the food business too long;

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:34.720
it would never occur to me to stir the caramel
with a spoon. So, you have to swirl it in

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:38.150
the pan. And then the next thing I do is what
I call "road testing" it, which is, I put

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:42.240
it together with a meal and I feed it to my
friends and sometimes they're invited for

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:47.259
six desserts because I wanna see which one
they wanna eat. And that's my road testing

00:23:47.259 --> 00:23:48.259
the recipes.

00:23:48.259 --> 00:23:50.370
&gt;&gt;Marissa: Road testing the coffee cake was
unbelievable.

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:51.370
[laughter]

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:52.370
&gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you.

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:53.370
&gt;&gt;Marissa: I'm hoping the recipe is in the
book.

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:54.370
&gt;&gt;Ina: It is.

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:55.370
[Ina and Marissa laugh]

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:56.370
It's on my email; I'll send it to you.

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:57.370
&gt;&gt;Marissa: Let's go ahead for another question
there.

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:04.370
&gt;&gt;audience #6: Would you mind sharing a story
of making a dish that went horribly wrong?

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:06.759
[Ina and audience #6 laugh]

00:24:06.759 --> 00:24:10.590
&gt;&gt;Ina: Horribly wrong. I tend not to make
something that I haven't made before, literally

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:15.409
even for dinner for Jeffrey. I do remember
when we first got married, I made some recipe

00:24:15.409 --> 00:24:19.070
that had ground beef and corn in it that was
just dreadful.

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:20.070
[laughter]

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:24.190
Something that's just gone horribly wrong.
I remember a dessert just didn't happen right.

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:28.700
I mean, I don't know what happened and it
was the genesis. I thought, "Oh my God. People

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:33.429
are coming in like, an hour, and I don't have
dessert." And I decided, well, I had some

00:24:33.429 --> 00:24:36.690
creme fraiche and honey and vanilla and I
made honey vanilla creme fraiche for the berries

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:40.620
that I had in the refrigerator. And it was
the genesis of one of the best recipes I've

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:44.210
written. It was really simple and it was,
it's out of the disastrous that something

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:45.210
good comes out of it.

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:46.210
[laughter]

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:47.210
Hi.

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:57.750
&gt;&gt;audience #7: Hi. I have just a quick question
related to the last question. How do you handle

00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:02.710
it when a recipe fails and you have company?
Do you apologize? Do you ignore it? What's

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.370
the best steps of handling and communicating
the disaster?

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:06.790
&gt;&gt;Ina: I say nobody ever needs to know.

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:07.790
[laughter]

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:13.889
It's that simple. I remember being at a friend’s
house for a dinner party and we're all, it

00:25:13.889 --> 00:25:18.860
was like, 20 people for dinner and we were
all having cocktails and everybody’s having

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:23.850
a good time and it got later and later and
later. And everybody said, "You go into the

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:28.000
kitchen and find out what's going on." So,
I went in and it turns out she had set out

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.980
all the first courses on the table and her
two dogs had jumped on the table and gone

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:35.850
all the way down the table and eaten everybody's
first course.

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:36.850
[laughter]

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:39.690
And she was trying to make a first course.
And I said to her, "You know what? Just forget

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:44.400
the first course. Let's just have dinner,
we'll sit down and nobody will ever know."

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.440
So, nobody ever needs to see you sweat.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.440
&gt;&gt;audience #7: Great.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.500
&gt;&gt;Ina: And if all else fails, there's always
take-out pizza. And you can, a friend of mine

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:56.700
actually has what she calls her "disaster
Christmas party." Every year something horrible

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:01.210
happens and they just laugh about it and those
are the ones -- the caterer got stuck in traffic

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:05.110
and then the sofa caught on fire one time.

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:06.110
[laughter]

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:08.549
It's always something, and those are the best
parties.

00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:09.549
[laughter]

00:26:09.549 --> 00:26:14.799
So, you just have a good laugh about it and
nobody ever needs to know.

00:26:14.799 --> 00:26:16.769
&gt;&gt;audience #7: Thank you.

00:26:16.769 --> 00:26:22.870
&gt;&gt;audience #8: Hi. As a beginning home cook,
out of college where all you cook with is

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:25.400
a microwave and whatever you steal from a
cafe.

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.400
[Ina laughs]

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:30.169
What are the three basic things that you need
for a home cook -- because I think watching

00:26:30.169 --> 00:26:33.821
TV shows, it can be very overwhelming. They
have a Kitchen Aid, a food processor and everything.

00:26:33.821 --> 00:26:38.590
&gt;&gt;Ina: I'm thinking if there's anything that
you can't cook if you have knives and half-sheet

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:44.470
pans. You can make roast chicken, you can
make roast carrots, and maybe one sauce pan

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:51.039
that you can make some pasta in. You really,
this is a book I'd really love to write is

00:26:51.039 --> 00:26:55.090
the only ten recipes you need to know, because
if you can make a roast chicken, you can make

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:59.870
roast Cornish hens; you can make a roast turkey.
It's the same process; it's just slightly

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:04.399
different times. If you can make a chicken
pot pie, you can make a lobster pot pie; you

00:27:04.399 --> 00:27:08.679
can make a vegetable pot pie. So, choose one
thing, like a roast chicken, which is actually

00:27:08.679 --> 00:27:13.250
really simple to do; test it when you don't
have any guests, so you learn how to do it

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:16.299
and just keep making it over and over again.
Hi.

00:27:16.299 --> 00:27:18.139
&gt;&gt;audience #9: Thanks for coming here today
and--

00:27:18.139 --> 00:27:19.320
&gt;&gt;Ina: Nice to see you again.

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.759
&gt;&gt;audience #9: my wife is definitely one of
your biggest fans.

00:27:21.759 --> 00:27:22.759
&gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you.

00:27:22.759 --> 00:27:26.059
&gt;&gt;audience #9: So, we talked a little bit
about how you got into television, but you

00:27:26.059 --> 00:27:30.649
also made the jump from the White House to
the Barefoot Contessa. And I was just wondering

00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:34.781
if you could talk a little bit about what
inspired you to do that and what advice you

00:27:34.781 --> 00:27:39.639
would give to other people who are looking
to make that sort of a career jump.

00:27:39.639 --> 00:27:44.769
&gt;&gt;Ina: Well, you know, when I was in my 20s,
my husband was in the White House in the State

00:27:44.769 --> 00:27:51.289
Department; he worked for Kissinger. And I
just thought I was the leading generation

00:27:51.289 --> 00:27:57.139
of women that were starting to work; it never
occurred to me to have a career. And so, in

00:27:57.139 --> 00:28:01.549
my 20s, I wanted to grow up to be Jeffrey.
And when I hit 30, I thought, "He's great,

00:28:01.549 --> 00:28:02.860
but I don't wanna be him."

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:04.190
[laughter]

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:11.690
He's like the intellectual in the family.
I just wanna have fun. So, what I used to

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:14.960
do when I wasn't working was have dinner parties
 -- every Saturday, I'd have a dinner party

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:19.299
and I'd work my way through Julia Child's
"Mastering the Art of French Cooking", Volume

00:28:19.299 --> 00:28:23.230
I and Volume II, and I thought, "Well, maybe
I should be doing that instead." And I was

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:27.649
sitting in my office in the White House, trying
to figure out what I wanted to be when I grew

00:28:27.649 --> 00:28:33.650
up and there was an ad for a specialty foods
store for sale. And I went home and I said

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:36.759
to Jeffrey, "I gotta do something else." And
he said, "Well, pick something you think would

00:28:36.759 --> 00:28:40.630
be really fun. Pick something. Don't worry
about making money. Think about what you love

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:44.940
to do because if you love it, you'll be really
good at it." And I said, "Funny you should

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:45.940
mention it."

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:46.940
[laughter]

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:50.249
I saw this ad and bless his heart, he said,
"Let's go look at it tomorrow." So, I really

00:28:50.249 --> 00:28:54.749
had no idea what I was getting into, but I
knew I was going. The White House wasn't an

00:28:54.749 --> 00:29:00.289
option anymore. Nuclear energy policy wasn't
my passion. And I loved, if it's anybody's,

00:29:00.289 --> 00:29:01.289
I don't know.

00:29:01.289 --> 00:29:02.289
[laughter]

00:29:02.289 --> 00:29:03.289
It must be somebody's.

00:29:03.289 --> 00:29:05.170
&gt;&gt;audience #9: Actually, I do energy policy
here at Google and I used to work in the White

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:06.170
House doing energy policy.

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:07.170
&gt;&gt;Ina: I'm sorry?

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:08.330
&gt;&gt;audience #9: I used to work in the White
House doing energy policy--

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:09.330
&gt;&gt;Ina: You're kidding.

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:11.029
&gt;&gt;audience #9: and I actually do energy work
here at Google.

00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:13.159
&gt;&gt;Ina: Isn't it great?

00:29:13.159 --> 00:29:16.360
&gt;&gt;audience 9: But it's my passion.

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.360
&gt;&gt;Ina: Congratulations.

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.360
[uproarious laughter]

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.360
What administration did you work in?

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.360
&gt;&gt;audience #9: Clinton.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.770
&gt;&gt;Ina: Oh my goodness. That's fabulous. So
you know exactly how I feel.

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:23.770
[Ina laughs]

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:29.120
&gt;&gt;audience #9: But I'm not looking to make
a career change, just so you know.

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.120
[laughter]

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.120
Thank you.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.440
&gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you. Congratulations, that's
a great career move.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.440
[laughter]

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:37.940
&gt;&gt;Marissa: So, we have time for just a few
more questions. Let's, we got, I think, three

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:38.940
here. So, yeah.

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:39.940
&gt;&gt;audience #10: Hi, Ina.

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:40.940
&gt;&gt;Ina: Hi.

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:44.470
&gt;&gt;audience #10: Great to see you here at Google.
I am not much of a cook, but my wife is a

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:45.470
huge fan.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:46.470
&gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you.

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:48.679
&gt;&gt;audience #10: With the tablet computer set
to invade kitchens, could you give us an--

00:29:48.679 --> 00:29:52.230
&gt;&gt;Ina: I'm so sorry. Can you speak a little
louder? I can't quite hear.

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:54.559
&gt;&gt;audience #10: With the tablet computers--

00:29:54.559 --> 00:29:55.559
&gt;&gt;Ina: Yes.

00:29:55.559 --> 00:29:56.559
&gt;&gt;audience #10: set to invade kitchens--

00:29:56.559 --> 00:29:57.559
&gt;&gt;Ina: Mm-hmm.

00:29:57.559 --> 00:29:58.559
&gt;&gt;audience #10: Hopefully, lots of Google-based
tablets.

00:29:58.559 --> 00:29:59.559
&gt;&gt;Ina: Yes.

00:29:59.559 --> 00:30:00.559
[laughter]

00:30:00.559 --> 00:30:01.559
&gt;&gt;Marissa: Android tablets to invade kitchens.

00:30:01.559 --> 00:30:02.559
[laughter]

00:30:02.559 --> 00:30:06.659
&gt;&gt;audience #10: Could you give us an artist’s
perspective on how you see technology helping

00:30:06.659 --> 00:30:09.039
us become better cooks?

00:30:09.039 --> 00:30:13.820
&gt;&gt;Ina: Well, I think one of the things about
tablets that can actually work is, for example,

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:21.440
I have my latest book on an e-book through
Amazon and I know it’s a thing that you're

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:26.049
carrying with you, so I thought, "Well, how
can we make this more appropriate for shopping,

00:30:26.049 --> 00:30:32.249
say?" So, all the recipes are in the— it's
the whole book-- but also every ingredient,

00:30:32.249 --> 00:30:37.279
you can click on the ingredient and it tells
you what a Bosque pear looks like and it tells

00:30:37.279 --> 00:30:41.460
you how to know whether a Bosque pear is ripe
when it's brown or green. Or should it be

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:47.350
soft or should it be hard when it's ripe?
Or, you go to the olive oil section and it

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:51.840
says there are a million olive oils. You just
can't imagine what to choose. They are the

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:55.960
two that I recommend; one's more inexpensive,
one's more expensive. So, it can have a lot

00:30:55.960 --> 00:31:00.429
of information for you and I think it will
go towards when you get to, you can tap on

00:31:00.429 --> 00:31:06.820
the-- when you're cooking--you can tap on
the word "whip" and you'll see what it means

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.900
if you're really a beginning cook, if you
need all that help. If you're not a beginning

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:13.970
cook, you just cruise right past it. So, I
think it can have a lot of depth that just

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:18.440
a plain printed recipe can't do. So, hopefully
that's where we're going.

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:24.409
&gt;&gt;audience #11: I just wanna say, I absolutely
adore you and my kids and I have a ritual

00:31:24.409 --> 00:31:27.409
every night that we have you on in the background
while we're making dinner together.

00:31:27.409 --> 00:31:29.580
&gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you. I love that you're making
dinner with your kids. That's great.

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.759
&gt;&gt;audience #11: So, they're gonna be thrilled
that I [ ]. But I just think you're so warm

00:31:31.759 --> 00:31:33.760
and loving and you're, it just really comes
across.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:34.760
&gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you.

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:35.760
&gt;&gt;audience #11: But my question for you is
when I read that Barefoot Contessa was sold,

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:40.509
I was really wondering why you didn't buy
it back at that point and why you let it go?

00:31:40.509 --> 00:31:45.919
And where is it now? And I've always been
curious about that.

00:31:45.919 --> 00:31:46.919
&gt;&gt;Ina: About the store?

00:31:46.919 --> 00:31:47.919
&gt;&gt;audience #11: Yeah, exactly.

00:31:47.919 --> 00:31:53.049
&gt;&gt;Ina: Well, actually, when I made the decision
that it was time to sell the store to the

00:31:53.049 --> 00:31:58.470
employees, and that I was gonna take it off,
it never occurred to me. I thought that era

00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:02.909
of Barefoot Contessa was over and I was gonna
do something else. And then when I started

00:32:02.909 --> 00:32:05.980
writing books, I said to them, "Well, do you
want me to write Barefoot Contessa books?

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:11.210
Cause they own the store. Or, should I do
Ina Garten books?" And they said, "No, no,

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:15.480
no. Please, please, do Barefoot Contessa books."
So, as time went on and they decided they

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:19.360
wanted to go on, one wanted to have a restaurant
and the other one had children or didn't want

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.519
to work anymore, I actually bought the business
back.

00:32:21.519 --> 00:32:22.519
&gt;&gt;audience #11: Oh, OK.

00:32:22.519 --> 00:32:24.260
&gt;&gt;Ina: So, I do own Barefoot Contessa. Yeah,
so it worked.

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:28.169
&gt;&gt;audience #11: Oh, good. Now, where does
Jeffrey go? I always wonder, where's he going?

00:32:28.169 --> 00:32:29.169
&gt;&gt;Ina: Yale.

00:32:29.169 --> 00:32:30.169
&gt;&gt;audience #11: OK.

00:32:30.169 --> 00:32:31.169
[laughter]

00:32:31.169 --> 00:32:32.169
&gt;&gt;Ina: He was the Dean of the, well, he was
a lot of things. He was an investment banker;

00:32:32.169 --> 00:32:33.169
he was in the Clinton Administration--

00:32:33.169 --> 00:32:34.169
&gt;&gt;audience #11: OK.

00:32:34.169 --> 00:32:38.539
&gt;&gt;Ina: and he was the Dean of the business
school at Yale. I know he looks like a crazy

00:32:38.539 --> 00:32:39.539
person.

00:32:39.539 --> 00:32:40.539
[laughter]

00:32:40.539 --> 00:32:43.830
Like all he does is just sit there or go shopping
for oranges for me on the show.

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:44.830
[laughter]

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:45.830
&gt;&gt;audience #11: Right.

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:46.830
&gt;&gt;Ina: But he's really a smart guy.

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:49.360
&gt;&gt;audience #11: Well, he always comes back
for his roasted chicken on Friday night.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:54.710
&gt;&gt;Ina: Right, that's right. On Monday, he
goes to New Haven where he now teaches at

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:59.100
Yale, among other things, and then comes back
on Friday. That's the roast chicken night.

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:00.100
[laughter]

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:01.100
&gt;&gt;audience #11: [ ] where does he come from?
OK. Thank you.

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:03.889
&gt;&gt;Marissa: Ina and Jeffrey are the power couple.
In fact, I have lots of emails from Googlers

00:33:03.889 --> 00:33:06.850
who had gotten their Yale MBAs, including
Lazlo Bock, who's--

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:07.850
&gt;&gt;Ina: Oh, really? Oh.

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:09.879
&gt;&gt;Marissa: our head of HR here.

00:33:09.879 --> 00:33:10.999
&gt;&gt;Ina: Oh, fabulous.

00:33:10.999 --> 00:33:13.690
&gt;&gt;Marissa: And so he wanted to come and say
hello because he was like, "Oh, I know Ina

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:14.690
and Jeffrey."

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:15.690
[laughter]

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:18.740
&gt;&gt;Ina: Yeah, Jeffrey has his own rep. I was
having dinner one night at a restaurant in

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:24.730
East Hampton with Susan Stroman, who is the
producer, no, the director and choreographer

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:31.179
of "The Producers", among other things, and
Mel Brooks and Nathan Lane and Jeffrey and

00:33:31.179 --> 00:33:35.480
me. And somebody from across the restaurant
was coming towards us and Susan Stroman, who

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:39.309
we call "Stro" said, "Oh my God. I don't know
who she's gonna, who this persons gonna come

00:33:39.309 --> 00:33:43.519
after. Is it Mel? Oh, he's gonna be thrilled.
Is it Nathan? He's gonna be really upset."

00:33:43.519 --> 00:33:46.610
And the person came right over and said, "Oh
my God. Jeffrey Garten."

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:47.610
[laughter]

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:53.590
So, he has his own base of fans.

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:54.590
[laughter]

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:57.100
It was like, "Get out of the way, Mel Brooks."

00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:58.100
[laughter]

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:02.559
&gt;&gt;Marissa: OK, so we'll take one more question
and then we'll have casual questions after.

00:34:02.559 --> 00:34:03.559
Yeah?

00:34:03.559 --> 00:34:04.559
&gt;&gt;audience #12: Hi, Ina.

00:34:04.559 --> 00:34:05.559
&gt;&gt;Ina: Hi.

00:34:05.559 --> 00:34:08.820
&gt;&gt;audience #12: I was just wondering if you
would ever consider being on Iron Chef, and

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:13.980
if you were, who would you battle and what
would you want the secret ingredient to be?

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:14.980
[laughter]

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:20.810
&gt;&gt;Ina: Well, I'd definitely pick a non-cook.
You know, the truth is, I'm not a restaurant

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:25.620
chef. I can make something perfectly delicious
if I have enough time to do it, but I admire

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:30.040
those guys enormously. You really have to
be a line cook and a chef to be able to do

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:35.750
those. I mean, if somebody gave me oysters
and heavy cream and said, "Make something

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:38.020
out of this." I'd have a total meltdown.

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:39.020
[laughter]

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:43.490
So, I actually cook the way you do. I'm really
a home cook. I know how to do it, I've had

00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:47.200
a little more experience, so it's a little
easier, but I'm really not in that category

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:50.590
at all. I don't consider, I consider myself
a business person who cooks, rather than a

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:51.590
chef.

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:55.530
&gt;&gt;audience #12: Who would you wanna cook aside,
though, if you could have a partner. Who would

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:56.850
you choose to be your partner?

00:34:56.850 --> 00:35:00.600
&gt;&gt;Ina: Well, I love Bobby Flay. I love the
way he, I love his energy and I love what

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:05.660
he does. So, I'd choose him and then I'd just
watch him.

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:06.660
[laughter]

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:09.460
I'd be around going, "What should I do now?"

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:15.260
&gt;&gt;Marissa: So, this has been really, really
delightful. I know we have lots of people

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:16.900
who want autographs and photos and want a
chance to chat with you.

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.150
&gt;&gt;Ina: I'd love to.

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:21.180
&gt;&gt;Marissa: Ina's gonna be here for probably
about the next half an hour and then she's

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:22.180
gonna get to experience a Google lunch.

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:23.180
&gt;&gt;Ina: Yay!!

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:24.180
&gt;&gt;Marissa: So, you can see how our chefs cook.
