00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.340
&gt;&gt;Female commentator: Hi, everyone.

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:11.920
I grew up eating meat. I still eat meat and
I cook with meat, and the argument I often

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:20.869
make is I-I don't want my palate to be limited,
what-what I, the flavors and colors and that

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.310
I put on a plate, I don't wanna be limited
by.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:34.700
I'm also a Mom and I have a beloved dog. I
still use the present tense. I had a beloved

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:44.520
dog, Barney, and who I sometimes confused
with my son who often looked at me and would

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.940
go, "Mom, I'm the two-legged one."

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.910
[laughter]

00:00:48.910 --> 00:01:01.170
So I have this completely chaotic relationship
with animals and I welcomed when I was handed

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.450
Jonathan Safran Foer's book, Eating Animals,
I-I welcomed somebody who could, was maybe

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.779
going to make an argument about vegetarianism.
And that is what the book is not.

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:21.130
It is a subjective, starting from his childhood
he describes his relationship to animals and

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:29.869
to eating animals and goes from there to a
very big view about what maybe our relationship

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.030
and our responsibilities are and should be.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:42.159
It's a different argument than Michael Pollan's
argument. Michael Pollan is some, is somebody

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:49.249
who we on the food team refer to often and
we-we often refer to Food Rules, his book,

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:50.619
as-as our bible.

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:58.309
So I-I-I really enjoyed reading Jonathan's
book very, very much and-and I can't wait

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:59.469
to hear more from him.

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:02.009
So here he is.

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.670
[applause]

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:13.709
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: Thank you so much.
It was a very thoughtful introduction and

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.750
I found that I was quite worried when I published
the book or when I anticipated the publication

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:27.400
of the book because I thought that I would
have a certain set of built in natural enemies.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.640
And I had assumed that chefs were gonna be
one kind of enemy and that farmers were gonna

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.299
be another kind of enemy.

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:41.079
And what I found since the book has been in
the world and I've been able to talk to lots

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.650
of different kinds of audiences is that the
strongest or the most enthusiastic response

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.319
has actually been from chefs and farmers;
farmers in particular.

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.340
And that the most negative responses have
come from where I thought the most positive

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.610
responses would come which is the animal rights
movement who-who often feel as if the book

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.329
didn't go far enough.

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:06.671
But it means a lot to me that-that-that you
would speak so generously about the book.

00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:11.890
And I think that part of the solution to this
problem and it seems to me whatever side you

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.660
come down on in terms of eating meat or not
eating meat or what kind of meat, you really

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.829
have to recognize that there's a problem.

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:24.959
We have a serious problem and part of the
solution is gonna be in making visible these

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:32.730
presently invisible alliances like between
someone who's concerned with animal welfare

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.909
and a chef who likes to cook meat.

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:42.329
We're used to thinking of these people at
being on opposites ends of a spectrum or a

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.480
cattle rancher and an activist at PETA. We
think that these represent the extremes.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.120
And my experience when I met these people
and heard their stories was-was that I-I was

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.441
surprised to find that they're on the same
end of the spectrum and opposite people who

00:03:58.441 --> 00:04:04.230
are willfully ignorant or willfully forget
that we have this horrible problem in front

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.230
of us.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:13.030
Well I'm grateful to be speaking to you. It's
very, you, I'm sure you take for granted how

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.391
unusual a place this is –

00:04:14.391 --> 00:04:15.391
[laughter]

00:04:15.391 --> 00:04:18.889
but it was a real revelation walking in here
today.

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:25.030
I am a layman with computers and technology
and I am I guess still under the impression

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.030
that Google is like a search engine and if
you need to find something you type Google

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.460
and you enter it and you get a whole bunch
of responses. And I can't for the life of

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.200
me imagine why this requires so many people
 --

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.500
[laughter]

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.500
and so many buildings.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.580
[laughter]

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.759
But as I walked the campus I say, "Oh a lot
bicycles. They're very colorful." And the

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:49.270
person who was walking me said, "Oh, Google
provides us bicycles."

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.810
And in the lobby there was a-a-a drink, a
cooler filled with drinks and it was unlocked

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.500
and it didn't have any place to insert money
 --

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.580
[laughter]

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.270
and he said, "Oh, Google provides those."

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.800
I started getting this image of a place that
is really nice to work until I went into the

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:12.840
men's room and I noticed that there were toothbrushes
on shelves. And suddenly I understood everything

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:13.840
 --

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.840
[laughter]

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.840
that was going on here.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.840
[laughter]

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.139
That it's all down payments on your time.
And toothbrushes at work. What an absolutely

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:21.490
horrible, miserable thing.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:22.490
[laughter]

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.120
My God, I'm so glad I don't have to have a
toothbrush where I work.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:33.620
But then again I don't work anywhere so I'm,
I guess I'm unusually lucky.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.280
So I thought what I would do is talk for a
little bit about this book, the research that

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.360
went into it and why I decided to write it.
I'm not a journalist, I'm not an activist,

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.750
I'm not a philosopher, I'm not even an animal
person, I'm not really an environmentalist.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:53.900
And most of the people who've become engaged
with this subject in any kind of devoted way

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:54.931
are one of those things.

00:05:54.931 --> 00:06:01.379
I thought I'd talk about why I did get involved
with it. Give you some sense of what the book

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:07.740
is and some of the conclusions that I reached
and then leave as much time as possible for

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.860
something resembling a conversation, because
this is a-a subject that is very well served

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:20.740
by conversation and very poorly served by
a lecture. It's, we perceive it to be very

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.259
controversial and very touchy.

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:27.510
As I was saying when I anticipated the book
coming out I thought that, I thought it was

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.990
gonna be a really difficult and trying and
maybe even dangerous experience.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:40.150
I had heard stories from friends of mine who
had written books about food, not even targeting

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:47.260
the meat industry in particular, but targeting-targeting
the industrialized food system who at various

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.970
times had to have body guards when they would
give readings because they got so, had so

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.930
many threatening people come up to them afterwards
at the signing.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:01.840
And I thought that I was really going for
the bullseye of this unfortunate target and

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:07.939
that I had imagined many times, for some reason
my mind would cling to the image of someone

00:07:07.939 --> 00:07:10.310
throwing ground beef at me at a reading.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.310
[laughter]

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:15.099
And I became so convinced that this would
happen. It's probably just narcissism, but

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:18.990
I became so convinced it would happen that
I would think, I go, "What's the right move

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.860
if someone should do that? Do I pretend it
didn't happen and just read as if --

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:23.860
[laughter]

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:30.290
there weren't meat stuck to the wall behind
me? Or throw it back?" Or when somebody would

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:34.750
inevitably in the audience say, "Hey, kick
that guy out," would I then say, "No, no,

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:39.520
no let the guy sit. I wanna talk to this person"
and try to engage this person. Anyway it never

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.520
happened.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:47.849
And no one ever got angry with me and most
surprisingly no one ever disagreed with me.

00:07:47.849 --> 00:07:53.030
And I don't think this is because I'm such
a persuasive arguer. I think it's because

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.129
the case against factory farming is so persuasive.

00:07:56.129 --> 00:08:00.880
I spent three years researching it and I've
spent about a year talking about it now and

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.139
I've yet to meet the person who wants to publicly
stand up and defend it.

00:08:05.139 --> 00:08:10.699
And there's been absolutely no response from
the industry itself which is perhaps the most

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:16.449
shocking thing I've encountered in-in-in the
process of researching and writing this book.

00:08:16.449 --> 00:08:18.330
I mean it's insane if you think about it.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:25.629
If I wrote a book about Google and said, "Google
is an evil company for these reasons. Here

00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:33.080
are 80 pages of ed notes citing facts about
Google's horrificness and here are testimonies

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:37.260
from former Google employees explaining why
it's a horrible company and here's why we

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.431
need less Google in the world."

00:08:38.431 --> 00:08:43.650
If I were do that rest assured Google would
respond somehow or someone would respond on

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:49.490
Google's behalf. I'd probably be sued into
oblivion first of all, and secondly people

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:54.180
would say, somebody would say, "Either you've
got it completely wrong or you're not telling

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:59.030
the full story and here's the rest of the
story."

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:04.950
And that never came. There was no response
from a meat industry that has one of the most

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.130
powerful lobbies in the world.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:12.620
And so this suggests one of two things: either
I got it all right, all of my facts are right;

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:18.720
my argument is right and they are effectively
raising the white flag and submitting, which

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.250
is not the case.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:28.450
Or they are recognizing that the expansion
of this conversation will-will, is-is against

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:33.340
their interests. That the more people think
and talk about this and examine what's going

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:37.761
on, what we have, and what our choices are,
the less inclined they will be to eat meat.

00:09:37.761 --> 00:09:43.600
Now I-I've been a little bit sloppy so far
in speaking about meat and speaking about

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.051
factory farming as if they were perfectly
interchangeable, and they're not.

00:09:47.051 --> 00:09:53.181
Everybody knows what meat is. Factory farming
is-is quite hard to define because it's not

00:09:53.181 --> 00:10:00.310
any particular set of technology so much as
a mindset that I think is most simply described

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:07.130
as farming that takes nature as an obstacle
to be overcome, rather than any kind of guide.

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:14.230
So the idea that sick animals are better than
healthy animals. The idea that environmental

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:21.930
destruction is-is better in a business model
than sustainability; the idea that human health

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:23.910
is of no great regard.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:28.640
So 99% of the animals that we eat in this
country now come from factory farms; less

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:33.680
than 1% come from the kinds of farms that
probably everybody in this room holds an image

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.810
of in his or her mind when thinking about
farming.

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:44.050
We imagine a barn and animals on grass and
sunshine and soil and hay and fence posts

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:47.860
and a farmer and his wife and so on.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:54.610
And that has no correlation to reality or
at least it represents the tiniest little

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:55.700
sliver of reality.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:11:02.870
Reality is animals being raised in extreme
concentrations; almost always indoors; almost

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:08.460
always fed antibiotics and other drugs from
birth until death; almost always kept in conditions

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:14.550
that would be illegal if they were dogs or
cats; environmental destruction is built into

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.430
the business model.

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:21.570
A company like Smithfield had 7,000 violations
of the Clean Water Act in one year. So if

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:28.350
they'd had 10 we would say, "That's regrettable."
If they'd had 100 we would say, "Someone needs

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:34.110
to keep a better eye on this company." But
7,000 starts to seem like it's on purpose;

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:37.950
like it's as much as they can get away with.
And as it turns out they can get away with

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.420
really anything.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:44.920
Animal agriculture is the number one cause
of global warming. The U.N. has said it's

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:50.050
one of the top two or three causes of every
significant environmental problem on the planet

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:57.140
locally and globally: air pollution, water
pollution, deforestation, loss of biodiversity.

00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:01.500
The Climate Chief of the United Kingdom said
in an interview a couple of months ago, and

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:07.250
this is not a henchman of PETA and this is
not a vegetarian. He said, "That the only

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:10.230
way to save the planet is a global movement
toward vegetarianism."

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:15.240
Al Gore now talks about the need to reduce
meat consumption.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:21.810
We're at a point where we know that we cannot
continue to think of ourselves as environmentalists

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:26.320
while eating factory farm meat regularly.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:31.770
And it's a very strange subject because as
I was saying we perceive it to be divisive.

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:35.790
We think that there's gonna be an argument.
We think people are gonna feel aggressive

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:42.930
or defensive whenever we talk about meat,
despite the fact that it represents our most

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:47.410
important relationship to animals. And there's
not a person in this room or not a person

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:52.130
in where ever these other rooms are who is
indifferent to animals. Such people don't

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:57.610
exist. Ninety-six percent of Americans think
that animals deserve legal protection. Seventy-six

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:04.480
percent of Americans think that farmed animals
deserve strict protection from cruelty.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:12.700
It's pretty wild to think of anything that
95% or 75% of Americans agree on at this point.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:17.970
Whether or not you believe in global warming
or not, you believe it would matter if the

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:23.770
globe was warming, and you believe that it
matters that the quality of the air that we

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:25.800
breathe and the quality of the water that
we drink matters.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:31.610
And so as I was saying we're in this odd position
where we have this daily act. And for most

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:37.370
people it's two times a day and for some people
it's three times a day that is our most important

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:41.740
relationship to the environment and our most
important relationship to the animal world.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:46.270
And yet so many of us find ways not to think
about it.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:50.540
So when writing this book I wanted to find
a way to think about it and find a way to

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.920
encourage other people to think about it.
It's not any kind of straight forward case

00:13:53.920 --> 00:14:00.130
for vegetarianism, but it is a very strong
case for engaging with this problem.

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:05.850
So I thought what I would do is read a tiny
bit so you get a sense of what-what the book

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:10.800
is like; the ways in which it is sort of journalism
and sort of philosophy, but not really either

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.030
of those things and much more of a story.

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:18.510
And then, and then we can have a kind of conversation
about it.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:23.000
So I'm gonna read, begin by reading a letter
that I wrote near the beginning of the research

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.540
that I did. I thought that this research would
take me a month or two months and that I would

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:34.280
do it through Google and a little bit of reading
and maybe a couple of short trips.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:39.750
It ended up taking three and a half years
in part because it's such a complicated subject

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:41.490
and in part because of letters like this.

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:45.640
"To Whom It May Concern at Tyson Foods.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:51.870
I'm following up on my previous letters of
January 10th, February 27th, March 15th, April

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:55.060
20th, May 15th, and June 7th.

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:59.800
To reiterate, I'm a new father eager to learn
as much as I can about the meat industry in

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.250
an effort to make informed decisions about
what to feed my son.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:07.550
Given that Tyson Foods is the world's largest
processor and marketer of chicken, beef, and

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:10.170
pork, your company is an obvious place to
start.

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:15.360
I'd like to visit some of your farms and speak
with company representatives about everything

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.630
from the nuts and bolts of how your farms
operate to animal welfare and environmental

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:23.980
issues. If possible, I'd also like to speak
with some of your farmers.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:28.550
I can make myself available at just about
any time and on relatively short notice and

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:30.930
I'm happy to travel as is needed.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:35.250
Given your family centered philosophy and
recent, 'It's what your family deserves,'

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:40.480
advertising campaign, I assume you'll appreciate
my desire to see for myself where my son's

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.030
food comes from.

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.290
Thanks so much for your continued consideration.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:45.290
Best,

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:46.560
Jonathan Safran Foer"

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:53.380
And so Tyson Food is not any worse than any
other company in the meat industry in America.

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.110
It's not any better either.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:16:03.390
I sent dozens of these letters. I made dozens
of phone calls and I was met always with evasion

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:10.940
or silence or, "We'll get back to you," or
"It's not a very good time for us," or "Because

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:15.370
of this biosecurity risk we're actually not
able to have visitors."

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:20.780
And I-I-I basically wasn't able to see anything
this way. There was a way that I was able

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:21.970
to see things which I'll get to in a minute.

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:32.150
Now this is a quick aside, small and family
farmers that less than 1% of the industry

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:39.330
responded very, very differently. When I would
ask to see a farm they were enthusiastic to-to-to

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:42.980
host me and they would answer any questions
I had even when they knew the answers were

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.440
not flattering.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:49.790
I was always forthright about who I was and
what I was interested in finding out and what

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:52.730
I might write about it.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:57.440
But it's-it's a worthwhile little test if-if
you or somebody who eats meat open your refrigerator

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:02.230
and look at the label on the first thing you
pull out and just for fun call the company

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.649
or write a letter to them. Just because why
not?

00:17:04.649 --> 00:17:10.620
Because in life we feel like we deserve such
answers especially when we're giving a lot

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:15.760
of money to these places and more importantly
we're ingesting their products; we're bringing

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:19.769
them into our bodies and feeding them to loved
ones quite often.

00:17:19.769 --> 00:17:26.569
And as far as I can tell the meat industry
and the military are the great exceptions

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:29.789
in American business; certainly in food.

00:17:29.789 --> 00:17:33.580
If you wanted to find out where your apple
juice came from you could pretty easily get

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:36.179
an invitation to the orchard and the processing
facility.

00:17:36.179 --> 00:17:40.690
If you wanna know how your bagel is made they'll
let you behind the counter at the bakery or

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:45.649
deli, but here there is just nothing to be
learned.

00:17:45.649 --> 00:17:51.690
So I investigated other ways of learning if
they weren't going to make themselves available

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:57.789
there had to be ways of getting into these
farms. And what I ended up doing was what-what

00:17:57.789 --> 00:17:59.740
I'm about to read.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:03.460
"I'm wearing black in the middle of the night
in the middle of nowhere."

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:06.220
This is, by the way, not all that far from
here.

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:11.580
"There are surgical booties around my disposable
shoes and latex gloves on my shaking hands.

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:16.649
I pat myself down quintuple checking that
I have everything: red filtered flashlight,

00:18:16.649 --> 00:18:23.580
picture I.D., 40 dollars cash, video camera,
copy of California Penal Code 597e –

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:24.580
[laughter]

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:29.299
bottle of water, not for me, silenced cell
phone, and blow horn."

00:18:29.299 --> 00:18:32.880
"We kill the engine and roll the final 30
yards to the spot we scouted out earlier in

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:38.360
the day on one of half dozen drive bys. This
isn't the scary part yet."

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:43.940
I'm accompanied tonight by an animal activist
who I refer to as C in the book.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:48.690
"It wasn't until I picked her up that I realized
I'd been picturing someone who inspired confidence,

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:53.929
but C is short and wispy. She wears aviator
glasses, flip flops, and a retainer."

00:18:53.929 --> 00:18:55.899
I could be describing half of the people in
the room actually.

00:18:55.899 --> 00:18:57.210
[laughter]

00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:00.509
"'You have a lot of cars I observed.'" I could
be describing myself to be frank.

00:19:00.509 --> 00:19:03.879
"'You have a lot of cars I observed' as we
pulled away from her house.

00:19:03.879 --> 00:19:06.419
'I live with my parents for now,' she said.

00:19:06.419 --> 00:19:10.419
As we drove down the highway known to locals
as Blood Run, both because of the frequency

00:19:10.419 --> 00:19:15.370
of accidents and the number of trucks that
use the road to transport animals to slaughter,

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:19.620
she explained 'that sometimes entry is as
simple as walking through an open gate, although

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:24.990
this has become increasingly rare given concerns
about biosecurity and trouble makers.

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:30.620
More often these days fences have to be hyped.
Occasionally lights and alarms go off. Every

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:34.990
now and then there are dogs; every now and
then unleashed.'

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:38.710
She once encountered a bull that was left
to roam among the sheds waiting to impale

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:46.179
snooping vegetarians. 'Bull' I half echoed,
half asked with now obviously linguistic intent.

00:19:46.179 --> 00:19:47.510
'Male cow,' she said brusquely --

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:48.590
[laughter]

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:53.090
as she, as she sorted through a bag of what
appeared to be dental equipment. 'And if you

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:56.799
and I should tonight encounter a bull,' 'we
won't' she said.

00:19:56.799 --> 00:20:00.960
A tailgater forced me behind a truck packed
tight and piled high with chickens on their

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:06.170
way to slaughter. 'Well hypothetically.' 'Stand
very still,' she advised, 'I don't think they

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:08.659
see stationary objects.'

00:20:08.659 --> 00:20:13.289
If the question is if things ever gone seriously
wrong one of C's night visits the answer is

00:20:13.289 --> 00:20:14.730
a resounding, 'Yes.'

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:19.909
There was the time she fell into a manure
pit a dying rabbit under each arm and found

00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:22.980
herself up to her neck, literally, in literally
deep shit.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.260
[laughter]

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:29.840
And the night she was forced to spend in construction
paper blackness with 20,000 miserable animals

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:35.080
and their fumes, having accidentally locked
herself in the shed. And the near fatal case

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:39.929
of campylobacter one of her cohorts picked
up from picking up a chicken.

00:20:39.929 --> 00:20:42.730
Feathers were collecting on the windshield.
I turned on the wiper and asked, 'What's all

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:46.830
that stuff in your bag?' 'In case we need
to make a rescue.'

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:49.860
I had no idea what she was referring to and
I didn't like it.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:54.649
'Now you said you don't think bulls see stationary
objects. Wouldn't this qualify though as one

00:20:54.649 --> 00:20:58.749
of those things you absolutely need to know?
I don't mean to belabor the point, but --

00:20:58.749 --> 00:21:00.440
[laughter]

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:04.860
but what the hell have I gotten myself into?
I'm not a journalist, activist, veterinarian,

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:08.690
lawyer, or philosopher, as to my knowledge
have been the others who have made such a

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:14.360
trip. I'm not up for anything and I'm not
someone who can stand very still in front

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.230
of a guard bull.'"

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:20.990
I imagined, this is if I imagined the meat
coming at me many times, I also imagined what

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:25.720
would actually happen if I did face down this
bull knowing that I had to stand still and

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:31.409
what would I think about? Baseball or my parents
having intercourse, or --

00:21:31.409 --> 00:21:32.570
[laughter]

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:36.080
something that-that would completely paralyze
me.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.080
[laughter]

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:41.300
"We come to a gravelly stop at the planned
upon spot and wait for our synchronized watches

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:45.580
to click over to 3:00 a.m., the planned upon
time. The dog we'd seen earlier in the day

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.379
can't be heard, although that's hardly a comfort.

00:21:48.379 --> 00:21:51.200
I take the scrap of paper from my pocket and
read it one last time."

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:56.460
And then I give the text of California Penal
Code 597e which says basically if you come

00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:03.820
upon an animal that is impounded and without
proper access to food and water you are allowed

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:09.389
to take it upon yourself to provide food and
water and you're not liable for trespassing

00:22:09.389 --> 00:22:11.559
or any other laws you might break in the process.

00:22:11.559 --> 00:22:15.919
So this is how animal activists get on to
farms they-they use this in California. They

00:22:15.919 --> 00:22:23.290
use this law, this loophole. And it's pretty
interesting why there are laws that, the particular

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:26.450
laws that forbid one from having access to
farms are quite extreme.

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:34.559
After September 11th the government passed
an Animal Terrorism Act which makes trespassing

00:22:34.559 --> 00:22:42.630
onto a farm not an act of trespass but an
act of terrorism. And it's worth investigating

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:44.190
what is meant by that.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:48.590
The most generous interpretation I guess is
that the government was legitimately afraid

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:55.090
that some terrorist would come and I don't
know poison our food supply.

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:59.090
But when you put it in the context of what
it is this farm system has done, 76 million

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:05.299
Americans get food poisoning every year and
the CDC says the prime culprit is animal agriculture.

00:23:05.299 --> 00:23:08.690
I mean no terrorist is that ambitious.

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:13.740
The num, one-one of the top two or three causes
of every significant environmental problem

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:19.299
on the planet: Swine Flu, H1N1, which moved
across the United States and the world and

00:23:19.299 --> 00:23:23.070
killed relatively few, but could have killed
a hundred million people. There's absolutely

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:28.450
no reason it didn't, it just didn't happen
to mutate in a particular way; originated

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:36.580
on a hog farm in North Carolina. So it's-it's
possible that we have our definition of terrorism

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:38.279
backwards.

00:23:38.279 --> 00:23:43.330
So I read California Penal Code and I say,
"which despite being State law is about as

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:45.590
reassuring as Cujo's silence.

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:50.869
I'm imagining some roused from REM sleep and
well armed farmer coming upon I know the difference

00:23:50.869 --> 00:23:56.419
between arugula and rugelach scrutinizing
the living conditions of his turkeys. He cocks

00:23:56.419 --> 00:23:59.481
his double barrel, my sphincter relaxes, and
then what?

00:23:59.481 --> 00:24:00.481
[laughter]

00:24:00.481 --> 00:24:03.399
I whip out California Penal Code 597e?

00:24:03.399 --> 00:24:04.399
[laughter]

00:24:04.399 --> 00:24:07.269
Is that gonna make his finger less or more
itchy?

00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:11.700
It's time. We use a series of dramatic hand
signals to communicate what a simple whisper

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:16.530
would have done just as well, but we've taken
vows of silence; not a word until we're safely

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:17.549
on the way home.

00:24:17.549 --> 00:24:23.309
The twirl of a latexed index finger means,
'Let's roll.' 'You first,' I blurt. And now

00:24:23.309 --> 00:24:24.950
for the scary part."

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:31.710
So I-I ended up seeing this farm which was
a turkey farm and seeing many other farms

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:37.889
of all of the food species and I went into
lots of processing plants, slaughter houses,

00:24:37.889 --> 00:24:44.620
and the scary part was really this veil of
secrecy; just how impossible it was to learn

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.559
about food.

00:24:46.559 --> 00:24:50.909
The-the fact that almost every door that I
encountered to one of these windowless sheds

00:24:50.909 --> 00:24:56.270
was locked and not because they were afraid
of an animal turning the door knob and escaping,

00:24:56.270 --> 00:25:00.340
and not because they were afraid of somebody
stealing the animals, because that's-that's

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:04.049
not a real concern when it comes to chickens
or turkeys.

00:25:04.049 --> 00:25:10.139
But they're afraid of us. Afraid of the people
who buy their products and eat their products

00:25:10.139 --> 00:25:15.399
learning what these products really are; how
they are brought to our tables and what the

00:25:15.399 --> 00:25:18.549
effects are. And it's infuriating.

00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:21.940
And there are many times in, when I writing
this book that I regretted that I was writing

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:25.870
this book because I like to be a novelist.
It's how I think of myself. It's how I like

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:30.659
to spend my time. I can't think of a better
way to spend my time.

00:25:30.659 --> 00:25:34.259
And yet I put aside about three years, three
and a half years to write this. But whenever

00:25:34.259 --> 00:25:37.789
I was feeling unmotivated and whenever I was
feeling uninspired or when I felt that maybe

00:25:37.789 --> 00:25:43.080
I shouldn't be working on this book, I think
of those locked doors and they just made me

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:49.600
so angry that they would, they would provide
more than enough fuel for the engine of the

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.990
book.

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:57.520
So I've now given you some introduction and
I think it would be best to try to have a-a

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:01.899
kind of conversation as I said, I would love
to hear somebody stand up and say, "You've

00:26:01.899 --> 00:26:08.129
got it all wrong," but short of that I would
love to hear questions, of course, but also

00:26:08.129 --> 00:26:16.630
any experiences you might have had with meat
or farming or anything like that.

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:18.639
[pause]

00:26:18.639 --> 00:26:37.929
&gt;&gt;female in audience #1: So my name's Ann
and I wanted to, oh sure.

00:26:37.929 --> 00:26:38.929
[pause]

00:26:38.929 --> 00:26:39.929
Hi everyone.

00:26:39.929 --> 00:26:44.999
I wanted to address a piece that I felt like
you really focused on at-at the beginning

00:26:44.999 --> 00:26:51.440
of your story, that I think is-is missing
in-in this greater conversation and that's

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:57.619
the connection between food and meat within
that and family.

00:26:57.619 --> 00:27:03.289
And I really appreciated that that's where
you started because I don't know about any

00:27:03.289 --> 00:27:10.200
of you who, if you've made choices about what
you eat or started to think about changes

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:14.740
that you've made, I've found that the hardest
part is the family piece.

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:22.499
And that when you talk to your friends or
co-workers or anyone else in your life they

00:27:22.499 --> 00:27:29.840
seem to be a lot more accepting of, "Oh you've
decided to do x, y, or z" and-and it can even

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.710
be considered cool or appealing or whatever.

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:39.570
And family's been the hard one, at least for
me. And-and I-I got the impression that it

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:47.730
has been to some extent for you in terms of
extended family. And-and I guess I'm just

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:55.610
wondering if, not if you have any advice,
but just I feel like we need to come up with

00:27:55.610 --> 00:28:02.549
some sort of safe way to approach some of
these conversations with the people who started

00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:07.169
to feed you. And you don't wanna make them
feel guilty because they're you're Mom and

00:28:07.169 --> 00:28:11.999
you're saying, "Mushroom soup on everything
is disgusting," or whatever. [chuckles]

00:28:11.999 --> 00:28:18.480
But I-I-I just, I wanted to bring up that
that piece of it is I think an important starting

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:25.509
point in terms of how we educate is the-the
people who are closest to home as opposed

00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:33.210
to raging activism to these large comp-companies
that-that aren't so close 'cause it starts

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:34.210
local, I guess.

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:38.399
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: Well I make no effort
to educate or persuade people close to me.

00:28:38.399 --> 00:28:44.559
At least not in any active way because I think
that, I think there's a danger in making the

00:28:44.559 --> 00:28:50.029
person the reference rather than, or the person
the subject of your conversation, rather than

00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:52.320
what you really wanna be the subject which
is this problem --

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.320
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Um-hum.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:29:01.129
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: that faces all of
us. And I-I've just never had any success

00:29:01.129 --> 00:29:05.950
to be honest in-in a one-on-one conversation
trying to persuade somebody to eat differently

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:07.039
and so I don't try anymore.

00:29:07.039 --> 00:29:13.190
But what I find is very successful is explaining
when asked, waiting 'til someone asks and

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:18.350
then explaining honestly why I do what I do,
trying to give an answer that corresponds

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:19.500
to the nature of their question.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.500
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Um-hum.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:25.440
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: Sometimes people say,
"Oh why didn't you get a burger?" And they

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.519
don't wanna hear, "Do you have any idea where
that burger comes from and?"

00:29:29.519 --> 00:29:30.519
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Right.

00:29:30.519 --> 00:29:31.519
[laughter]

00:29:31.519 --> 00:29:34.700
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: So you can say something
like, "You know I actually don't eat burgers

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:38.909
I read this thing now available in paperwork
by Jonathan Safran Foer --

00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:40.000
&gt;&gt;female in audience: [laughs]

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000
[laughter]

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.080
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: about the environmental
effects and I've been thinking a lot about

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.520
the environment so I'm just trying to eat
less."

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:48.649
I think actually moving away from the binary
vegetarian or not is-is --

00:29:48.649 --> 00:29:49.649
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Right.

00:29:49.649 --> 00:29:52.210
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: one of the most successful
tactics and moving toward, "I'm trying to

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:53.370
eat less meat.
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Yeah.

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:57.029
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: And for me it happens
to be zero. That's how little meat I eat,

00:29:57.029 --> 00:30:02.440
but I am just somebody trying to eat less
meat. And I think that's very, it-it creates

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.019
a huge opening for –

00:30:05.019 --> 00:30:06.019
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Um-hum.

00:30:06.019 --> 00:30:07.980
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: people who care, but
are not going to care ultimately. Which frankly

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:08.980
is most people.

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:09.980
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Right.

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:11.749
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: Most people are not
going to become vegetarian any time soon,

00:30:11.749 --> 00:30:15.080
but I do think that confronted with these
realities most people are ready to eat one

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:19.679
serving less a week. I mean I think that's
possible and I think that most people are

00:30:19.679 --> 00:30:25.630
probably ready to eat three or four or five
servings less a week. But they have to be

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:28.500
given that space without like a fear of being
called a hypocrite.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:29.500
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Um-hum.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:33.740
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: Because the-the danger
when talking about these things is to reach

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:37.879
right for the extremes, like the margins of
the conversation, "Well you're vegetarian

00:30:37.879 --> 00:30:42.059
but you're wearing leather shoes." But, "You're
a vegetarian but I saw you swat a fly the

00:30:42.059 --> 00:30:43.059
other day and why --

00:30:43.059 --> 00:30:44.059
[laughter]

00:30:44.059 --> 00:30:47.280
I mean it sounds ridiculous, but this is what
happens in so many of these conversations.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:52.230
And what we, what's happened is we've allowed
the realization that we won't be perfect to

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:53.919
be an excuse not to try.

00:30:53.919 --> 00:30:58.280
And we need to-to think about these things
like we think about the environment. It's

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:02.720
no longer a sensible question to-to ask, "Are
you an environmentalist or not?" I mean would

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.299
you have a good answer for that? It's a weird
question. It's almost like asking if you're

00:31:06.299 --> 00:31:07.299
a feminist or not.

00:31:07.299 --> 00:31:08.299
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Sure.

00:31:08.299 --> 00:31:11.929
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: Like, "Of course,
but I guess unless you mean crazy."

00:31:11.929 --> 00:31:12.940
[laughter]

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.759
I meant that, by the way, about the environment
not about feminism.

00:31:15.759 --> 00:31:16.769
&gt;&gt;female in audience: [laugh]

00:31:16.769 --> 00:31:17.769
[laughter]

00:31:17.769 --> 00:31:18.769
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Good. [unintelligible]

00:31:18.769 --> 00:31:22.669
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: So I try to buy good
appliances. I don't leave the car idling.

00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:29.519
I turn off lights when I leave a room. And
yet I flew here from New York and I know that

00:31:29.519 --> 00:31:32.470
that's about as bad as it gets in terms of
my transportational footprint.

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:36.340
But I didn't get off the plane, throw my hands
up in the air, call home and say, "Turn the

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:39.100
car on. Let it idle."

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.100
[laughter]

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.820
Because it's not an all or nothing proposition.

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:47.679
Instead we recognize or we do our best to
recognize, the choices that are in front of

00:31:47.679 --> 00:31:51.350
us and then also our ability to make better
choices.

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:55.269
And so I think it's the exact same thing with
food. We have to get away from this idea,

00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:59.549
"I was a vegetarian for six years but then
I found myself in a bus station at two in

00:31:59.549 --> 00:32:04.779
the morning and the only thing that was open
was KFC and all they had left were chicken

00:32:04.779 --> 00:32:10.440
things and so I ate them and that was the
end of my vegetarianism." I've heard a lot

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:11.809
of that and you've probably heard that too.

00:32:11.809 --> 00:32:12.809
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Um-hum.

00:32:12.809 --> 00:32:16.029
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: As if like the slightest
encroachment meant it's time to stop trying.

00:32:16.029 --> 00:32:17.029
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Right.

00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:19.749
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: And if you imagine
applying that standard to any other realm

00:32:19.749 --> 00:32:24.460
of decision making it's foolish; it's crazy.
Like, "I used to be someone who tried to tell

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:28.180
the truth then my Mom came down the stairs
on the way to a party and asked me if she

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:31.989
looked nice in a dress and I said yes, so
I now I lie at every available opportunity."

00:32:31.989 --> 00:32:32.989
[laughter]

00:32:32.989 --> 00:32:33.989
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Right.

00:32:33.989 --> 00:32:34.989
[laughter]

00:32:34.989 --> 00:32:35.989
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: It just doesn't make
any sense.

00:32:35.989 --> 00:32:36.989
[laughter]

00:32:36.989 --> 00:32:39.279
And so I think guiding the conversation toward
the middle ground like, "You know what I've

00:32:39.279 --> 00:32:45.110
been thinking about this and Jesus, it matters
to me. Like it really has to matter to me

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:51.879
that-that this is so environmentally destructive
and I'm not really all that into animals but

00:32:51.879 --> 00:32:55.434
some things are just wrong. And this is wrong.
I know what's goin' on is wrong. So I'm trying

00:32:55.434 --> 00:32:56.580
to eat less of it."

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:59.710
I think that is actually a very successful
approach.

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:00.710
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Yeah.

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:04.590
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: Because it doesn't
make the-the other person the topic of your

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:05.590
conversation.

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:09.799
&gt;&gt;female in audience: I-I guess I just think
that one of the sort of fall backs is that

00:33:09.799 --> 00:33:16.690
this is our tradition, this is our tradition,
this is our culture, but it's such a short

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:20.950
tradition that this factory farming piece
has been a part of the picture, I mean --

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:24.159
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: But you also have
other traditions and cultures like caring,

00:33:24.159 --> 00:33:25.159
like --

00:33:25.159 --> 00:33:26.159
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Right.

00:33:26.159 --> 00:33:29.940
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: like some people find
their values in the Bible, some people find

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:35.549
their values in stories their grandparents
taught them, but they all have, they ultimately

00:33:35.549 --> 00:33:36.549
actually teach the same lessons--

00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:37.549
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Right.

00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:40.450
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: about like dominion
and stewardship. Like what it means to be

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:48.169
a human and what responsibilities that entails
and also what it means to be like a citizen

00:33:48.169 --> 00:33:49.169
of the earth.

00:33:49.169 --> 00:33:50.169
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Um-hum.

00:33:50.169 --> 00:33:54.730
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: And this is, this
is something that I felt as I was writing

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:59.279
the book and I've been very, very happy in
feeling like it's been shown out in the conversations

00:33:59.279 --> 00:34:03.730
that I've had since which is that we all already
share the values that would inspire one to

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:04.730
stop eating --

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:05.730
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Right.

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:08.810
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: meat, or to eat less
meat. No one needs to acquire new values.

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:13.429
You don't need to persuade anybody to-to care
about these things only to act on the care

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:16.840
that they already have. And so then it's a
question of well, what are the different ways

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:20.870
that people can act? How can you expand the
action rather than contract it?

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:26.060
And it might be that holding a sign that says,
"Meat is murder," on a street corner contracts

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:30.100
people's desire to act, whereas like offering
them flexibility they'll say, "Ah, that might

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:31.100
feel good. I'll try that."

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:32.100
&gt;&gt;female voice: [unintelligible]

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:33.100
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.330
Thank you very much.

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:36.860
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: Thank you.

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:37.860
[pause]

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:43.100
&gt;&gt;male in audience #1: Hi. Thanks for the
book and reading it was quite an experience.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:48.400
And then at the end I still felt that there
were a few questions that seemed to me obvious

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:53.770
that were left unanswered and I went to your
online forum and still didn't find the answers.

00:34:53.770 --> 00:35:02.280
So the first one was you talked about factory
farming of meat but not of dairy and eggs

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:06.530
so much and it seemed that the-the issues
apply identically.

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:11.320
The second was somebody must have brought
up the issue that crop agriculture, industrial

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:15.520
crop agriculture kills a lot of animals too
and causes animal suffering.

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:16.610
And then the third one was --

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:18.600
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: Let's do one at a
time 'cause I know I'll just forget otherwise.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:19.600
[laughter]

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.600
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Okay.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.840
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: So in terms of eggs
and dairy, I didn't include them because they

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:27.360
just weren't in the scope of this book. But
you're absolutely right that they're precisely

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.970
the same problems.

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:29.970
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Okay.

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:33.190
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: I mean I-I made a
lot of decisions in the interest of having

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:45.340
this be accessible and hopefully persuasive
and sometimes that meant sacrificing comprehensiveness

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:51.310
or one can state things in many different
ways and can be equally truthful.

00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:55.740
And I made certain choices and sometimes I
regretted that I didn't state them in other

00:35:55.740 --> 00:36:02.280
ways that are maybe more stringent or like
anybody you-you feel differently about the

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:06.930
same thing at different times of the day and
over the course of a week or month or year.

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:10.800
And there are passages I look back at and
I regret that I didn't say something more

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:15.030
strongly. And there are passages that I look
back and I regret having said is so strongly.

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:20.690
But I was trying to strike the balance. That
scene of breaking into the farm I was, I was

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:26.270
conveying a very difficult aspect of writing
this book which was getting the information

00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:29.680
itself. But a more difficult thing was getting
the tone right.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.790
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Um.

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:32.240
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safren Foer: And then crop-

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.240
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Yeah.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.240
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: crop growing crops
kills animals, basically.

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:40.860
&gt;&gt;male in audience: And so I'm sure people
brought that up as an argument and --

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:46.570
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: Yeah, the goal is-is-is
not to be these kumbaya, perfect, harm- well

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:51.210
no perhaps that is the goal, but it's not
re, it's not what we're realistically aiming

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:52.220
ourselves toward.

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:58.070
There's a big difference between a tractor
accidentally, and it is accidental even if

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:01.810
you know it's going to happen in the course
of crop agriculture, killing however many

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:04.120
I don't know woodchucks, what lives in the
ground?

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.120
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Um.

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.120
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: Beavers?

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.120
[laughter]

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:08.120
I have no idea --

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.120
[laughter]

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.120
Republicans?

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.120
[laughter]

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:15.460
There's a big difference between that and
knowingly creating cages for pregnant animals

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:17.690
so small they can't turn around.

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:20.800
Part of this has to do with the effects on
the world and part of it has to do with effects

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:26.720
on ourselves. And we do pay a price for making
these decisions individually and as a culture.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:27.742
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Okay.

00:37:27.742 --> 00:37:32.480
And then the third one was somebody somewhere
must have asked you how do you know plants

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.480
don't feel pain?

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.090
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: How do I know plants
don't feel pain?

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:37.110
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Hasn't somebody asked
you that question in your --

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:41.520
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: They usually ask it
in a, in a, in a more annoying form which

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.880
is something like, "But you don't you hear
the carrots crying?"

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.090
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Yeah.

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:46.090
[laughter]

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:49.490
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: I don't know that
plants don't feel pain. I don't know that

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:50.490
you feel pain.

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:55.440
We make assumptions and our assumptions are
usually based in evidence –

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.440
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Um-hum.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.810
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: in science so science
gives us many, many reasons to think that

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:03.490
other human beings experience pain in a way
that's sort of similar to the ways that we

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:05.350
do.

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:12.240
And it also gives us reasons to think that
dogs care when you kick them and that a pig

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:17.740
cares when you kick it and that a cow cares
when you kick it and that a fish on a hook

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:23.221
that appears to be struggling for its life
and appears to be squirming in something like

00:38:23.221 --> 00:38:26.670
pain is not just giving us false indications.

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:32.940
That-that chemistry of its brain, the ways
that the-the nerves are organized resemble

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:38.330
those in humans to such an extent that we
have good reason to think that they are having

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:42.630
experiences that include suffering or pain
or whatever you wanna call it.

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:50.640
And we don't have any reason to think that
plants experience pain. But as I said, we'll

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:56.150
never know so it comes down to what kind of
assumptions you wanna make. And it's better

00:38:56.150 --> 00:39:00.900
to be someone who makes generous assumptions
than someone who's miserly with his assumptions.

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:05.630
You depend on me to believe you when you slam
your thumb in a car door and say, "Ah, Jesus

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:10.500
Christ, that fucking hurts." You want me to
say, "Hey, are you okay? Do you need to go

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:15.700
to the hospital?" Because I could make other
assumptions about you. I could say, "Oh there

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:19.670
he goes again just showing me all the symptoms;
exhibiting all of the pain behavior --

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:20.670
[laughter]

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:22.030
but I know he's not really feeling pain."

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:26.070
In fact humans are good at doing this. And
have historically been very good about assuming

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:32.960
that other humans don't feel things in the
same way; humans of different races or sexes.

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:43.480
So the goal in life is to expand I think our-our
definition of pain not to contract it.

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.030
And if you're proven wrong --

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:46.030
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Yes.

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:47.840
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: You know if you're
proven wrong and it turns out the pig actually

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:52.400
feels nothing, what have you lost? A bunch
of pretty good meals. But if you're proven

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:56.340
right, then we have something very, very serious
on our hands.

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:59.840
&gt;&gt;female in audience #2: Hi there. Thank you
so much for coming. I love your-your fiction

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:04.160
and I read this book and I love your non-fiction.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.900
It's also preaching to the choir 'cause I'm
an 11 year vegetarian who doesn't wear leather.

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:14.930
But my question is I learned all these interesting
facts that just further solidified my decisions,

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:20.250
but I wanted to see if you had any ideas on
how we can take this to the next step and

00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:25.920
impact the food industry, and take all these
facts and make sure that this kind of these

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:31.040
atrocities don't happen 'cause they're not
only what I perceive to be cruel, but they're

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.040
unhealthy for humans.

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:38.380
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: Well, farmers grow
what we ask them to grow not what they want

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:39.380
to grow.

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:44.260
And if you go to any supermarket now you'll
see cage-free or free range eggs and you wouldn't

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:49.040
have seen them in any supermarket probably
five years ago. You see it in gas stations

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.540
now. I mean everywhere they have them.

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:55.630
And it's not because these companies woke
up and said, "It's probably a, like just the

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:59.490
right thing to do to get them out of these
cages." They did it because it's what people

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:04.170
asked for. It's the fastest growing sector
in the food industry: cage-free and free range

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:09.410
eggs. Not in Berkeley and not in Brooklyn,
but in the entire United States.

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:13.480
It's a food that doesn't taste any better
and isn't any better for us, but people are

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:17.290
buying because it's just the right thing to
do. No one needs to be persuaded that it's

00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:21.780
wrong to keep an animal that's the size of
a football in a cage about the size of this

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:25.470
book. It's just not right.

00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:29.130
So as people have asked for different things
they've started producing different things.

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:32.910
So at a certain point I think a tipping point
will be reached in much the same way that

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:38.030
it has, was reached with smoking. Where we,
there was a period where everyone had access

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:42.180
to the information and we all knew it but
we just weren't quite acting on it and the

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:49.270
conversation had to cha, expand and change
in such a way that if just one thing led to

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:53.430
another and suddenly there was legislation
happening at the same time as the consciousness

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:54.430
was changing.

00:41:54.430 --> 00:42:00.150
And-and now it's legal to smoke cigarettes.
It will always be legal to eat meat, but I

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:04.991
do think that in the not too distant future
the question won't be why don't you eat it,

00:42:04.991 --> 00:42:06.260
but why do you eat it?

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:07.580
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Okay.

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:08.580
[pause]

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:12.241
&gt;&gt;female in audience #3: I have a somewhat
similar question to the question that she

00:42:12.241 --> 00:42:19.760
just asked. I feel really lucky that I can,
that I live in San Francisco; that I have

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:24.000
access to all of these free-range eggs, organic
meat, no hormone, no antibiotics.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:34.440
And one of the things that-that changed the
way I eat and I'm not, I'm not a vegetarian

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:39.310
but I try to limit or I try to at least know
where my meat comes from, was the Monterey

00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:40.590
Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch Card for-for seafood.

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:48.680
So every time I go to a restaurant or I-I'm
eating fish somewhere I look up to see that

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.250
fish species and it's totally revolutionized
my purchasing and my consumption.

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:58.150
And-and again I feel in a way like this is
like I'm a little bit in a, in a igloo because

00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:59.810
I'm lucky enough to have --

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:01.340
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: Did you say an igloo
or an emu? I didn't hear what you said.

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:03.570
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Igloo. That I, because
I'm --

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:04.570
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: Igloo?

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:05.720
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Or like a bubble.

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.030
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: Like an Eskimo house?

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:08.030
[laughter]

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:10.590
Is that what you're saying? I just , I honestly
can't hear what you're saying.

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:12.490
&gt;&gt;female in audience: My point is that I'm
lucky enough --

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:13.490
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: Yeah.

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:15.090
&gt;&gt;female in audience: to be able to make these
purchasing decisions about the food that I

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:16.090
eat.

00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:17.090
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: Right.

00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:19.730
&gt;&gt;female in audience: So I guess my question
is if there were some kind of an app where

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:27.050
I could say, "Okay, Foster Farms, chicken.
What's the condition of living for that animal

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:30.240
versus I don't know Petaluma Poultry or something
like that?"

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:34.070
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: It's very difficult
because these are not individual farms; they're

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:39.300
farm conglomerates. And even on the best farms
I mean what you would really want is to be

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:43.690
able to trace an individual animal and to
note was this animal given antibiotics at

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:48.670
any point in its life. And it's not always
bad to give an animal antibiotics. I mean

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:52.470
a sick animal should be given antibiotics
and a healthy animal should not.

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:59.220
We give eight times the amount of antibiotics
to healthy animals as we do to sick people.

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:02.710
Not only because they've been bred in such
a way that they are destined for illness,

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:08.730
but because it makes them grow faster. That's
the real reason antibiotics are given to animals.

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:14.530
So the challenge would not be to identify
which brands are good or bad, but which animals

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:18.830
are raised under what conditions and there's
just too much information that we can never

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:19.830
know.

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:25.280
Was this animal's slaughter botched? That's
a really important thing to most people. Like

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:31.540
if you found out that the steak you are about
to eat came from a cow that for two and a

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:35.960
half minutes experienced its own slaughter,
let's just say had like its skin pulled up

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:40.260
over its head, you wouldn't, you probably
wouldn't wanna eat it, right? I mean most

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:41.260
people wouldn't.

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:45.760
So that would be a useful piece of information
to you. But you'll never get that piece of

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.760
information.

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:52.580
And so what happens is when you eat meat you
make a wager like, "I think this is probably

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:57.390
good enough," or "I don't think it's good
enough." And we don't have nearly enough information

00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:01.540
to know. I mean Temple Grandin who's the most
important person in the livestock industry

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:11.440
did an audit of-of cattle processing plants
and found that about 32% of the time during

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:16.460
her announced audits, her pre-announced audits,
there were deliberate acts of cruelty happening

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:18.130
on a regular basis.

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:23.820
And that's a really crazy thing to hear. That
when they knew someone was gonna be there

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:28.720
watching, about a third of the time they were
not accidental acts of cruelty, but deliberate

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:34.190
acts of cruelty not happening rarely but on
a regular basis. So numbers have improved,

00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:37.020
I should say, since she made that audit.

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:43.370
But maybe should we think one out of three,
one out of two, everyone has his or her own

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:48.260
calculus. What I know is when I don't eat
meat I don't get involved with that wager.

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:50.050
I get it right every time.

00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:54.730
That I don't have to worry about, was this
a farm where they keep the manure in lagoons

00:45:54.730 --> 00:46:01.770
outside and it inevitably runs off into local
waterways and gets sprayed through aerosol

00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:06.620
over neighboring fields, or was this a farm
where they have proper waste management?

00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:13.770
Was this a farm where farm workers are pushed
to such an extent that they become at least

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:19.850
sloppy and at most sadistic? Or is this a
farm where workers are treated well; get a

00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:24.270
decent wage, are allowed to have some control
over the techniques and do their job thoughtfully

00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:27.460
and respectfully?

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:30.530
We just can't know all of that stuff and there
is no way that we will ever know.

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:34.680
Fish are quite different because you're just
looking to see if a species is right or not.

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:41.190
It's not, by the way, one shouldn't necessarily
feel perfect confidence in just knowing that

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:48.020
a certain kind of tilapia is okay. It says
nothing about how that specific fish was caught.

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:50.960
What the buy catch rate was.

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:55.650
Or what the fish itself went through which
might seem like a silly or flakey suggestion

00:46:55.650 --> 00:47:01.660
that I'm making, but we have very, very good
reasons to think that they feel quite a bit

00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:06.310
and perhaps every bit as much as like a chicken
does or maybe even a cow.

00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:11.800
And some people say, "That's regrettable.
I don't care that much." Some people say,

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.000
"I care enough to order something else."

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:22.610
But my only point is you're always going to
be largely ignorant. And that's something

00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:25.990
I'm not comfortable with three times a day
or two times a day or even once a day.

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:27.060
[pause]

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:35.490
&gt;&gt;male in audience #2: Hey. Thanks for coming.
I really appreciate it.

00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:42.560
So I'd actually kind of like to make an argument
for factory farming in some cases. I think

00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:49.340
there's, all the cases that you've been talking
about have been very easily demonizable like

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:54.260
beef slaughter, chicken slaughter, hard to
argue with a lot of those cases.

00:47:54.260 --> 00:48:01.430
But what about where the lifestyle of this
animal in the wild is threatened by there

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:03.850
not being a factory farm situation.

00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:09.990
I'm thinking in particular like, well you
just brought up fish. So where tuna is becoming

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:14.380
extinct, certain species of salmon are becoming
extinct.

00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:22.630
And without factory farming institutions the
demand is such that the fish farmers or the

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:30.060
fish-fisherman are driven to want to drive
these-these animals into extinction. So --

00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:33.480
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: Alright. So just to
be clear we'll only talk about fish unless

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:34.680
you can think of an example --

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:35.760
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Well people keep that
barrier set up --

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:36.760
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: Okay.

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:37.760
&gt;&gt;maler in audience: and we won't go into
that.

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:38.760
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: So --

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:39.760
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Wildlife of cows.

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:42.950
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: Salmon farming was
developed for the reason you're describing

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:48.160
to take pressure off wild salmon population.
And it's a kind of smart idea. Like if we're

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:52.380
gonna fish these things into extinction, and
by the way, fisheries scientists now estimate

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:58.220
that in the year 2048 we will have fished
all wild fish into extinction. All wild fish

00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:01.570
in every ocean; there'll be zero wild fish.

00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:05.000
And if that sounds, they're not saying in
about 50 years or midway into the century;

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.420
in 2048. It's based on very precise calculations.

00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:14.680
So fisherman said just out of self interest,
"We need more supply somehow; we can't, there

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:19.600
will be no business if we use all of these
up." And so salmon farming was developed.

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:23.380
But it curiously happened which was that as
salmon farming took off the-the pressure on

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:28.710
wild salmon populations increased rather than
decreased, because eating is habit forming.

00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:35.260
And as there was more supply of salmon there
was a-a demand rose faster than the supply

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:38.580
because you'd see it on more menus and you
would see someone eating it at a table next

00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:39.580
to you.

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:44.390
And the way most people eat is not, does not
involve lots of inquiry. Maybe people here

00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:47.830
it does, but most people you see somebody
eating salmon and you think, "That looks pretty

00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:52.460
good. I'll get the salmon." And you don't
say, "Is this farmed or is it wild caught?"

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:58.060
And this gets to a point that the consumer
can't be responsible for asking that question.

00:49:58.060 --> 00:49:59.060
We are, we are --

00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:00.960
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Except when it tastes
better. Wild typically --

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.570
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: I mean there's a –

00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:03.570
&gt;&gt;male in audience: tastes better.

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:04.730
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: the question does
it taste infinitely good?

00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:05.730
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Sure.

00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:07.330
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: I mean things can
taste better and better and better but do

00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:10.810
they taste infinitely good and is there anything
that, is there anything that brings us more

00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:14.830
pleasure than the taste of salmon? Most people
would say, "Yes."

00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:23.830
So we don't need all of the choices that we
have. This is like, we don't need the choice

00:50:23.830 --> 00:50:28.700
to buy children's toys that are painted with
lead paint. It's just not a choice we need.

00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:32.420
It doesn't make our lives richer; it doesn't
make us feel more free or in touch with our

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:33.720
Constitution.

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:38.100
And we don't need the choice to buy Chilean
Sea Bass. We just don't need it in supermarkets

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:43.180
or restaurants. We shouldn't have it. And
this is what should happen with seafood is

00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:45.790
certain seafood should just become illegal.

00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:50.850
Foods where it falls upon the consumer's responsibility
to be knowledgeable and make the decisions

00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:54.050
about things that one couldn't conceivably
be expected to.

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:55.050
[pause]

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:58.950
&gt;&gt;commentator: We have time for one more question.
[inaudible]

00:50:58.950 --> 00:51:03.290
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: Oh, sure. I don't
know exactly, I've never addressed the screen

00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:04.290
before but --

00:51:04.290 --> 00:51:05.290
&gt;&gt;commentator: [inaudible]

00:51:05.290 --> 00:51:07.361
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: How do we know their
actually there?

00:51:07.361 --> 00:51:08.361
[laughter]

00:51:08.361 --> 00:51:11.191
Look they're not responding when I say that.

00:51:11.191 --> 00:51:12.191
[laughter]

00:51:12.191 --> 00:51:15.360
&gt;&gt;commentator: Does anybody have a question
from our [unintelligible] --

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:17.460
&gt;&gt;male in audience #3: Hi, we're here.

00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:18.750
&gt;&gt;commentator: to prove you exist?

00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:20.780
[pause]

00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:22.120
We have time for one last question.

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:27.140
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: Well, someone has
one here so we might as well.

00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:28.780
&gt;&gt;commentator: Okay. Last question.

00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:32.880
&gt;&gt;male in audience #4: Hi. Thanks very much
for coming.

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:39.480
If what you said near the beginning during
the introduction is true, then almost everybody,

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:45.480
at least in the United States, knows at least
some of the reasons why eating meat is the

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:50.970
end of a chain of causes and effects that
has all sorts of bad consequences.

00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:59.630
And so eating meat is for many people a willful
act of setting aside what they think or what

00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:03.730
they know. And that's an uncomfortable thing
to think about.

00:52:03.730 --> 00:52:11.930
It-it just seems to me that it's-it's pretty
important to-to address how people feel about

00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:16.750
eating meat in addition to how they think
about eating meat. And I-I think this is the

00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:21.180
way people invest their own sense of virtue
and their own sense of personal morality into

00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:25.580
what they do is what leads to questions like:
why are you wearing leather shoes if you're

00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:30.590
a vegetarian? It's this feeling that there-there
are virtue points to be scrabbled over and-and

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:34.230
that you can't let the other person have all
of them.

00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:40.140
And so I just, I just wanted to get more of
your thoughts on how to make thinking about

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:46.100
that less uncomfortable, less-less of something
that people want to run away from not because

00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:47.980
of what they think but because of their emotions.

00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:51.520
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer: I guess I would just
return to what I said before and-and finding

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:57.660
a way to make it participatory and inclusionary
rather than exclusionary, rather than who

00:52:57.660 --> 00:53:03.010
is getting it more right than somebody else.

00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:08.820
We all depend on a certain like I don't know
if you call it forgiveness or generosity from

00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:15.810
our friends not to call us out every time
that we fall short, like I don't give as much

00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:23.730
money to charity as I should. I don't volunteer
as much as I should. And yet if-if my friends

00:53:23.730 --> 00:53:27.460
were to point that out I don't think that
I would do those things more. I might even

00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:29.420
do them less.

00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:32.580
But if my friends said, "You know what on-on
Saturday I was thinking about going to this

00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:36.550
like homeless shelter to make some sandwiches.
I've just been bothered, I've just been like

00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:40.090
feeling really guilty by how many homeless
people I've been seeing in the neighborhood

00:53:40.090 --> 00:53:45.400
recently and I thought I would do something."
I would say, "I'll go too." I just would 'cause

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:49.260
it would be participatory and inclusionary
and I know that the experience would make

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:50.260
me feel better.

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:55.480
And so the challenge is to present it in a
way that it is not a deprivation but that

00:53:55.480 --> 00:54:01.000
it is something that gives you more. Where
you end, of course there's, you're gonna remove

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.620
certain choices from your life and you're
also gonna remove certain pleasures from your

00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:08.560
life. That-that's something we haven't really
talked about but meat smells good and tastes

00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:14.720
good. It does. I think, I'm glad in your introduction
you said what you did, that you want to have

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:19.960
as full a palate as you can when performing
your art.

00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:23.390
But we don't have a full palate as it is.
I mean there are foods you would not serve

00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:28.130
ever. You wouldn't serve chimp, for example.

00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:34.130
So humans are very good at saying no to things
we want in the interest of other things we

00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:40.570
want, and saying no to things that we want
a lot more than we want meat.

00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:47.920
So we just have to, I think it's-it's a question
of getting used to it, like acclimating to

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:51.930
a different world. The world 50 years ago
was not this world. We didn't have, there

00:54:51.930 --> 00:54:55.430
wasn't the same urgency in the problem, we
didn't have.

00:54:55.430 --> 00:55:02.030
Also the-the knowledge that we now have entails
a responsibility because like we can't plead

00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:07.550
ignorance like people could have 10 or 20
years ago. And I-I really, I wrote this in

00:55:07.550 --> 00:55:10.691
the book and I believe it that it will be
asked of us what did you do when you learned

00:55:10.691 --> 00:55:17.700
about this. And I would much rather say, "I
withdrew" than, "I forgot about it."

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:19.130
[pause]

00:55:19.130 --> 00:55:23.760
&gt;&gt;commentator: I wanted to thank Jonathan
for being here today and let you know that

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:29.080
we have books from Books, Inc., in the back
as well as T-shirts that are, the T-shirts

00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:34.490
are free, the books are five dollars. And
Jonathan will be available to do some signing.

00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:36.030
Thank you so much for being such a great audience
too.

00:55:36.030 --> 00:55:36.110
