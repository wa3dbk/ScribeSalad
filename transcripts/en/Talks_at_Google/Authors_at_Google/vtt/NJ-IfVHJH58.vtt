00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.120
&gt;&gt;commentator: Leonard Mlodinow, bestselling
author of the The Drunkard's Walk has a new

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:12.090
book called SUBLIMINAL: How Your Unconscious
Mind Rules Your Behavior, a fascinating and

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.609
enlightening look at the profound ways that
the unconscious affects our experiences and

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:17.609
our lives.

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.160
Over the past two decades researchers have
developed remarkable new tools for probing

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.310
the unconscious or subliminal workings of
the mind and this explosion of research has

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.040
led to a sea change in our understanding our
how the mind affects the way we live. With

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.700
a new understanding of our own hidden mental
processes that Mlodinow provides in SUBLIMINAL

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.820
we are able to recognize and avoid some common
pitfalls in our lives, work, and relationships.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.460
So with that, if you could welcome Leonard
Mlodinow to the stage.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.040
[applause]

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:57.070
&gt;&gt;Leonard: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for
inviting me here and thanks for taking your

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.900
lunch hour to listen to me and also to participate
in an experiment and do a little work on your

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.369
lunch hour.

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.979
I'm gonna start actually with two experiments
and it's totally voluntary and it's anonymous

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:17.710
so if you want to participate just do what
I ask and if you don't then ignore me.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.960
So the first thing that I need to do is to
divide you into two groups and it's important

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.880
as we do the experiment that no one talk and
you just follow the directions you'll see

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.770
on the screen. So to divide you into two groups
let's go like right down here, and if you

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.350
perceive that you're on this side this line
then call yourself Group 1, and if you perceive

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.640
that you're on this side then you're Group
2.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.749
And Group 1 please look at the screen, please
read this silently, and record your answer.

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:55.420
Okay, now please read this question silently
and also record your answer.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.200
Group 1 please turn toward the back of the
room and Group 2 please turn forward.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.680
Group 2 please read this question and record
your answer.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.690
Alright now please read this question and
record your answer here.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.010
Great, now you can all turn forward again.
Thank you.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.690
Now if you're in Group 1 please put a 1 at
the top of your slip of paper and circle it

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.420
and if you're in Group 2 put a 2 and circle
that.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.080
[pause]

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.800
Okay, now the second experiment.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.800
[pause]

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:38.610
I need a female volunteer. Come up, please.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.850
[pause]

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:41.930
Thank you. What's your name?

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:42.930
&gt;&gt;Maria: Maria.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:43.930
&gt;&gt;Leonard: Sorry.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:44.930
&gt;&gt;Maria: Maria.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.040
&gt;&gt;Leonard: Maria, thank you. I'm gonna read,
everyone study these words, okay, I guess

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.320
hopefully you've been studying them. I'm gonna
read the top line, Maria's gonna read the

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.580
second line, and then I'll read the third
line.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.620
Candy, sour, sugar, bitter, good.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.040
&gt;&gt;Maria: Taste, tooth --

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.460
&gt;&gt;Leonard: Whoop, whoop sorry. Here come --

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.460
[pause]

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.370
&gt;&gt;Maria: Taste --

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.950
&gt;&gt;Leonard: Whoop, it's not.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.050
&gt;&gt;Maria: Hello.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.250
&gt;&gt;Leonard: There we go.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.550
&gt;&gt;Maria: Taste, tooth, nice, honey, soda.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.850
&gt;&gt;Leonard: Chocolate, heart, cake, eat, pie.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.850
Okay, hope you were listening carefully. Thank
you Maria.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.390
[pause]

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:34.210
Alright now you might be wondering is there
another test coming? Well the answer is yes.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:40.220
But this isn't it. Whoops, hold on. Don't
write anything, but I want you just to think

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.790
of all the words of the list that you can
recall and think of us saying them. Okay,

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.870
so spend a minute and focus on that.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.670
[pause]

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.670
Alright now –

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.590
[pause]

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:02.110
now comes the test. Either zero, one, two,
or all three of these words were on the list

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.790
and I want you to think back, picture either
Maria or I saying, or think back in your mind

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.670
if you can hear either Maria or I saying these
words. If you're confident that one of these

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.290
words was on the list write it down; it might
be that none of them were on the list, it

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.870
might be that all three of them were on the
list, or it might be that one or two of them

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.380
were on the list. So I'm not tellin' you which
or how many were on the list, but if any of

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.510
them, if you have a, if you're confident that
you have a distinct memory of having seen

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:36.010
one of these on the list or heard us saying
them, please write it down right now. Okay.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:42.030
Alright, now Group 1 please pass your papers
this way and Group 2 please pass your papers

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.000
this way and they'll be collected and tabulated
for our experiment. Thank you.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.820
So while we're collecting the papers let me
begin the talk.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.170
So I call the book SUBLIMINAL: How Your Unconscious
Mind Rules Your Behavior. Why did I call it

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.770
SUBLIMINAL? Well some of you may know that
in the 1950's a marketing consultant named

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:08.470
James Vickery said that he was able to subliminally
influence people's behavior by flashing for

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.300
just one-thirtieth of a second a sign that
says either, "Drink Coca-Cola" or "Eat popcorn,"

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:21.400
during a movie called Picnic that was playing
in a New Jersey movie theater. And he claimed

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:29.290
that he could increase the sales of popcorn
by I think it was 18% and Coke was 51 or 55%

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:35.520
by having these subliminal messages play in
front of the audience which they did not perceive.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.650
But about five years later, this is the 50th
anniversary of an article in Advertising Age

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.720
Magazine in which he admitted that it was
all a hoax; he had a failed marketing business

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.390
and he was trying to prop it up with this
trick. But although he admitted that it was

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:56.740
a hoax it never really left the American consciousness
or our culture and so subliminal persuasion

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.610
is something that everyone even still recognizes
today.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.970
Some people follow this and don't seem to
have gotten the retraction though, including

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.449
one of our former Presidents. This was an
ad that George Bush ran against Al Gore in

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:15.780
which he flashed, or his campaign, flashed
the word rats in the middle of a message for

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:23.430
one-thirtieth of a second and this message
played on TV over an anti-Gore ad and it played

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:29.140
for about 4,000 times before somebody discovered
it and then it was pulled from the air. So

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.449
apparently they didn't really get the message.

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:37.020
But actually a few years after this a scientist
decided to test to see whether such subliminal

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.300
messages can actually have an effect on people
and they found that even a message such as

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.920
this or other messages about drinks can have
a little effect, a fragile effect on people

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.450
in the laboratory.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.660
For instance, in one experiment people were
brought into a room and told that they were

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.130
gonna see word scrambles and unbeknownst to
them one of the quote word scrambles really

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:02.490
said Lipton Ice. And afterwards the subjects
were offered drinks and far more than who

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.360
had seen the Lipton Ice chose Lipton Iced
Tea than those who hadn't seen it.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.320
But nobody really believed you can persuade
someone to like Lipton Iced Tea if you don't

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:16.710
like Lipton Iced Tea or that that effect would
last beyond the laboratory hours later; it's

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.220
really something that's hard to reproduce
in the lab and it's very fragile but it does

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.220
exist.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.270
One other hand there are many subliminal effects
in your environment that are affecting you

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.150
all the time that are much less artificial
than this, and that's really what the book

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.820
is about. It's about subliminal effects, meaning
effects that go on below the threshold of

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:38.760
consciousness that your brain picks up, that
your senses pick up, that are processed by

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.111
the unconscious part of your brain and feed
into your consciousness perceptions, visual

00:07:43.111 --> 00:07:48.290
perceptions, social perceptions, memories,
and they govern the way you behave to a great

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:49.690
extent.

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:55.280
Let me, before I talk about them specifically,
let me define what I mean by unconscious behavior.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.350
An unconscious process in your mind is something
that is automatic and occurs with no effort

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.720
on your part and it's outside of your awareness,
you're not aware that it's happening or that

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.400
it's influencing you, and it's outside of
your will and largely outside of your control.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:18.449
So those are the traits that I mean when I
say something is unconscious.

00:08:18.449 --> 00:08:23.230
And as a result of that we often don't understand
what's influencing us in our everyday lives

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:26.139
[pause]

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:30.910
and however I wanna point out that the unconscious
I'm talking about is not the Freudian unconscious

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:35.500
that you may have heard a lot of about, it's
not the unconsciousness that was talked about

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.990
for most of the 20th century; this is a totally
different kind of unconscious. The Freudian

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:44.560
unconscious was very emotional and it was
hidden from people for motivational reasons.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.690
But the new unconscious that neuroscientists
and psychologists talk about is far different

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:53.080
from that; it's not accessible through therapy
or talking or introspection, but it takes

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.610
place in parts of your brain that are inherently
inaccessible to your conscious mind. So even

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:01.839
though Freud was right that a lot of your
behavior is influenced by the unconscious,

00:09:01.839 --> 00:09:05.580
most of the specifics of what he talked about
have not found any support in the scientific

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.630
community.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.690
[pause]

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:14.640
My book SUBLIMINAL is based on something called
social neuroscience. And social neuroscience,

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.230
this slide says it evolved in the mid-1990's
but actually the technology that largely fueled

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:24.630
it evolved in the 1990's but the subject didn't
really gel until the early 2000's; the first

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:31.020
meeting in this field was in 2001. The field
is really a ménage a trois, that's represented

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:36.680
by this slide, those three pairs of feet.
And the feet over on this side represent social

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.660
psychology. Social psychology is a psychology
of how people interact with each other; the

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.080
psychology of our social interactions.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:48.050
The feet on this side is cognitive psychology.
Cognitive psychology is psychology of the

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.510
way we think and the way we deliberate.

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:56.399
And the feet in the center that brought them
both together is neuroscience, and neuroscience

00:09:56.399 --> 00:10:02.770
really exploded in the mid-1990's when something
called functional magnetic resonance imaging

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:09.529
became widely available. And before that fields
of psychologies did behavioral studies but

00:10:09.529 --> 00:10:13.850
it was hard to get a good impression or a
good idea, a concrete idea, of exactly what

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:17.330
was going on because we couldn't see into
people's heads.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:21.520
And functional magnetic resonance imaging
or FMRI allows scientists in a way to see

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.820
into people's heads because it provides a
3-D picture not only of the structure of the

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:30.960
brain but of what parts of the brain are currently
active, as you can see here by the yellow

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:36.850
and the red areas. And so it allowed scientists
not only to make speculations about behavior

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:40.680
being unconscious but to trace what parts
of the brain are responsible for conscious

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.440
and unconscious behavior and how they interact
with each other.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.190
And one of my favorite studies along these
lines, just to show you how powerful it's

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:53.011
becoming, was done by a fellow named Jack
Gallant who is at Berkeley nearby, and he

00:10:53.011 --> 00:10:59.580
showed people a series of images which are
pictured here, there are many more of them,

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:05.589
but here's four of them. And he used the data
solely from the functional magnetic resonance

00:11:05.589 --> 00:11:14.380
imaging data to predict what the people were
looking at. So he didn't use any of the data

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:18.110
about what images where actually being shown
but just the readings of these peoples' brains

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:23.190
and he used that to choose images and make
guesses, the computer chose images and made

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:27.630
guesses, as to what they were looking at.
The computer had a database of six million

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:34.190
images to choose from and after taking these
readings as input it spat out what it thought

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:35.990
was its version of mind reading.

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:38.100
So let's see how well it did.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.100
[pause]

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:44.839
So I think that's pretty impressive; you can
see on this side, these black slides here,

00:11:44.839 --> 00:11:49.610
show you the computer's guess and the red
slides are what the people were actually looking

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.660
at.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.709
[pause]

00:11:53.709 --> 00:11:58.400
So I'm gonna talk a little bit about how this
works, how the unconscious mind works in your

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.880
life. First I'm gonna talk about the unconscious
and sensory perception because that's very

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:08.830
easy to illustrate and it's something that
I can show you visually here as opposed to

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:12.500
bringing people up and doing little experiments
on you. But I did do two experiments to start

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.110
the talk so eventually we'll go and we'll
demonstrate how that works in your own lives,

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:20.550
but first let's look at how it works in vision
and hearing and allow the processes that your

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:27.769
brains use have their analogs in the way we
construct our world, our social world.

00:12:27.769 --> 00:12:33.170
I want you to come away with three main points:
one is that our mental processes proceed along

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:39.300
two paths, the conscious and the unconscious
which we're unaware of; secondly that all

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:44.519
of our perceptions, our visual perceptions,
our auditory perceptions, our memories, and

00:12:44.519 --> 00:12:48.950
our social perceptions including the way you
see people and the way you see yourself are

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:55.240
not just purely direct reflections of the
data that you take in, but are constructions

00:12:55.240 --> 00:13:02.529
by your brain that seem real but really are
made of the data that you've assimilated plus

00:13:02.529 --> 00:13:08.290
things like your prior beliefs, your knowledge,
the context, and even your desires.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.279
[pause]

00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:15.490
And I want you to see that the way we experience
the world therefore is largely due to this

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:17.520
unconscious processing.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.560
[pause]

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:24.060
Let's start with a little picture here, okay.
I want the men especially to look at this

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:29.120
picture and to look for something unusual
in this picture, okay? Alright so take your

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.790
conscious mind, I want you to consciously
search for something unusual in this picture,

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:38.610
alright? Okay. Now that picture had something
in the foreground that psychologists would

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:40.610
call a high interest image--

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:41.610
[laughter]

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.600
okay, that's why I said especially the men
in the audience 'cause it's a higher interest

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:48.790
image for men. And how many of you saw something
very unusual in the picture?

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:49.870
[pause]

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:54.480
So okay a handful. How many of you didn't?

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.540
[pause]

00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:02.250
Okay, slightly larger handful. But normally
it breaks about one to four or one to three;

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:09.040
the minority see something unusual and the
majority don't. And that's because when light

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:13.170
impinges on your retina your brain doesn't
automatically detect he image and make an

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:17.510
image for you but you have something called
attention that has to be directed in order

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:25.220
for you to see what your, in order for you
consciously perceive what your eyes are seeing.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:30.350
And this attention is a function of both your
conscious and your unconscious. And in the

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:35.459
case of a very high interest image your unconscious
often wins and has that image dominate so

00:14:35.459 --> 00:14:40.649
that you don't really see the lower interest
part of the image.

00:14:40.649 --> 00:14:45.620
In this case I'll tell you, unfortunately
this is not the best projector, but do you

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:49.910
see a King Kong there in the background? If
you look at that screen behind you, as least

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:53.680
those of you in the front, it's a lot clearer
I think. To you right, to the right of the

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.540
woman as you're looking at her in the bushes
is the face of King Kong.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:58.540
[pause]

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.190
Could you see it now?

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:01.190
[pause]

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.950
[people speaking in background]

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:09.470
On my screen it's perfect, but if you look
on that screen back there I think it's much

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:14.960
more, it's over to the right. I'll show you
it's right here. Do you see it now? It can

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.320
be hard to see even if you're looking for
it, but right here is a face of King Kong.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:23.000
&gt;&gt;male #1: There's also a ladder [inaudible]

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.310
&gt;&gt;Leonard: There's also a ladder there that's
in much more contrast, that's right.

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:32.560
Alright let me show you what, when you look,
here's an example of a scene that you perceive

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:39.350
if you look at the road. Now this is the image
that your eye, this is the image that your

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.889
conscious mind perceives when you look at
the road. Let me show you now the image that

00:15:41.889 --> 00:15:48.910
your retina picks up. Your retina picks up
an image that's only clear in the very center

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:54.180
of the area that you're fixating on, and it's
very fuzzy outside of that and it has a black

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:59.800
spot that you'll see over here which is the
blind spot from where your optic nerve attaches

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.160
to your retina.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:06.230
What your brain does is it takes this and
it uses this data and it uses the data from

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:11.100
both eyes and it fills in the gaps and it
uses the context that you're looking at and

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:16.180
it uses even your expectations and your desires
to present to you a clear image and a three

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:20.140
dimensional image which is not really there.
And you perceive the image, when you look

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:25.170
down the road, you perceive the image as being
real, you don't have to expend any effort

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:29.519
to see the clear image, it comes automatically
and you can't in fact if you look at an image

00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:34.040
of the road you can't override these unconscious
processes and see it the way it really impinges

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:39.970
on your retina because all these things are
happening for you automatically. Nature has

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:44.750
created human beings to work this way because
this is how we survived in the wild. If we

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:50.399
had to stop and take the actual core data
that's coming to our eyes and work to reconstruct

00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:54.959
it we would never be able to catch our prey
or run from our predators.

00:16:54.959 --> 00:16:57.019
[pause]

00:16:57.019 --> 00:17:02.240
This is an example of how that works. If you
look at the squares you'll see the square

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:08.260
A and you'll see the square B. Now the square
that's labeled B you perceive as a white square

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:12.689
and you perceive the square that's labeled
A as a black square. This is because you're

00:17:12.689 --> 00:17:16.429
looking, you know you're looking at a checkerboard
and you see the shadow from the cylinder and

00:17:16.429 --> 00:17:21.189
your eye puts all that together. But this
is not the reality; the reality is that the

00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:26.230
square A is identical to the square B; it's
not the same color, it's not any darker or

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:30.780
lighter, it's exactly the same. So I want
you to stare at it and override your unconscious

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:35.910
mind and see it as being the same. You see
it as being different because of the context,

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:37.140
but actually it's the same.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:41.010
Now here's a couple people who are trying
to blot it out with their hands and that's

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:44.419
the right way to do it. But let me do it electronically
for you, it's a little bit easier. I'm gonna

00:17:44.419 --> 00:17:48.990
move the checkerboard away from the squares
and once I move the context away you'll see

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:51.290
that the squares are the same color.

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:52.470
[pause]

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:56.020
There you go.

00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:00.870
So what your unconscious mind is doing is
it's creating the reality for you, it's creating

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:05.290
the reality of this checkerboard because it's
useful for you to see it that way, but it's

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:12.110
overriding the actual physical data that a
physicist would say is impinging on your retinas.

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:14.400
[pause]

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:21.420
So you recognize this fellow? Your brain has
a very special area called the fusiform face

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:27.140
area that's used to analyze faces. That's
because human beings are an extremely social

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:34.120
species, we've evolved to have the most complex
social interactions of any other animal and

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:38.080
our brains and our unconscious minds have
also evolved to handle that. So not only does

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:44.830
your unconscious handle physical sensory perception
for you it handles a lot of your social perception.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:50.450
So the fusiform face area helps you recognize
people because in human society especially

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:54.380
as we were evolving it was very important
to know who's dominate, who's not, who's an

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:59.450
ally, who's an enemy, and how we all relate
to each other. And so we've evolved these

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:03.570
special talents for the social world and our
unconscious mind builds us a picture of the

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:08.090
social world just as it does of the physical
world. The thing about your fusiform face

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:12.790
area is though you don't usually see people
upside down and so it doesn't really work

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:15.630
as well upside down as it does right side
up. So when you look at these pictures they

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:20.179
probably both look like they're pretty decent
pictures of the President. Does any of these

00:19:20.179 --> 00:19:22.090
looked grotesquely distorted to you?

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:23.890
&gt;&gt;male #2: [inaudible]

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:25.250
How many of you have seen this before?

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:26.250
[laughter]

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:32.440
That why I shouldn't give this talk at Google,
but let's turn 'em over for you.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.740
[pause]

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:40.270
So this is the actual pictures and now your
fusiform face area seeing a right side up

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:45.210
face kicks in and they look grotesquely distorted,
but it's hard to see when they're upside down,

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:48.980
you can see the image go away as I turn the
picture.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.260
[pause]

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:57.390
Here's another example. Look at the image
on your left: male or female?

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:58.390
&gt;&gt;male #3: Female.

00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:59.780
&gt;&gt;Leonard: Female. And the one on the right?

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:00.780
&gt;&gt;male #4: Male.

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:03.530
&gt;&gt;Leonard: Male. Okay, but they're actually
the same person. Not only are they the same

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:08.360
person they are the same image except that
one has been doctored to show more contrast

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:14.160
and one to have less contrast. So you're automatically
perceiving the person as a male or a female

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:19.440
based on certain cues that you're used to
from everyday life and this happens unconsciously

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:23.400
and outside of your control and it doesn't
take any effort.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.900
[pause]

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:28.990
So the moral of all these slides is that our
vision is not objective but rather it's constructed

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:34.770
by our minds employing context, prior knowledge,
belief, desire, and other such factors that

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:39.680
are separate from the actual data that comes
into your eyes.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.950
The same thing happens in hearing. So I'm
going to just briefly give you a couple examples

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:46.740
in hearing and I want you to see how they
are analogous to the same thing that's happened

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.010
in vision.

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:51.220
[pause]

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:57.420
I'm gonna play this sentence for you in a
minute where a cough obliterates one of the

00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:00.910
sounds. The sentence is, "The state governors
met with their respective legislatures convening

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:01.910
in the capital city."

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:04.240
[pause]

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:09.390
Now I want you to listen very carefully to
this audio file and just as I showed you the

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:13.861
fuzzy picture of the roadside and told you
how your brain fills it in to make it a clear

00:21:13.861 --> 00:21:19.220
picture, your brain is also gonna fill in
the sound that obliterated by this cough and

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:20.960
you're gonna hear a pretty normal sentence.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.360
[audio file being played]

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:26.480
&gt;&gt;Male Recording: The state governors met
with their respective [cough] legislatures

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:31.190
convening in the capital city. The state governors
met with their respective legislatures [cough]

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:36.430
convening in the capital city. The state governors
met with their respective [cough] legislatures

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:46.440
convening in the capital city. The state governors
met with their respective [cough] legislatures

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.440
convening in the capital city.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.110
&gt;&gt;Leonard: Do you know which sound was obliterated?

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:51.160
&gt;&gt;male #5: G.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:56.900
&gt;&gt;Leonard: G. Hum? It's hard huh? I mean it
sounds as it sounds somewhere like it's in

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:01.500
the word maybe legislatures. Well it is in
the word legislatures and it's the first,

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:05.460
oh, I guess I pushed the button a little too
fast. The answer's up there.

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:06.460
[laughter]

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:08.910
Now it's really astounding that more hands
didn't go up. [laughs]

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:09.910
[laughter]

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:14.340
It's first S in the word legislatures. So
let me play it for you again and try and hear

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.340
that.

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.340
[audio file being played]

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:18.020
&gt;&gt;Male Recording: The state governors met
with the their respective legi [cough]latures

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:30.190
convening in the capital city. The state governors
met with their respective legi [cough]latures

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:32.230
convening in the capital city. The state governors
met with their respective legi [cough]latures

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:33.230
--

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:37.110
&gt;&gt;Leonard: So the reason that it's very hard
or even impossible to tell exactly where that

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:40.299
cough comes is that your brain fills it in.
If you didn't speak English and you heard

00:22:40.299 --> 00:22:48.130
this you would legis l[cough]atures, legi
[cough]slatures and not the word legislatures

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:52.309
'cause you wouldn't know to fill it in. But
because that we speak English when you hear

00:22:52.309 --> 00:22:56.030
this your brain fills it in just like it fills
in the visual data.

00:22:56.030 --> 00:23:00.950
And there's a very famous experiment in the
1970's that shows how far your brain goes

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:06.930
and how it uses context to fill it in. They
played a similar audio file with the word

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:12.169
"[cough]eel" and the context at the end of
the sentence that the people were listening

00:23:12.169 --> 00:23:21.440
to as defined, gave their brains the context
for what word was being said. And when they

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.881
played this for subjects and they didn't tell
them again what was being obliterated and

00:23:24.881 --> 00:23:28.931
they asked them what they heard, the subjects
who heard, it was found that the cough "eel"

00:23:28.931 --> 00:23:33.310
was on the orange reported hearing the sentence,
it was found that the peel was on the orange,

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:37.289
and they didn't even notice that the cough
obliterated the p in peel they just automatically

00:23:37.289 --> 00:23:42.420
heard peel. When the last word was shoe they
heard heel and so on. So your brain uses the

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:47.380
context just like it did in the checkerboard
with the two squares that you thought didn't

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:51.830
match but did, it uses context to create the
reality for you.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:56.929
So speaking of context let me show you how
hard it is to overcome that context. I'm gonna

00:23:56.929 --> 00:24:02.720
play a song for you, part of a song for you
called Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:03.720
So listen to it.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.620
[Led Zeppelin singing "Stairway to Heaven"]

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:06.620
[guitar intro]

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:10.049
"If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't
be alarmed now,

00:24:10.049 --> 00:24:19.070
It's just a spring clean for the May queen.
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:31.820
in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:32.890
on."

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:35.020
[guitar fades]

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:41.480
Alright now, now that you've heard it forwards
I'm gonna play it backwards and I want you

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:45.909
to listen to it backwards and see if it makes
any sense. I don't think the words forward

00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:46.909
made a lot of sense --

00:24:46.909 --> 00:24:47.909
[laughter]

00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:48.909
and I don't think --

00:24:48.909 --> 00:24:49.909
[laughter]

00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:53.970
that's just me perhaps. And I don't think
that Led Zeppelin was clever enough to design

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:59.530
a song that makes sense both forward and backwards,
but some people claim that it does. I don't

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:05.120
know, how many of you have heard about these
backwards effects? So, alright. So this is

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:11.679
something that for a while was quite popular
on the Web looking for messages in backwards

00:25:11.679 --> 00:25:14.230
songs and speeches by politicians, etcetera.

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:18.750
So I'm gonna play this for you, what you just
heard backwards and I want you to listen carefully

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:26.680
and see if you can decipher the paragraph
of words that constitute the backwards song.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:46.320

[guitar fades]

00:25:57.230 --> 00:26:03.350
Alright. Now not those of you who know this
but those of you who don't know this did you

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:04.570
make sense of it?

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:05.570
[pause]

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:09.970
It sound like gibberish? Yeah, it sounded
like gibberish to me when I first heard it

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:14.480
too and then I was shocked, shocked to find
this message in it. Let me show you. I'm gonna

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:19.710
play it for you now with the words of the
backwards message and listen to it and read

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:22.370
along and see if it makes sense to you this
time.

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:26.410
This is an example of, I'm gonna give you
some context for your brain to reconstruct

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:29.600
the reality of the backwards song.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:43.870

[guitar fades]

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:05.970
So from your laughter I infer that you got
it this time.

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:06.970
[laughter]

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:11.580
So that probably sounded pretty real to you.
Now you've heard the same sounds twice: once

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:17.360
it sounded like gibberish and once it sounded
perfectly real. So which was reality? Is it

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:22.000
the second time where there was a Satanic
message or was it the first time?

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.250
Well I'm gonna play it for you another time
now and I want you to decide consciously,

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:31.920
I want you to override your unconscious mind,
watch the words, listen to the song, but don't

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:36.850
connect the words with the song this time.
I want you to hear it the first way even though

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:52.480
you're seeing the words.

[guitar fades]

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:15.970
So were you able to overcome your unconscious
mind? Could you watch the words and hear it

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:17.750
yet as gibberish? No, huh.

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:22.370
I'm gonna give you one more chance but this
time I'm guessing that you're spoiled like

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:26.700
I am 'cause I've heard it so many times now
I cannot, even without the words, I know the

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:27.860
words.

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.030
[laughter]

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:32.809
I'm gonna play it for you again without the
words and now I want you to hear it without

00:28:32.809 --> 00:28:47.740
the Satanic message.
[Led Zeppelin singing "Stairway to Heaven"

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:53.930

[guitar fades]

00:29:06.299 --> 00:29:10.809
So could you overcome it or is it still sounding
like the Satan song? Yeah.

00:29:10.809 --> 00:29:17.620
Well so because people, because of this suggestibility
in this context that makes your brain automatically

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:22.330
interpret this, some people once they're told
this is there and they don't realize what's

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:27.190
going on they really believe that there is
a Satanic message there because what else

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:31.441
could it be? It does sound very real. And
I wanna thank Michael Shermer of the Skeptics

00:29:31.441 --> 00:29:35.260
Society for the backwards song. You know the
Skeptics Society? You should check it out,

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:39.300
skeptics.com and one of the things he does
is go around debunking myths like this where

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:45.210
people find Satanic messages. You can take
any backwards sounds, come up with words that

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:48.630
sound similar to that, play it, and the same
effect will happen because your mind is using

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:51.490
that context to create the reality.

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:55.779
So in the rest of the talk I'm gonna talk
about social perception because the point

00:29:55.779 --> 00:30:01.909
is that these same tricks that your mind uses
in audio and visual perception it also uses

00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:07.309
in social perception. And these are very useful,
I don't mean to be talking about these only

00:30:07.309 --> 00:30:09.539
because of the illusions that they create.

00:30:09.539 --> 00:30:14.360
If you run into people that look like this
you don't want to have to always individually

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:18.140
analyze what is their role, what is their
job, what do they want from me, how do I interact

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:22.720
with them? You wanna be able to automatically
without thinking, without any effort, categorize

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:28.059
them and interact with them as a bus driver
or if you see policemen you have to be able

00:30:28.059 --> 00:30:31.690
to interact with policemen without analyzing
first what are they there for, what's their

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:33.990
role, what's the gun mean?

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:35.540
[laughter]

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:38.230
Especially in New York. I give this talk in
New York and they all say, "Yeah, that's true."

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:42.640
[laughter]

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:48.350
Captains of industry and politicians we all
get limited data on these people and then

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:51.690
when we think about them especially the politicians
who we're going to have to vote for or not

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:56.360
vote for we form a picture of their character
and their personality, we form what's often

00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:00.370
a much clearer picture than we have any right
to because the data that's coming into our

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:05.070
minds is like the data at the side of the
road, it's very fuzzy, but our minds are forming

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:10.059
for us a clear picture. Sometimes that clear
picture, like the picture that we get from

00:31:10.059 --> 00:31:14.230
the side of the road, is accurate and sometimes
our clear picture is inaccurate, it's an illusion,

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:16.930
like the optical illusions I showed you.

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:21.000
And everybody that we meet in the world, your
work colleagues, your acquaintances, your

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.789
casual friends, it's something like that;
we get limited data on people and on social

00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:29.149
situations; we get limited data when we're
going to make purchases and when we're thinking

00:31:29.149 --> 00:31:35.159
about business decisions, but we have a clearer
picture than that data really supports and

00:31:35.159 --> 00:31:40.720
we don't realize that the clear picture that
we have is not completely justified but it's

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:46.090
filled in by our unconscious minds and presented
to us as reality.

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:49.350
So let's talk about this a little bit in social
behavior. We're gonna talk about how your

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:54.741
social perception is constructed by your mind.
Since this is an election year I thought it

00:31:54.741 --> 00:31:59.120
would be good to talk about a nice election
study.

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:03.030
You might be a staunch Democrat or a staunch
Republican in which case you're probably gonna

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:09.679
vote one way or the other no matter what.
But a good 20, 25, 30% of the population are

00:32:09.679 --> 00:32:14.310
what we call swing voters who are in any given
election are undecided. And what they think

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:18.550
they're doing, what they intend to do, is
to judge the candidates based on the issues,

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:23.740
based on their experience, based on how competent
they are. But one of the things that they

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:28.140
don't realize they're doing is they're judging
people by data that's fed to them from their

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:31.601
unconscious mind to fill in the blanks. And
one of the things that our unconscious mind

00:32:31.601 --> 00:32:37.890
feeds them is looks. When you look at candidates
you automatically judge competence by the

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:39.110
person's face.

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:45.380
And this shows you an example of how that
works. This was a study done in UC Irvine;

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:50.690
these are not the actual pictures used from
the study because the papers that were written

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:55.799
about it did not have the faces, so I'm illustrating
with these faces. But what they did was they

00:32:55.799 --> 00:33:01.221
made flyers on supposedly real Congressional
races; they told the subjects of the experiment

00:33:01.221 --> 00:33:05.399
that these are races outside of your district,
but here's a political flyer that we made

00:33:05.399 --> 00:33:10.039
on these two candidates. And the flyer shows
their parties, their stance on some of the

00:33:10.039 --> 00:33:14.410
issues, their experience, and a photograph
and they were asking people to pick who they

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:19.470
thought was the better person for the job.
But they were people outside their district

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:21.870
so they were not expected to recognize them.

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:27.529
But in reality what they did was they picked
one person to be the Democrat and one person

00:33:27.529 --> 00:33:33.080
to be the Republican and then they had a Hollywood
makeup artist and a professional photographer

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:38.730
create two versions of photos of them for
the flyers. In one version was designed to

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:42.480
make them look less competent and another
version was designed to make them look more

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.540
competent.

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:47.420
Prior to this they did a little pilot study
where they studied exactly what features of

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:50.490
a person would make them look more or less
competent and then they used what they learned

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:54.059
to have these people design two versions of
each candidate.

00:33:54.059 --> 00:34:00.700
And half the people saw the Republican candidate
in her more competent looking version and

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:04.940
the Democrat in her less competent looking
version, and the other half saw the Republican

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.260
in the less competent looking version and
the Democrat in the more competent looking

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:12.869
version. And then they compared the vote that
they would get to see what is the vote swing

00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:16.489
just based on the degree of competence in
your picture.

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:20.799
And they found that when the Republican was
more competent looking, the Republican got

00:34:20.799 --> 00:34:27.049
56%of the vote, but when she was less competent
looking she only got 44%. So there was a vote

00:34:27.049 --> 00:34:35.329
swing there from 44 to 56, I'm sorry 58%,
there was a vote swing of 14%. So 14% of the

00:34:35.329 --> 00:34:39.829
vote changed based purely on the person's
picture whether it was a competent looking

00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:41.709
picture or a less competent looking picture.

00:34:41.709 --> 00:34:46.269
So I mentioned the Skeptics Society; if you
guys are skeptical you could say, "Well, they

00:34:46.269 --> 00:34:50.389
were told that this was a real election but
that they had nothing at stake. So this might

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:53.999
happen in the laboratory but does it happen
in real life?"

00:34:53.999 --> 00:34:59.520
And fortunately a fellow at Princeton, a psychologist
named Alexander Todorov, decided to see if

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:06.200
this works in real life, so he did something
very impressive. He looked at about 400 elections,

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:11.680
gubernatorial, senatorial, congressional elections
and he gathered photos of the candidates and

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:18.269
paired them; this was before the 2006 elections.
And he wondered if this effect is real can

00:35:18.269 --> 00:35:23.490
I predict the outcome of the races by these
pictures? So he had subjects come into the

00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:28.130
lab and look at the pictures in pairs very
briefly and just pick one; which one looks

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:32.609
more competent? And he had hundreds of subjects
do this and he gathered statistics on which

00:35:32.609 --> 00:35:36.779
of these candidates looked more competent.
And then he created a prediction for all those

00:35:36.779 --> 00:35:41.329
races based not on political science, not
on party, not on the issues, based purely

00:35:41.329 --> 00:35:46.160
on who looks more competent to the most people.
So the question is: how successful do you

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:51.549
think he would have been? Well, he was actually
very successful; he got 70%of the races correct

00:35:51.549 --> 00:35:53.599
that way.

00:35:53.599 --> 00:35:57.890
So what this indicates, this correlation is
that something is going on that when we're

00:35:57.890 --> 00:36:01.680
judging people we're factoring in something
we don't think we're factoring which is their

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.050
appearance.

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:04.430
[pause]

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:08.809
Another thing that influences us in our social
interactions a great deal is touch. This slide

00:36:08.809 --> 00:36:12.700
shows four different kinds of primates engaged
in grooming activities.

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:13.700
[laughter]

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:18.440
Now except for the one in the center, these
primates spend a lot of time, an hour or two

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:22.160
every day, doing this grooming even though
it only takes about 10 or 20 minutes to accomplish

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:29.099
the physical purpose of the grooming and that's
because alliances, social alliances are very

00:36:29.099 --> 00:36:35.489
important for all primates, including us,
and by touching we create bonding and we create

00:36:35.489 --> 00:36:41.940
trust. And so primates create their social
alliances largely through their touching and

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:44.910
their grooming. And the question is: what
about people?

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:49.489
Well touch is also very important for people
and in fact in the last few years scientists

00:36:49.489 --> 00:36:55.979
have even discovered specialized nerves that
are mostly in your arms and your face that

00:36:55.979 --> 00:37:01.829
don't work very well for feeling what's there,
where something is, but transmit the pleasantness

00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:06.319
of social touch to your brain. So they seem
to be there purely for the bonding experience.

00:37:06.319 --> 00:37:11.030
And so the question is: how much of an effect
is this? How much of your perception of a

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:16.319
scene or of an interaction with someone is
influenced by the touch element? We talked

00:37:16.319 --> 00:37:19.440
about the looks element but now I'm gonna
talk about the touch element.

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:25.209
And my favorite experiment here was done in
France and it involves a few handsome Frenchmen

00:37:25.209 --> 00:37:31.650
and some French, single French women. This
fellow represents the handsome Frenchman --

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:32.650
[laughter]

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:37.000
these guys were all in their 20's and they
were asked to stand on a street corner in

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.119
a town in Northern France and spend all day
for a few days propositioning single women,

00:37:42.119 --> 00:37:46.119
single, young women who walked by. And they
were all instructed to say exactly the same

00:37:46.119 --> 00:37:51.519
thing and this is the translation of it. They
basically say, "Hi my name's Antoine. You're

00:37:51.519 --> 00:37:55.140
very pretty, don't have time to talk now,
can I have your phone number, I'll call you

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:56.140
later for a drink."

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:57.160
[laughter]

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:01.529
But to half of the women they propositioned
they were told to give a very light half second

00:38:01.529 --> 00:38:06.390
or less touch on the shoulder or the elbow
and to the other half they weren't; they were

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:11.119
told not to do that. And the question was:
what kind of effect does this have on their

00:38:11.119 --> 00:38:17.329
success rate? Well it had a great effect,
it doubled it. So 10%of the women agreed to

00:38:17.329 --> 00:38:22.239
the date if they didn't touch them and 20%
did with the touch.

00:38:22.239 --> 00:38:23.239
[laughter]

00:38:23.239 --> 00:38:26.309
Again going to the skeptics side you could
say, "Well touch is actually more directly

00:38:26.309 --> 00:38:32.460
related to sex. What about other things that
about the influence of touch in other social

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:36.970
situations that aren't so directly related
to the touching you might do later?"

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:37.970
[laughter]

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:43.070
And so one of the other experiments was done
in restaurants, actually two of them. In one

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:50.789
of the experiments they gathered a group of
waiters and waitresses instead of the men

00:38:50.789 --> 00:38:54.099
and they told them, "When you deal with your
customers I want you somewhere during the

00:38:54.099 --> 00:38:59.190
interaction to give them a nice light touch,"
for half of them; and for half don't. "And

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:03.969
we're gonna keep track of your tips and see
if touching them increases your tips."

00:39:03.969 --> 00:39:09.290
And sure enough they found that the waitresses
and waiters averaged 14½% tips from the customers

00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:14.869
they didn't touch and 17% from the customers
they did touch. And they did a similar experiment

00:39:14.869 --> 00:39:19.380
on how many people take your recommendation
when you recommend the special and that went

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:22.690
up from 40% to 60% with the touch.

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:29.039
What about going to the blackboards, this
is one of my pet peeves on this study: they

00:39:29.039 --> 00:39:33.289
said, "No one in the math class," and I've
taught math classes, "No one in the math class

00:39:33.289 --> 00:39:37.539
will wanna go to the blackboard." So they
tested the influence of touch on kids who

00:39:37.539 --> 00:39:40.920
wanna go to the blackboard in a difficult
statistics class and as the professor's asking

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:45.640
them to go the blackboard and potentially
be embarrassed, and only 9% who weren't touched

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:49.749
went to the blackboard but with this very
subtle touch 28% did.

00:39:49.749 --> 00:39:54.809
Doctors, where are the doctors?

00:39:54.809 --> 00:39:55.829
[pause]

00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:58.539
The doctors have disappeared. Well, that's
okay.

00:39:58.539 --> 00:40:06.550
Agreeing to take a mall survey: 53% agreed
to spend five minutes on a mall survey and

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:11.880
76% agreed to take it if they were given a
light touch. So this touch, and oh by the

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:16.410
way, in most of these studies the subjects
were debriefed afterward and one of the questions

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:21.119
they were asked was, "Did you notice being
touched at any time?" And most of them in

00:40:21.119 --> 00:40:24.690
the study said that they didn't even notice
the touch.

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:26.260
[pause]

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:30.619
Finally I wanna talk about when self provides
the context. So sometimes the context in a

00:40:30.619 --> 00:40:35.809
social situation has to do with how it matters
to you personally and your own self-image

00:40:35.809 --> 00:40:37.529
or your own world view.

00:40:37.529 --> 00:40:43.009
This is Salvador Dali and he famously said,
"Every morning upon awakening, I experience

00:40:43.009 --> 00:40:48.500
a supreme pleasure: that of being Salvador
Dali, and I ask myself wonderstruck, what

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:51.690
prodigious thing will he do today, this Salvador
Dali?"

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:52.690
[laughter]

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:57.569
Now he may sound like a pompous ass but I
[chuckles] like this quote because this quote

00:40:57.569 --> 00:41:03.190
is what our unconscious mind wants us all
to feel about ourselves. Because the best

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:08.029
chance of success we can have in life if you're
approaching some difficult problem at Google

00:41:08.029 --> 00:41:12.969
or if you're approaching difficult graduate
school or medical school or difficult medical

00:41:12.969 --> 00:41:20.410
problems, chemotherapy, starting a business
on your own, you have a very big advantage

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:26.680
if you feel that you can overcome this and
that you that don't have perhaps a totally

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:30.749
realistic view of what you're getting into.
And your unconscious mind is very important

00:41:30.749 --> 00:41:32.240
helping you see that.

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.749
Let me just show you the results of that.
What happens when you ask people how good

00:41:35.749 --> 00:41:38.789
they are at things? If you ask high school
kids, "Are you above average?" I don't know

00:41:38.789 --> 00:41:43.369
if any of you have high school kids but you'll
probably know that they're gonna say, "Yes."

00:41:43.369 --> 00:41:48.509
And indeed in a survey of three million high
school kids, 100% of them said they were above

00:41:48.509 --> 00:41:49.589
average. [laughs]

00:41:49.589 --> 00:41:50.589
[laughter]

00:41:50.589 --> 00:41:56.039
I'm guessing they rounded up from 99.99, but.
What about the professors? Do the teachers

00:41:56.039 --> 00:42:00.839
have a better view? So professors were asked,
"Is your work above average?" Yes, only 94%

00:42:00.839 --> 00:42:02.780
of them thought so.

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:07.099
And here's some doctors, what about your doctor,
your doctor's usually confident in your diagnoses.

00:42:07.099 --> 00:42:11.569
But in one study doctors were confident that
they had diagnosed pneumonia correctly 80%

00:42:11.569 --> 00:42:16.469
of the time and they were only right 20%of
the time.

00:42:16.469 --> 00:42:22.339
One of the things your mind does when it gives
you these over inflated views of yourself

00:42:22.339 --> 00:42:28.779
is it changes the way you treat incoming data;
this is called motivated reasoning. So if

00:42:28.779 --> 00:42:33.049
you're completely objective and you look at
data then you might judge the data by the

00:42:33.049 --> 00:42:40.440
methodology, you might judge the data by the
weight that that particular data should hold,

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:45.940
in other words, is that factor that you're
testing very important? But what your unconscious

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:51.190
mind does is it adjusts the weight that you
give to data and it adjusts your view of the

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:57.119
methodology in a way to tend to confirm your
preexisting beliefs and desires.

00:42:57.119 --> 00:43:02.160
So when you're looking at data, the human
mind does not act as a scientist who's analyzing

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:06.489
data objectively and drawing a conclusion
but your unconscious mind is more like a lawyer

00:43:06.489 --> 00:43:10.739
who looks at the conclusion that you want
and adjusts the way that you look at the evidence

00:43:10.739 --> 00:43:14.809
to tend to support that conclusion. And it's
very important this unconscious 'cause if

00:43:14.809 --> 00:43:18.930
you try to consciously do it you're too smart
for that, you're gonna know that I'm just

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:23.410
fooling myself. But your unconscious can fool
you in a way that you're not aware of and

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:25.209
that's how these things happen.

00:43:25.209 --> 00:43:29.599
And another thing that your unconscious does
is it adjusts your memory. Your memory, as

00:43:29.599 --> 00:43:34.190
we'll see later, is a construction just like
your vision is and your audio and your social

00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:40.709
perception. What you remember are the broad
strokes of things that happen just like your

00:43:40.709 --> 00:43:45.719
eyes pick up the broad strokes of the scene
but it's fuzzy and your brain puts it together,

00:43:45.719 --> 00:43:49.539
your memory remembers the broad strokes of
events that happen and then fills in the blanks

00:43:49.539 --> 00:43:55.440
so that you have a very clear memory, a distinct
memory. But that memory uses things like context

00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:00.250
in addition to data, context, prior knowledge,
beliefs, and desires.

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:04.599
So if you ask, for instance, students four
years out of college, "What were your grades?"

00:44:04.599 --> 00:44:09.530
you'll find an interesting effect. They tend
to remember their A's pretty well and their

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:11.249
lower grades less and less.

00:44:11.249 --> 00:44:15.329
In one study scientists gathered together
a bunch of kids who had graduated four years

00:44:15.329 --> 00:44:19.229
earlier, got them to sign off on their transcripts,
got their transcripts so they could see what

00:44:19.229 --> 00:44:23.880
their grades were, and the kids had no motive
to lie, and they asked them about their grades.

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:29.079
Well they remembered their A's 89% of the
time, 60% of their B's, 51% of their C's,

00:44:29.079 --> 00:44:31.799
and only 29%of their D's.

00:44:31.799 --> 00:44:34.369
So if you were in school, and I always tell
my students, "If you're getting back grades

00:44:34.369 --> 00:44:36.759
don't worry in time your grades will improve."

00:44:36.759 --> 00:44:39.670
[laughter]

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:45.950
Now in business what happens is this can cause
problems because CEO's, for instance, tend

00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:50.050
to overpay for companies because they look
at other companies and they go, "I'm a better

00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:54.619
CEO than that CEO. One of the problems is
that CEO didn't know how to run the company.

00:44:54.619 --> 00:44:58.380
I can run it better." And so they end up overpaying
for the company.

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:07.140
So our unconscious mind creates sincere beliefs
and images of what's going on in the world,

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:12.269
and we believe them as being real, but they're
not necessarily based purely on data.

00:45:12.269 --> 00:45:13.519
[pause]

00:45:13.519 --> 00:45:22.140
This motivated reasoning was illustrated nicely
in a study in Texas. They took subjects and

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:28.369
the subjects were all given the data on a
case where an automobile crashed into a car,

00:45:28.369 --> 00:45:33.190
crashed into a motorcycle and the motorcyclist
was suing the automobile driver. And they

00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:36.910
gave them the transcript of the case, the
data, and they told half of them, "You're

00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:40.910
gonna take the part of the motorcyclist."
And they told the other half, "You're gonna

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:46.089
take the part of the automobile driver. And
you're gonna pair up and negotiate your own

00:45:46.089 --> 00:45:51.400
form of the settlement," which was between
$0 and $100,000.

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:54.970
So they digested all this data and they got
ready to negotiate and then the experimenter

00:45:54.970 --> 00:46:00.950
said, "Oh wait a minute, before you do that
take your advocate's hat off, this is just

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:05.359
a game after all, so forget the conflict of
interest. I want you to guess what the real

00:46:05.359 --> 00:46:09.970
settlement was and if you can guess within
$5,000 I'll give you a cash bonus. So it's

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:14.740
in your financial interest to be objective
here and to ignore any possible motivated

00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:21.029
reasoning that you had when you were digesting
the data." So how did they do? Well the subjects

00:46:21.029 --> 00:46:24.930
who were told that they were going to take
the motorcyclist part guessed on average that

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:32.349
a fair settlement would be $40,000, but those
who took the driver's part guessed only $20,000.

00:46:32.349 --> 00:46:36.940
So they were unable to overcome, as I said
these are automatic, the unconscious effects

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:41.160
are automatic and very hard to control. So
even when money was at stake for them they

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:44.299
were unable to be objective in their analysis
of the case.

00:46:44.299 --> 00:46:49.180
Let's see if this stuff happens to you. So
we'll get to those two tests that we did earlier

00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:57.029
and the first one is called anchoring and
it shows how the context of a situation can

00:46:57.029 --> 00:47:03.859
affect your consumer behavior. Both groups
were given this question as question number

00:47:03.859 --> 00:47:08.680
two: "How much would you expect to pay for
this lovely hotel room in Tahiti?" Well, let

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:14.239
me tell you what the answers were: Group 1,
that's you guys right? You guessed on average

00:47:14.239 --> 00:47:20.700
$1,176. So Group 2 you're probably a little
bit surprised because you guessed on the average

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:22.239
$304.

00:47:22.239 --> 00:47:27.890
Well what I did do? I exercised mind control
over you guys. From over here I went like

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:33.710
that and I got you guys to quadruple your
offer. And how did I do that? That's because

00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:36.779
when, I didn't give you a lot of data on the
hotel room, I gave you some pictures and it

00:47:36.779 --> 00:47:41.610
was in Tahiti and a little information and
your brain formed some kind of image of what

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:46.259
this hotel room is worth. The thing is that
the difference between you guys was the first

00:47:46.259 --> 00:47:51.359
question I asked. So Group 1 was asked, "Does
this cost more than $5500 a night?" And Group

00:47:51.359 --> 00:47:56.109
2 was asked, "Does this cost more than $55
a night?" This is like a throw away question

00:47:56.109 --> 00:48:00.029
'cause I think it's pretty obvious that it
is more than $55 a night and it's not more

00:48:00.029 --> 00:48:04.859
than $5500 a night. And you probably didn't
think too much about it and thought, "Well

00:48:04.859 --> 00:48:10.119
these questions are a little bit extreme,"
but yet it affected your conscious assessment

00:48:10.119 --> 00:48:11.349
of what's going on.

00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:17.260
So when you watch those late night shows and
they wanna sell you 10 steak knives for $49.95

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:20.789
in the end, but they start off by saying,
"These 10 steak knives are worth $700, we

00:48:20.789 --> 00:48:26.099
normally sell them for $700 but today just
for you it's discounted to $49.95." And you're

00:48:26.099 --> 00:48:30.329
probably thinking if you're like me, "That
$700 what BS, no one would ever pay anything

00:48:30.329 --> 00:48:33.739
like that." But what you don't realize is
they manipulated you to thinking that the

00:48:33.739 --> 00:48:38.529
$49.95 wasn't nearly as bad as you might think
if they hadn't given you the $700 to begin

00:48:38.529 --> 00:48:41.279
with, as absurd as it is.

00:48:41.279 --> 00:48:42.939
[pause]

00:48:42.939 --> 00:48:49.959
So finally let me, let's go to the other test
which shows you how you create your own memories.

00:48:49.959 --> 00:48:55.520
What I gave you earlier was this list over
here: candy, sour, sugar, etcetera and then

00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:59.309
I asked you which of these words appeared
on the list.

00:48:59.309 --> 00:49:03.849
Well I was telling you how your brain constructs
memories just like it constructs vision based

00:49:03.849 --> 00:49:10.529
on things like context, and this is a good
illustration of that. Because the word point

00:49:10.529 --> 00:49:15.160
was not on the list and only two of you guessed
the word point, that's pretty good and that's

00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:20.349
normal. And the word taste was on the list
and 37 of you correctly remembered that the

00:49:20.349 --> 00:49:23.740
word taste was on the list. But remember I
asked you to only write it down if you're

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:29.180
confident and if you can hear us saying the
word. So I don't think any of you should have

00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:32.869
written down sweet because sweet wasn't on
the list. So if you remembered the word sweet

00:49:32.869 --> 00:49:37.640
it was what we call a false memory. Your brain
reconstructed that clear as a bell, excuse

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:41.790
the pun, but it didn't hear anything; it's
just the gist of the list and it filled it

00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:46.670
in for you. So I said 37 people said taste,
well 37 people also said that sweet was on

00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:47.670
the list.

00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:51.949
So this shows you the power of the reconstruction
of your memory and it's something to be very

00:49:51.949 --> 00:49:55.869
cognitive of when you read about legal cases
and eyewitness testimony, but we don't have

00:49:55.869 --> 00:49:56.869
time for that.

00:49:56.869 --> 00:50:00.759
So let me just end with a quote from Carl
Yung that I like; I don't believe in a lot

00:50:00.759 --> 00:50:05.969
of what he said but some of what he said was
really [inaudible]. "These subliminal aspects

00:50:05.969 --> 00:50:10.369
of everything that happens to us may seem
to play very little part in our daily lives,

00:50:10.369 --> 00:50:13.819
but they are the almost invisible roots of
our unconscious thoughts."

00:50:13.819 --> 00:50:14.819
Thank you.

00:50:14.819 --> 00:50:15.819
[laughter]

00:50:15.819 --> 00:50:15.820
[applause]
