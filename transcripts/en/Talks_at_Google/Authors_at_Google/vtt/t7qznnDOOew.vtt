00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.879
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Author's at Google New
York are very pleased to welcome James Briscione

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:08.080
and Brooke Parkhurst as they introduce their
new cookbook, Just Married and Cooking.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.080
Here we go.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.080
&gt;&gt;James: Yea, here we are.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.080
&gt;&gt;Brooke: [Laughing]

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.080
[Applause]

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.080
&gt;&gt; Brooke: Thank you guys for coming.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.080
Enjoying your lunch hours with us.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.320
We really appreciate it.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.539
&gt;&gt; James: Yeah, thank you very much.

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.080
[clears throat] I actually love this forma,
because I think you guys are helping me prove

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.530
a point right now.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.090
Brooke never believes I can pay attention
to her while I'm working on my laptop at the

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.090
same time.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.430
I think you guys are going to prove that point.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.130
Help me prove that point.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.230
I appreciate that.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.230
Thank you.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.230
I'm James.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.230
My wife Brooke--

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.700
&gt;&gt;Brooke: I'm Brooke.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.210
&gt;&gt;James: We're both New Yorkers.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.910
Well, currently New Yorkers at least.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.160
We both grew up down South.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.329
We live here in the city.

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.700
Actually just down the street in the village.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.190
I teach full-time at the Institute of Culinary
Education, some of you guys may know the cooking

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.230
school up on 23rd street.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.969
And I used to, I was one of the sous chefs
in the private dining room at Restaurant Daniel

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:02.250
before coming to the school to teach.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.189
So I've kind of got a chef and fine dining
sort of background.

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:08.100
And Brooke is a writer—

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.320
&gt;&gt;Brooke: I'm a writer.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.320
&gt;&gt;James: and former journalist.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.420
&gt;&gt; Brooke: I used to work for Fox News Channel
and quickly decided that that wasn't going

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.819
to be for me.

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:20.810
So I transitioned into my real passion which
were writing and food.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.710
And I published a novel three years ago, Belle
in the Big Apple about a southern girl moving

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.490
to New York City.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.090
And then I happened to meet this one and was
able to take my passion for culinary to a

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.090
different level because he was patient enough
to work with me.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.689
And from that, we kind of began journey to
write this book which we realize we never

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.119
set out to write a book for newlyweds.

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.999
It's something that kind of came naturally.

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:55.749
Because like we say in the introduction it's
kind of like the mixed tape.

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:58.039
The foodie mixed tape of our lives.

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.380
It was just one song after other of representative
moments.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.489
It was one recipe after the other that we
were cooking for each other in our first year

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:09.299
as both parents and newlyweds.

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:14.080
Things happened a little out of order so we
began our big journey all at once.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.420
So we really had to get in the kitchen because,
you know, we couldn't take out an infant.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.510
We really had to get in there and figure out
how to make amazing meals for each other and

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.760
for our tiny family.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.440
&gt;&gt;James: Yeah, so and the book just married
and cooking is really our story.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.130
It's certainly a book for everyone.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.230
It's not explicitly a newlywed cookbook.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.530
I think there's good things in there for every
day for everyone.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.859
It's full of just great recipes.

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:51.540
Things that are really useful but we can point
to almost every recipe in that book and remember

00:02:51.540 --> 00:03:00.140
a time when we first started dating five years
ago on up through we pushed send for the last

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.780
time to our publishers where we remembered
these meals, preparing them together, enjoying

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.090
them together some sort of story.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.560
So they're really part of us and I think the
title of the book comes as much from our story

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.609
as it does.

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:17.939
Mark our intended audience.

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:23.140
&gt;&gt; And he gets things kind of fancy or he
enjoys doing things fancy from his background.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.329
I kind of bring him down and say, "honey,
we're not making foie gras every night.

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.170
We're not doing country liver pate again.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.260
We're not going to have eggs and bacon every
day for breakfast.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.530
We're going to try to make this a healthy,
easy, elegant cookbook.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.019
He also brings a different level of cooking
to it.

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.500
For those of you who are Food Network fans,
if you have time to watch the Food Network,

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.500
I don't know.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.030
He was the Food Network two-time Chop Champion.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.519
So he loves crazy ingredients, time constraints,
lights, cameras.

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.579
So I have to kind of tame him down for things.

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:01.670
&gt;&gt; James: I enjoy the challenge.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.079
&gt;&gt; Brooke: He enjoys the challenge.

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.500
&gt;&gt; James: Like you.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.290
&gt;&gt; Brooke: That's right.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.989
So what we wanted, you know, help you with
today or talk to you about or inspire you

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.420
is, you know, with you and your partners,
both of you probably working or with your

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.949
roommates, whatever it may be.

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:25.810
You absolutely can get in the kitchen let's
say three, four, five nights a week.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.960
That's what this book was written for, getting
you in the kitchen.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.440
And we think a great place to start is actually
Page 45 in the book and that is our After

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.830
Work Apps section.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.610
And it is kind of we love happy hour.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.449
Of course New York has amazing happy hours
especially this time of year.

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:46.880
We love going out for little bites to eat,
great glasses of wine or cocktails.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.770
Not like it add up but sometimes it's just
nice to chill out in your house especially

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:52.810
for those of you who have children.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.010
You kind of have to get back.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.060
You have to get back to the nanny, get back
to the babysitter or just get back to see

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.060
your little ones.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.970
So why not just throw your own happy hour
at home?

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.479
It's also a great motivator if you're not
quite into the cooking thing yet.

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.210
You have this amazing cafeteria.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.710
I would say I would never bring my own lunch.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:13.810
I don't blame you.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.800
I wouldn't be packing an egg salad sandwich.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.900
I would be enjoying the food truck and everything
else.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.930
But with the apps, it's great because you
can make them the night before.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:29.490
It kind of coaxes you to come back home and
enjoy a drink and an hors d'oeuvre.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.889
And it kind of gives you something to go on
and actually cook your meal that night.

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.670
Because if you come home, you and your partner
are starving.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.560
You want food then.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.900
So if things aren't prepared for you, you're
going to forget.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.110
You're going to scrap your idea of cooking
right, and head out for the takeout.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.000
So this way you got a little bit in your belly.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.810
You're going to be happy, maybe a glass of
wine and then you're going to move on and

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.649
maybe think about cooking dinner.

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:57.389
&gt;&gt; James: And so, as you look through those
recipes, they're really really simple.

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:05.139
It's the idea you can make any of these in
30 minutes on a Sunday afternoon or Saturday.

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:07.400
Kind of whatever you had a little bit of time.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.810
And they're all made to keep really well in
the refrigerator.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.720
So whether it's, you know, having a little
happy hour with some friends to your apartment

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.919
after you get off work or what Brooke was
saying just knowing that you've got something

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:24.470
ready to eat when you get home so you won't
stop at the deli so you don't stop off somewhere

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.309
just grab something while you're going home.

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:31.920
It's something to nibble on while you're waiting.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.710
What we always try to do because we're both
very busy and running.

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.530
If I'm at school and Brooke's working and
then with the baby.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.390
We're both kind of running around in different
places.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:47.320
Really, that end of the day is one of our
few chances to be together.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.500
&gt;&gt; Brooke: And who doesn't love 5 o'clock?

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.500
Let's be honest.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.680
It's the time to have a drink.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.310
So you might as well have something delicious
to eat with it, right?

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.310
[giggling]

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.310
&gt;&gt; James: Absolutely.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.850
For us kind of finding that reason or that
excuse or that motivation to get home and

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.270
cook your own meal and start your own meal.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:11.560
I think that's one really great way to help
yourself get into the mode of doing it.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.789
It's that already have something ready to
eat that's simple and satisfying but enough

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:17.880
to keep you going.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.229
And then, you know, second -- another.

00:07:20.229 --> 00:07:24.770
&gt;&gt;Female #1: I was just going to ask -- sorry
to interrupt.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.970
So tell us about when you come home from work.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.850
What should you have in your house right now?

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:35.550
It's early spring and it's 5 o'clock and I
know when I come home from 5 to 7 I can't

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:36.550
think.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.550
&gt;&gt;James: [chuckle]

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:43.330
&gt;&gt;Female #1: So how can we prepare to come
home for the blind spot between 5 and 7?

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:49.340
What would be a good thing to have in the
pantry, have handy so that we don't have to

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.900
run to the deli.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:51.900
That's why I end up.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.679
I end up with an empty refrigerator and that's
where the pizza arrives.

00:07:54.679 --> 00:07:55.679
&gt;&gt; James: Perfect.

00:07:55.679 --> 00:07:58.560
You took me into the next step.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.889
Really you guys are a great location here.

00:08:03.889 --> 00:08:06.470
We spend a lot of time at Chelsea market,
shopping there.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.020
The shops are fantastic.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:14.879
Another great motivator to go home and cook
something is just go buy something.

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:19.210
Whether it's whatever looks good and beautiful
and seasonal right now.

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:26.430
Certainly asparagus is everywhere and asparagus
is beautiful and they have New Jersey asparagus

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:29.160
at the Manhattan Fruit Exchange.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.450
I was right there yesterday and it's just
perfect.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:36.070
I think if you, you know, something that you
really love.

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:37.840
One ingredient that you really really like.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.840
Go buy it and just put it in your fridge even
if you don't have a plan for it.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:47.270
Because then as you start thinking about it
in there as you're working.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:52.340
Wait a second, asparagus recipes.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.440
let's Google some.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.330
And you know find a great asparagus recipe.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.950
You know, you start thinking about it and
then you're like wait a second, I just spent

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:01.080
five bucks on an asparagus.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.300
I spend another five bucks on a sandwich and
let that asparagus go bad.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:08.890
I better figure out something to make with
it and get it home.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:13.320
I feel like I say this every season.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.650
This is my favorite time of the year to cook.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.850
Whenever the seasons change and new stuff
becomes available.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:18.850
I always get so excited.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.900
&gt;&gt; Brooke: But there's so much available now.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.280
Strawberries, asparagus, little spring onions--

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.480
&gt;&gt;James: Peas and carrots.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.260
Turnips are one of my favorite things in spring
that I think a lot of people don't think about

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.260
it.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.510
People think of it more as a hearty winter
vegetable.

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:39.610
You get these little beautiful white turnips
radish size and we have those right there

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:44.450
at the Chelsea Market, Manhattan Fruit Exchange
right now.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:50.160
But it's so much fun, here in New York to
go and visit all of our green markets and

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.160
just walk around.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.580
You know, that's where some of the recipes
in our book came from was just from sort of

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.930
wandering around the green market, grab a
couple of--

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:58.930
&gt;&gt; Brooke: What was fresh.

00:09:58.930 --> 00:09:59.970
What we felt like that day.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:05.160
But there is, 5 to 7 o'clock period where
you go either way.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:11.490
So it's great if you have those stalks or
spears of asparagus just waiting for you.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:16.420
Maybe a half dozen farm eggs and you could
do a great just fried egg on top of blanched

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:21.070
asparagus, you know, a little pecorino on
top, something super, super simple.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:24.200
&gt;&gt;James: And you gotta have that Ham or bacon
too.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:30.480
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Ham or Bacon, he puts that in everything.[laughing]
There's no getting around that.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.940
And then also we get asked about the necessary
kitchen equipment.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.250
There really is so much out there.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:39.200
&gt;&gt; James: Before we move on I just want to
say one other thing on keeping you going or

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.940
helping you do it from 5 to 7.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:49.041
What we often do is, if we're making something,
you know, we make a lot of it.

00:10:49.041 --> 00:10:54.170
So if we were going to grill or roast some
chicken breasts or roast the whole chicken,

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:55.960
we might do two whole chickens.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.380
We might do six chicken breasts even though
there's two of us.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:06.910
Then you have great, good, tasty grilled chicken
just sitting in your fridge and it's so easy

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:11.110
to make a quick salad or to toss it into a
pasta or to--

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:12.450
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Yeah, don't cook for one night.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:13.620
Cook for three nights.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.070
Cook in larger portions.

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:21.200
And then our next book is about kind of transforming
each night.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.240
And go that you've made the first night.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.960
So you have this kind of one base recipe and
then by adding fresh produce and new spices

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.620
it's transformed each day without a lot of
muss and fuss.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:37.030
My mother did cook seven nights a week my
entire childhood, bless her.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.540
But she was in the kitchen all the time.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.670
And we just don't have that luxury.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:43.970
&gt;&gt;James: That's another full-time job to do
that.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:47.750
Don't if you will fool yourself and think
you have to be like they do on TV and whip

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:51.520
something up completely from scratch every
single day.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.550
Kind of embrace that ability to use something,
you know, to utilize,

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:56.550
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Stretch it.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.380
&gt;&gt;James: Make the most of it.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:03.850
If you're just going for one or two, that
one bunch of asparagus may be more than you're

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:05.450
going to eat in one night.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.600
So blanch all your asparagus.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.940
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Blanch means

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:13.420
&gt;&gt;James: Boiling in salted water to get it
just cooked through and then throw in some

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.080
ice water so it stays bright green.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:20.980
So you might have that with a fried egg and
some ham or bacon one night for dinner.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:25.660
But then the next day you may chop it up and
toss it with some pasta and feta cheese.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.060
&gt;&gt; Brooke: And Mint and peas makes a great
salad.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.670
&gt;&gt;James: Which is in there somewhere.

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:31.050
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Which is in the book.

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:32.050
&gt;&gt; James: Grilled chicken.

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:34.740
Kind of toss that.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.310
There's always something in our refrigerator.

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:42.830
&gt;&gt; Brooke: That inspires us to create it to,
you know, get in there and cook.

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:44.320
It's never just champagne and mustard.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.540
Ha ha ha. [giggling]

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:46.540
&gt;&gt; James: No.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:52.910
It's at least orange juice for our daughter,
juice and bananas and yogurt.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:57.670
&gt;&gt; Brooke: But the next thing also in the
beginning we have a list of kind of can't

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:00.570
miss gotta have kitchen appliances.

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:05.430
I think it's so overwhelming walking into
a Williams Sonoma and the store is so beautiful

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:07.580
and we were cooking there last night.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:12.910
Yesterday we cooked on the Today Show and
then in the evening we did a signing and demo

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:13.910
at Williams Sonoma.

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:19.390
And I could have left with 5,000 dollars worth
of fun, beautiful kitchen gear.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:23.510
Aside from having no space and no time in
the apartment, there's really no purpose.

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:26.490
Especially for starting out cooks.

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:31.650
We kind of what a top 5, top what?

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:37.160
Ten list of fun can't miss kind of inexpensive
things, right?

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.500
He first taught me about something as simple
as kitchen tongs.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.660
When you are blanching your asparagus, how
are you going to reach in and get them?

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:44.920
All of these things can be intimidating.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.730
Oh, my God I'm going to burn myself.

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:47.730
I don't know how to get it out.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:49.260
Am I going to pour the whole pot of water
out?

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:53.440
No, you have these simple tools that he's
been using all of what?

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.990
Your professional life in kitchens that the
home cook might not think to use that make

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:59.750
your life so much easier.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:02.000
We love a good set of tongs.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.050
A good microplane zester for grating garlic.

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:09.840
People get intimidated by how to properly
chop up a garlic.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.060
They don't want to do it.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:14.550
You get a mircoplane zester.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:18.400
They get intimidated by these 600 dollar knife
sets.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.020
Don't buy a seven piece knife set.

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:26.080
Go out and get one good lightweight Japanese
blade chef's knife or maybe three.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.090
Jamie favors three.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:28.090
You favor three.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.660
A paring knife, a serrated knife, chef's knife.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.570
That's really all you need in the beginning.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:38.790
So I think the less you spend in the beginning,
the less likely you are to be let down.

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:42.350
Because it's not like you made this 5,000
dollar investment and things aren't turning

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:43.530
out perfectly.

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:45.220
You made a small investment.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.380
You're learning, you're working and you can
always add on.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:52.220
The one thing we think you should invest in
is a good Cuisinart.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.500
For a lot of our dips and the after work apps
you're going to need a good Cuisinart.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:59.790
For a lot of great soups, homemade pestos
that are going to keep throughout the week

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:03.340
to toss with pasta and chicken when you come
home at the end of the day.

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.450
That's definitely something worth investing
in.

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:06.890
But there are really few things.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:08.450
A great wooden cutting board.

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.430
Go across to Bowery Trading Company.

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:12.430
What is it called?

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:13.430
&gt;&gt;James: Bowery Kitchen Supply.

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:17.490
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Bowery kitchen supply in Chelsea
market and get a great 50 dollar cutting board

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:19.820
and kind of start from there, right?

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:20.890
&gt;&gt; James: Right.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:27.260
&gt;&gt; Brooke: Another thing that we say is don't
try to make filet mignon with PB and J skills.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.450
Think about what your skill level is you're
starting off with.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.650
But we have the perfect book for that.

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:36.500
[laughing] But when you're looking at Epicurius
or you're looking online and you get stars

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.750
in your eyes and we all want to be Mario Batali
and you pick a really, really difficult recipe.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:45.060
Maybe it's the second thing you've really
ever tried to cook by yourself.

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:48.330
It's probably not going to turn out to be
fantastic.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:54.630
So why don't you start out in our book with
the skirt steak with scallion potato cakes.

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.730
Skirt steak is inexpensive.

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:57.730
You mess it up.

00:15:57.730 --> 00:15:58.730
Okay.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:00.040
You wasted five dollars.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.220
Say you had bought bone in ribeye for four.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.930
You mess that out, you're out 85 dollars.

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:10.230
Chances are when you mess up the rib eye,
the next thing you're going to do is get takeout.

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:13.970
You mess up the skirt steak, you might go
out and buy a second skirt steak and try it

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:14.970
out.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:20.980
So the less like I said with all of this the
tools, the food, the less monetarily you invest

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:25.860
in the beginning, the more likely you are
to succeed and kinda continue.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:29.130
&gt;&gt;James: It all takes practice.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:30.130
Just like anything.

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:34.190
I think to get good at anything in life, you
got to do it.

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:40.490
So, you know, don't be fooled by TV that makes
it all look so easy.

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:43.340
They wave their hands around, pull something
out from beneath the counter.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.220
Yeah, it's just that easy.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:46.490
It's not always just that easy.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:48.780
It's not necessarily that hard.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.250
But it takes a little practice.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:53.710
It takes some doing.

00:16:53.710 --> 00:17:00.170
You know, I was very fortunate kind of throughout
my career to be able to make a lot of mistakes.

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:05.020
Starting out cooking and actually I started
out as a dishwasher when I was 16 years old

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.390
and worked my way up through the ranks.

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:12.240
As a teenager cooking, I got to work at a
place where we were always allowed to make

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.480
ourselves lunch.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:18.639
We weren't able to pull out the good steaks
and just grill them all for ourselves.

00:17:18.639 --> 00:17:23.839
But to be honest when we had the time we could
make ourselves whatever we wanted to eat.

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:29.440
And I was getting really into cooking and
I was reading a lot and I'd go through books

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:34.830
and see all these things and try to go do
them the next day at work.

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:40.299
I remember the first time I tried to make
risotto, I made it are orzo pasta.

00:17:40.299 --> 00:17:42.009
I just didn't know the difference.

00:17:42.009 --> 00:17:46.679
I remember the word ended in O. That's pretty
much the shape.

00:17:46.679 --> 00:17:48.129
I think this is it.

00:17:48.129 --> 00:17:52.139
So my first batch of risotto ever was made
with pasta.

00:17:52.139 --> 00:17:53.639
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Not rice.

00:17:53.639 --> 00:17:55.850
&gt;&gt;James: And I learned from there, you know.

00:17:55.850 --> 00:18:00.549
The chefs were like, "Okay, it tastes good,
but this is no, this is not risotto.

00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:01.549
It's not even close.

00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:04.320
First of all, it's rice not pasta."

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.929
We went on from there.

00:18:06.929 --> 00:18:12.330
Making mistakes and expecting mistakes and
knowing it's not always going to be perfect.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:15.450
But you enjoy it anyway.

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.250
And have fun with the process.

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:22.059
That's for one of us the most important things
is just having fun with it and enjoying the

00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:24.580
process going through it together.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:29.519
&gt;&gt; Brooke: And it's great at the end of the
day I think we're all prone, maybe it's your

00:18:29.519 --> 00:18:32.429
computer, get in front of the television,
zone out.

00:18:32.429 --> 00:18:36.180
Kind of stick one person with chef duty while
the other gets to relax.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.470
Well, you really can relax together in the
kitchen.

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:42.059
Pour yourselves a glass of wine.

00:18:42.059 --> 00:18:43.220
Get in there.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:44.220
Learn together.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.220
Be a little creative.

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.830
Use our recipes as kind of the base.

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:50.130
And then, throw in your favorite things.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:54.190
But try to use that space as something fun
and not a chore.

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:58.549
Which cooking definitely can be or it can
seem like it is.

00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:59.610
If you have bad recipes.

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:03.620
But if you have fantastic recipes that are
going to turn out great time and again, ha

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.970
ha [laughing] you're going to enjoy it.

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:08.800
&gt;&gt; James: Oops, you have a question?

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:13.659
&gt;&gt;Female #2: So do you have any suggestions
for if you have like a disparity between the

00:19:13.659 --> 00:19:14.659
cooking skills.

00:19:14.659 --> 00:19:15.659
Like--

00:19:15.659 --> 00:19:16.659
&gt;&gt; Brooke: You're really good and your boyfriend's
really bad?

00:19:16.659 --> 00:19:17.659
[laughing]

00:19:17.659 --> 00:19:19.629
&gt;&gt; Female #2: My husband is really bad.

00:19:19.629 --> 00:19:22.960
And I don't want to be in there like, "no,
don't do it like that, you're chopping your

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.759
fingers off or your overcooking something."

00:19:25.759 --> 00:19:33.529
I don't want to be like the kitchen meister
but at the same time I really don't want to

00:19:33.529 --> 00:19:35.500
eat burnt food.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.809
&gt;&gt; James: [laughing]

00:19:36.809 --> 00:19:38.509
&gt;&gt;Brooke: That was a good question.

00:19:38.509 --> 00:19:41.940
One for him since he is by far better than
I am.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.159
He is the chef.

00:19:43.159 --> 00:19:44.399
I am the cook.

00:19:44.399 --> 00:19:49.140
&gt;&gt; James: Yeah, we say whenever you're trying
to cook together work together always play

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.140
to your strengths—

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:53.211
&gt;&gt;Brooke:Bbut if there are no strengths, what
do you do?

00:19:53.211 --> 00:19:54.211
[laughing]

00:19:54.211 --> 00:19:55.779
&gt;&gt;James: But if there are no strengths, what
do you do?

00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:58.610
You know, I think it's the same thing.

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:02.299
You know, kind of start out small.

00:20:02.299 --> 00:20:05.539
Just kind of give him little things to do.

00:20:05.539 --> 00:20:09.890
&gt;&gt;Brooke: That clove of garlic in the microplane
zester that you just gone out and bought and

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:10.940
just tell him to grate it.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.269
Or give him a block of cheese in the box grater.

00:20:13.269 --> 00:20:14.720
&gt;&gt; James: Now is he really ambitious?

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.230
Does he want to do it at all?

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:18.120
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Or is more than you let him?

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.900
&gt;&gt; Female #2: Um, Now, I mean he, he wants
to help.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:22.000
He doesn't want me to be the only person cooking
and doing stuff.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
&gt;&gt;Brooke: That's great.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
&gt;&gt; Female #2: He's excited about stuff.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:31.019
He is successful in a couple of things -- however
it takes like four times as long than necessary.

00:20:31.019 --> 00:20:35.020
Great on a Saturday but not Tuesday night.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:36.679
&gt;&gt; Brooke: Not Tuesday night.

00:20:36.679 --> 00:20:40.190
&gt;&gt; Female #2: I have to wait until ten O'clock—

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:45.429
&gt;&gt; Brooke: Well, this is I guess when like
prepping, no one likes to hear it but when

00:20:45.429 --> 00:20:46.429
prepping ahead.

00:20:46.429 --> 00:20:51.289
And this is one of our big pieces of advice
the night before kind of clean your vegetables

00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:54.330
or trim your meat or dice things.

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:59.809
In the culinary world "mise en place" getting
everything kind of like restaurant chefs do.

00:20:59.809 --> 00:21:03.860
So if you're excited about this Wednesday
dinner you all are going to make say "Honey,

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.739
well maybe you should get Tuesday night--

00:21:06.739 --> 00:21:12.440
&gt;&gt; James: Tuesday night after we finish dinner,
before we even clean up, let's just go and

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.779
have this stuff and we can chop up some of
this stuff for Wednesday.

00:21:14.779 --> 00:21:15.779
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Right.

00:21:15.779 --> 00:21:19.789
&gt;&gt;James: You can go sit down and relax and
let him take an hour and a half to chop an

00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:20.789
onion.

00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:21.789
&gt;&gt;Brooke: But that is great.

00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:22.789
You don't want to squash—

00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:23.789
&gt;&gt; Female #2: It never takes an hour and a
half to cut an onion.

00:21:23.789 --> 00:21:24.789
An hour and a half

00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:25.909
&gt;&gt; Brooke: We also teach couples cooking at
ICE.

00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:28.590
If you want to sign up for those.

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:29.929
Ya'll can come on.

00:21:29.929 --> 00:21:30.929
&gt;&gt; James: Bring him in.

00:21:30.929 --> 00:21:31.929
Bring him in.

00:21:31.929 --> 00:21:33.100
I'll help straighten him out.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:38.150
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Some of those are fundamentals of
cutting up, properly cutting up an onion.

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:39.460
Properly doing garlic.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:45.090
Things like that you do need learn once and
learn them well to move on.

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:50.539
&gt;&gt;James: I think learning some base knife
skills is really, really important.

00:21:50.539 --> 00:21:55.799
You know, like Brooke said, for we do the
couples classes up at ICE up at the school.

00:21:55.799 --> 00:21:56.799
They're a lot of fun.

00:21:56.799 --> 00:21:59.200
It's kind of a fun thing to do.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.340
Then you can just sort of stand back and say,
"Yeah, I told you.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:04.570
I told you that's what you're supposed to
do."

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:07.440
Don't ever do it.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.740
But you know some base knife skills.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:15.519
That I think once you get it down and learn
how to do it and understand how to use a knife

00:22:15.519 --> 00:22:21.480
properly and how to chop things up properly,
it really makes the process more enjoyable

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:25.419
because sometimes that's like the hard tedious
part.

00:22:25.419 --> 00:22:28.879
And if it takes you an hour and a half to
chop an onion, you're not going to be really

00:22:28.879 --> 00:22:31.320
motivated to do much else.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:35.850
But when you learn those things and they're
again, it's just something that takes some

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:36.850
practice.

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:42.440
But the skills, the concept of the skills
is really quite simple.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:46.070
Does anybody else have?

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:47.549
Yeah, please.

00:22:47.549 --> 00:22:53.679
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Do you have in your book anything
a child friendly recipes or if a child can

00:22:53.679 --> 00:22:54.679
participate?

00:22:54.679 --> 00:22:55.679
Are they simple enough for.

00:22:55.679 --> 00:22:58.899
&gt;&gt; Brooke: I think a lot of them are.

00:22:58.899 --> 00:23:01.009
&gt;&gt;James: They definitely are.

00:23:01.009 --> 00:23:04.480
Our daughter is not quite there yet.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.620
She just turned two.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.020
&gt;&gt; Brooke: How old are yours?

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.119
&gt;&gt; Female #3: 6 and a half.

00:23:08.119 --> 00:23:09.119
&gt;&gt; Brooke: Okay.

00:23:09.119 --> 00:23:10.119
So she can.

00:23:10.119 --> 00:23:11.119
&gt;&gt; James: You know what?

00:23:11.119 --> 00:23:12.119
I think there's.

00:23:12.119 --> 00:23:14.610
&gt;&gt; Brooke: Our everyday's dinner's chapter
is just great.

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.610
These weeknights we're talking about.

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:21.879
I think everyday dinner is very simple and
general that chapter to look at for these

00:23:21.879 --> 00:23:23.159
recipes that you certainly can do with a child.

00:23:23.159 --> 00:23:24.960
&gt;&gt; James: The soups and sandwiches.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:29.759
There's some soups and sandwiches and a few
salads in there that I think are really good.

00:23:29.759 --> 00:23:35.659
A lot of them a lot of times are using the
salads like shaved cheese where you just take

00:23:35.659 --> 00:23:37.970
the vegetable peeler and you peel the cheese.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:42.999
I think those are grating cheese and doing
those kinds of things are always good things

00:23:42.999 --> 00:23:43.999
for kids.

00:23:43.999 --> 00:23:45.440
&gt;&gt; Brooke: Things without heat, hahaha.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.440
[laughting]

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:50.299
&gt;&gt; James: Yeah, I think stirring or mixing
is always good.

00:23:50.299 --> 00:23:54.809
So in the breakfast chapter some of the things
like pancakes and muffins—

00:23:54.809 --> 00:23:55.809
&gt;&gt;Brooke: and muffins—

00:23:55.809 --> 00:24:01.970
&gt;&gt;James: and those kinds of things are really
great healthy muffin recipe in there.

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:06.480
We just had a bout of sickness in our house
and our daughter was a little sick and wasn't

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.480
really wanting to eat much.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:10.309
And I was thinking we need to make, she loves
cookies of course.

00:24:10.309 --> 00:24:15.740
As long as we tell her it's a cookie and it's
a little bit sweet and she's convinced.

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:20.889
I was just thinking we needed to make a batch
of muffins and they're healthy and a little

00:24:20.889 --> 00:24:21.889
bit sweet and pretty satisfying.

00:24:21.889 --> 00:24:23.650
&gt;&gt;Brooke: The granola in here also.

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:27.600
I love my granola recipe, girls and that's
a lot of fun.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:34.139
Throwing in the different nuts, coconut, dried
fruit, mixing it.

00:24:34.139 --> 00:24:37.330
That's a lot of fun you can't go wrong.

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:38.629
You can put more fruit than you need.

00:24:38.629 --> 00:24:39.629
More seeds.

00:24:39.629 --> 00:24:43.230
&gt;&gt; James: Have you found that your child,
boy or girl?

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:44.429
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Daughter.

00:24:44.429 --> 00:24:48.549
&gt;&gt;James: Your daughter, is she more interested
in eating when she gets to help you out with

00:24:48.549 --> 00:24:49.549
it?

00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:52.320
&gt;&gt; Female #3: She likes to help out just in
general.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.320
She usually does the baking.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.320
&gt;&gt; Brooke: Right.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.320
&gt;&gt;Female #3: She doesn't do skillet or anything
like anything with stove related.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.320
&gt;&gt;James: Right.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.320
&gt;&gt; Female #3: But I'm thinking , I want her
to be more healthy eater at least.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:07.119
I'm thinking to be involved more in dinner
cooking she might be.

00:25:07.119 --> 00:25:08.299
&gt;&gt; James: Definitely.

00:25:08.299 --> 00:25:10.679
You know I think-

00:25:10.679 --> 00:25:14.290
&gt;&gt;Brooke: The spring pasta we're actually
just talking about the penne with asparagus,

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:18.750
mint, peas, feta has a lot of great greens
in it.

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:19.750
It's very seasonal.

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:20.750
It's perfect for right now.

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:21.750
Let me find the page.

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:24.389
That could be a lot of fun, I think, for a
little one.

00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:28.050
&gt;&gt;James: That's a lot of, you could do a lot
of stuff at the stove.

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:30.110
Cook the pasta, cook the peas.

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:31.259
It's all just boiling water.

00:25:31.259 --> 00:25:33.220
So you put on one big pot of water.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:35.740
Throw the pasta in, get it cooked through,
put it in the colander--

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.970
&gt;&gt;Brooke: It's page 90 in the book: spring
pasta.

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:41.330
&gt;&gt;James: And then drop your asparagus and
peas in the boiling water.

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:42.330
Scoop them out.

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:45.399
Let them all cool a bit and then put them
in a bowl and you're going to toss it with

00:25:45.399 --> 00:25:52.129
some mints and some vinegar and feta cheese
and some scallions . You're just kind of toss

00:25:52.129 --> 00:25:53.529
that all together.

00:25:53.529 --> 00:25:58.909
You can kind of have all those things separate
and let her add them in mix it up and crumble

00:25:58.909 --> 00:25:59.909
up the cheese.

00:25:59.909 --> 00:26:04.500
Those are good things for little hands to
do.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:09.309
Lots of beautiful fresh spring vegetables
that are all really, really great right now.

00:26:09.309 --> 00:26:10.309
[pause]

00:26:10.309 --> 00:26:14.909
&gt;&gt; Brooke: Do ya'll cook a lot ya'll when
you go home?

00:26:14.909 --> 00:26:17.049
He says no; she says yes.

00:26:17.049 --> 00:26:18.820
&gt;&gt;James: I don't know how you could working
here.

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:22.480
I don't know I ever would.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.889
It's a very nice setup you guys got here.

00:26:25.889 --> 00:26:26.889
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Definitely.

00:26:26.889 --> 00:26:27.889
&gt;&gt;James: I'm jealous.

00:26:27.889 --> 00:26:30.480
I just want a scooter to ride around.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:36.630
I could get one push before I bump into a
wall at our apartment, at our office.

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:42.531
&gt;&gt; Female #4: Tell us about how you would
cook for a small family for a special occasion.

00:26:42.531 --> 00:26:48.309
Special occasion with adults would be the
big rib eye or whatever but now we have little

00:26:48.309 --> 00:26:52.190
kids and not so much time.

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:54.659
How do you suggest planning that day?

00:26:54.659 --> 00:26:59.190
Because sometimes to cook for like people
cook for another couple with their little

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:00.450
kid coming over on Saturday.

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:03.090
You need three or four hours to prep.

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:05.129
How would you divide up that three or four
hours?

00:27:05.129 --> 00:27:09.320
Would you divide it so everything was ready
when they show up or would you perhaps include

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.450
the other family so all of you are working?

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:14.490
What are your thoughts on that?

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:19.139
&gt;&gt;Brooke: I think first and foremost in those
three or four hours, you really should shop

00:27:19.139 --> 00:27:20.480
a different day.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:25.080
Fabulous location, you're right here at Chelsea
market after work one day and get your produce,

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.080
your groceries.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.080
Right?

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.549
So that's already taken out of that prep time.

00:27:29.549 --> 00:27:35.080
Then, yes we actually and the book is divided
into two sections which we haven't even talked

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.080
to you about.

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:40.110
There is life as we know it which is a lot
of these everyday type foods.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:44.809
And the second section is new traditions about
you and your partner and your little family

00:27:44.809 --> 00:27:48.919
maybe starting new traditions of your own
not just Christmas or Hanukkah and Thanksgiving,

00:27:48.919 --> 00:27:50.059
new ones.

00:27:50.059 --> 00:27:54.960
And in several of these menus we talk about
getting your guests involved because that

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.440
can be really fun.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:01.740
We do love doing pizzas at home, homemade
pizzas, you know, whole-wheat flour crusts.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:04.309
We use a lot of fresh veggies.

00:28:04.309 --> 00:28:06.049
Pizza is very fun for the kids.

00:28:06.049 --> 00:28:09.619
Stretch and kneed the dough.

00:28:09.619 --> 00:28:15.540
We talk about one in the back in our Brussels
sprout salad with a great homemade pesto about

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:19.120
everybody helping, you know, clean the Brussels
sprouts.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:26.409
&gt;&gt;James: That's one of my favorite menus and
recipe kind of occasion ideas from the second

00:28:26.409 --> 00:28:27.409
half of the book.

00:28:27.409 --> 00:28:28.710
What do we call it?

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:29.799
&gt;&gt; Brooke: New traditions.

00:28:29.799 --> 00:28:31.279
&gt;&gt;James: Right.

00:28:31.279 --> 00:28:34.719
It's the menu's called the holiday get away
from the family.

00:28:34.719 --> 00:28:36.139
&gt;&gt; Brooke: When you go home.

00:28:36.139 --> 00:28:40.149
&gt;&gt; James: Because Christmas time typically
for us it means going back home to where the

00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:41.149
parents are.

00:28:41.149 --> 00:28:42.289
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Page 299 in the book.

00:28:42.289 --> 00:28:48.470
&gt;&gt; James: And usually mom or aunts or uncles
somebody is still going to be hosting the

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:49.739
big holiday dinner.

00:28:49.739 --> 00:28:53.340
And when you've been home for three or four
days and you have pretty much all you can

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:57.360
handle of family and your ready to just kind
of get away from them get with friends.

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:01.379
This is like a really fun menu to do with
friends.

00:29:01.379 --> 00:29:05.840
Of course very seasonal and prime for November,
December.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:11.239
And you know, the idea is that you have this
great salad made with Brussels sprouts.

00:29:11.239 --> 00:29:16.140
&gt;&gt; Brooke: A sweet potato and brussels sprouts
salad with parmesan pecan pesto.

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:19.240
&gt;&gt;James: It's kind of tedious to pick all
those brussels sprout leaves and it will take

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:25.789
you awhile to do it but we say just have a
batch of cocktails made and when all your

00:29:25.789 --> 00:29:30.619
friends get together give everyone a bowl
of brussels sprouts and have them pick the

00:29:30.619 --> 00:29:31.619
brussels sprout leaves—

00:29:31.619 --> 00:29:32.970
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Make them work for it.

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:37.440
&gt;&gt;James: while you guys catch up and chat
and sip your cocktails so then you're ready

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.760
to go.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.230
It depends on what you're making.

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:47.529
&gt;&gt; Brooke: The key is that we teach in our
classes though you want to get them involved

00:29:47.529 --> 00:29:52.299
but don't actually think they want to make
it from start to finish with you.

00:29:52.299 --> 00:29:53.789
Like, when you have this pizza party.

00:29:53.789 --> 00:29:57.480
Don't actually give them a cup of water, flour
and to make the dough.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:00.059
You want to have a lot of it prepped ahead.

00:30:00.059 --> 00:30:03.620
It's just going to be easier and more enjoyable
for everyone.

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:08.419
So to answer Kate's question directly what
would we say?

00:30:08.419 --> 00:30:09.419
Be well prepared.

00:30:09.419 --> 00:30:10.419
&gt;&gt;James: Yeah, be well prepared.

00:30:10.419 --> 00:30:19.950
One of the things we always teach in our cooking
classes up at ICE is a lot of times it's nice

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:20.950
in the menus.

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:27.539
We always do one seafood and one meat whether
it be pork or chicken or beef or whatever

00:30:27.539 --> 00:30:29.120
as part of a dinner party menu.

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:36.360
One of the great tricks is being in New York
City -- at least us -- if you cook fish in

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.440
your apartment, you're going to know for awhile.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:41.619
Most people in your hall are going to know
you cooked some fish.

00:30:41.619 --> 00:30:45.399
That smell can just kind of hang for awhile.

00:30:45.399 --> 00:30:51.030
So a great trick for doing, you know, fish
for dinner party or having friends over is

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:53.470
just actually just sear the fish on one side.

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:59.390
Get it really nice brown in the pan and then
take it out and put it onto baking pan other

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:01.210
side completly raw.

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:06.690
And then, you can light some candles, open
the windows, turn on a fan and clear out the

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:07.789
apartment.

00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:12.030
Then when you're ready to actually have your
dinner when you're ready to serve all you

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:14.299
have to do is throw that tray of fish into
the oven.

00:31:14.299 --> 00:31:19.259
Takes about five minutes if the oven is at
425 degrees.

00:31:19.259 --> 00:31:20.840
The fish will be cooked through perfectly.

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:25.450
It will have that perfect it won't look like
sad baked fish.

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:31.359
I would say cafeteria food, but you guys don't
have sad cafeteria food here.

00:31:31.359 --> 00:31:35.620
It would look like a beautiful, roasted piece
of fish but you're not going to deal with

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:41.399
the smell, the oil splatter and all of that
mess.

00:31:41.399 --> 00:31:43.919
Pre-cooking thing is such a great investigate
thing to do.

00:31:43.919 --> 00:31:45.539
&gt;&gt; Brooke: That's a chef's trick that we do
in the restaurant.

00:31:45.539 --> 00:31:49.299
&gt;&gt;James: That's what most restaurants do in
the reality of it.

00:31:49.299 --> 00:31:53.889
When you think about when you go to a restaurant
sit down and order a bowl of risotto and in

00:31:53.889 --> 00:31:56.679
eight minutes, the bowl of risotto is at your
table.

00:31:56.679 --> 00:31:58.690
Start to finish that's a 35 minute process.

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:01.809
So the risotto is 75 percent cooked—

00:32:01.809 --> 00:32:02.809
&gt;&gt;Brooke:In the morning

00:32:02.809 --> 00:32:07.451
&gt;&gt;James: In the morning, miday and then it's
cooled down and held in the refrigerator and

00:32:07.451 --> 00:32:13.880
then when you order it they just heat up a
pot and . And there's nothing wrong with that

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:14.880
at all.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.109
We kind of always have this romantic image

00:32:17.109 --> 00:32:18.109
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Fresh.

00:32:18.109 --> 00:32:20.470
&gt;&gt;James: of all these things being made from
scratch.

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:22.260
&gt;&gt;Brooke: In the moment.

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:25.299
&gt;&gt; James: But pre-cooking things having things
prepared.

00:32:25.299 --> 00:32:29.912
Like we said, having things ready in your
fridge is really a wonderful way to go about

00:32:29.912 --> 00:32:30.912
it.

00:32:30.912 --> 00:32:31.912
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Another great thing—

00:32:31.912 --> 00:32:33.419
&gt;James: And it's the reality I think for all
of us.

00:32:33.419 --> 00:32:38.440
Kind of the way we live our lives and the
time constraints we have for cooking and working

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:39.440
these days.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:44.271
&gt;&gt; I think it's also really fun when you have
people over and we think it's really easy

00:32:44.271 --> 00:32:46.639
to have bottles of wine.

00:32:46.639 --> 00:32:47.639
Girls love wine.

00:32:47.639 --> 00:32:52.679
We love to get with the girls, eat cheese,
crackers, drink wine.

00:32:52.679 --> 00:32:53.679
It's great.

00:32:53.679 --> 00:32:58.919
In the book we have several chapters dedicated
to cocktails, house drinks.

00:32:58.919 --> 00:33:04.090
And if you're on a budget, it actually works
out to be more economical to make great house

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:07.749
cocktails if you think about a person's going
to have, each guest is going to have two or

00:33:07.749 --> 00:33:11.769
three glasses apiece, think of how many bottles
of wine you're going to go through.

00:33:11.769 --> 00:33:16.210
As opposed to you buy one nice bottle of what
would be liquor and you jazz it up with some

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:17.580
fresh juices.

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:24.989
We like our rosemary fresh lemonade infused
with rosemary and vodka.

00:33:24.989 --> 00:33:28.480
All of that is so much more inexpensive and
you also get these big points for being a

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:35.070
very kind of inventive creative hostess when
all you're doing is just following our book.

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:36.570
[laughing]It's a great touch.

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:42.629
It's personal to make those drinks and have
those ready instead of just wine.

00:33:42.629 --> 00:33:45.549
And like I said, it's easier on the budget
also.

00:33:45.549 --> 00:33:48.539
&gt;&gt; Female #5: Hi guys.

00:33:48.539 --> 00:33:50.029
&gt;&gt;James: Hey.

00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:55.619
&gt;&gt;Female #5: So sometimes cooking in New York
is really uninspiring not just because of

00:33:55.619 --> 00:33:59.539
the budget or the expensive food but because
your space itself is so uninspiring.

00:33:59.539 --> 00:34:03.320
It's small or ugly or cramped or your sharing
it with a roommate--

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:04.320
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Bad ventilation.

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:05.320
&gt;&gt;Female #5: All those things.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:09.380
So I'm wondering if you have tips about how
to make the space itself more appealing so

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.380
you want to get on in there.

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:16.580
So whether it be tips on storage, tips on
making it look prettier, keeping it clean.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:21.640
Sometimes I don't want to go in the kitchen
because I don't want to be in there.

00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:25.230
I don't want to spend two hours in that room.

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:27.800
Sometimes being in the kitchen is because
it's not fun.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:32.600
&gt;&gt; Brooke: First of all, removing clutter
from the counters, having nice clear clean

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.600
counters.

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.090
Think, are you actually using that toaster
oven?

00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:37.970
Do you actually use the microwave that much?

00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:40.740
Are you actually using the toaster?

00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:44.450
Different little things that perhaps can be
moved away so you have this clear counter

00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:45.450
space.

00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:48.040
What else honey?

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:49.320
Mr. Organization in the kitchen.

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.510
&gt;&gt;James: Yeah, I'm the one--

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:52.510
&gt;&gt; You are.

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:54.750
&gt;&gt; James: Usually in charge of that typically.

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:58.830
I mean, it is really challenging i think in
New York.

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:01.710
Counter space is almost always at a premium.

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:04.650
So you do your best to maximize it.

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:09.680
We have two different size cutting boards
we use depending on what's going on really

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:12.260
what we're working on.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.550
Which cutting board you're going to pull out.

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:15.800
You know, keeping just things really -- I
mean, just keep things organized.

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:16.800
&gt;&gt; Female #5: I guess do you guys turn on
music when you're in the kitchen?

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.800
Do you decorate?

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:18.800
I mean, the last place I think of you know
when I'm at IKEA or target is decorations

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.800
for the kitchen.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:29.060
But do you guys have photo frames--

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:33.755
&gt;&gt; Brooke: Well, one great thing actually
for organization is we have what is it called?

00:35:33.755 --> 00:35:34.755
A knife.

00:35:34.755 --> 00:35:36.030
&gt;&gt;James: The magnetic knife strip.

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:37.030
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Knife strip

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:39.700
&gt;&gt;James: So the knifes hang up on the wall.

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.560
&gt;&gt; Brook: So that's one less thing also on
your counter.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:43.700
You have the strip up there.

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:45.820
The knives are arranged nicely.

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:48.630
The Container Store we do love.

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:52.460
We do have a really big kind of pantry so
we're lucky for that.

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:53.460
&gt;&gt; James: Yeah.

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:59.440
We have, you know, just having things accessible
and not having to dig through cabinets.

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:03.480
Which may seem goes against what we just said.

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:07.720
But actually in the book here in the very
beginning there is a list of all the tools

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.840
you should have and how to use them.

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:14.400
And they're organized by where you should
store them.

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.150
There's things that should be in the drawer,
you have one drawer that you pull out that

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:21.040
has your peeler and whatever else in it.

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:26.920
And then, we always keep a little crock or
container right next to the stove that has

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:32.990
mixing tools: a whisk and a spatula and the
spoons, metal spoon and a wooden spoon and

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.990
a little scooper.

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.990
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Your tongs.

00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:37.150
&gt;&gt; James: For scooping things out of the stove.

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:40.400
So those things you would tend to use at the
stove are there.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:44.520
And I think sort of I think that's actually
a really good guide.

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:45.520
We spent a good bit of time--

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.300
&gt;&gt;Brooke: It begins on page can have 5, where
to keep things.

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:49.600
&gt;&gt; James: Putting that together.

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:52.670
But having the specific sort of stove tools.

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:54.030
Keep them by the stove.

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:55.330
Keep the things by the drawer.

00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:59.140
Keep the mixing bowls together in one cabinet.

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:02.310
If you can just dedicate a few spaces to that.

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:07.090
And you know don't keep a drawer full of takeout,
because you know you're going to get fresh

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:10.520
takeout menus every single day at your apartment
anyway.

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:14.520
&gt;&gt; Brooke: Dedicate that drawer to new kitchen
tools.

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:15.640
&gt;&gt; James: That's right.

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:16.640
&gt;&gt; Brooke: We love music.

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:21.150
I love a glass of wine when I cook, um, sometime.

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:23.170
&gt;&gt; James: We're actually very fortunate too.

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:27.450
We have a kitchen that just has little island
that looks out over our living room.

00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:30.560
&gt;&gt; Brooke: Otherwise our daughter would never
see us if our kitchen was in a different part

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:33.420
of the apartment or if it were closed off,
she would never see us.

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:36.170
Luckily we do have an open kitchen to the
living room.

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:43.200
&gt;&gt; James: We watch her scribble on the pillows
and chalk like she was just doing this morning**

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.180
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Morning.

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:49.150
&gt;&gt;James: before we left.

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:50.150
[pause]

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:53.120
&gt;&gt;Female: #6: Hi.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.100
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Hi.

00:37:55.100 --> 00:38:03.190
&gt;&gt;Female #6: The thing that I always have
trouble with is grocery shopping.

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:05.060
Like I'll go out Sunday and be like Oh yeah,
these veggies this looks great.

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:06.860
And then I'll come home on a Monday night
and I don't know how to cook this.

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:10.330
I don't know how to make this and I'll realize
I need ten other ingredients I didn't actually

00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:11.330
buy.

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:12.330
So do you guys plan out a menu every week?

00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:13.359
Do you find yourself running out?

00:38:13.359 --> 00:38:18.440
&gt;&gt; Brooke: We keep staples in the pantry which
is also in the beginning of the book with

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.440
the tools.

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.100
Things you should have all the time.

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:26.390
Then you can just work from and throw in fresh
things in addition to that.

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:28.720
So we begin with a well-stocked pantry.

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:33.620
Which is of course easy to say, but it makes
a lot of sense to go ahead.

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:38.770
Always have not just the flour and the sugar
but anchovies for one of our pasta sauces.

00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:40.880
To always have the chicken broth.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.870
To have those things.

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:44.990
Have a very basic spice cabinet.

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:48.650
And then what else honey?

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:55.670
&gt;&gt;James: Yeah, and you know the other thing
I think don't feel so bound to a recipe.

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:56.670
You know.

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:58.141
&gt;&gt; Brooke: Easy for him to say.

00:38:58.141 --> 00:39:01.490
Easy for a Chop Champion to say.Just whips
it up at the last minute.

00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:02.490
I'm more like you.

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:03.490
I like to follow a recipe.

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:07.640
&gt;&gt;James: If you have one or two ingredients,
doesn't mean you can't make it.

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:12.190
If you don't have a teaspoon of that spice,
you can go without it.

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:13.190
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Right.

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:14.190
&gt;&gt;James: It will be okay.

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:18.110
You can kind of, you know, work around those
things.

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:19.260
But we definitely do plan.

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:23.650
I mean, I actually have a list in my back,
I'm going to Chelsea market as soon as we

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:24.650
finish here.

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:31.080
I have a list in my back pocket of things
kind of think about what we want to make or

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:33.110
what we're going to make.

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:34.380
And make out a list.

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:35.380
But --

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:36.970
&gt;&gt;Brooke: And menu planning is really great.

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:40.450
You can think and plan out just three meals
or maybe start with two.

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:45.460
Do not be overly ambitious because you might
go out with your girlfriends or husband or

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:46.460
boyfriend or what else.

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:49.630
But make sure you have two and make sure you
get all the ingredients for those two.

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:50.980
And that can be your meal planning.

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:52.570
And then you can plan on two nights of leftovers.

00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:57.110
That's already four nights covered and do
cook that on Sunday.

00:39:57.110 --> 00:40:00.320
That will last you to Wednesday.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:05.760
Meal planning, it sounds like kind of what
a suburban housewife would do.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:09.000
Totally unnecessary and way too organized
but it's great to do.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000
It's already in your head when you're at work
or walking home or getting on the subway.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.380
What am I going to eat?

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:16.770
This is all so overwhelming.

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:21.920
Well, you know because you decided on Sunday
and you're taken care of until Friday.

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:26.130
And what we were talking about with Kate,
basically whatever you cook for yourself is

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:32.550
going to be more healthful than almost anything
you get in a restaurant or takeout.

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:35.690
You know exactly what's going into it.

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:38.880
Whether you're watching your figure or just
trying to be healthy.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:42.130
It's great to know everything that's going
into your food.

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:44.370
Or you can take things out our of recipes.

00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:46.360
You don't want so much cheese or sour cream
that he added.

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:51.700
You can take it out and be fine with it.

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:57.390
We love our takeout also, but once you get
used to eating very healthfully at home and

00:40:57.390 --> 00:41:02.910
then you have this takeout food or restaurant
food, it's "wow, it's so salty, wow, it's

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:06.700
so sweet or wow, it's so heavy."

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:08.140
&gt;&gt; James: And there's also substitutes.

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:11.300
When you get that great Thai recipe and it
calls for fish sauce.

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:14.450
You're not going to buy a whole bottle of
fish sauce just to make one thing--

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:15.450
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Soy sauce.

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:16.450
&gt;&gt;James: one time.

00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:17.450
Soy sauce is a good substitute.

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:22.200
You pull out the little packets that you saved
up from your sushi takeout that you saved

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.660
up for the last three months.

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:27.670
&gt;&gt; Brooke: Also by the way for these questions
things like this we have a website by the

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:28.700
same name.

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:30.630
Honestly, we always answer questions.

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:36.300
So for any of you guys feel free to write
us and ask questions like about "I don't have

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:38.570
fish sauce, what can I do Jamie?"

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:42.600
[laughing] You can write us and we'd love
to answer all your questions.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:46.010
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Any other questions?

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:50.090
I think that would be it.

00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:51.250
Thank you so much for your time, we really
appreciate it.

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:52.250
&gt;&gt;James: Great, well thank you guys.

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:53.250
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Thank you guys for coming.

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:53.251
[Applause]
