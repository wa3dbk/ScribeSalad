00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:10.460
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Hello everyone, thank you
guys for coming.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:17.570
I'm very happy and very proud to welcome Jonah
Lehrer who is the author of three books, 'How

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.460
We Decide', 'Proust Was a Neuroscientist'
and most recently 'Imagine', which is about

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.950
the science behind creativity.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.860
Hopefully you all will have a chance to read
it after this with the free copies.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.980
But I think it's particularly applicable to
us because it talks about what some of the

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.800
scientific underpinnings are both at an individual
level and an organizational level in terms

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.590
of fostering creativity, what are some of
the blocks and what are some of the enablers

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.590
behind them.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.280
So, with that, I will hand over to Mr. Lehrer
and we'll have time for a Q&amp;A session afterwards.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.649
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: Thank you all for coming.

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.289
It's a pleasure to be back at Google, I was
just at the New York office a couple weeks

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:06.020
ago and every time I'm in a Google office
I always get the intense urge to apply for

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.020
a job here.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.270
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: Cause it always smells so

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.660
good and the offices are so beautiful.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.790
Um, I don't want to step in that.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.479
I'd like to begin today with a story about
Bob Dylan.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.700
We heard when I walked into the room one of
his better songs playing.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.710
So, it takes place in the early summer of
1965 when Dylan was just finishing up his

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.710
tour of England.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.549
It'd been a grueling few months for the singer
as he had been struggling to maintain a nonstop

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.390
performance schedule.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.750
He'd first traveled across the Northeast on
a bus playing in small college towns and big

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:42.750
city theaters.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.880
Then he crossed over the west coast to the
states and crammed in a hectic few weeks of

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.909
concerts and promotion.

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.850
He'd been paraded in front of the press and
asked an endless series of inane questions

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.750
from, "What is the truth" to "Why is there
a cat on the cover of your last album?"

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.360
When Dylan wasn't surly, he was often sarcastic,
telling journalists he collected monkey wrenches,

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.920
was born in Mexico, that his songs were inspired
by chaos, watermelon and clocks.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.600
That last line almost made him smile.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.980
By the time Dylan arrived in London it was
clear the tour was taking a toll, the singer

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.760
was skinny from insomnia and pills, his nails
were yellow from nicotine and his skin had

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.020
a ghostly pale pallor.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.940
Joan Baez said he looked like an underfed
angel.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.270
He rare--, for the first time his solo shows
felt formulaic as if he were singing the lines

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.270
of someone else.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.110
He rarely acknowledged the audience or paused
between songs, he seemed to be in a hurry

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.389
to get off stage.

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:44.329
Before long, it all became too much.

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.260
While touring in England Dylan decided that
he was leading an impossible life.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.800
The only talent he cared about, his ceaseless
creativity was being ruined by fame.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.769
The breaking point probably came after a brief
vacation in Portugal where Dylan came down

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.620
with a vicious case of food poisoning.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.990
The illness forced him to stay in bed for
a week, giving the singer a rare chance to

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.990
reflect.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.269
"I realized I was very drained" Dylan would
later say, "I was playing a lot of songs I

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:09.269
didn't want to play.

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.120
I was singing words I didn't really want to
sing.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.470
It's very tiring having other people tell
you how much they dig you if you yourself

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.040
don't dig you."

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.910
The last shows were in London.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.020
It was here that Dylan told his manager that
he was quitting the music business.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.060
He was finished with singing and song writing.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.530
He was gonna move to a tiny cabin in Woodstock,
New York.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.200
Although Dylan had become a pop icon, the
prophetic poet of his generation, he was ready

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.860
to renounce it all.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.620
He just wanted to be left alone.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.940
Dylan wasn't bluffing.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.419
As promised he returned from his British tour
and rode his Triumph motorcycle straight out

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:48.420
of New York City; he didn't even bring his
guitar.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.840
Of course our story doesn't end here.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.770
Bob Dylan did not retire in 1965.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.990
After a few relaxing days in Woodstock, just
when he was most determined to stop creating

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.660
music, he was overcome with the familiar feeling.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.290
"It's hard thing to describe," Dylan would
later remember.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.100
"It's just a sense that you've got something
to say."

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.450
So Dylan did the only thing he knew how to
do, he grabbed a pencil and pad of paper and

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.299
started to scribble.

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.650
Once Dylan began his hand didn't stop for
the next several hours.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.040
"I found myself writing this song, this story,
this long piece of vomit.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.290
20 pages long," Dylan said, "I'd never written
anything like that before and it suddenly

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.860
came to me that this is what I should do."

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.790
Vomit is the essential word here.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.040
Dylan is describing with characteristic vividness,
the uncontrollable rush of creative insight,

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.400
that flow of associations that can't be held
back.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.670
"I don't know where my songs come from," Dylan
said, "It's like a ghost is writing the song.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.460
It gives you the song and it goes away, you
don't know what it means."

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.090
In retrospect, we can see that this frantic
composition, these words written by the ghost

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.070
in Woodstock allowed Dylan to fully express
for the very first time the full diversity

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.180
of his influences.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.000
In his cryptic lyrics, we can hear his mental
blender at work as he mixes together scraps

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.430
of Blake, Fellini, Woody Guthrie and Robert
Johnson.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.260
Songs are modernist and pre modern, avant
garde and country western.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:21.250
What Dylan did, and this is why he's Bob Dylan,
is find the strange thread connecting these

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.960
different voices.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.040
In those first minutes of writing, he found
a way to make something new out of this incongruous

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.790
list of influences, drawing them together
into a catchy song.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.310
When Dylan gets to the chorus and he knows
this is the chorus as soon as he commits it

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.350
to paper, the visceral power of his words
becomes obvious.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.420
"How does it feel without a home?

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.240
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone."

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.300
The following week, on June 15th, 1965, Dylan
would bring the sheaf of papers into the cramped

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.530
space of Studio A Columbia records in New
York City.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:02.670
After just 4 takes, the musician's only beginning
to learn their parts, "Like a Rolling Stone"

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:03.840
was cut on acetate.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:10.330
Those 6 minutes of raw music would revolutionize
rock and roll.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:16.390
The story of "Like a Rolling Stone," the reason
I'm talking about Bob Dylan today, is because

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.830
it's a story about a moment of insight.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:24.480
At times, such stories can feel like romantic
clichés, the sort of make believe breakthroughs

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.650
that happened to Archimedes in the bathtub
and Newton under the apple tree.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.610
And yet, insights do happen, they are a genuine
mental event.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:37.820
They really are responsible for the theory
of gravity and "Like a Rolling Stone."

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.220
In recent years, cognitive psychologists and
neuroscientists made some interesting progress

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:46.060
trying to understand these most mysterious
of mental moments in terms that there are

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.330
two defining features to moments of insight.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.639
The first defining feature is the answer just
arrives out of the blue, arrives when we least

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:53.639
expect it.

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:58.790
So we wrote our best song, our most influential
song after we quit the singing and song writing

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:59.790
business.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.630
The second defining feature is as soon as
the answer arrives, as soon as we write those

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.900
words down, we know this is the answer we've
been searching for.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.170
That this is the solution we need.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:13.290
It comes attached with this feeling of certainty,
it seems like a revelation.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.570
So those are the two defining features of
moments of insight.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:21.020
And at first glance, it's not quite clear
how one can scientifically study such things

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:26.630
cause you can't just put undergraduates in
a brain scanner, fMRI machine and say, "Have

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.130
an epiphany we're ready for you."

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.590
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: That'd be very inefficient.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.800
So, instead, what scientists had to do is
come up with a way to generate lots of moments

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.910
of insight on the fly.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:40.370
And I'm talking today, primarily, about the
research of Mark Beeman at Northwestern and

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.870
John Kounios at Drexel University.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:47.790
And they came up with a set of word problems
called compound remote associate problems.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.470
The acronym has been unfortunate, C-R-A-P.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.520
But they generated lots of moments of insight.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.910
So the problems go like this, I'm gonna give
you three words, you have to find a fourth

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.830
word that can form a compound word with these
three words.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.120
So we'll do the first one together.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:10.090
The three words are pine, crab and sauce,
the fourth word in this case is apple; pineapple,

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.770
crab apple, applesauce.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:13.170
Here's one for you guys.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:17.850
The three words are age, mile and sand.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:21.710
What's the fourth word that can form a compound
word with age, mile and sand?

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.449
&gt;&gt;male audience member: stone.

00:08:23.449 --> 00:08:27.940
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: An answer that quick is most
certainly a moment of insight.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.949
The answer is stone, stone age, milestone
and sandstone.

00:08:30.949 --> 00:08:34.899
So the first thing Beeman and Kounios discovered
when they gave people these compound remote

00:08:34.899 --> 00:08:39.089
associate problems inside an fMRI machine
is that in the seconds before the insight

00:08:39.089 --> 00:08:44.630
appeared an obscure part of the brain called
the anterior superior temporal gyrus in the

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.441
back of the right hemisphere just behind your
ear, showed a sharp spike in activity.

00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:50.540
It's a brain area nobody knows too much about.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:55.029
It's been previously associated with things
like the processing of jokes and the interpretation

00:08:55.029 --> 00:08:56.029
of metaphors.

00:08:56.029 --> 00:08:58.790
And this begins to make a little sense, right?

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:03.511
When Romeo says that Juliet is the sun, we
know he's not saying that Juliet is a big

00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:07.060
flaming ball of plasma gas, we realize he's
trafficking metaphor.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:11.390
And how we make sense of that metaphor is
by looking past all the surface dissimilarities.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:15.820
The fact that Juliet and suns have literally
nothing in common and, instead, searching

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.180
for the underlying themes it actually shares.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:24.360
We're able to realize that Romeo is saying
Juliet lights up his world the way the sun

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.850
lights up ours.

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:30.120
Now a similar process is unfolding when you
need to make sense of pine, crab and sauce.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.500
Those aren't three words that go together
very frequently, you've probably never used

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:38.290
them in a sentence before, yet this one brain
area, the anterior superior temporal gyrus,

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:42.700
seems to be particularly good at finding the
thin thread that binds them together.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.700
[Laughter]

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.830
&gt;&gt;male offstage: they're at the other office

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:48.690
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: Oh!

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:53.029
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: 21st century is amazing.

00:09:53.029 --> 00:09:55.920
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: So it's able to find the one

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.190
other word that binds them all together

00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:59.190
[Laughter]

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.660
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: Oh no, our friends, what happened?

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.200
Oh they're still happening.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.750
Oh, that's too bad.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.380
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: So it's able to find the one

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.060
other word that binds them all together.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:13.350
Now when you need a moment of insight, when
you're stuck and stumped, when you don't know

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:17.930
what to do next, when you've just reached
that block, chances are you also need to draw

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.880
together a set of distantly related ideas.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.740
If the connections were on the surface, if
they were literal, if they were obvious, you

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:25.740
would have found them already.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.430
The fact that you need an epiphany suggests
that they're hidden and you need to draw together

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:30.600
a set of remote associations.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:36.540
And that's what this one brain are, the anterior
superior temporal gyrus, seems to be so good

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.540
at.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.850
Just the first that Beeman and Kounios discovered,
second is found to be a bit more interesting.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:45.070
This they discovered when they hooked people
up to an EEG, it's like wearing a big bulky

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:49.610
shower cap that measures the waves of electricity
pouring out of your head.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:54.529
What they discovered is they could predict
up to 8 seconds in advance whether or not

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:56.399
someone was gonna have a moment of insight.

00:10:56.399 --> 00:10:58.310
Now, just think how spooky this is.

00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:59.850
They could look at your brain waves.

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:04.490
They could say, "Sorry, buddy, you could sit
here all day trying to solve these word problems

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:06.050
and you would get nowhere.

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.589
You're wasting your time, go home."

00:11:08.589 --> 00:11:12.440
Or they could say, "You know what, in about
7 and a half seconds you're gonna have an

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.080
epiphany so brace yourself."

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:19.110
The question, of course, of what this predictive
signal is, turns out to be something called

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:20.460
alpha waves.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:23.740
Like most things in the mind, alpha waves
are pretty mysterious but they are closely

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.390
associated with states of relaxation.

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:29.839
So, things that lead to the production of
lots of alpha waves are things like taking

00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:36.520
a walk on the beach, having a beer on the
couch, taking a long hot shower, playing foosball,

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:40.830
whatever it is that gets you to stop thinking
about those problems at work that you just

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:45.800
can't solve, that puts your mind at ease,
that allows you to daydream without constantly

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:50.700
being interrupted, that's probably a place
that's gonna generate lots of alpha waves.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:54.290
Now, the reason these states of relaxation
are so important, Beeman and Kounios argue,

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:58.870
is when we're not relaxed, when we're focused,
when we're juiced on caffeine, when we're

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:03.180
chained to our desk, staring at our computer
screen, working late at the office, that's

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:04.180
where our attention is.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:08.070
It's out in the world, we are consumed by
the noise, we are thinking about pine, crab

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:09.070
and sauce.

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:13.490
Pine, crab and sauce and inspire a wrong answer,
a common wrong answer for pine, crab and sauce

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:16.480
is tree, that we just can't get past.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.970
And so we're frustrated, we're stuck, we're
making no progress.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:27.500
That's why [inaudible] were in the warm shower,
shampooing our hair, unable to check our email,

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:31.000
that at long last we're able to turn the spot
light of attention inwards and that's when

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.850
we're able to hear that quite voice coming
from the back of our head telling us, "the

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:37.640
answer is apple", "the answer is apple."

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:42.770
Maybe that voice has been there for hours
or days or weeks, we just haven't taken a

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:43.770
moment to listen.

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:48.970
Beeman and Kounios tell this wonderful story
about this trained Tibetan Buddhist monk who,

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:53.790
this guy meditates 12 hours a day, so he's
got exquisite control over the spotlight of

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:57.750
his attention, and at first, he thought the
way to solve these compound association problems

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:58.750
was to stay very focused.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:02.420
He'd think about pine, crab and sauce and
of course that's the wrong approach, so he

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.420
went 0 for 30.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:07.290
Normally he's prompted about a twenty percent
success rate, but he was going 0 for 30 cause

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:08.690
he was just really, really focused.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:12.440
And then at a certain point he realized, "You
know, I'm using the wrong strategy, maybe

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.620
I should switch it up."

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.690
And because he's a trained mediator he's able
to-

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.550
[Snapping]
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: increase his alpha waves like

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:18.732
that, on a dime.

00:13:18.732 --> 00:13:24.010
And they watch this abrupt spike in his brain
waves and then he became an insight machine.

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:28.740
He solved 25 in a row, a streak they had never
seen before or since.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.850
That's because he was focused on not being
focused.

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:34.480
Now there is something counterintuitive about
this work, right?

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:40.621
I think we all assume on giving a hard problem
that what we should do is work harder, pay

00:13:40.621 --> 00:13:45.471
more attention to it, chug that Red Bull,
snort that Ritalin, do whatever it is that

00:13:45.471 --> 00:13:46.471
we need to do
[Laughter]

00:13:46.471 --> 00:13:48.920
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: to maintain our attention.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.030
But this research suggests that's the exact
wrong thing to do.

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:56.180
That we will be focused but we will be focused
on the wrong answer.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:00.950
The next time you need a moment of insight
you should take a break, take a warm shower,

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:06.380
play an extended game of foosball or ping
pong, find a way to get relaxed, the answer

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.440
will only arrive after you stop looking for
it.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:15.850
There's a wonderful line of Einstein's that,
"creativity is the residue of wasted time,"

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:20.250
The next time you need a moment of insight
you have to make time to waste time.

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:26.120
Now it would be wonderful if I could stand
up here and tell you that the way to solve

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:31.110
every creative problem is to, you know, take
a nap, get drunk.

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:32.580
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: Just last month a study came

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:38.670
out showing that when you get undergraduates
legally drunk, so too drunk to drive a car,

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:43.070
it's a study out of the University of, University
of Illinois at Chicago, they solved 30 percent

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:46.850
more difficult creative problems, that require
moments of insight, than their sober classmates.

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:49.730
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: So being drunk does make us

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:52.500
more likely to have a moment of insight and
it'd be wonderful if we could always walk

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.560
around in a stupor.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.190
But, of course, we know that's not the case.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:01.290
In the real world sometimes you have to put
in the work, sometimes you have to invest

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:06.050
the attention that, yes, creativity involves
inspiration, but it also involves a hell of

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:07.440
a lot of perspiration.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.240
And sure enough when you talk to creative
people they often begin by telling you this

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:15.620
romantic story about that epiphany in the
shower but then if you keep on pressing them

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.680
they'll talk about all the hard work that
came after.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.810
Even after they had their big idea, they still
had to edit it and refine it and make it,

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:24.370
you know, good enough for the real world.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:29.970
As Nietzsche once observed, "Creators have
a vested interest in our believing in the

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:35.100
flash of revelation, the so called inspiration
shining down from the heavens as a ray of

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.870
grace, but this is often a lie.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:42.690
In reality, all great artists and thinkers
are great workers."

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:46.860
To illustrate his point Nietzsche described
Beethoven's musical notebooks which documented

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:50.240
the composer's pain staking process of refining
his melodies.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:55.640
It wasn't uncommon for Beethoven to experiment
with 70 different versions of a single musical

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.760
phrase before settling on the final one.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:03.540
The lesson here is that even Beethoven, the
cliché of artistic genius, still needed to

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:09.980
constantly refine his ideas, struggling with
his music until the beauty shown through.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:15.101
Let's not sugarcoat this rejecting process,
you know, the work process of Beethoven, it's

00:16:15.101 --> 00:16:16.400
not fun.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:21.820
It's the red pen on the page in a discarded
sketch, the trash prototype and the failed

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.050
first draft.

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:27.650
Nevertheless, such a merciless process is
sometimes the only way forward.

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:33.390
We keep on thinking and paying attention because
our next thought might be the answer.

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:35.680
So what defines this kind of creativity?

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:40.940
What allows some people to go through 70 different
iterations of a single musical phrase?

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.399
At first glance, it's not quite clear.

00:16:42.399 --> 00:16:48.250
I mean, you can look at these epic successful
creators, people like Beethoven, like Bob

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:54.210
Dylan, like Pablo Picasso, like Steve Jobs
and ask, "Well, what makes them different

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:56.209
from you and me?

00:16:56.209 --> 00:16:57.470
What makes them so successful?"

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:02.150
And you give them a battery of intelligence
tests and IQ tests and so on, and they'll

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:03.240
all look pretty normal.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.100
They're not smarter than normal, they're often
not smarter than the rest of us.

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:10.890
You give them a battery of old fashioned personality
test, Myers Briggs and all the rest, and once

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:12.749
again, they'll look pretty standard.

00:17:12.749 --> 00:17:17.789
Maybe a little more open to experiences and
a touch more extroverted but nothing too out

00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:19.429
of the standard range.

00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:23.110
But in recent years, it's become clear that
these people are different from you and me.

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:26.789
And there's one character, a new character
trait that sets them apart.

00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:29.970
It's the character trait called grit.

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:35.139
G-R-I-T, it's about stubbornness, it's about
persistence, it's about single mindedness.

00:17:35.139 --> 00:17:37.039
And I'm thinking here of someone like J.K.

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:43.090
Rowling who suffered through 12 rejections
from publishers but kept on writing about

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:46.480
this boy wizard in coffee shops while her
baby daughter napped.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.600
It's that kind of stubborn refusal to give
up.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:55.210
This single minded focus on seeing it through,
that is grit.

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:58.220
The best way to explain the importance of
grit is to tell you about how it came about,

00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.220
how it was first studied.

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:06.109
It's a story that takes place in 2005 at West
Point Military Academy and for decades West

00:18:06.109 --> 00:18:07.519
Point had this problem.

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:09.090
The first 6 weeks at West Point are known
as Beast Barracks.

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:12.799
It's a very tough time, you get yelled at,
you get your head shaved, you get woken up

00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:15.279
at 5:30 in the morning, you go on long runs.

00:18:15.279 --> 00:18:18.830
And West Point had lost between 5 and 10 percent
of its first year cadets

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:19.869
[Snapping]
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: right off the bat.

00:18:19.869 --> 00:18:21.059
In the first 6 weeks.

00:18:21.059 --> 00:18:24.590
This is a huge problem, right, because there
are no transfer students at West Point.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:28.210
So these are future leaders of army who are
just disappearing.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:30.100
They didn't wanna lose them.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:34.529
So West Point had searched for decades for
some metrics, some measurements that would

00:18:34.529 --> 00:18:38.860
allow them to predict retention, to figure
out who was most likely to drop out.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:43.220
They looked at SAT scores, they looked at
grades, they looked mental and physical fitness,

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:47.019
everything they could think of, nothing predicted
retention.

00:18:47.019 --> 00:18:52.499
So in 2005, in desperation, they go to Angela,
say, "Can you help us?" she comes up with

00:18:52.499 --> 00:18:55.519
a short survey called the Grit O Survey.

00:18:55.519 --> 00:18:59.360
You can take it on her website, just Google
Angela and Grit O Survey.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:02.409
She asked questions in two different domains.

00:19:02.409 --> 00:19:05.769
The first domain is how single minded are
you?

00:19:05.769 --> 00:19:07.039
Have you always wanted to go to West Point?

00:19:07.039 --> 00:19:08.379
Have you always wanted to work at Google?

00:19:08.379 --> 00:19:09.570
To be a computer scientist?

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:10.710
To be a poet?

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:11.710
To be a painter?

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:12.710
To be an entrepreneur?

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:15.529
Whatever it is, is this the goal you've had
for a long time?

00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:21.139
Number two, how do you react to the inevitable
frustrations and failures along the way?

00:19:21.139 --> 00:19:22.960
Are they the sign that you should give up?

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.500
That this is the world telling you you're
not cut out for this goal?

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.489
Or are they a sign that you should try even
harder, that you should double down and just

00:19:29.489 --> 00:19:30.489
give it your all?

00:19:30.489 --> 00:19:32.270
So those are the kinds of questions she asked.

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:36.789
And what she discovered in 2005 is that her
short Grit O Survey, given to every cadet

00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:40.850
at West Point on the second day at West Point,
was the first survey that allowed them to

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:41.850
predict retention.

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:45.869
They've used it every year since and it works
every single year.

00:19:45.869 --> 00:19:51.499
Now, since 2005, Duckworth has gone to show
that in field after field, Grit is the single

00:19:51.499 --> 00:19:52.980
best predictor of success.

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:56.480
So if you're trying to figure out which 12
year old is mostly likely to win the national

00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:01.700
spelling bee, turns out it's not the smartest
ones, not the ones with the best grades, it's

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.409
the ones with the highest levels of grit.

00:20:03.409 --> 00:20:04.409
Why?

00:20:04.409 --> 00:20:08.440
Because grit mediates deliberate practice,
grit allows you to practice the right way,

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.859
which is not the fun way.

00:20:09.859 --> 00:20:13.590
If you're trying to figure out who's most
likely to become a U.S. army ranger, it's

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:15.149
the ones with the highest levels of grit.

00:20:15.149 --> 00:20:19.159
Which amateur golfers are most likely to make
the PGA tour in 5 years?

00:20:19.159 --> 00:20:22.720
Not the ones with the best drives, the longest
drives, the best putts, it's the ones with

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.230
the highest levels of grit.

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:26.929
Which teachers are mostly likely to make it
through an intercity school for the first

00:20:26.929 --> 00:20:29.149
year, the ones with the highest levels of
grit?

00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:32.440
Which graduates of Wharton Business School
are gonna make the most money 3 years from

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.440
now.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.760
The ones with the highest levels of grit.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:40.330
That in field after field, grit explains,
above and beyond, what intelligence and IQ

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:41.460
scores explain.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:47.460
Now I would argue, and Duckworth would agree,
that grit is particularly important in creative

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:53.539
domains and that's because creativity by definition
in the 21st century is gonna be hard.

00:20:53.539 --> 00:20:57.380
If it were easy that product would already
exist, that patent would have been filed,

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:58.600
that poem would have been written.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:03.940
So it's always gonna involve lots of frustration,
lots of failure, lots of iteration, lots of

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:07.220
people telling you you're not cut out for
this, this will never work, here's all the

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:09.320
reasons why this is a bad idea.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:14.539
In order to make it real, in order to make
this idea become a tangible thing, you're

00:21:14.539 --> 00:21:20.779
gonna have to persist through all those naysayers,
all that negative feedback and that takes

00:21:20.779 --> 00:21:22.220
grit.

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:27.090
Woody Allen has this wonderful quote that,
"80 percent of success is just showing up"

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:33.159
well, grit is what allows you to show up again
and again.

00:21:33.159 --> 00:21:38.299
So far I've been attempting to describe these
two distinct forms of creativity which depend

00:21:38.299 --> 00:21:41.850
on very distinct patterns of activity in the
brain.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:45.789
The more practical lesson though, is that
different kinds of creative problems benefit

00:21:45.789 --> 00:21:48.009
from different kinds of creative thinking.

00:21:48.009 --> 00:21:52.110
The question, of course, is how do we adjust
our thought process to the task at hand?

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:53.999
When should we daydream and take warm showers?

00:21:53.999 --> 00:21:57.010
And when should we drink another cup of coffee?

00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:02.690
What requires relaxation and what requires
grit?

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:08.269
The good news, and this is very good news,
the human mind has a natural ability to diagnose

00:22:08.269 --> 00:22:12.759
our problems, to assess the kind of creativity
we need.

00:22:12.759 --> 00:22:16.960
These assessments have an eloquent name, they're
called, feelings of knowing.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.249
And they occur whenever we suspect that we
can find the answer if only we keep on thinking

00:22:20.249 --> 00:22:21.600
about the question.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.820
My favorite examples of feelings of knowing
is when a word is on the tip of your tongue.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:30.229
On the one hand, so annoying, drives me crazy
every single time, you know, you're walking

00:22:30.229 --> 00:22:34.799
down the street, you see someone, you know
you know their name but you just can't quite

00:22:34.799 --> 00:22:36.460
place it.

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:41.639
So frustrating, but it's also kind of profound
because how do you know you know their name

00:22:41.639 --> 00:22:43.289
if you don't actually know it?

00:22:43.289 --> 00:22:45.769
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: Why are you so convinced that

00:22:45.769 --> 00:22:49.460
memories in one of these overstuffed filing
cabinets if you can't find the file?

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:51.879
Well, that's a feeling of knowing.

00:22:51.879 --> 00:22:56.979
It's a hunch reminding you that if you just
keep on searching for that name, in 5 minutes

00:22:56.979 --> 00:23:00.679
or 10 minutes, you will find it, you will
locate the file.

00:23:00.679 --> 00:23:05.299
That feeling of knowing will become real will
become actual knowledge.

00:23:05.299 --> 00:23:09.470
Now, when it becomes to creative problem solving,
these feelings of knowing turn out to be an

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:14.639
essential guide because study after study
has found that when it comes to problems that

00:23:14.639 --> 00:23:18.940
don't require moments of insight, that people
can actually diagnose, about 85 percent of

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:23.039
the time, whether or not they can solve a
problem within a given time frame.

00:23:23.039 --> 00:23:27.299
So I can show you analytical creative problem
and say, "Can you solve this in an hour?

00:23:27.299 --> 00:23:28.470
Can you solve this in a day?

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:30.350
Can you solve this in a week?"

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:34.859
With 85 percent accuracy, and upwards of 85
percent accuracy in many domains, people can

00:23:34.859 --> 00:23:37.710
say, "Yep, I can do that, no problem."

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:39.559
Or, "No, I can't."

00:23:39.559 --> 00:23:42.919
Now what makes these feelings of knowing even
more useful is they come attached with a sense

00:23:42.919 --> 00:23:43.919
of progress.

00:23:43.919 --> 00:23:47.859
So as you're working towards that problem,
you're able to say whether or not you're getting

00:23:47.859 --> 00:23:51.690
closer to the answer even though you don't
know what the answer is, right?

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:52.879
Which is kind of wondrous.

00:23:52.879 --> 00:23:56.361
It's like being dropped in a strange city,
you have no idea where you're supposed to

00:23:56.361 --> 00:24:00.999
be going, yet you're able to say, "If I make
this left hand turn, I'm getting closer.

00:24:00.999 --> 00:24:03.049
If I go right, I'm going a little further
away."

00:24:03.049 --> 00:24:08.139
We're able to measure progress towards a destination
when we don't know what the destination is.

00:24:08.139 --> 00:24:13.099
Now, I think we can use these feelings of
knowing to help us diagnose our creative problems,

00:24:13.099 --> 00:24:17.770
then figure out, you know, should we drink
a beer or drink a triple espresso.

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:22.940
So, when we don't feel that we're getting
closer to the answer, we've hit the wall,

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:27.840
so to speak, there is no feeling of knowing,
no sense of progress, then we probably need

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.289
a moment of insight.

00:24:29.289 --> 00:24:32.389
Maybe we've had a sense of progress before,
maybe we've been working on this problem for

00:24:32.389 --> 00:24:35.519
a month and we've gotten closer but now we
are stuck and stumped.

00:24:35.519 --> 00:24:39.220
Now we are Bob Dylan in May 1965.

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:42.989
In these instances we should rely on the right
hemisphere which excels at revealing those

00:24:42.989 --> 00:24:45.190
remote associations.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:48.260
Focusing on the problem will be a waste of
mental resources.

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:51.859
We will stare at our computer screen and repeat
our failures.

00:24:51.859 --> 00:24:54.029
Instead, we should find a way to relax.

00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:57.960
The most productive thing we can do is forget
all about work.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:02.269
However, when those feelings of knowing are
telling us we're getting closer, then we need

00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:03.789
to keep on struggling.

00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:09.399
We should keep paying attention until it hurts,
to rely on those muscles of grit.

00:25:09.399 --> 00:25:15.330
Before long, that feeling of knowing will
lead us to the actual answer.

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:19.799
So far, I've been talking about individual
creativity, about how we invent when we're

00:25:19.799 --> 00:25:24.119
alone, but I'll spend our remaining time talking
about creative collaborations because this

00:25:24.119 --> 00:25:27.210
form of creativity is definitely becoming
more important.

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:30.229
The increasing necessity of creative collaborations
is probably best demonstrated by the work

00:25:30.229 --> 00:25:33.230
of Ben Jones, an economist in Northwestern.

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:37.450
He's data mined 20 million science papers,
published over the course of the 20th century.

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:42.519
When you go back to 1950 the most important
papers in a field, those papers with more

00:25:42.519 --> 00:25:47.809
than 100 citations, are almost always the
product of a scientist working by themselves.

00:25:47.809 --> 00:25:54.539
Some lone genius who managed to shift the
paradigm all alone, you know, Einstein, Darwin,

00:25:54.539 --> 00:25:55.539
someone like that.

00:25:55.539 --> 00:25:59.669
You fast forward, though, to the 21st century
and now science looks very different.

00:25:59.669 --> 00:26:03.970
Now the most important papers in a field are
almost always the product of a team, of people

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:06.279
from different disciplines coming together.

00:26:06.279 --> 00:26:11.509
Furthermore, the size of these teams is increasing
by about 20 percent per decade.

00:26:11.509 --> 00:26:15.669
Jonah's explanation for this is quite simple,
our problems are getting harder, all the low

00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:18.879
hanging fruit is gone, in fact, many of the
problems that remain exceed the capabilities

00:26:18.879 --> 00:26:21.049
of the individual imagination.

00:26:21.049 --> 00:26:24.779
So we either learn how to work together or
fail alone.

00:26:24.779 --> 00:26:27.629
This raises the obvious question, how should
we work together?

00:26:27.629 --> 00:26:29.390
What's the ideal template for group collaboration?

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:34.940
There's a lot to say on the subject such as
don't brainstorm, brainstorming just doesn't

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:40.570
work and it's important to seek out the input
of outsiders who often see more because they

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:42.259
know less.

00:26:42.259 --> 00:26:47.039
But today I'd like to focus on a single theme
in successful group collaborations which is

00:26:47.039 --> 00:26:52.679
the important of spaces that bring a diverse
mixture of people together in person.

00:26:52.679 --> 00:26:55.330
In person being the crucial addendum.

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:59.289
One of my favorite examples of this is the
Pixar Studios which were largely designed

00:26:59.289 --> 00:27:00.289
by Steve Jobs.

00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:02.879
People at Pixar refer to them as Steve's movies.

00:27:02.879 --> 00:27:05.940
The original plan for the studios called for
3 separate buildings, one building for the

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:10.159
animators, one building for the computer scientists,
one building for everyone else, the writers,

00:27:10.159 --> 00:27:11.700
directors, producers, and so on.

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:16.149
Jobs, according to the legend, took one look
at these plans and said, "That is idiotic"

00:27:16.149 --> 00:27:17.599
and tore them up in front of the architect.

00:27:17.599 --> 00:27:22.440
He realized that the success of Pixar would
depend on all these different cultures finding

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.440
a way to collaborate.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:26.720
So the animators would learn from the computer
scientists and so on.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.979
So he said everyone should share the exact
same space.

00:27:28.979 --> 00:27:33.320
They actually had to renovate the old Del
Monte canning factory outside of Oakland.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:37.119
But Jobs realized, you know what, it's not
enough to just put people in the same building,

00:27:37.119 --> 00:27:39.389
we need to force them to mix and mingle.

00:27:39.389 --> 00:27:43.042
So he carved out this big atrium and he put
everything important in the atrium, he put

00:27:43.042 --> 00:27:46.909
the mailboxes there and the gift store there
and the cafeteria there and the coffee shop

00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:47.909
there.

00:27:47.909 --> 00:27:50.029
And he realized, you know what, even that's
not enough cause you can build people a gleaming

00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:53.750
cafeteria and serve delicious food but the
animators would still have lunch with the

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:57.049
animators, computer scientists would still
have snacks with computer scientists and so

00:27:57.049 --> 00:27:58.049
on.

00:27:58.049 --> 00:28:01.919
So then in one of his moments of insight,
he decided that there would only be two bathrooms

00:28:01.919 --> 00:28:03.850
in the entire Pixar Studios
[Laughter]

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:05.700
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: And he put those in the atrium.

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:10.049
So there's one place we all have to go every
single day, it's the bathroom.

00:28:10.049 --> 00:28:13.850
And at first the people at Pixar thought this
was the worst idea ever, right, it's a huge

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:18.120
factory, it's a quarter mile long nearly,
so if you're at the wrong end of the building,

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.539
it can be a long walk to the bathroom.

00:28:21.539 --> 00:28:25.009
But now when you spend time at Pixar you hear
again and again these stories of these bathroom

00:28:25.009 --> 00:28:26.009
epiphanies.

00:28:26.009 --> 00:28:30.909
The great conversation they had while washing
their hands or that serendipitous chat they

00:28:30.909 --> 00:28:33.710
had in the hallway on the way to the bathroom.

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:39.399
That, as Jobs once put it, "Creativity is
just connecting things and most of those connections

00:28:39.399 --> 00:28:40.710
come from other people."

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:44.059
Now, there's some neat empirical proof to
this concept.

00:28:44.059 --> 00:28:46.059
This comes from the work of Isaac Kohane at
Harvard.

00:28:46.059 --> 00:28:48.059
[Coughing]
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: He analyzed 20 thousand papers

00:28:48.059 --> 00:28:49.570
produced by Harvard researchers.

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:54.049
This took him several years and a small army
of undergrads because he had to map out the

00:28:54.049 --> 00:28:58.769
physical location of every single Harvard
coauthor down to the nearest meter.

00:28:58.769 --> 00:29:04.149
But what he discovered is that physical location,
what he calls collocation, that it matters,

00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:05.639
it matters a lot.

00:29:05.639 --> 00:29:09.450
That papers produced when scientists were
within 10 meters of each other, which meant

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:12.940
they shared the same water cooler, the same
coffee room and the same bathroom, that those

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:17.190
papers were 3 times more likely to be highly
cited than papers produced when scientists

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:19.129
were a kilometer or more apart.

00:29:19.129 --> 00:29:24.259
The lesson here is that even in this age of
wonderful technologies, our most important

00:29:24.259 --> 00:29:27.049
ideas often don't arrive on a screen.

00:29:27.049 --> 00:29:32.700
Rather they emerge from idle conversation,
from too many people sharing the same space.

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:35.679
Now, personally, I find this surprising.

00:29:35.679 --> 00:29:41.090
I mean, you go back ten years and you hear
people making very convincing arguments, futurists

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:45.049
making these convincing arguments, that it's
the death of geography.

00:29:45.049 --> 00:29:48.799
We live in an age where geography and physical
space are gonna become obsolete.

00:29:48.799 --> 00:29:50.519
Why should we all move to London?

00:29:50.519 --> 00:29:55.969
Why should we cram ourselves into these expensive,
overcrowded, smelly, crime ridden places full

00:29:55.969 --> 00:29:58.599
of traffic and too many strangers?

00:29:58.599 --> 00:30:00.549
What's the possible value of that?

00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:04.419
Why should we even come to an office, why
not just sit at home in our pajamas in the

00:30:04.419 --> 00:30:06.109
suburbs and telecommute?

00:30:06.109 --> 00:30:07.109
It's so much easier.

00:30:07.109 --> 00:30:08.629
It's so much more efficient.

00:30:08.629 --> 00:30:11.100
Needless to say, that hasn't happened.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:12.929
If anything, the opposite has happened.

00:30:12.929 --> 00:30:16.119
Cities are more valuable than ever before,
more and more people are moving to cities.

00:30:16.119 --> 00:30:19.309
Urbanization is the great theme of the 21st
century.

00:30:19.309 --> 00:30:22.639
That in the next 100 years more people will
move to cities than have moved to cities in

00:30:22.639 --> 00:30:24.039
all of human history.

00:30:24.039 --> 00:30:26.899
So this is a huge and growing trend.

00:30:26.899 --> 00:30:32.059
One of my favorite factoids is that since
the invention of Skype, attendance at business

00:30:32.059 --> 00:30:34.460
conferences has nearly doubled.

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:36.719
That even though we live in this age that,
in theory, we could sit at home and get the

00:30:36.719 --> 00:30:41.649
same content just on a screen, we know that
it's important to come together in person,

00:30:41.649 --> 00:30:45.369
to rub up against strangers, to have those
random chats.

00:30:45.369 --> 00:30:50.320
And I don't mean this is any way to dismiss
the importance of these new tools, you know,

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.190
to dismiss the importance of all these wonderful
gadgets.

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:58.009
To be able to search for anything on Google
on this phone in my pocket, that is an amazing

00:30:58.009 --> 00:30:59.009
thing.

00:30:59.009 --> 00:31:03.309
But these tools, they tend to make our lives
more efficient, they make it so much easier

00:31:03.309 --> 00:31:04.609
to find stuff.

00:31:04.609 --> 00:31:07.099
But creativity, when you look at it, it's
not really about efficiency.

00:31:07.099 --> 00:31:08.099
It's about serendipity.

00:31:08.099 --> 00:31:11.729
It's about encountering that information you
didn't even know to look for, about bumping

00:31:11.729 --> 00:31:17.929
into that person you didn't even know to meet,
that, even in the 21st century, it is still

00:31:17.929 --> 00:31:22.399
the human friction that makes the sparks.

00:31:22.399 --> 00:31:27.999
The last idea I'd like to end with is a provocative
one and I think it's especially provocative

00:31:27.999 --> 00:31:31.649
for a company like Google with such an incredibly
rich history of innovation.

00:31:31.649 --> 00:31:37.100
And it speaks, I think, to the difficulty
of maintaining this pace of creativity.

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:43.729
In fact, it suggests that many of the things
typical companies do with the best of intentions

00:31:43.729 --> 00:31:47.710
to make their workers more creative, actually
get in the way.

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:51.639
This is best demonstrated by the work of Geoffrey
West, he's a theoretical physicist at the

00:31:51.639 --> 00:31:53.389
Santa Fe Institute.

00:31:53.389 --> 00:31:56.799
He studies cities and gathers vast tracks
of data from governments from all across the

00:31:56.799 --> 00:32:01.690
world trying to understand what makes cities
tick and why some cities tick better than

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:02.690
others.

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:05.769
He's done all sorts of peculiar correlations.

00:32:05.769 --> 00:32:11.669
One of my favorites is that when you're trying
to find the most predictive variable of patents

00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:16.059
per capita in a given metropolis, it turns
out to be the walking speed of pedestrians.

00:32:16.059 --> 00:32:21.159
First of all, who knew the census bureau in
the states collected data on the walking speed

00:32:21.159 --> 00:32:22.159
of pedestrians.

00:32:22.159 --> 00:32:25.890
But, that's bizarre enough, but nobody knows
what to make of this correlation.

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:30.059
It could be a random accident, it could be
just a statistical fluke, but West argues

00:32:30.059 --> 00:32:31.110
that it begins to make sense.

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:36.830
The function of a city is to foster those
bumps, to get people to just have those random

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:41.970
interactions while waiting in line for a latte,
on the sidewalk, so in a sense people are

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:42.970
particles.

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:44.309
You can model urban dwellers as particles.

00:32:44.309 --> 00:32:48.519
And if you increase the velocity of those
particle, you make those pedestrians walk

00:32:48.519 --> 00:32:52.559
just a bit faster, you get more bumps and
eventually those bumps add up and you get

00:32:52.559 --> 00:32:53.690
a new patent.

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:58.299
But, West makes this very interesting comparison
between cities and companies.

00:32:58.299 --> 00:33:02.710
He points out that from a certain perspective,
cities and companies look quite similar, right?

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:08.639
They're both big clusters of people in a fixed
physical space, lots of infrastructure, yet

00:33:08.639 --> 00:33:11.989
cities and companies exhibit one very interesting
difference.

00:33:11.989 --> 00:33:18.159
That cities, this form of social organization
we call cities, they never die.

00:33:18.159 --> 00:33:19.779
They are immortal.

00:33:19.779 --> 00:33:21.071
You can nuke a city, comes back.

00:33:21.071 --> 00:33:23.250
You can flood a city, bounces back.

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:28.620
You can have a devastating earthquake, burn
the city to the ground and we still have San

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:29.629
Francisco.

00:33:29.629 --> 00:33:32.429
Companies, on the other hand, die all the
time.

00:33:32.429 --> 00:33:34.419
They are incredibly fragile.

00:33:34.419 --> 00:33:40.080
Fortune 100 firms, these huge multinational
firms, their average lifespan is 45 years.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.299
Only two companies in the original Dow Jones
index are still around.

00:33:43.299 --> 00:33:48.039
More than 25 percent of Fortune 500 firms
die every decade.

00:33:48.039 --> 00:33:53.779
So West wanted to understand, what's the difference,
why are cities immortal, resilient and perdurable?

00:33:53.779 --> 00:33:56.339
Why are companies so fragile and fleeting?

00:33:56.339 --> 00:34:01.309
Well, by analyzing lots and lots of data he
found an interesting difference and the difference

00:34:01.309 --> 00:34:02.940
is this.

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:07.950
As cities get bigger everyone in that city
becomes more productive, by every metric we

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:11.901
have, they're gonna look better, they're gonna
make more money, invent more patents, invent

00:34:11.901 --> 00:34:13.090
more trademarks and so on.

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:15.520
This is the trend, in fact, that's making
our cities bigger.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:19.380
This is what's driving urbanization; it's
called superlinear scaling.

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:23.850
So urban productivity looks like this, like
a roller coaster taking off into the sky.

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:29.310
This is why West calls cities the most important
invention in the history of human civilization,

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:31.550
the idea that's unleashed so many of our ideas.

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:34.940
You get this social multiplier effect in the
cities.

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:37.929
Companies, on the other hand, look very different.

00:34:37.929 --> 00:34:42.270
As a company gets bigger, everyone in that
company becomes less productive.

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:46.840
They bring in less profit per employee, fewer
patents per employee, fewer trademarks and

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:47.840
so on.

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.080
This is called sublinear scaling.

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:53.920
So companies look like this and over time
this becomes a dangerous trend, right, because

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:58.290
Wall Street there's all this pressure to keep
on getting bigger to grow the bottom lines.

00:34:58.290 --> 00:34:59.290
That's what companies do.

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:03.650
But that means you've got expanded bureaucracy,
expanded fixed cost, but you're no longer

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:05.250
innovating at the same rate.

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:08.860
So you become more reliant on your old ideas
for your new ideas, you have an expense of

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:10.500
expensive acquisitions.

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:14.570
But eventually, those old ideas are no longer
useful, those acquisitions don't pan out and

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:16.910
that's when you go belly up.

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:21.060
Now what causes the difference, why are cities
superlinear and companies are sublinear?

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:23.900
West argues it's because companies get in
the way.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:27.680
When you think about a city, the magic of
a city is no one's in charge.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:31.520
It's a freewheeling chaotic place and a mayor's
a pretty powerless figure.

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:34.680
He can't tell you where to live or who to
talk to or what to work on.

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:39.140
It's just a bunch of particles, a bunch of
strangers going about their business, bumping

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:40.140
into each other.

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:45.310
That because cities don't try to maximize
creativity, that's exactly what they end up

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:46.310
doing.

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:48.360
Companies, on the other hand, try to micromanage
the process.

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:52.140
So, they tell us who to talk to, they tell
us what to work on, you know, brainstorm,

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:56.200
they tell us don't drink a beer in the afternoon,
focus, focus, focus.

00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:01.310
They stifle horizontal interactions becoming
these very vertical places; they silo knowledge

00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:02.460
and so on.

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:07.200
And in all these things, many of which are
done with the best of intentions, they actually

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.360
get in the way, they hold us back.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:17.130
So West's advice is simple, when in doubt
imitate the city.

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:22.700
In closing, the imagination has always seemed
like a magic trick of matter which is probably

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:25.840
why we've always blamed our best ideas on
the muses.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:30.030
The good news, that by finally understanding
where our new ideas come from, we can hopefully

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:31.930
have a few more of them.

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:35.960
The science of creativity can make us just
a little bit more creative.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:38.000
But we must also be honest.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.090
The creative process will never be easy no
matter how much we know about neurons or cities.

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:47.111
The science of the imagination doesn't fit
neatly on a Power Point slide and it can't

00:36:47.111 --> 00:36:49.210
be summarized in a subtitle.

00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:53.560
If creativity were that easy, Picasso wouldn't
be so famous and it wouldn't require so much

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:54.560
grit.

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:59.970
It's about all of the clever studies and rigorous
experiments our most essential talent remains

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:01.300
our most mysterious.

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:06.720
The mystery is this; although the imagination
is inspired by the everyday world, by its

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:11.760
flaws and its beauties, we are able to see
beyond our sources to imagine things that

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.970
only exist in the mind.

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:17.920
There was nothing, now there is something,
it's almost like magic.

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:21.910
Thank you all so much for having me at Google
and thank you so much for listening today.

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:26.360
I think we've got some time for Q and A, so
that's my favorite part, so please have at

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.590
it.

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:30.820
[Applause]

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:41.501
&gt;&gt;male #1: Thank you so much for that, so
it's hard to choose whether I should ask a

00:37:41.501 --> 00:37:46.000
question on the individual side or the organizational
side; I'll go with the individual side.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:52.190
Which is, when you think about alpha waves
and more about the pervasiveness of technology,

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:57.660
do you think those moments where we can actually
detach have now gone away because we always

00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:01.590
have a phone in our pocket, a tablet and access
to these things?

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:04.160
Or is our only sanctum the shower now?

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:08.810
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: I mean, it's a really interesting
question and I always try to resist the urge

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:11.170
to speculate on the forwarding effects of
technology.

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:14.760
I think it's so easy to be scared by it or
think it's gonna change everything.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.580
You know, Google's either making us stupid
or it's the salvation.

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:22.890
And I think it's complicated, I mean, like
I said, these tools are amazing.

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:26.160
They're allowing us to connect and expose
ourselves to information we never could have

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.500
had before.

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:28.900
I think they fuel our curiosity.

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:34.600
But, in my own life, what I can say is that
I have noticed that now when I'm bored, the

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:38.500
first thing I do, no matter where I am, is
I get out my phone and I check my email, I

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:43.560
check Twitter, I check, you know, I go to
Google News, whatever it is.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:46.340
So I'm always interrupting my daydreams.

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:51.720
And that worries me simply because we've learned
in the last few years that day dreaming, this

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:55.800
mental state we've always told our kids not
to practice, we've assumed it's like this

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.960
form of thinking when we don't want to think
at all.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:01.590
It turns out to be incredibly useful, that
your brain consumes more energy while day

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:03.920
dreaming than it does when you're focused.

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:07.920
And that's because huge swaths of cortex are
communicating and interacting, you're mashing

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:13.220
up new associations, you're exploring counter-factuals
and that's why people who daydream more score

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:15.440
much higher on tests of creativity.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.820
So we now believe daydreaming is quite important.

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:21.990
And being bored is a precursor to daydreaming,
right, you daydream, you fall down that rabbit

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:24.970
hole in your own mind after you're a little
bit bored and so you entertain yourself.

00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:30.900
So I do worry, that in my own life, these,
you know, having these computers in our pockets

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:34.100
does sometimes interfere with our ability
to go on these extended daydreams, that we're

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:35.370
always interrupting them.

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:40.110
So, you know, one way I've tried to compensate
for this is, you know, when I'm really stuck

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:43.960
and stumped at work, I'll go for a walk and
just leave my phone behind.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:45.440
It makes me anxious for an hour
[Laughter]

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.070
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: You know, to not be checking
email.

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:49.401
But that's kind of how I've solved it.

00:39:49.401 --> 00:39:53.580
And I think it's, when you talk about technology
it's finding those kinds of tweaks.

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:58.640
In general these tools are so wonderful and
I love them so much but just finding ways

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:03.170
to kind of give ourselves a break from that
every once in a while.

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:11.850
&gt;&gt;male #2: Hello, you mentioned that you shouldn't
brainstorm.

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:16.360
I was kind of interested in that cause we
do an awful lot of that here.

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.170
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: Yeah, this is classic brainstorming
I'm talking about.

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:24.349
Classic brainstorming was invented by a guy
named Alex Osborn in the late 1940s.

00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:30.480
He's the O in BBDO; he's kind of the Don Draper,
the star of Mad Men, of his day, very swank,

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:31.480
dapper fellow.

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:35.230
In the series of best selling business books
he outlines this technique he called, he called

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:36.230
brainstorming.

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:39.370
There's really just one important rule to
brainstorming as he described it, which is

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:40.990
no criticism is allowed.

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:44.170
That all ideas are good ideas, right?

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:48.900
The logic here is quite straight forward that
the imagination is meek and shy and fragile

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:52.880
and if it's worried about being criticized
it'll just clam up and not be able to say

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.090
anything interesting at all.

00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:56.800
And this is a feel good productivity technique,
right?

00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:01.940
We can all go into a room and free associate,
we fill the white board with our ideas, we

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:06.060
all contributed to the group, we all felt
productive, no one had their feelings hurt,

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:09.810
so there's a reason why people have done brainstorming
for so long.

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:13.170
The only problem with brainstorming is that
it just doesn't work.

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:18.440
That study after study over the last 60 years
has shown that people who brainstorm in a

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:22.400
group come up with fewer ideas, and less original
ideas, than those same people who work on

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.360
the problems by themselves.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:28.440
That we become less than some of our parts
when we brainstorm and the reason brainstorming

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.870
doesn't work returns us to the very first
rule which is 'thou shall not criticize'.

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:34.710
Cause it turns out that criticism is really
important.

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:40.000
The work of Charlan Nemeth at UC Berkeley,
she's shown dozens of studies that groups

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.590
that engage in debate and dissent, where they're
encouraged to constructively criticize the

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:49.640
ideas of other people, they come up with anywhere
between 25 to 40 percent more ideas and those

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:50.740
ideas are seen as more original.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:54.760
One of my favorite data points of hers is
that you ask people, you know, you have three

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:59.450
different conditions, one condition is brainstorming,
one condition is do whatever the hell you

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:01.770
want and third condition is debate and dissent.

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:06.360
So you ask people to work on hard problems
like reduce traffic in the San Francisco Bay

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.360
area.

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:11.910
Then you let them work on the problem and
then you say, "Okay we're gonna bring you

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:13.970
back in an hour or a day or a week."

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:18.130
Give them some time and when you bring them
back you ask them, "Okay, since the study

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:21.810
was over, have you had any more new ideas
since?"

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:25.600
And it turns out that those who engaged in
debate and dissent come up with, on average,

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.790
7 times more new ideas after the study is
over.

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:33.800
They can't stop thinking about it cause they're
more engaged, invigorated, they're more surprised.

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:38.791
That when we stick to our natural free associations,
when there is no debate and dissent, we kind

00:42:38.791 --> 00:42:42.970
of float on the superficial surface and it
turns out our free associations are pretty

00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:43.970
superficial.

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:47.550
You know, over the last decade, psychologists
have amasses these word association charts

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:51.090
and so I'm able to predict, with pretty good
accuracy, that if I ask you to free associate

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:58.230
on blue, your first answer will be green,
followed by ocean, sky, jeans, Smurfs, maybe

00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:59.500
Miles Davis and so on.

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:04.530
But nothing too interesting, I mean, I can
predict the vast majority of your free associations.

00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:07.880
That's because we're bound by language and
language is full of clichés.

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:11.580
The way we get passed that superficial surface
is with criticism.

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:15.840
That means we're fully engaged, we're digging
down deeper, we've got some skin in the game,

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:19.720
so even after the meeting is over we keep
on thinking about it.

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:24.730
So, we know brainstorming doesn't work, we've
got some hints as to improve it, to encourage

00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:28.960
debate and descent but, of course, research
comes with a huge caveat which is that all

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:32.600
these studies are done with undergrads on
a one off basis.

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:36.500
You give them an experiment, they come together
and they go away and they never see each other

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:37.500
again.

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:41.150
In a work place you're dealing with colleagues
who come together every single day.

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:45.110
And it's unclear how to actually implement
debate and dissent.

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:49.522
You see at Pixar where they're already struggling
with it, every day there begins with what

00:43:49.522 --> 00:43:50.550
they call the shredding meeting.

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:53.980
Which is where they review the few seconds
of footage from the day before and they tear

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:55.281
it apart, they dissect it.

00:43:55.281 --> 00:44:01.660
It sometimes, as Jobs put it, involves brutal
honesty but I'm not sure that would work for

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:02.660
every place.

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:07.870
So I think it's still unclear how to actually
translate debate and dissent to a collegial

00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:08.910
work environment.

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:13.280
To make sure it's constructive, to make sure
it's, you know, remains positive and it remains

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.280
productive.

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:17.180
Cause the last thing you want, obviously,
is for people just going at it and getting

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:19.330
personal and getting nasty.

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:24.450
But what we can say now, I think with some
fairly good certainty, is that brainstorming

00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:25.450
just doesn't work.

00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:29.770
That it's time to find ways to experiment
with debate and dissent.

00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:36.070
&gt;&gt;female #1: Along the lines of inspiration,
could you tell the story of your favorite,

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:41.230
how you came up with the idea of one of your
three books?

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:47.500
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: Um, that's interesting, it
sounds so grandiose to talk about my own ideas

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:51.760
in terms of epiphanies especially after having
just described "Like a Rolling Stone" that's

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.560
quite intimidating.

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:59.190
My first book really emerged from, I was working
in a neuroscience lab at the time and we were

00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:01.000
studying memory, the chemistry of memory.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.631
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: And basically what that meant
was you poke a sea slug over and over and

00:45:06.631 --> 00:45:09.180
over again until it gets bored by your touch.

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:11.400
So it adapts, habituates, to the touch.

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.870
And that's a form of memory and you can pull
out its neurons and figure out what, you know,

00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:18.410
the chemistry with a long term potentiation
is.

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:22.000
Not most people think of it as a memory but
it was that kind of work.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.600
I mean very reductionist neuroscience.

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:29.600
At the time, by sure accidents, I was taking
a course in French modernism.

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:36.570
So, we were assigned Proust and I was reading
Swann's Way and his first volume of the epic

00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:39.070
and that's really a novel all about memory.

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:42.290
It's all about long term storage of memories.

00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:49.320
I mean, it's this novelist who famously dips
his Madeleine, this buttery sea shell shaped

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:53.330
cookie, into a lime floured tea and all of
a sudden he remembers all these memories from

00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:54.920
his childhood that he'd thought he forgot.

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:59.550
And they all come flooding back to him triggered
by this scent of this childhood cookie.

00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:06.450
And so that got me thinking about here's this
novelist describing this very rich, very detailed

00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:12.540
memory and, in particular, how these memories
are triggered by the smell and taste of things.

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:16.960
And at the time Proust had no idea how the
brain actually worked.

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:21.120
There wasn't a whole lot of neuroanatomy and
yet, in the last decade, neuroscientists have

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:25.660
come along and figured out that the reason
why, it's not called the Proust effect, why

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:28.420
our smells and tastes are more sentimental.

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:31.980
And that's because the olfactory cortex, the
part of the brain that processes smells and

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:35.920
tastes, is the only sensory area directly
connected to the hippocampus, the center of

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:36.920
long term memory.

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:41.821
This is really an accident of evolution, it's
just cause for most primitive species, smell

00:46:41.821 --> 00:46:43.820
and taste are really, really important.

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:46.770
We're more visual but this wire had never
been cut.

00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:51.400
And, so, even though Proust didn't know about
neuroanatomy, somehow he was able to intuit

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:54.820
these wires and he was able to realize that,
yes, smell and taste are uniquely nostalgic.

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:59.210
And so I was reading that literally in the
lab.

00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:04.040
And probably just because of where I was,
I was thinking about this novel and these

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:07.820
silly scientific terms and that's where I
had the idea for my first book which is all

00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:14.160
about the intuitions of artists and how sometimes
they, they presage the discoveries in modern

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.840
neuroscience.

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.620
I wasn't in a shower or anything.

00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:20.730
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: I was actually quite bored.

00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:24.990
I was waiting for an experiment that I'd been
trying to run for a month and it never worked

00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:28.200
and it turns out if actually never worked.

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:30.720
And I kind of knew it would never actually
work so that's why I was passing the time

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:34.340
in the lab reading a novel, so maybe my alpha
waves were going.

00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:36.420
But I don't know.

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:42.000
Thanks for the question.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:47.380
&gt;&gt;male #2: Hello, I don't like the phrasing
of this question but I can't think of a better

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:48.380
one.

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:49.380
Can grit be learned?

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:50.380
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: Yeah, I don't know.

00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:51.380
&gt;&gt;male #2: Can we teach it to our kids?

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:54.580
Can we teach it to ourselves?

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:59.970
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: Yeah, um, nobody knows for
sure, no one's on the detail genetic work

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:05.260
to figure out the exact, you know, the exact
breakdown of heredity in terms of grit.

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:10.500
The presumption is that like just about every
other personality trait it's about 50/50.

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:13.100
50 percent nature, 50 percent nurture.

00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:14.550
And that's good news, right?

00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:17.480
Cause that means you can really shift the
curve.

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:22.040
The question, of course, is how then to shift
the curve, how actually teach grit.

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:27.780
Duckworth is just beginning a ten year longitudinal
study where she looks at students in the Philadelphia

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:32.280
District schools, public schools in the inner
city of Philadelphia and these are some sad

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:36.520
statistics, but 45 percent of these kids drop
out before graduation.

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:40.160
She's focusing on the 55 percent of kids who
stay in, who already show higher levels of

00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:41.730
grit than those who drop out.

00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:47.430
Of those 55 percent who stay in, 95 percent
that the longer they stay in school the worse

00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:52.470
their test scores get, the farther they fall
behind their peers in Pennsylvania.

00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:54.820
This is just, to me, depressed the hell out
of me, right?

00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:58.150
The longer they are in these schools, the
worse they get.

00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:02.400
5 percent of these kids, though, in these
same schools, in the same struggling community,

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:04.900
with little household support, they make themselves
better.

00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:06.740
They find a way to improve their test scores.

00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:09.990
So Duckworth is trying to figure out what
sets these kids apart.

00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:12.970
Sure enough they score off the charts in grit
but she wants to figure out how does that

00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:13.970
cash out?

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:14.970
What does that actually mean?

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:17.810
She's looking at their work habits, their
routines and so on.

00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:19.510
She's pulled out some interesting stuff.

00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:21.620
They tend to focus on exemplars when they're
frustrated.

00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:25.660
So they've got a model, maybe it's a sports
star, maybe it's Martin Luther King, someone

00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:30.680
like that who they know persevered through
difficulty and they think about them a lot,

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:32.510
especially when they're going through a tough
time.

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:37.260
So, one of the first pieces of advice is give
kids heroes, give them exemplars.

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:41.850
She also found some interesting stuff like
this one I didn't expect, these kids from

00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:46.260
a certain perspective are just more thoughtless
that when they're doing their algebra homework

00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:50.360
they're not thinking about the ball game on
TV, they're not taking the opportunity cost

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:53.100
of their activity, they just do the algebra
homework cause that's what they need to do.

00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:56.990
So they're not exploring counterfactuals,
what else they could be doing, they're just

00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.990
doing it.

00:49:57.990 --> 00:50:01.770
So they think less about alternatives which
is kind of interesting.

00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:04.690
They're more focused on tangible progress
than the long term goal.

00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:08.950
Cause that goal is so distant that if you're
just thinking about the long term goal you'll

00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:10.470
get demotivated very quickly.

00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:12.520
So it's very important to think about, "Well,
I got better today.

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:14.580
I'm doing a little bit better today than I
was yesterday."

00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:16.040
And so on.

00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:20.990
But it's too early to say, I think, that these
are the 5 things you need to do to build grit

00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:23.260
up in yourself or in your children.

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:29.740
Right now Duckworth's best advice is this
wonderful maxim she refers to, choose easy,

00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:35.250
work hard, which means that we should expose
our kids and ourselves to a menu of possibilities.

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:37.960
To a lot of things you might fall in love
with.

00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:42.680
Maybe it's painting, maybe it's drawing, maybe
it's computer programming, maybe it's marketing,

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:46.320
who knows, just let yourself find something
that feels like fun, that feels like play

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:47.320
not like work.

00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:52.130
And then once you commit to it, you have to
remind yourself every single day to work hard.

00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:57.060
To put in your ten thousand hours plus or
minus five thousand hours, that it's not always

00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:59.660
gonna be fun, in fact, it'll rarely be fun.

00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:04.780
People who are really gritty, they find the
un-fun stuff just as aversive as people who

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:07.190
don't have grit, it's just they're able to
push on through it.

00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:10.840
So, choose easy, work hard is, I think, the
best advice we have right now.

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:17.180
&gt;&gt;female #2: Can we take a question from Daniel
in our Soho office?

00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:19.750
[Pause]

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:27.070
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: Maybe this is why people still
go to business conferences.

00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:28.070
[Laughter]

00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:32.990
&gt;&gt;male #3: Can't hear you Daniel.

00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:38.390
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: I wish I could lip read.

00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:39.390
[Pause]

00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:47.750
&gt;&gt;female #2: Okay, alright, we'll move on
with another question and we'll come back

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:48.900
to Daniel.

00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:57.100
&gt;&gt;male #4: Hi, um, you mentioned scientists
going from working individually to working

00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:59.960
in larger and progressively larger groups.

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:07.601
And you mentioned some of the scientists working
individually, Darwin and Einstein and they

00:52:07.601 --> 00:52:10.410
had very revolutionary ideas.

00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:19.060
I'm wondering if the move to groups will lead
to more evolutionary science as opposed to

00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:30.620
revolutionary science where if the ideas of
energy as matter would get thrown out in a

00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:32.750
debate early on in a group?

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:36.400
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: It's a really interesting
question and it's something I've talked with

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:37.530
Jones about extensively.

00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:42.860
And I think it's unclear to him whether or
not, I think, I feel like physics if it's

00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:47.350
just too immature to still have those kinds
of total paradigm shifts or if we now know

00:52:47.350 --> 00:52:51.400
enough about the structure of reality where
it's just become an evolutionary science.

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:52.400
Yes?

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:55.200
&gt;&gt;male #4: The same was thought before Einstein

00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.440
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: Of course, in 1903

00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:58.900
&gt;&gt;male #4: They've become a scientist, we
know everything.

00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:06.530
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: Of course, they've been saying
that, I'm sure Pythagoras was complaining

00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:09.040
about, ugh, all the interesting problems have
been solved.

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:12.050
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: It's a refrain you see again

00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:14.640
and again but eventually it's gonna be true,
right?

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:19.190
Eventually we will have a good enough map
of reality where, you know, our predictions

00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:20.400
line up.

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:26.500
And, you know, I think it's unclear with all
these super colliders coming out online, if,

00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:28.900
you know how much they'll change about our
assumptions.

00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:32.890
So, I think there are many, many interesting
problems to solve in a field like physics,

00:53:32.890 --> 00:53:36.600
in a field like neuroscience, the answers
even more clear that we know nothing.

00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:40.690
That right now we know enough just to know
how little we actually understand.

00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:44.600
Um, so I think there's absolutely revolutions
waiting to happen.

00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:51.840
I don't think, necessarily, that teams, by
definition, will make those paradigm shifts

00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:52.840
less radical.

00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:56.210
I mean, I think that's our old model of big
paradigm shifts come from individuals.

00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:59.670
I think Jones would argue it's just now we
need to be more interdisciplinary.

00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:04.560
When you look at a field like neuroscience,
which I know better that physics, unfortunately,

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:09.240
and you look at the kinds of problems we need
to solve, they require people with backgrounds

00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:13.550
in, you know, like the Connectum, it's a big
movement neuroscience to understand the actual

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:14.840
wiring diagram of the brain.

00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:20.340
That requires people with backgrounds in computer
science, computer programming, you know, molecular

00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:24.690
biology, neuroscience, neurology, I mean,
it requires all these different people to

00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:25.690
come together.

00:54:25.690 --> 00:54:29.420
No single field, no single discipline can
solve it by themselves.

00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:34.170
And what Jones argues is there simply are
limits to how much knowledge the brain can

00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:35.170
hold.

00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:39.869
It takes ten years to even amass an expertise
in one of those disciplines.

00:54:39.869 --> 00:54:43.040
We don't live long enough to become an expert
in enough disciplines to actually tackle these

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:47.040
very, very hard problems which is why they
exceed our individual capabilities.

00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.160
But it's an interesting question.

00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:51.050
I think there's no good answer for it yet.

00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:56.820
I think we'll have to see how 21st century
science plays out.

00:54:56.820 --> 00:55:03.180
&gt;&gt;female #3: Hello, um, I really enjoyed all
your radio lab contributions.

00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:04.180
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: Oh, thank you.

00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:08.440
&gt;&gt;female #3: And I wanted to ask you, cause
there was an article in the New York Times

00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:12.630
last Sunday about the brain and physical activity.

00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:18.869
I wanted to see if you can quote any studies
on daydreaming and making all these connections

00:55:18.869 --> 00:55:19.960
with physical exercise.

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:20.960
Thank you.

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:25.040
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: It's interesting, I mean,
a lot of people, it turns out physical activity

00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:28.820
when it comes to like daydreaming and alpha
waves whether or not it's relaxing, it's very

00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:29.820
divisive.

00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:33.240
Some people, and people in these studies,
some people find going to the gym very relaxing.

00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:36.900
They find the Stairmaster or the Treadmill
or jogging outside, very relaxing.

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:39.580
They'll talk about all the great ideas they
have when they jog.

00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:41.210
Some people find it very stressful.

00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:45.720
So that's why it's tough, in general, to come
up with a universal prescription for how to

00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:47.260
relax yourself.

00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:50.960
Maybe it's playing football, maybe it's playing
foosball.

00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:54.620
It's different for everybody and that's why
it's so important for each individual to seek

00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:57.619
out their own place that puts them at ease.

00:55:57.619 --> 00:56:02.710
I mean, on the larger subject of physical
exertion, it's so essential.

00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:07.680
And I think it's been one of the big themes
in modern neuroscience, which has surprised

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:11.780
neuroscience, cause I think for a long time
we like to flatter ourselves by thinking about

00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:16.570
the brain as somehow separate from the body,
you know, just, we're just this, you know,

00:56:16.570 --> 00:56:23.130
ethereal brain in a vat, mostly un tethered
and disconnected from this fleshly machine

00:56:23.130 --> 00:56:24.370
we gotta carry around.

00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:26.150
Well, it turns out that's not true at all.

00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:31.170
That's why neurogenesis, for instance, the
birth of new brain cells in, you know, even

00:56:31.170 --> 00:56:34.170
the adult brain, is very closely connected
with physical exercise.

00:56:34.170 --> 00:56:38.020
The single best way to increase neurogenesis
is to get more exercise, to move about more.

00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:40.990
You see this is rodents and you see this in
humans.

00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:45.130
Nobody knows why that is but we know it's
just, it's important.

00:56:45.130 --> 00:56:49.700
Some new studies have come out looking at
dementia and blood flow and simply blood flow

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:52.300
to the brain increases with exercise.

00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:56.230
It's improving your cardiovascular system
and so one of the best ways to save off dementia

00:56:56.230 --> 00:57:01.140
seems to be even better than playing bridge
every day which used to be like the best prescription,

00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:06.300
is going for a walk, getting exercise, getting
your blood going.

00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:09.050
Now one of the control studies, which I'm
kind of fascinated to see how it turns out,

00:57:09.050 --> 00:57:11.630
there compared exercise to people that do
headstands.

00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:15.500
Cause if it's just about blood flow, right,
then a headstand should work pretty well.

00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:17.530
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: So that'll be interesting,

00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:19.960
that'll be a better test to the causality.

00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:23.490
So, I think that's due to come out next year.

00:57:23.490 --> 00:57:28.550
Um, I mean, right now we can say it's important,
I don't think we understand all the causal

00:57:28.550 --> 00:57:31.370
mechanisms, that's my release on the research.

00:57:31.370 --> 00:57:35.760
&gt;&gt;female #2: I think we're about running out
of time but if we could just do two more questions.

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:39.150
I've got one from Daniel in the Soho office.

00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:43.400
You talked about idle conversation in the
online space and gave the example of Skype.

00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:48.740
What's your perspective on the rise of social
and catalyzing serendipitous connections and

00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:52.150
is there any way of transferring serendipity
into the online space?

00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:53.850
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: I have no doubt there is.

00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:58.740
I'd be the last person to ever bet against
the future innovations of tech companies.

00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:02.190
I think it's astonishing how far we've come
in a short amount of time.

00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:05.650
That's, I don't think we've found it yet.

00:58:05.650 --> 00:58:09.730
I think too often the online space, our interactions,
and this is at least true with my interactions,

00:58:09.730 --> 00:58:12.869
they're driven by what psychologists call
self-similarity principle.

00:58:12.869 --> 00:58:17.510
Where even a platform like Twitter, which
I think could be used to foster some kind

00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:18.510
of serendipity.

00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:22.770
And I'm always depressed when I look at who
I follow on Twitter, it's people a lot like

00:58:22.770 --> 00:58:28.110
me, people who are interested in the brain,
interested in science, people who are good

00:58:28.110 --> 00:58:31.020
liberals, etcetera, etcetera.

00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:32.940
And this is the self similarity principle.

00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:36.900
This has been found in study after study that
it's always easier to spend time with people

00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:38.370
who are just like us.

00:58:38.370 --> 00:58:42.150
And so, when given a choice, we seek out those
who think like us, who talk like us, vote

00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:46.050
for the same politicians, speak the same languages,
use the same acronyms and so on.

00:58:46.050 --> 00:58:48.830
That's more comfortable, that's easier, less
tension.

00:58:48.830 --> 00:58:52.690
And I think that speaks to the importance
of what cities do.

00:58:52.690 --> 00:58:55.270
Cities bring together a bunch of weirdos and
throw us together.

00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:58.030
We can't choose who we bump into.

00:58:58.030 --> 00:59:04.310
And so, in a sense, I think that when you
imagine a serendipitous online space, it would

00:59:04.310 --> 00:59:05.310
be kind of unpleasant.

00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:08.810
It's hard to imagine how you would have serendipity.

00:59:08.810 --> 00:59:12.180
You know, have that human friction but not
have it be so unpleasant.

00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:19.030
Have us choose to go to a website that's gonna
say, "I'm gonna confront you with strangers

00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:20.160
who think differently than you."

00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:25.130
I have no doubt it'll happen cause I think
it's a really important next step, but I have

00:59:25.130 --> 00:59:30.030
yet to come up with a good plan of how to
make it happen other than to randomly choose

00:59:30.030 --> 00:59:32.870
people to follow on Twitter.

00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:36.770
But I have no doubt that someday a company
like Google will come up with a way to actually

00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:40.460
foster serendipity online, interpersonal serendipity
especially.

00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:48.690
&gt;&gt; male off mic: the last one
&gt;&gt;female #4: Hi, very fascinating speech,

00:59:48.690 --> 00:59:53.470
I've got a real interest in the grit thresholds
neurologically.

00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:58.730
I'm wondering if any studies have been taken
by people with respect to, you know, these

00:59:58.730 --> 01:00:04.640
highly focused, highly successful creative
people who have a very high level of grit

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:09.010
and those that also have a very high level
grit that like certain sports stars and other

01:00:09.010 --> 01:00:13.650
people who get to that, you know, high level
of grit and then get, you know, what is characterized

01:00:13.650 --> 01:00:17.380
as burn out, ME or chronic fatigue those sorts
of things.

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:20.710
How do you think that works, you know, neurologically
in the brain?

01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:23.000
What differentiates between those two types
of people?

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.511
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: You mean what separates those
with lots of grit from those who?

01:00:26.511 --> 01:00:30.600
&gt;&gt;female #4: Who had lots of grit but then
the grit threshold is obviously too high and

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.350
then the brain goes, "I can't take this anymore"
and shuts down.

01:00:33.350 --> 01:00:34.670
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: I mean it's a great question.

01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:37.930
There's no, no one is really taking grit to
the brain yet.

01:00:37.930 --> 01:00:41.730
It's a brand new character trait, at least
in the context of character traits it's only

01:00:41.730 --> 01:00:42.970
been around since 2005.

01:00:42.970 --> 01:00:47.060
So, you know, we've got some sense of what
underlies it from lots of work on self control

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.830
cause grits in the self control family.

01:00:49.830 --> 01:00:55.200
But it's too soon to say what exactly parts
of the brain fizzles out or kind of goes limp

01:00:55.200 --> 01:01:00.960
when people, who clearly were able to put
in the work, just give up.

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:06.290
It's also important to point out that it's
not always great to just have endless grit

01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:10.200
resources that, grit, like all character traits,
you can have too much of it.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:13.890
So you get increasing returns, it gets better
and better and at a certain point you can

01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:16.330
have too much grit, right, you can be too
single minded.

01:01:16.330 --> 01:01:20.390
Like, I may wanna be a professional basketball
player, in fact, I do wanna be a professional

01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:21.820
basketball player.

01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:25.390
But someone's gotta pull me aside and say,
"You know what, even if you're the greatest

01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:27.119
person in the world, look at yourself.

01:01:27.119 --> 01:01:28.119
You still won't get there."

01:01:28.119 --> 01:01:32.369
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: So if I'm too gritty, I may

01:01:32.369 --> 01:01:35.360
devote my life to trying to accomplish an
impossible goal.

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:39.280
So grit is also about being a little strategic
about saying like what are the goals that

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:42.080
are worth pursuing given who I am?

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:45.010
That's why Duckworth argues we have to be
more realistic in talking to our kids.

01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:48.570
Like, right now we say, "If you can dream
it, you can do it!

01:01:48.570 --> 01:01:49.600
Just go for it!"

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:51.550
When, maybe that's kind of bad advice sometimes.

01:01:51.550 --> 01:01:53.920
Maybe we should make sure that, I know it
sounds sad, right?

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:57.380
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: It sounds so cynical but let's

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.720
be honest.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:03.220
We can't all play in the NBA and that's just
the fact of life.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:07.550
So we should make sure our kids, at the very
least, have some kind of tangible plan for

01:02:07.550 --> 01:02:10.590
getting from, you know, where they are to
where they wanna be.

01:02:10.590 --> 01:02:14.080
And maybe it'll mean just giving them better
advice at an early age.

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.900
And make sure they've got realistic goals
too.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:21.010
Not that we shouldn't dream or anything, I
should be the last person to suggest that,

01:02:21.010 --> 01:02:22.900
but that we should be realistic.

01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:30.070
So, you know, in terms of why some people
give up, um, I think it's often that, one

01:02:30.070 --> 01:02:33.310
explanation that I might propose is that these
are people that are actually very strategic

01:02:33.310 --> 01:02:34.359
about goal setting.

01:02:34.359 --> 01:02:38.880
Maybe they were a football star and they had
a lot of grit and they put in those ten thousand

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:43.280
hours and got really good at it but then they
realized that I'm just, you know, my talents

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:48.330
are fading, I'm not quite good enough, I should
find a new goal while I still can and devote

01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:51.930
my grit to that resource.

01:02:51.930 --> 01:02:55.980
One of the important things about grit is
the limited resource, it's a scarce resource.

01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:58.950
So, it's a bit like self control, you have
to figure out how to allocate it depending

01:02:58.950 --> 01:03:00.430
on what you wanna do.

01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:04.030
So, sometimes you see people switching, a
lot of gritty people will have just one goal

01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:08.670
for their entire life and do that, they're
able to pivot but once they pivot they're

01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:11.980
able to commit to that goal.

01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:17.030
So grit isn't just about stupid persistence
it's also about being strategic in how you're

01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:18.030
single minded.

01:03:18.030 --> 01:03:20.770
&gt;&gt;presenter: Unfortunately we're out of time.

01:03:20.770 --> 01:03:22.740
&gt;&gt;Jonah Lehrer: Thank you.

01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:26.750
&gt;&gt;presenter: I'm sure we could spend the next
few hours peppering you with questions.

01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:29.660
But really just wanna thank you for coming
and join me in a round of applause here.

01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:29.780
[Applause]
