00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.280
&gt;&gt;Female presenter: Hi, everyone. Welcome
to AuthorsGoogle. I'm really excited to introduce

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.280
Chris Guillebeau today. Chris is an author,
blogger, and all-around awesome human being.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.030
He wrote the book, The Art of Nonconformity,
and has a really popular blog of the same

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:27.330
name. Chris describes himself as a writer,
traveler, entrepreneur, and general nonconformist,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.520
and he's on a mission to visit every country
in the world before he turns 35. So, he's

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:40.480
currently visited about 151 countries, has
49 to go and is also running his book tour

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:48.710
in similar audacious fashion. He is visiting
all 50 states in a span of about two, two

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.770
and a half months as well as ten Canadian
provinces. Chris's goals are to help people

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.110
live unconventional lives, make their own
choices, and change the world. I know I've

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.220
been personally very inspired by Chris and
his work, so without further ado, Chris Guillebeau.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.220
[applause]

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:15.430
&gt;&gt;Chris: Thanks so much. That was great. Thank
you so much. Thanks, Jenny that was wonderful.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.360
The one thing Jenny didn't mention is that
she's an author herself and her book is coming

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.350
out, Life after College, in spring of next
year. So, I'm really excited about that. And

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.670
thanks for your help in organizing this. Thanks,
Candice, for the posters, and thanks to all

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.759
of you for being here. Thanks for welcoming
me to the Googleplex. So, I am psyched. It

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.170
is an unconventional book tour, so because
of that, I don't wanna lecture for an hour.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.380
I'm sure you don't want that, either, and
I'm also going to assume that everyone here

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.580
is literate. So, I won't read to you from
the book. If you want to read the book, you

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:55.039
can do so. That's great; if not, that's fine,
too. This is stop number 46 of the Unconventional

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.420
Book Tour. It's been so much fun to go all
over the country and talk to fun people about

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.219
nonconformity and unconventional life and
work of different forms. So, what I thought

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.880
I'd do is I'll talk for about 15, 20 minutes.
I'll tell you a little bit about the book.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.010
I'll tell you why I wrote it and what I hope
will come of it and a couple of things that

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.170
are happening with the Art of Nonconformity
in general. And then we'll do what I call

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.890
questions and attempted answers for about
15 minutes or so. So, sometimes that goes

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.170
better than others, but here, I'm sure, it's
gonna be great; at least we'll have great

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.250
questions. And then we'll just hang out and
I'll be in the back after that to sign books

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.280
for anybody who wants that. And normally,
I encourage people to bring cupcakes, but

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.350
here, at the Googleplex, that doesn't seem
to be an issue. So, again, we'll just hang

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:46.140
out and I'm so glad you're here. Quick audience
survey: How many of you have blogs of your

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.320
own?

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.650
[pause]
OK. And how many of you use Twitter? Awesome.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:00.650
OK, about a third with blogs, about 50% Twitter,
nice. So, the first question that often comes

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:09.070
up these days, why bother writing a book?
Like, what's the point? Because we live in

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:16.790
this beautiful, digital age where we can get
information out to people immediately; we

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.410
can go tonight and write a blog post about
what happens here today. And no one's gonna

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.620
tell us what to say. We have no editors, there's
no gatekeeper. And we can get that message

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.850
out to tens of thousands or more people and
if we want instant feedback, we can get that

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.640
with Twitter, Facebook, Side Comments, etc.
And I think it's all wonderful, but it also

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.130
begs the question, why bother writing a book?
Because a book is almost the opposite of that

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.200
process. A book takes forever. The publishing
lifecycle takes a year or more. I wrote this

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.270
book last year; it just came out two months
ago. You have to give up control. There's

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.060
no guarantee of success, etc. And so I was
thinking about this as I was going through

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.470
the writing process and getting ready to publish
the book and I realized that, for me, I was

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.180
always a big reader and I grew up reading
books and books were something that were very

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:18.310
special to me, and I could think of probably
five to ten books, at least, that I had read

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.349
as a child or a teenager, as an adult, that
had really changed my life, that had really

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:27.620
made a big impact or a big difference. And
after I read the book, I was a different person,

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.710
or I made decisions differently. And I couldn't
really think of a lot of blog posts that have

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.430
changed my life and I certainly couldn't think
of any tweets that changed my life; just reading

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.979
through the tweet deck and like, "Wow. I'm
a different person." Couldn't think of anything

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:48.439
like that. So, I think Twitter is great for
gathering people together and doing this Unconventional

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:52.439
Book Tour and each stop along the way. Twitter,
Facebook, all those things have been fantastic

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:57.099
in bringing people out. And I think it's also
good for making connections and sharing information

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:04.129
and all kinds of things, but I also think
that a lot of digital communication is fleeting

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:07.099
and a lot of it just goes out there and then
we move on to the next thing.

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:08.099
[woman’s voice on intercom interference]

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:14.819
All right. I guess we're gonna keep going.
Great.

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:15.819
[laughter]

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:19.969
So, a lot of communication goes out there
and if you have a blog of your own, you probably

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:25.259
know that your archives are almost never read.
It's mostly only your current posts. Ninety

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:30.509
percent of the traffic is going to your most
recent posts. And so, I guess I still believe

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:35.219
that books, at least, have the potential to
be a little bit longer lasting, to make a

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:40.249
little bit more of an impact, to be something
with a longer timeline, at least a different

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:46.279
format. And it's not for me to say whether
this book will change anyone's life or not;

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:50.770
that's for other people to judge. But I also
think it's good to have a goal and it's good

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:56.270
to define your own success and if you're gonna
undertake a big project, you might as well

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.650
decide for yourself what success is gonna
look like. And so, in my case with this book,

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.599
my hope with The Art of Nonconformity book
is that people will read it and say not only

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.979
it was a good book, but hopefully say, "I
read this book and then I thought differently

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:14.789
about some things and I went and made some
changes, or I made some different decisions."

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:20.520
So, really, the goal is to inspire people
to take action, to create positive change,

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.310
or whatever positive change looks like in
their lives. And so, I like to frame the whole

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:31.599
question around something that Gretchen Rubin
said. And Gretchen is the author of The Happiness

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:36.389
Project book and blog and she's been a good
friend and mentor to me, and so on the first

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:43.669
page of the book, Gretchen asks this question
and the question is, "In the face of relentless

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:50.759
pressure to conform, and pressure to avoid
risks, how do we craft the life of our dreams?"

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:54.960
Or another way to put it is, "How do we live
a remarkable life in a conventional world?"

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:01.339
So, that's the central question of the book.
And I use this analogy in the prologue of

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:05.920
jumping off a bridge, or bridge jumping. So,
bridge jumping comes from this experience

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.669
you might have had when you were a kid and
you wanted to do something that you probably

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:15.960
shouldn't do and your parent or your teacher
or some authority figure said, "Jenny, why

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.719
do you want to do that?" And she said, "Oh,
because Candice is doing it. Because Tim is

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:25.819
doing it." And they said to her, "If everyone
else jumped off a bridge, would you?" So then

00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:30.289
she's a little bit disappointed, but she realizes,
hopefully, maybe it's good advice, which is

00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:37.650
all fine and well, but then we grow up and
the situation changes; kind of reverses itself.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:43.770
And we look around and we see that many of
our peers are making the same kind of decisions.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:48.330
And many of our peers are on one narrow path
and doing the same kind of things in terms

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:54.650
of their education, their career, their relationships,
how they think about money and debt and all

00:07:54.650 --> 00:08:01.029
kinds of things. And if we wanna do something
different, if we have an idea maybe to take

00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:06.059
the road not taken or even make our own road,
even if it's something that not confrontational,

00:08:06.059 --> 00:08:10.930
even if it's not opposed to someone else,
then we often encounter this resistance and

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:14.979
we encounter this pressure to conform, that
Gretchen talked about, or this pressure to

00:08:14.979 --> 00:08:20.059
avoid risks. And so, it's almost like everyone's
asking us the opposite question. It's almost

00:08:20.059 --> 00:08:24.969
like everyone's saying, "Everyone else is
jumping off the bridge, why aren't you? What's

00:08:24.969 --> 00:08:31.509
wrong with you?" And so, the one sentence
statement of why I wrote the book is to bring

00:08:31.509 --> 00:08:36.800
the childhood message up to adulthood application
and to say, "You don't have to live your life

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:41.930
the way other people expect you to and you
can do good things for yourself and for others

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:48.660
at the same time." It's not a false choice,
it's not a dichotomy. And here are the stories

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:53.089
of a number of people who have done that in
different ways. So, I wrote the book, there's

00:08:53.089 --> 00:08:57.040
a number of stories about me and some people
will relate to those stories and others won't,

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:01.570
and that's OK. But then there's stories of
other people who have somehow overcome the

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:07.480
pressure to conform and pursued an unconventional
choice of their own. So for example, there's

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:13.570
a story of Susan Lewis, who's from Dallas,
Texas, and Susan wanted to make a career change.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:17.880
She didn't actually want to be an entrepreneur;
she wanted to be part of a company or an organization

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:23.399
bigger than herself, but she realized any
job I apply for, there's probably gonna be

00:09:23.399 --> 00:09:28.540
a hundred other people, at least, applying
for this job. And maybe on paper they look

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:35.240
as good as I do, so how can I get around this
situation? How can I circumvent the HR process?

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:40.660
And so, instead of sending out 300 emails
with her resume attached, in hopes that one

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:47.000
company would call her back, Susan created
a website called "Susanhiresaboss.com" and

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.500
put her portfolio online and said, "Here's
who I am and here's what I've done, and most

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:57.170
importantly, here's what I would like to do
for the right company or organization. And

00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:01.930
I am interviewing prospective bosses. If you'd
like to be considered, fill out this form."

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:06.899
So, of course that's very audacious, especially
at the height of the economic crisis, when

00:10:06.899 --> 00:10:11.750
unemployment was 12 to 14% in Texas, but Susan
did this and she got a lot of attention for

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:17.430
it and she got 12 to 14 good job offers from
companies all over North America. And the

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:21.920
company that she ended up going to work for,
or the boss that she hired, to use her language,

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.769
was not actually planning on expanding their
organization until he heard about Susan's

00:10:26.769 --> 00:10:30.850
project and he was just really impressed with
her initiative and he said, "I have to make

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:36.050
room in my organization for someone like Susan."
There's also a story about a guy named Alan

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:43.540
Bacon and Alan was a self-described conventional
guy with a traditional job and a family, middle-aged,

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:47.990
and Alan was happy with many parts of his
life, but he was also discontented and thinking

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:54.259
about making some change, but he realized,
"I can't make a really big change. I can't

00:10:54.259 --> 00:10:57.660
just leave everything behind and move to Thailand,
like some people do. That's great that some

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:03.190
people can do that, but I can't." So what
Alan did instead was, he created what he called

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:09.940
a "series of life experiments." And the life
experiments began with really small things,

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:15.149
things like going to the art museum during
his lunch break. So, every day he drove to

00:11:15.149 --> 00:11:19.190
work and he passed this art museum and he
had never been inside. So one day, he went

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:23.759
inside. And then he took up photography, which
was a hobby he had always been interested

00:11:23.759 --> 00:11:29.240
in, but had never really pursued. So he bought
a camera, took a class. Then he started doing

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:34.009
some travelling. He started doing some business
travel he hadn't done before. He went overseas

00:11:34.009 --> 00:11:38.019
to Europe for the first time and he found
out that he had to go back to France for about

00:11:38.019 --> 00:11:42.730
three weeks, and instead of going back by
himself, he found a way to bring his family

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:48.350
with him. So, his wife and their three young
daughters went to France for a three week

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:52.660
cross-cultural immersion experience; talked
about what a good decision that was for the

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:57.389
family. And then Alan started consulting and
now he's completely self-employed. And he

00:11:57.389 --> 00:12:04.240
traces the whole process to the early idea
of the life experiments; to just being willing

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:10.980
to experiment with change, to see change as
something welcoming instead of something fearful.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:17.259
So, the story of Susan, the story of Alan,
a number of other people in the book, again,

00:12:17.259 --> 00:12:22.490
with the goal of inspiring readers to take
action, to create positive change, to take

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:27.079
action to maybe step back from the bridge
and take a different look and see, "How can

00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:32.139
I pursue my own unconventional life?" And
so, when we talk about things like change,

00:12:32.139 --> 00:12:37.829
and we talk about nonconformity, unconventional
living, all these kinds of things, it’s

00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:42.410
good to mention that these are not things
that everyone cares about, and not everyone's

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:47.470
interested in change and not everyone wants
to live unconventionally, and that's OK. So,

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:51.709
I get a lot of emails and from time to time,
people will write in and say, "I have a very

00:12:51.709 --> 00:12:56.890
traditional life, what do you have against
me?" And it gives me a great opportunity to

00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:01.910
say I have nothing against you and I wish
you well and that's great, I'm so glad you're

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:08.750
happy. The problem is that a lot of other
people are not happy with that and maybe not

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:13.110
so much unhappy, but I would say a lot of
people are discontented and a lot of people

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:18.550
are dissatisfied with the idea of doing things
the way they've always been done. And so,

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:22.310
in many ways, the fundamental message of The
Art of Nonconformity, the whole project, is

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:27.769
really for the discontented. It's a self-selecting
group of people who do want to do something

00:13:27.769 --> 00:13:33.180
different. And for those of us who find ourselves
in that group, for people who identify with

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:39.040
that and say, "Yes, I do want to pursue the
road not taken, or make my own road," I've

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:44.170
been doing these meet-ups all across the country.
San Francisco is number 46 and out of all

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:49.329
these conversations, I've developed just two
suggestions. So, two suggestions for those

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:56.779
of us who find ourselves in that group. The
first suggestion is that these days, there

00:13:56.779 --> 00:14:02.459
is a lot of conversation about efficiency,
about how to be the most efficient person

00:14:02.459 --> 00:14:07.200
or the most productive, or how to live the
most optimal life; how to get up at 5 o'clock

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:13.000
in the morning and read your 60 RSS feeds
by 6 AM, or how to outsource your life and

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.990
get other people to do things for you, so
that you can detach yourself from humanity.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:23.600
And I think that's a little bit overrated.
And my response to that would be the same

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.209
as with the other people. I would say, "If
that works for you; that's great, if that

00:14:27.209 --> 00:14:31.879
rocks your world, wonderful." But for those
of us who might be a little bit uncomfortable

00:14:31.879 --> 00:14:36.500
with that, or for those of us who might wonder,
"Is that it? Is that the answer?" I would

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:43.329
say that there's an alternative, and the alternative
to pursuing efficiency for efficiency's sake,

00:14:43.329 --> 00:14:50.260
is to pursue meaningful adventure. So, things
like, in my case, visiting every country in

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:54.579
the world. For those of you who read the blog,
you know it's a highly inefficient quest.

00:14:54.579 --> 00:15:01.139
I spend a lot of time and money and energy
sorting out plane tickets and logistics and

00:15:01.139 --> 00:15:05.540
Visas and sleeping on the floor of the airport
all over the world, and getting kicked out

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:11.589
of various countries. And it's all very inefficient
and in many ways, my life could be much easier

00:15:11.589 --> 00:15:15.639
if I just didn't do that; if I just lived
at home in Portland, Oregon, maybe travelled

00:15:15.639 --> 00:15:19.769
around the States, maybe traveled once a year.
But I don't do it because it’s efficient

00:15:19.769 --> 00:15:24.220
or productive; I do it because it’s meaningful.
It brings personal joy to me; that's why I

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:30.819
do it. Another example would be this book
tour itself. About 90 days before the book

00:15:30.819 --> 00:15:35.319
came out, I talked to my publisher and I said,
"Hey guys. What's the plan for the book tour?

00:15:35.319 --> 00:15:40.300
Where am I going?" And they said, "Oh, we
don't have any money for that and we don't

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.949
really believe in book tours anymore. Most
authors don't really want to do them anyway."

00:15:43.949 --> 00:15:48.779
And they said, "You can come to New York if
you want." And I said, "Well, New York is

00:15:48.779 --> 00:15:54.319
great, but not everyone lives there." So,
I just decided if there's no official book

00:15:54.319 --> 00:16:00.380
tour, well that's OK. I'll make my own. And
I don't want to do anything small, so I don't

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.900
want to only do major markets. So, that's
how the whole 50 state thing came about and

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.870
I didn't want to leave out Canada, so all
the provinces up there. And I just figured

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:11.990
it’s not only me, it's all of my great readers.
I have great readers all over the country

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:16.160
and we'll just make this happen and we'll
find a way to do it, however we can do it.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:21.970
And it's been so fantastic. It's been so much
fun, so rewarding, so meaningful and it's

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:25.389
great that I can go to places and have great
crowds. It's great that I can come here to

00:16:25.389 --> 00:16:29.949
Google, but some of the smaller stops, in
many ways, have actually been more meaningful;

00:16:29.949 --> 00:16:35.439
to go to a place like North Dakota where there's
nine people, until a few days before. I went

00:16:35.439 --> 00:16:39.829
to West Virginia and there was only one person
on the sign-up list and her name was Nancy.

00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:44.009
So I wrote to her and said, "Nancy, you have
to be there. You can't get sick, you can't

00:16:44.009 --> 00:16:46.580
skip it, because it's you and me and West
Virginia."

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.999
[laughter]

00:16:47.999 --> 00:16:52.480
So it's one of those things that doesn't make
sense from an economic perspective, or from

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:58.600
a marketing perspective. But again, it's an
adventure. It's fun. So, instead of efficiency,

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:05.949
consider meaningful adventure. And the second
of just two suggestions comes from the awareness

00:17:05.949 --> 00:17:10.280
that these are really privileged conversations
that we're able to have. And I think it's

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:15.559
fantastic that we can talk about things like
what kind of work we would like to do and

00:17:15.559 --> 00:17:20.659
how we would like to spend our time and what
blogs we read. And so, it's great, but it's

00:17:20.659 --> 00:17:25.079
also very unusual; it's very remarkable and
it's very privileged to be able to talk about

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:29.679
these things. And so, something that I think
is missing from the whole conversation about

00:17:29.679 --> 00:17:35.520
alternative life and work, is this question
of contribution; the question, "What can we

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:40.150
contribute?" instead of just, "What can we
consume?" or "How can we engage instead of

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:44.250
detach?" And so, that's why I say that the
two most important questions in the universe

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:49.080
are, number one, what do you really want to
get out of life? Because a lot of people don't

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:53.490
know what they want, so I think if they can
figure that out, that's great. But then, number

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:59.279
two, what can you offer the world that no
one else can? So that's that question of contribution,

00:17:59.279 --> 00:18:03.971
a question of engagement. And it's good to
say, when we talked about contribution, and

00:18:03.971 --> 00:18:09.470
it's not entirely a selfless act, it's not
a sacrificial thing, at least not entirely,

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:14.770
because we ourselves benefit as we contribute,
and we, ourselves, are made better as we seek

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:21.260
to answer that question of contribution. So,
it's good for everyone. And my story is, after

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:27.039
9/11, I was depressed like everyone else and
just asking myself the big questions of life

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:32.600
and my wife and I are talking about what can
we do and is there a way we can respond? How

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.440
can we do something to give back? And it was
out of that situation that we ended up moving

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:41.440
to West Africa and living in Sierra Leone
and Liberia for about four years, volunteering

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:46.350
for a medical charity. And it was just the
most amazing, transformative experience of

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:50.460
our lives. It was very good for us and we
would come back to the States about every

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:54.760
year or so, and we would talk with people
about what we were doing, and people would

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:59.700
say things like, "Oh, that's amazing. How
sacrificial of you." And we realized pretty

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:04.590
quickly to become uncomfortable with that
kind of dialogue because we would say, Oh,

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:09.310
it is great that we can do this and it is
wonderful that we can be a part of something

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:15.240
bigger than ourselves and that we can help
an organization that's working in post-conflict

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:19.390
countries, and that's good. And people's lives
are being made better through that, but it's

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:22.980
not the whole story. The whole story is that
our lives are being made better through this,

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:27.190
also. And we are also being changed. So really
this is the best decision that we've ever

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:34.620
made. And so, that's why I call it a selfish
generosity as we seek to answer that question

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:38.779
of contribution and we, ourselves, are made
better. So, when you put all these things

00:19:38.779 --> 00:19:45.610
together, along with this opportunity to embrace
life as a meaningful adventure, instead of

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:51.740
something to be lived to its most efficient
state all the time, along with the imperative

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:55.770
to really think about contribution and think
about what we can give and how we can engage.

00:19:55.770 --> 00:20:02.429
I think what it all comes down to is a question
of legacy, of what will our legacy be? And

00:20:02.429 --> 00:20:06.000
what are we building and what kind of story
do we hope to tell with our lives and what

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.210
will the ultimate impact of our lives be?
And I think of legacy as having nothing to

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:17.970
do with money, nothing to do with inheritance,
even career. It's certainly nothing that we

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:22.950
think about at the end of our lives, looking
back, when we can't really make any changes,

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:28.350
but rather, legacy is something to think about
from whatever stage in our life we're in.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:33.950
And I think it's a question of influence and
relationships and that part of contribution

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:38.070
that I talked about. And so, that's what I've
been trying to do with The Art of Nonconformity,

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:42.940
with the blog, and now the book, the business,
the whole community. I like to be very clear

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:47.540
that it's been a work in progress from the
beginning and it continues to be. I wasn't

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:51.270
really clear about the project in the beginning
and that's normally how it goes. I began with

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:56.740
a classic blogging strategy of making shit
up. I'm sure no one at Google is familiar

00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:02.490
with that, but that's how I started and fortunately,
a number of people came along and engaged,

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:07.400
and contributed, and participated and asked
good questions and made the project so much

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:11.760
better than it would've been just with me.
And so, I'm extremely grateful for that and

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:17.919
I consider myself extremely fortunate to have
responsibility for this community. And just

00:21:17.919 --> 00:21:22.320
to let you know, two very quick things for
those of you who are interested, the first

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:27.340
thing is that this book is actually a partnership
with my friends at Charity Water and we're

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:33.320
working with two communities in Ethiopia to
bring clean water and sanitation. And so,

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.930
if you get the book in any form, print or
digital, if you just write your name down

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:41.151
on this notebook today and then all the money
that I get for the book will go to the project

00:21:41.151 --> 00:21:47.750
in Ethiopia. And the second thing is as I've
been doing these meet-ups all over the country,

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:53.340
I realized that the best thing about the whole
event, the whole space, is not this formal

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:57.920
time where I'm talking, but really all the
other people who come out in the before and

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:02.100
the after space. So I was trying to think
how can we scale this experience? How can

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:05.990
we do this? How can we bring remarkable people
together, not just from one city, but all

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:11.529
over the world? And so, I created the World
Domination Summit, which I'm hosting next

00:22:11.529 --> 00:22:16.270
June in Portland, Oregon, and I rented out
the Portland Art Museum and I'm working with

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:22.120
a great team to bring together speakers and
workshop leaders. It's gonna be very participatory

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:26.730
and so if you're interested in that, I have
an invitation for you. But mostly, I always

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:33.500
want to say that I get paid in nice emails
and in blog trackbacks and so I'm so grateful

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.529
for everyone who's been a part of the project
and if you're new, that's great, too. Whenever

00:22:37.529 --> 00:22:41.250
I see people writing about The Art of Nonconformity,
I just have the same feeling that I would

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:46.860
have of getting paid. So, I'm very grateful
for that. And the last thing I wanna say before

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:51.940
we can do the Questions and Attempted Answers
and then we'll hang out, is I always like

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:56.980
to talk to people about their own projects,
about their own blogs and businesses and adventures

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:02.190
and things, and on this tour so far, I've
been hearing from a lot of people thinking

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:08.049
about starting something. And the question
of a topic varies quite a bit in terms of

00:23:08.049 --> 00:23:11.250
what they're thinking about starting and what
they're thinking about doing, but I have noticed

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:17.830
this common theme, and the common theme is
"I worry I'm too late." "I worry I'm too late

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:21.799
to do this." So, if it’s a business idea,
I worry that the marketplace has passed me

00:23:21.799 --> 00:23:25.870
by. If it's something else, maybe I just worry
that I'm too late in life. I should've done

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:31.150
this years ago or whatever. And I think it's
really interesting because I always say it's

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:35.440
good to do market research, it's good to think
about your motivations and understand what

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.520
you really want to do and if you're gonna
stick with it. And all those things are great,

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:44.160
but I also realize that that's exactly how
I felt three years ago when I started The

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.909
Art of Nonconformity. And I looked around
and lots of other successful bloggers and

00:23:48.909 --> 00:23:53.830
authors and I thought, "Do I really have a
unique message to share? And I should've started

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:59.350
this a long time ago." And so, there's all
this fear and insecurity and anxiety and somehow

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:03.630
I managed to overcome that and I'm so glad
I did because now here we are together and

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:08.000
now there's this book tour and now the project
is so much bigger than what it was. And I'm

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.019
very grateful for that. And so, I always say
when someone asks, "what is the best time

00:24:12.019 --> 00:24:17.160
to start?" I always say the best time to start
was last year, but failing that, today will

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:22.690
do. So, I'm happy to share whatever it is
I've learned about unconventional life, work,

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:27.149
and travel along the way, and I know I'm among
a great community of people who know all about

00:24:27.149 --> 00:24:32.600
starting things, but mostly I would encourage
you as well to find a way to share your story

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:36.740
with those who can benefit from it. And thanks
so much for having me here, on stop number

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:43.400
46 of The Unconventional Book Tour.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:48.460
[applause]

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.429
So, questions and attempted answers with the
microphone.

00:24:51.429 --> 00:24:53.890
[pause]

00:24:53.890 --> 00:25:05.340
&gt;&gt;Male audience #1: Hi Chris. My name is James.
Thanks for coming here and doing this talk.

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:12.049
So, I think I looked a little bit at your
blog yesterday and you talk about travelling

00:25:12.049 --> 00:25:17.110
long-term and also making money on the side.
And on one hand, I also saw something about

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:20.840
AdWords and AdSense Arbitrage. Can you tell
us a little bit more about that?

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:25.440
&gt;&gt;Chris: Sure. Well, I can probably explain
how I got started as an entrepreneur and then

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:30.679
the transition to the blog. So, thanks James,
for a great question. I got started as an

00:25:30.679 --> 00:25:35.200
entrepreneur about ten years ago. I just discovered
that I wasn't a good employee. I was unemployable,

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:40.340
basically. It's a long story. I go into it
in the book, but my motivation in the beginning

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:45.669
was how can I find a way to support myself?
I don't necessarily need to get rich, but

00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:50.300
how can I find a way to support myself without
working for someone else? So, I would say

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:56.429
it's a low-level motivation. But, I started
a coffee importing business; I started selling

00:25:56.429 --> 00:26:02.360
things on eBay way back in the day when eBay
was new. Then, I was a designer for a while

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:06.080
and then I realized that I was a good designer
in 1999. And things had changed a little bit,

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:11.039
so now I work with a great designer partner.
But I did a number of things with Google AdWords,

00:26:11.039 --> 00:26:15.730
also in the early days. I did affiliate marketing
and I created information products and all

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:20.220
of that. So, I had a kind of scattered history
as an entrepreneur; I never built a big company

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:24.779
or anything. It was mostly, like, my motivation,
again, was to support myself and my wife and

00:26:24.779 --> 00:26:29.210
I went overseas for four years and I was able
to do that without taking a salary from the

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:36.409
organization. So, that was great. But then,
I moved back to the States in 2006 and I realized

00:26:36.409 --> 00:26:40.510
I had done a number of things that were somewhat
interesting to some people, but they were

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:45.769
all kind of unrelated. So I wanted to create
convergence. I felt like I had been an entrepreneur,

00:26:45.769 --> 00:26:49.130
I'd been an aid worker, I have this travel
thing I was starting to do where I was trying

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:55.080
to visit every country, but I had no platform.
And so, that was where The Art of Nonconformity

00:26:55.080 --> 00:27:00.529
came from. And in terms of the monetization
with the site, that was also a very organic

00:27:00.529 --> 00:27:05.260
thing. I get a lot of credit for being strategic
and it's totally false. Really, in the beginning,

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:11.769
I had no monetization plan at all and what
I found was as the project grew, I kept getting

00:27:11.769 --> 00:27:16.429
a lot of the same questions, a lot of technical
question about how I do my travel without

00:27:16.429 --> 00:27:20.630
round the world plane tickets and frequent
flyer miles and travel hacking, and then also

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:25.730
about microbusinesses and entrepreneurship
on a very small scale. And so, I just decided

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:30.549
to create additional resources for sale for
those who wanted that. And I try to be very

00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:36.200
clear in the beginning and still am that I
do most of my work for free. Eighty percent,

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:40.851
90% of the work is for free and then the 10%
or 20% is there for people who want it. So,

00:27:40.851 --> 00:27:45.750
I built that store up along the way. And now,
UnconventionalGuides.com, which is the related

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:50.279
side business to Art of Nonconformity, is
really how I make a living and how I support

00:27:50.279 --> 00:27:56.480
myself. Basically, what I've tried to do is
listen to my community and I've tried to understand

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.610
what they want and what resources they're
looking for, what needs that they have and

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:07.870
try to then find a way to meet those needs.
And that's how the monetization has come about.

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:09.260
[pause]

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:13.659
There's a long line here at the question,
but just try to make your way through.

00:28:13.659 --> 00:28:14.659
[pause]

00:28:14.659 --> 00:28:24.029
&gt;&gt;Male audience #2: Hi, Chris. I feel that
most of the time the best catalyst for action

00:28:24.029 --> 00:28:28.750
is inspiration. And I feel as if inspiration
is something you get from role models. But

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:34.720
growing up, I feel I've been let down by most
of my role models, especially public figures,

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:41.169
so in order to nonconform, what are your thoughts
on where I can find role models to inspire

00:28:41.169 --> 00:28:42.169
me?

00:28:42.169 --> 00:28:43.169
&gt;&gt;Chris: What kind of role model are you looking
for?

00:28:43.169 --> 00:28:51.160
&gt;&gt;audience #2: It's a purposely vague question.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.160
&gt;&gt;Chris: OK.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:56.450
&gt;&gt;audience #2: I feel as if I wanted to do
something big, I would need a feeling, a wanting

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:57.740
to be like someone.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:58.740
&gt;&gt;Chris: OK.

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:02.809
&gt;&gt;audience #2: And so, in one sense, perhaps
the leaders of this company are my role models

00:29:02.809 --> 00:29:04.071
for how I would lead the company.

00:29:04.071 --> 00:29:05.760
&gt;&gt;Chris: Sure. That's great. What's your name?

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:06.760
&gt;&gt;audience #2: Mattheas.

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.580
&gt;&gt;Chris: Mattheas. OK, thanks. That's a good
question. I'm just thinking about how to answer

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:16.549
it that's not purposely vague. I think I also
take inspiration from people and I don't know

00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:20.460
if I would say they're role models. I mean
maybe they are. I would just say I like hearing

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:24.740
the stories of other people who've done different
things, or who have overcome something, or

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:29.520
have pursued a big project, a big dream. And
hopefully, found a way to connect that dream

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:35.929
with the lives of other people. So, I guess
even if I was to feel let down by someone,

00:29:35.929 --> 00:29:39.460
hopefully there's still something in their
life that I can look up to and derive inspiration

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:46.000
from. And part of the project, something I've
tried to be very careful about, is to maintain

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.880
what I call an anti-guru philosophy. So, I
try very hard. Sometimes people ask me specific

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:55.580
questions about their own lives and their
careers and what they're trying to do, and

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:59.710
if I can be helpful in that, I will, but I
don't have any claim that I can provide the

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:04.559
answer. So, I always try to reflect back on
people. So, I still take a lot of inspiration

00:30:04.559 --> 00:30:09.809
from the people who read the site and the
stories that they send me. And I take inspiration

00:30:09.809 --> 00:30:15.840
from other bloggers, other authors, and not
just people who are public figures, but people

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:21.640
who are doing fun things. So, I guess I'm
not looking for one role model or one big

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:26.090
person who I say I want to emulate that person,
but I try to take something from a variety

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:30.799
of people. And then you look at that person’s
life and you say, "What do I like about this?

00:30:30.799 --> 00:30:36.789
And how can I adapt this, or apply this characteristic
to me?" And then, obviously, not everything

00:30:36.789 --> 00:30:39.731
about them will relate to you, so maybe you
take something from someone and something

00:30:39.731 --> 00:30:42.840
from someone else. And then, hopefully, at
some point, that's where your identity comes

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:43.840
from.

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:44.840
[pause]

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:50.970
&gt;&gt;Female audience #1: Hi, I'm Sheba. So my
question is that the older I get and the more

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:57.880
stuff I have accumulated, and the more relationships
I have, like my husband, my kids, it's harder

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:03.990
and harder to do unconventional things. I
mean, mostly like travel and things like that.

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:09.140
Those, in my head, I would love to do that,
but I don't get to do a lot of those things.

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:11.919
So what advice would you have for someone
in my situation?

00:31:11.919 --> 00:31:16.789
&gt;&gt;Chris: OK, great. So, one of the things
that's really helped in the beginning, as

00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:20.750
I said, like people came along and asked good
questions. I started by writing about my own

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:25.029
trips and then people would say things like,
"Well, I don't want to travel," or, "I'm not

00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:28.650
able to travel right now. Isn't nonconformity
bigger than that?" Of course, the answer is

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:35.000
yes. So I had to back up a little bit. What
I've tried to do recently is to look at people

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.529
in different situations and to look at families,
for example. This comes up a lot. And some

00:31:40.529 --> 00:31:44.149
families do want to travel and have some kind
of international adventure and some don't,

00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:49.230
and either way is fine. For those who do want
that, then there are examples of people who've

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:54.649
done that. And a number of people have been
able to have a big adventure. There's a story

00:31:54.649 --> 00:31:59.960
in the book of a family who goes by the name
Soul Travelers 3, so they are soultravellors3.com

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:05.909
or soultravelers3 on Twitter. And they've
been raising their five-year old daughter,

00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:09.280
who I think is now eight or nine, and they've
been living in a number of different countries

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:13.250
and they make about 24,000 dollars a year.
And they have a blog where they talk about

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:17.340
how they do that and the choices that they've
made and the priorities that they've chosen

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:24.510
above other priorities to make happen. But
then the other thing is whether you want to

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:29.940
travel or not, I think these are good conversations
to have as a family. And it's good to talk,

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:34.760
as a family, or a couple, or whatever your
situation is, and say, "OK, what are your

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:38.759
dreams? What are my dreams? And it's OK for
us if some of those dreams are different.

00:32:38.759 --> 00:32:43.230
That's OK, but maybe there's also a shared
experience that we can create, something we

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:48.590
want to do as a family." And then, I like
to reverse engineer things and say, "OK, this

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:53.279
is my goal, this would be fun. How can we
make this happen? How do we step back from

00:32:53.279 --> 00:32:57.870
that and figure out everything that needs
to happen for that to take place." So, I was

00:32:57.870 --> 00:33:02.370
talking with Jenny today about her upcoming
book launch and all of her plans for that.

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:05.620
And I'm sure she'll share about that at some
point. But we were talking about what she

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:11.659
wanted to make happen and what needed to take
place to make that come about. So, I think

00:33:11.659 --> 00:33:15.240
it’s good to have conversations. I think
it’s good to have joint planning sessions.

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:19.520
It’s good to find a way to support each
other’s dreams. What's up?

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.950
&gt;&gt;Male audience #3: Hi, Chris. I'm Ryan.

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:22.950
&gt;&gt;Chris: Hi Ryan.

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:25.740
&gt;&gt;audience #3: Speaking of families, I was
curious what your upbringing was like that

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.919
pushed you into this obsession with nonconformity?

00:33:28.919 --> 00:33:36.309
&gt;&gt;Chris: About my upbringing. Well, I had
a split family, like a lot of people do. And

00:33:36.309 --> 00:33:41.340
so, I had basically two sets of families I
was growing up with and my mom was married

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:46.631
to a guy in the Air Force, so we moved around
a lot. I lived in the Philippines for a couple

00:33:46.631 --> 00:33:51.160
of years as a child, which I didn't enjoy
so much as a kid. I was like, six to nine

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:54.039
growing up and I was separated from my dad,
who was back in the States. So I didn't enjoy

00:33:54.039 --> 00:33:59.139
that so much then, but I think in the long-term
it was good; a good, cross-cultural experience.

00:33:59.139 --> 00:34:03.210
And then, I wasn't a very good student. I'm
actually a high school dropout. I talk about

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:06.409
that in the book. I went to one year of high
school and then just left and I ended up going

00:34:06.409 --> 00:34:14.780
to college after that. So, I guess in some
ways I had privileges and other ways, I was

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:18.191
kind of a rebel, or anti-authoritarian in
some ways.

00:34:18.191 --> 00:34:20.359
&gt;&gt;audience #3: Cool. Thanks.

00:34:20.359 --> 00:34:21.990
&gt;&gt;Chris: Thanks, man.

00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:29.149
&gt;&gt;Male audience #4: Let me start with this
one. What sort of mental techniques do you

00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:39.890
use to try to quelch risk-aversion? So, if
you're going on a trip around the world and

00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:45.790
you've got this stuff in your backpack and
this amount of money in the bank, there's

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:53.240
certainly scenarios that you could get yourself
in trouble. So, you or other people that you've

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:58.400
read, what sort of techniques do you use to
say, "I'm really ready to do this, I'm as

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.380
safe as I can be. Let's just go for it."

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:02.230
&gt;&gt;Chris: That's a great question. What was
your name?

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:03.230
&gt;&gt;audience #4: Jeremy.

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:07.220
&gt;&gt;Chris: Jeremy thanks. That was awesome.
I don't know if I have any mental techniques,

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:14.780
but I guess what I try to do and what I encourage
people to do is think about risk differently,

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:21.700
and maybe redefine risk a little bit. So,
the example of travel; this comes up a lot.

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:27.290
People always ask me about dangerous countries
and bad things that have happened and aren't

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:31.950
you scared, etc. And I always point out that
there are some dangerous countries in the

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:37.140
world, yes. But the list is very, very small.
Basically, like five to ten countries in the

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:42.470
world that actually could be called dangerous
and there's 180 countries which are totally

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:47.750
fine. So, I also say the more you do something,
then the more comfortable you become. When

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:52.510
the risk comes about, or the feeling of risk,
the fear, usually comes about when we haven't

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:56.630
done something and we're thinking about doing
something, but we don't know what it’s like.

00:35:56.630 --> 00:36:01.790
Once we get the experience, we look back and
say, "Oh, maybe not so much." The other thing

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:10.819
I would say about risk is, in terms of entrepreneurships,
small business, working for companies; traditionally

00:36:10.819 --> 00:36:16.610
security has been defined as working for a
company. And entrepreneurship is seen as the

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:21.180
risky alternative and entrepreneurs take risks.
Therefore, they are rewarded for their risk,

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:27.550
or they might fail. And I think a lot of what's
happened over the past few years has redefined

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:30.970
that. And I think a lot of beliefs have been
questioned. We used to have the belief that

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:34.340
the stock market is always going to go up.
We used to have the belief that homeownership

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:39.240
is the best choice for everyone. And, I think,
more and more people are looking at that and

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:45.330
saying, "What is risk? And what is security?"
In my case, I think it would be risky for

00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:50.630
me to have a job. I think working for myself
is the less risky, I think it’s the safe,

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:56.619
conservative choice. So, people often talk
about risk in the sense of starting a business,

00:36:56.619 --> 00:37:01.850
but it can actually be a very safe choice.
So, I like to think about risk and think about

00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:03.960
what the real risk is and maybe redefine it.

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:11.730
&gt;&gt;Male audience #5: Hi, Chris. My name is
Dan. I'm interested because a lot of bloggers

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:17.750
that I read, who have this sort of message
like do your own thing, like live your own

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:23.690
life, tend to make money from their blogs
or an associated online business. And, obviously,

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:25.190
you're doing some of that.

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:27.150
&gt;&gt;Chris: Sure.

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:32.971
&gt;&gt;audience #5: But you've done some other
things. Like, you mentioned the coffee importing

00:37:32.971 --> 00:37:34.560
business and designing and stuff. So I'm not
gonna ask what job should you do if you're

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:39.770
interested in this, but I'm interested in
what kind of feeling you get when you do these

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:44.079
sort of jobs and what is it that makes you
think, like what's the kind of feeling you

00:37:44.079 --> 00:37:46.500
get when you're like, "Oh, i should keep doing
this. This is going well," versus, "I should

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.130
drop this and try something different."

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:52.960
&gt;&gt;Chris: OK, good, so a couple different questions
there. I would say in terms of the feeling

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:55.329
I get, and maybe you're asking what motivates
me, or what--

00:37:55.329 --> 00:37:56.329
&gt;&gt;audience #6: Yeah, yeah.

00:37:56.329 --> 00:38:01.069
&gt;&gt;Chris: Where do I find encouragement? I
would say the encouragement is mostly through

00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:05.380
the daily engagement with what I call the
small army of remarkable people. You know,

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:11.420
so the people who are a part of the community,
both online and offline. So, every day I get

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:15.410
a lot of emails, just like all of you do.
And many of the emails are people talking

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:19.910
about sharing their own story and sharing
what they’re doing that's unconventional,

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:23.730
different, and how they're overcoming pressure
and how our lives are connected. And I find

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:30.240
that very motivating. I find that very encouraging
and as I said earlier, inspiring to me. Now

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:36.869
as to what other should do, I mean, that's
a big, broad question. I guess I always think

00:38:36.869 --> 00:38:42.130
a couple of things. One, I think it’s very
difficult to do something on a long term basis

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:48.340
that you're not motivated to do. I think it’s
much easier to do what you're motivated to

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:52.480
do as opposed to trying to motivate yourself
into something. We all have things we have

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:57.460
to do, like suck it up, get it done, but I
think if that's your career, then that's very

00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:03.220
difficult. So as much as possible, again,
for those of us in a relatively privileged

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:09.940
setting, as much as possible, I think it’s
good to forge your life and your career around

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:14.140
things that you're motivated to do and things
you're excited about. And in terms of blogging,

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:18.340
whether you want to have a commercially successful
bog or just a blog that's popular or just

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:23.520
a blog that a few people read, the question
to answer is always, "Why should other people

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:27.920
care about this, and what's in it for them?"
And what are their needs and how are you providing

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:32.981
a solution their needs? And if you do that,
then people will be interested in it. If not,

00:39:32.981 --> 00:39:36.869
probably not so much. And did you wanna have
a follow-up?

00:39:36.869 --> 00:39:41.369
&gt;&gt;audience #5: I just, you know, sorry. I
guess it's kind of a vague question, but I'm

00:39:41.369 --> 00:39:44.930
most interested in the motivation thing. Like,
when you start something new, is there a lot

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:48.550
of well, I gotta push through and do this
grunt work and that grunt work until I get

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:52.839
there? Or do you find that when you find a
groove, you really hit it and you're motivated

00:39:52.839 --> 00:39:54.099
from the start?

00:39:54.099 --> 00:39:58.470
&gt;&gt;Chris: For the most part, I enjoy almost
everything I do. For the most part, I enjoy

00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:05.329
the process of creating; I enjoy the process
of responding. I guess, again with the motivation,

00:40:05.329 --> 00:40:10.550
what I'm interested in at this point is influence
and how can we grow the community in a scalable

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:17.150
way, that makes sense and is appropriate,
not too fast, not too slow. But for the most

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:21.490
part, I love what I do. I mean, I have a great
life. I'm very grateful. Thanks.

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:28.500
&gt;&gt;Female audience #2: I'm Jen. I was wondering
if you have any advice on how to know when

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:33.440
to let a project go and how to do so without
feeling guilty? I've been writing a blog for

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:42.480
a few years and I have a few hundred followers.
I don't want to let them down, but I'm not

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:47.240
gathering as much fulfillment from writing
the blog anymore. But I continue to do it

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.559
out of not letting them down.

00:40:48.559 --> 00:40:51.940
&gt;&gt;Chris: You do it out of obligation?

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:53.230
&gt;&gt;audience #2: Yeah.

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:59.690
&gt;&gt;Chris: OK. Well, have you considered maybe
having a dialogue with those readers or followers

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:04.520
and maybe just expressing your feelings? I
mean, this is something that's actually, blog

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:11.069
readers respond very well to expressions of
your personal motivation and what you're feeling

00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:17.130
in terms of fulfillment. So, it’s almost
a kind of thing where if I felt that situation,

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:22.020
I would try to think a bit myself and think,
"OK, why am I feeling this way? I was excited

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:27.610
about this before, but something changed.
What changed? Is there a way that we can recreate

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:31.100
what I had before, or is it just time to move
on and do something else?" And if that's the

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:37.940
case, then that's fine. But it may also be
helpful to, instead of just focusing inwardly,

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:43.260
one question that people always ask when you're
trying to figure out what to do, a lot of

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:47.280
life coaches encourage people to ask themselves
the question, "What excites you?" So I think

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:49.900
that's good. I think it's good, but I think
it's only a good start. So, I think you think

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:54.380
about what excites you, but also what bothers
you. What bothers you about the world and

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:58.240
so, that's a little bit more of an external
focus. So, in this case, maybe having a dialogue

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:03.020
with the readers of the community, and just
sharing what you just shared and saying, “I

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.290
was really excited about this for a while,
but now some things have changed in my life,

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:10.599
or maybe I'm motivated by different things.
What do you think about that? And I think

00:42:10.599 --> 00:42:15.730
I might change the project entirely, or I
might start a new one, but let's have a conversation

00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:17.130
about it."

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:24.619
&gt;&gt;Male audience #6: Hi, Chris. I'm wondering
what advice would you give for gaining the

00:42:24.619 --> 00:42:33.819
understanding of families in our pursuits
of nonconformity, or just motivation and happiness.

00:42:33.819 --> 00:42:41.560
I'm speaking particularly to living in a different
place, travelling abroad, what is a good balance

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:47.140
and how do we achieve it between being happy
with our lives and getting other people to

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:48.650
understand that we're happy with our lives?

00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:52.020
&gt;&gt;Chris: Right. That's a very good question.
And maybe we should actually end with this

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:55.990
question and them I'm gonna hang out in the
back for anybody who wants to talk or sign

00:42:55.990 --> 00:43:00.820
a book. There's a number of things we could
say about that. I guess when we talk about

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:05.720
resistance and pressure to conform it often
comes from family or close friends who don't

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:11.410
understand why we want to do something. And
I think often, what is the case, especially

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:15.720
in terms of travel or living somewhere else,
like you mentioned, I think there's a fear

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:20.560
that you're gonna leave and never come back.
And so, sometimes it’s an irrational fear,

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:25.120
or it’s a fear that something is going to
be different or changed. And so, sometimes

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:29.650
it helps just to do something, or to go on
a trip or whatever and then you come back

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:36.470
and the people say, "Oh, OK. He went away
and then he came back and he's still the person,

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:41.110
the son, the brother, the husband, the partner,
or whoever, that I knew before." And so, I

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:47.530
would say in many cases, people just get used
to things over time. If you spend your life

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:52.560
trying to persuade them, trying to persuade
people to go along, you may be successful,

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:58.020
but you could spend years doing that. Or,
you could just step out a little bit and then

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:01.839
hopefully people will adjust. And often, that
fear comes out of, that resistance, comes

00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:06.400
out of fear and envy or jealousy. Or maybe
people wanna do something themselves, but

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:11.430
they haven't been able to or they don't see
how they can do it. So, what's fun is by doing

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:15.810
that, by actually stepping out and pursuing
whatever the unconventional choice is. In

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:21.609
your case, what's fun is that you can then
be an inspiration to them. And they're not

00:44:21.609 --> 00:44:26.369
going to read books about nonconformity. They
don't read blogs, but they know you and your

00:44:26.369 --> 00:44:29.640
part of their lives. So, if you've done that,
then you're an inspiration and hopefully maybe

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:37.839
they'll take a step as well. I could say a
lot more about that, but I think our time

00:44:37.839 --> 00:44:42.950
is up here, unless there's one more question.
Jenny, did you wanna say anything else? That's

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:46.890
good. You guys are awesome. Thank you so much
for having me. I'm gonna be at Rocket Room

00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:49.310
in San Francisco tonight at 7 pm. Thank you.

00:44:49.310 --> 00:44:49.459
