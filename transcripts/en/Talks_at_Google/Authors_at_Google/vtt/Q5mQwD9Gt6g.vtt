&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Good afternoon everyone,
authors at Google New York is please today

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.920
to welcome Howard Friedman.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.450
Howard Friedman is a statistician, health
economist, writer and artist currently employed

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:29.350
at the United Nations Population Fund and
as an adjunct associate professor at Columbia

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.350
University.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.680
He is here with us today to discuss his latest
book, "The Measure of a Nation: How to Regain

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.980
America's Competitive Edge and Boost Our Global
Standing".

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.510
He has a Masters in Statistics and a PhD in
Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.510
University.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.920
Please welcome Howard Friedman.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.920
[applause]

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.089
&gt;&gt;Howard Friedman: Well, thank you very much
for coming and thank you Google for hosting

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:55.089
today.

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:00.119
I appreciate the opportunity to talk with
everybody.

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:05.299
The book itself is based on this premise of
competitive intelligence and I think people

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.850
at Google are well aware of the idea of competitive
intelligence.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.470
Using data to compare yourself to other, in
your case, companies.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.050
I'm sure there's a lot analysis that goes
on here looking at other competitors in the

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.350
search space or advertising or in the social
media space.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.720
So it's a very common business practice.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.480
What's not so common is for the United States
to use the same principles to compare themselves

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.500
to other countries, see how they're doing
and then use that data to identify opportunities

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.550
for improvement as well as to identify areas
where they're excelling and they can leverage

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.060
their advantages.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.500
So, the premise behind the book is taking
that basic concept that's used regularly in

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.220
the business world and applying it to the
political space.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.810
Seems straight forward, of course there's
going to be some challenges.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.940
At the end of my talk, I'm gonna explain what
are some of the key challenges, but before

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.420
we even get to that it's worth putting one
thing on the table right away, which is the

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.390
whole idea of American exceptionalism.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.690
The first objection that a lot of people had
to the idea of using competitive intelligence

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:29.150
for the United States, is simply the idea
that America can't be compared to any country.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.450
That we're exceptional, so different that
there's nothing to be learned from the rest

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.670
of the world.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.520
Now, obviously that's a very problematic attitude.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.880
It's an attitude that rests in the idea of
blissful ignorance, it prevents you from learning

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.730
and it doesn't just seem arrogant, it is arrogant.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.660
So, this whole idea of American exceptionalism
and removing ourselves from the ability to

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.250
compare to other counties, we're just going
to have to take that and put it away, because

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.319
that defeats the whole opportunity for learning.

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:10.680
With that said, we then want to ask ourselves
the question of competitive intelligence,

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.850
who are we competing against?

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.180
And that's when we do have to recognize that
the United States is different from other

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.790
wealthy countries, in some respects.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.220
There is no other wealthy country that has
the size population of the United States.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.600
If you look at other countries that have large
populations, they're not as wealthy.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.770
And other wealthy countries aren't as populace.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.300
We have to accept that as just the reality
of the number of data points that exist for

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.850
countries.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.200
None the less what we did for the book is
identify wealthy countries, that is those

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.620
who had a GDP per capita of over twenty thousand,
and large in the sense of having a population

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.600
of over 10 million.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.730
The ten million threshold selects the 1/3
largest countries by population and it also

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.910
requires that country to have a population
larger than New York City, our largest city.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.900
It's not perfect, but it’s a good enough
criteria to allow us to do the rest of the

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.090
conversation, to examine these other countries.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.459
So we have that identified, and after we pass
through those two filters what we find is

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.280
there are fourteen countries remaining that
have data.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.150
The fourteen countries generally are populated
in Western Europe.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:38.310
Additionally there's Canada, The United States,
South Korea, Japan and Australia.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.259
Intuitively these are the countries that you
would expect to compare to the United States

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:52.620
because they have similar levels of socio-economic
quality, they have similar abilities for infrastructure.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.759
So we have our competition, but then what
are we comparing with?

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.330
What are the factors we're looking at?

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:08.229
In the book I focused on a few areas; health,
education, safety, democracy and equality.

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.889
Those five areas, why those five?

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:15.289
Well first they are fundamental to having
a successful society.

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:21.009
They're critical, they overlap with a lot
of the key areas in social science that have

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:23.599
been built on the idea of societies.

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:28.860
From Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs to Amartya
Sen's models.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.400
More importantly, from my perspective, and
I think everyone here at Google could appreciate

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.509
it, there's data.

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:40.590
And it's generally very rich data so we can
analyze it and drawn conclusions versus picking

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.729
subjects where it's not quantified.

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:49.060
So we have those five subjects, in today's
discussion I'm going to focus on three of

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.060
them.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.029
I'm not going to spend too much time on health.

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:56.600
I think people have heard so much about it
between the Patient Protection and Affordable

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.139
Care Act discussion and some of the key facts
that have been already discussed very much

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:02.610
in the media.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:08.319
And safety's been so much out and about, especially
the last few weeks with the unfortunate shooting.

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:12.629
So I'm going to mention a few quick facts
about that and then I'm going to move to the

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:16.699
other three topics, which I think are going
to be very interesting and we'll see how they're

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:19.569
all interconnected.

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:24.419
The whole basis of the book uses three principles
which are fairly straight forward.

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:29.629
The first one is, if you compare the United
States to other wealthy countries, we're quite

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:30.629
different.

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:35.740
Now that's an obvious statement, one that
anyone who's traveled outside the United States

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.020
has probably come to appreciate.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.699
But many Americans don't travel outside the
United States and so they don't recognize

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:44.169
how different we are.

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:47.749
From a quantifiable point of view, it's not
just that we're different, but the second

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:50.139
point is, we're not always the best.

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:54.020
And then the third point, which is pretty
logical from the first two, is and when we're

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.979
not always the best, let's see what we can
learn from other countries.

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:03.309
So three basic principles, with that in mind,
I'm going to introduce just a couple quick

00:07:03.309 --> 00:07:08.679
facts for you in health and safety and then
I'm going to focus on the other topics.

00:07:08.679 --> 00:07:14.509
So in health the key fact that I would want
people to walk away from is just the idea

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:21.779
that the United States spends two to sometimes
five times more on health than other wealthy

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:25.909
countries and we have the lowest life expectancy.

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:31.970
So we're spending far more and our primary
outcome for health, which is life or death,

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:32.970
we do the worst on.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.550
So we have a terrible return on investment.

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.059
We're gonna take that fact, we're gonna just
put it aside.

00:07:38.059 --> 00:07:40.339
We might come back to it, we might not.

00:07:40.339 --> 00:07:44.409
Safety, I'm gonna introduce just a couple
quick facts and then we'll move on to the

00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:46.289
other topics.

00:07:46.289 --> 00:07:51.770
For safety, key things to keep in mind about
the United States is, we're a much more dangerous

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:56.479
country than the competitors, than these other
wealthy countries.

00:07:56.479 --> 00:08:03.520
Our murder rate is more than twice and in
some cases, ten times more than the other

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.189
countries that I compared with.

00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:09.759
These other wealthy countries are much safer
in the sense that you're far less likely to

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:11.459
be murdered.

00:08:11.459 --> 00:08:18.729
And then the flip side of the whole idea of
risk, is then the question of incarceration.

00:08:18.729 --> 00:08:25.270
And in incarceration we see a similar difference
in that we see the United States incarcerates

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:30.629
roughly three and sometimes ten times more
than other countries.

00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:34.870
An incredible incarceration rate, one that
is almost at the same scale that the Soviet

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.580
Union had during the Gulag days.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:43.270
So we have this very different world in the
United States with regard to our internal

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:44.590
safety.

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:48.220
Let's take those facts and put them aside
for now, and let's focus on the other three

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:54.950
topics that I think are really interesting;
democracy, education and equality.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.940
First I'll talk a little about democracy because
of course we have the excitement of the upcoming

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.740
Presidential elections.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:06.890
When we think about democracy, there's lots
of ways you can compare two different democracies.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:14.550
One of the most common ways you do it is you
look at the question of competition and participation.

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:20.190
Competition refers to not just how competitive
are the elections, but also people's ability

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:24.280
to voice themselves in government.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.960
And then of course the participation is very
simple, that's voter turnout.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:33.590
When you combine those metrics, what you find
is that the United States does very poorly.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:38.930
We have the lowest voter turnout of any of
the comparative countries.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.530
Now that alone is a symptom of a democracy
in trouble.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:47.010
Besides the voter turnout being so low, we
have another situation.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:53.440
The situation is, our structure of elections
is very different from other wealthy countries.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:58.190
Let me explain that a little bit, what we
have in many of our elections is called a

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:00.870
single seat, winner take all election.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:05.370
Let's say you're voting for someone who's
in the House of Representatives, you have

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:10.270
your vote, whether you're a Democrat, Republican,
Libertarian, Green Party whichever party you're

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:15.290
from and you choose to vote for your candidate,
the candidate that gets the highest percent

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:17.900
of votes goes to Washington.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:24.630
Meanwhile, everyone who voted for another
party, their vote basically got ignored.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.260
What do you have in the rest of the world?

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:31.710
Well, 38 of the 41 largest democracies in
the world use proportional representation.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:38.210
A very simple idea, let the distribution of
representatives, the parties that are represented,

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.020
reflect the voting distribution.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:47.380
So if 40% of the people voted Democrat and
45 voted Republican and five voted Libertarian,

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:52.460
then the representatives would be that same
distribution.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.520
Why is this a big deal?

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:59.350
It's a huge deal, it's a huge deal because
with this single seat winner take all method

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:05.430
that we use and almost no other country generally
uses, we have a few problems.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:11.100
We have the problem of gerrymandering, we
create these very strange diagrams of what

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:15.350
a county looks like and then that seeks to
isolate.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:20.450
It minimizes the voices of other parties,
and it allows you to lock in seats.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:24.320
Gerrymandering leads to something else which
is extremism.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:29.020
Politicians who know that they are in a Republican
district or in a Democrat district know they

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.920
can be as radical as they want and get reelected.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.320
They don’t need to communicate to the entire
people who are in their district.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.830
They only need to communicate to their party.

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:42.370
And so it drives the parties farther and farther
apart.

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:44.980
There are lots of other issues as well.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:48.740
But from the point of view of competitive
intelligence, the key thing to recognize is

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:53.760
our method of electing officials is different
from what's done in most of the world.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.000
Not only is it different, but it's not so
good.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.130
So why do we have it?

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:02.070
Well, we developed our democracy more than
two hundred years ago.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:04.230
We were at the cutting edge.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.020
We were a leader in the world.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.030
But we haven't evolved our systems.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:12.320
The rest of the world has improved its technology
of voting.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:16.580
Whereas we're using basically the same system
from over two hundred years ago.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:20.280
The analogy in the Google world would be if
you were programming with punch cards.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.610
Wish ya luck.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:27.340
So moral of the story is, we have a system
that is antiquated and we're not updating

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.430
it using the latest technology for democracy.

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:32.460
And it's not such recent technology.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.720
This has been around for many many many decades.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.330
So we have that whole idea of proportional
representation.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:44.970
On other comparisons that are done, for instance
the World Bank does a nice comparison of democracies,

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:50.040
what they've seen is other countries such
as Australia rank very well.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.580
What does Australia do that's different from
the United States?

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.690
They have this great idea, it's called preferential
voting.

00:12:55.690 --> 00:13:00.500
Instead of going into the voting booth and
me picking my candidate, and let's say I do

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:05.230
like the idea of third party, in the United
States if I pick that third party I'm basically

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.980
throwing my vote in the garbage pail unfortunately.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.550
Because of that winner take all.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.180
In Australia, you rank order your candidates.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.600
This is my favorite, this is my second favorite,
this is my third favorite and you just go

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.300
down the list.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:23.460
If no candidate gets a majority, the candidate
who got the least amount of votes, they reallocate

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.850
based on what the second choices was.

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:28.870
And they keep doing that until a candidate
has a majority.

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:33.620
Makes perfect sense, works very well in Australia,
works in some other countries as well.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.960
The United States, we can adopt it.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:40.360
It's a great example of using a better method
of voting.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.480
So we have those two areas where we can improve.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:47.480
Of course we have the other thing we have
to keep in mind, the United States is the

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.420
only country that has two steps.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.500
Register, then vote.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:57.820
Most wealthy countries, the government takes
an active roll in making sure that anyone

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:02.710
who files taxes or has a driver's license
or does any involvement with the government

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:06.220
officially, is already preregistered to vote.

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.910
So you don't have this two-step process.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.610
Other countries are trying to enable their
voters.

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:16.400
Whereas we see there's a very active process
in the United States to keep people from being

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.610
able to vote.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:21.970
We're creating higher and higher bars for
people to jump over to vote.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:25.950
Whereas in other countries it's a much simpler
process for you to vote.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:29.000
And that impacts our voter turnout.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.660
Lastly on democracy, I'm just going to mention
two quick things, back to the idea of us using

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.740
an old system.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:38.950
The first thing that I want to mention is
there is no other wealthy country where if

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:43.460
you live in the capital, you don't get a voting
representative in Congress.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.410
This is only in the United States.

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:49.990
Washington DC residents, they have no voting
representative in Congress.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.060
Is there any logical reason for it?

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.400
Absolutely not.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:57.100
When they wrote the Constitution it wasn't
a perfect document.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.600
And there are things that had to be improved.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:04.460
In this particular case, what's preventing
DC from having a voting representative?

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.540
Partisan politics, nothing more.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:10.810
Meanwhile the rest of the world looks at the
United States on that particular issue and

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:16.029
they laugh, because we are telling the rest
of the world that we are a shining example

00:15:16.029 --> 00:15:20.660
of democracy yet citizens in our capital don't
even have a voting representative in their

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.350
legislation.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:25.960
The last thing I was going to mention is the
Electoral College.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:31.440
The Electoral College is a system that, well
let's just say has not been impersonated by

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.880
any other country in the world.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:39.230
Many countries have identified our separation
of powers as being an excellent idea and they've

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.910
adopted it to their usage.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:47.690
Many countries have admired the structure
of our Constitution, the way it was framed,

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:51.460
and they've modified it but they’ve used
that as a model.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:56.000
No country has looked at our Electoral College
and said that's a great idea, I've gotta take

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
it.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.240
And the reason why they don't do that is because
it's one of the most anti-democratic institutes

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.850
you could possibly imagine.

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:09.029
I'm just gonna mentioned two specific things
about it being highly undemocratic.

00:16:09.029 --> 00:16:12.900
The first one is we're here in New York.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:17.740
And if you're here in New York or California
or Texas, the number of representatives per

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:23.890
resident is much much lower than if you live
in a low population state, if you're in Wyoming

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:25.180
for instance.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:29.390
So when the Electoral College and in voting
for the President what that says is, people

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:36.370
in Wyoming are much more important than people
who live in New York or California or Texas.

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:40.210
It's not one person one vote, it's not even
close.

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:42.120
It's off by often a factor of three.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:46.680
Now that’s a huge disparity with no logical
justification.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.810
All you need to do is use the popular vote,
it's not complicated.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:53.090
Many countries do it, it's very straight forward.

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:56.970
And we do vote, so they could easily count
the popular vote.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:01.970
I don't actually expect that the Electoral
College is going to get torn apart anytime

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:02.970
soon.

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:05.370
So we’ll talk about a realistic solution
to that.

00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:10.470
But the other thing that's worth mentioning
is the Electoral College and its general process

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:15.430
of all or nothing voting is also what creates
this crazy system of swing states.

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.780
And think about a swing state for a second.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:25.579
In the 2008 election, the Obama campaign spent
roughly 20,000 dollars with advertising in

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:26.740
Illinois.

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:30.259
And they spent about 40 million in Pennsylvania.

00:17:30.259 --> 00:17:35.720
These states have roughly the same population;
they have exactly the same number of representatives.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:40.669
But if you lived in Illinois, he wasn’t
going to waste any money bothering to advertise

00:17:40.669 --> 00:17:42.530
or reach out to that state.

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:43.530
Why?

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:48.480
Because he knows he's going to quote unquote
win the state and then everyone in the state,

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:53.370
it'll appear as if they supported Obama, even
though a very large percentage didn’t.

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:59.240
Meanwhile, Pennsylvania, a swing state, those
citizens are much, much more important.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:03.651
And so depending on where you happen to have
registered to say that you're living, you're

00:18:03.651 --> 00:18:09.220
a much more important citizen or you basically
have no voice at all.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:15.770
So, we have these two symptoms, very obvious
symptoms, of a problem in our democracy.

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:19.100
With the Electoral College we're not going
to see it disappear anytime soon, but Maine

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.419
and Nebraska have already done a simple solution.

00:18:21.419 --> 00:18:25.100
They allocate their electors based on voting.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.789
They use proportional representation, trivial
idea.

00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:31.019
We don't have to have it all or none.

00:18:31.019 --> 00:18:32.249
It's not required.

00:18:32.249 --> 00:18:36.659
Every state could simply implement that rule
and you would not have disconnects between

00:18:36.659 --> 00:18:38.909
the popular vote and the electoral vote.

00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:40.049
Simple solution?

00:18:40.049 --> 00:18:43.920
Using that best practice of proportional representation.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:49.950
Let's take those ideas of democracy and put
them aside for now and let's focus on education.

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:54.759
Education is a really interesting topic because
it's another area where the data show very

00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:58.770
clearly that the United States was the world
leader.

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.049
And we've declined a lot.

00:19:00.049 --> 00:19:05.210
And when I say we used to be the world leader,
what I mean is we used to have the highest

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:08.690
rate of college education in the world.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.169
Now we're out of the top 15.

00:19:11.169 --> 00:19:19.159
We are an innovator in providing free primary
and secondary education to everyone.

00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:24.779
Universal access to it, an innovator in that
and with our GI bill, we really lead the forefront

00:19:24.779 --> 00:19:27.990
of encouraging people to go to college.

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:33.510
We've slipped behind and we can see that slipping
behind at all levels of education.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:40.049
Our rate of pre-primary school is average
to below average compared to other wealthy

00:19:40.049 --> 00:19:41.049
countries.

00:19:41.049 --> 00:19:45.450
And there's a huge disparity in who goes to
pre-primary education.

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:53.720
Children from middle class families have a
20% higher likelihood of going to pre-primary

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.799
school than children from poorer families.

00:19:56.799 --> 00:20:00.340
Twenty percent difference based on who your
parents are.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:06.010
So we see we're behind at the youngest levels
and that there's a huge gap.

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:08.700
As people age they reach high school.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:15.960
Our rate of secondary education graduation
went from 10% in the early 1900s to the seventy-ish

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.130
range.

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:18.130
And it did that around the 1970s.

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:22.779
And it's leveled off ever since, we have not
improved.

00:20:22.779 --> 00:20:27.879
Compared other countries we have about an
average rate of secondary school graduation.

00:20:27.879 --> 00:20:30.779
But what about the quality of the education?

00:20:30.779 --> 00:20:35.169
There's these great cross-country exams, there's
PISA, there's PiMs.

00:20:35.169 --> 00:20:40.070
And if you look at some of these cross-country
exams it tells us that the United States,

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:45.350
on areas of science and math, for instance,
tend to do slightly below average.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:50.860
The top countries, countries like Korea, Japan,
and Canada, do extremely well, the United

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.820
States somewhere around here.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.450
But then we get these disparities.

00:20:55.450 --> 00:21:00.019
Children from wealthier neighborhoods do extremely
well on these exams; in fact they would out

00:21:00.019 --> 00:21:02.409
perform any country.

00:21:02.409 --> 00:21:07.779
Whereas children from poorer neighborhoods
do much worse than any of the wealthy countries.

00:21:07.779 --> 00:21:13.570
This separation based on the wealth of your
family is a very important factor.

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:20.470
Now that would be true in any country but,
the relationship between how well you do on

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:27.509
these high school exams and the social-economic
class of your family is more important in

00:21:27.509 --> 00:21:30.260
the United States than any other wealthy country.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:35.539
They've looked at the relationship between
socio-economic class and performance on these

00:21:35.539 --> 00:21:41.350
PISA scores, and what they see is that the
United States has a far higher dependence

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:44.239
than any other country taking the exam.

00:21:44.239 --> 00:21:48.999
That's a problem we're gonna get back to when
we start talking about equality.

00:21:48.999 --> 00:21:53.940
Going further up, we see tertiary education
we have an above average rate and we'd like

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.799
to continue to do that.

00:21:55.799 --> 00:21:57.600
Now it's not all bad.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.769
We do have a real wonderful competitive advantage
in the United States.

00:22:00.769 --> 00:22:07.480
We have some of the highest quality colleges,
universities and graduate schools in the world.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.549
It's a competitive advantage and we need to
keep that competitive advantage in the back

00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:16.009
of our minds, because we need to leverage
competitive advantages and at the same time

00:22:16.009 --> 00:22:20.480
correct for issues that are going on in other
parts of society.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:25.320
Let's take that excellence for a second from
Korea and drill down into it.

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:30.970
The data's very consistent; Korea does outstanding
in education from the high school level to

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:33.860
the tertiary education level.

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:37.480
So what are the things that they are doing
in Korea that we could learn from?

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:41.720
Well let's start with the basics, number of
days of school in the United States?

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:46.519
We don’t have a national requirement, it's
state level but there's a huge variation and

00:22:46.519 --> 00:22:53.200
we roughly spend about 180 days of school,
at primary and secondary level.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.650
In South Korea, 220 days.

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:59.899
Roughly 40 days more of school.

00:22:59.899 --> 00:23:02.480
In 40 more days of school, you could learn
a lot.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:06.190
But additionally it's the structure of when
you take your time off.

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:11.610
They don't have that incredibly long summer
break, where we all remember, or we all recall

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:16.549
forgetting everything we had learned up to
May/June and then showed up back at September

00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:18.470
and you had to catch up.

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:22.230
So the length of school year, that's just
an obvious example and there's a very strong

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:28.330
correlation, over 85%, between length of school
and the score of these cross-country exams.

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:34.289
So increasing the length of school, a very
obvious step but not a silver bullet.

00:23:34.289 --> 00:23:38.259
What's more important is focusing on the strategy
that they've used in Korea, that's worked

00:23:38.259 --> 00:23:39.899
very well.

00:23:39.899 --> 00:23:44.919
They recruit the top students to become primary
school teachers.

00:23:44.919 --> 00:23:50.330
Only the top students are eligible to do that
very important role in society.

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:52.990
And then they get paid very well.

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:57.759
Primary school teachers in South Korea get
paid roughly twice the GDP per capita.

00:23:57.759 --> 00:24:01.489
In the United States, roughly GDP per capita.

00:24:01.489 --> 00:24:06.990
So in South Korea, it's a well-paid position,
very selective who can get into it.

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:12.570
They also add a lot of ongoing job training
to improve the skill set.

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:17.649
So they invest in their teachers, and they
have very low turnover rates, roughly 1% per

00:24:17.649 --> 00:24:18.649
year.

00:24:18.649 --> 00:24:20.230
The United States?

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:25.830
Unfortunately these days, roughly half the
people who go into education graduated from

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:27.780
the bottom third of their class.

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.789
We don't pay teachers well.

00:24:29.789 --> 00:24:31.429
Roughly GDP per capita.

00:24:31.429 --> 00:24:36.779
If you go back, about 40 years ago, we used
to give it a much higher rate.

00:24:36.779 --> 00:24:42.769
About 40 years ago in the United States we
paid roughly 175% of GDP per capita.

00:24:42.769 --> 00:24:47.250
Teachers used to be well paid and it used
to draw some of the top talent in the United

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:48.669
States.

00:24:48.669 --> 00:24:52.559
So here we're not drawing the top talent,
we're not paying them well, it doesn't get

00:24:52.559 --> 00:24:56.470
the prestige that it does in many other countries.

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:59.690
And our turnover rates, consequently, are
much higher.

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:04.059
The other thing to keep in mind is how we
fund our education.

00:25:04.059 --> 00:25:09.700
About 90% of the money for public education
in the United States comes from local sources.

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.369
That is, your local government, your state
government.

00:25:12.369 --> 00:25:14.629
The federal government has very little influence
on it.

00:25:14.629 --> 00:25:15.899
What does that mean?

00:25:15.899 --> 00:25:21.340
Well, it has a big, big difference because
if you grew up in a poorer neighborhood and

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:25.169
the money that's being raised for your school
is coming from your neighborhood, you have

00:25:25.169 --> 00:25:29.359
far less money per student than if you grew
up in a wealthier neighborhood in the United

00:25:29.359 --> 00:25:30.359
States.

00:25:30.359 --> 00:25:32.870
That disparity has huge implications.

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:37.299
The quality of the learning facilities are
worse, you have less availability of quality

00:25:37.299 --> 00:25:43.139
textbooks, computers and the salaries that
you pay teachers tends to be much lower.

00:25:43.139 --> 00:25:49.090
So the wealthier neighborhoods they have far
more money to spend on education, better learning

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:51.409
facilities, everything is quite strong there.

00:25:51.409 --> 00:25:55.340
And they draw the best teachers, the most
experienced teachers 'cause they pay more.

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:59.441
And the students who have to go to the poorer
schools, worse learning facilities, worse

00:25:59.441 --> 00:26:03.690
opportunities for learning and they end up
with usually the least experienced teachers.

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:09.340
A terrible cycle for students who already
started out with a lower rate of pre-primary

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:12.830
education and then their learning opportunities
are worse.

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:16.029
No Child Left Behind originally had two components
to it.

00:26:16.029 --> 00:26:20.700
One was this aggressive testing of students
to see how much they're learning.

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:26.370
The other one was an aggressive monitoring
of the students opportunity for learning.

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:31.080
The quality of the facilities of the education
that's available to them.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.450
They dropped one of them and that was a mistake.

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:36.389
They need to monitor both.

00:26:36.389 --> 00:26:41.220
Now, that last example I gave it's another
example where the United States is very different.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:46.869
Other countries there's a much stronger role
for the federal government in education, very

00:26:46.869 --> 00:26:49.950
much about equilibrating the opportunities.

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:52.559
And we see that there are certain advantages
to that.

00:26:52.559 --> 00:26:56.519
We have a separation of federal and state
powers and we're not going to get away from

00:26:56.519 --> 00:26:57.519
that.

00:26:57.519 --> 00:26:58.830
And I'm not advising that.

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:03.350
But all I am advising is, we should learn
from what goes in other countries in terms

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:07.200
of giving equality of opportunity.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.450
Children from the poorest neighborhoods should
not have the worst opportunities for learning.

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:14.919
They shouldn’t suffer because of the fact
that they grew up in a poorer neighborhood.

00:27:14.919 --> 00:27:19.669
We're gonna take all that information about
education and we're gonna put it aside for

00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:23.739
a second because it brings up the whole idea
of equality.

00:27:23.739 --> 00:27:30.450
We've seen it come up a few time already,
but it's gonna come up explicitly right now.

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:34.139
And when I say equality, there's so many ways
of measuring it.

00:27:34.139 --> 00:27:38.080
We have income inequality, we all know what
income is.

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.100
We have pretax, post-tax income.

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:45.940
And that's an outcome measure, when we talk
about income inequality, one of the things

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:51.129
that we'll see is that the United States has
a far higher rate of income inequality than

00:27:51.129 --> 00:27:53.149
other wealthy countries.

00:27:53.149 --> 00:28:00.210
Well, income over time, over years and over
generations leads to wealth.

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:06.309
And it's not surprising that knowing that
we have higher rates of both pretax and post

00:28:06.309 --> 00:28:11.109
adjustment income inequality that our wealth
inequality is also much higher than other

00:28:11.109 --> 00:28:13.120
wealthy countries.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.940
So we have those two.

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:19.950
We have the equality of opportunity, I'm gonna
spend a bit more time on that later.

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:23.980
And then lastly we have other factors like
gender equality.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:27.769
The opportunities for women, and there you
can measure it in many ways.

00:28:27.769 --> 00:28:32.220
In terms of economic opportunities we're about
average.

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:39.220
In terms of the political representation of
women in legislature, we're very far below

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.220
average.

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.710
We don’t have the same level of representation.

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:47.619
The UK had Margaret Thatcher, we've not had
a female President.

00:28:47.619 --> 00:28:53.799
Things like that, but we're gonna focus more
of the conversation on the equality of opportunity

00:28:53.799 --> 00:28:55.320
and income inequality.

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:59.690
To really drive home a point of disparity
between the United States and other countries

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:02.539
and decisions that we're making as a culture.

00:29:02.539 --> 00:29:08.029
If we go back to the idea of income inequality
for a second, what we've seen is that the

00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:12.720
inequality has increased over the past few
decades.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.269
The pretax and the post-tax.

00:29:16.269 --> 00:29:23.379
The pretax has increased for a number of reasons;
a lot of them are related to how we structure

00:29:23.379 --> 00:29:25.129
our corporations.

00:29:25.129 --> 00:29:30.369
How we pay executives, how we pay people in
finance.

00:29:30.369 --> 00:29:34.409
Our CEO to worker ratio is much much higher
than other countries.

00:29:34.409 --> 00:29:37.940
And it has exploded over the past few decades.

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:42.419
That explosion has corresponded at the same
time to a vast weakening in the strength of

00:29:42.419 --> 00:29:46.830
unions and a weakening in the voice of shareholders.

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:52.570
The owners of companies, shareholders, have
virtually no say on how much an executive

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:53.570
gets paid.

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:56.919
That's a very strange proposition of a business.

00:29:56.919 --> 00:29:58.870
And in many countries that's not true.

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:05.039
Germany for instance, there's a much stronger
voice that employees have in the compensation

00:30:05.039 --> 00:30:07.359
of everyone, including the executives.

00:30:07.359 --> 00:30:13.399
So you have a different structure and you
have less extremes of income.

00:30:13.399 --> 00:30:16.340
Now, you also have another factor that's playing
in.

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:23.679
A lot of people talk about the drive of globalization,
forcing higher rates of income inequality.

00:30:23.679 --> 00:30:30.350
And it's certainly a fact that income from
people who are doing manual labor, well that

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:33.460
could potentially now compete with people
from other countries.

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.389
And it could suppress those wages.

00:30:35.389 --> 00:30:40.940
But at the same time, you have not seen an
explosion in salary for people who have a

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:42.159
college degree.

00:30:42.159 --> 00:30:45.879
In fact, it's been completely stagnant for
30 years.

00:30:45.879 --> 00:30:53.330
Moreover, there are 4 of the thirteen comparative
countries saw an income equality increase,

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:54.879
not income inequality.

00:30:54.879 --> 00:30:56.840
It went to opposite direction.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:01.159
So for those people who say, well, this is
just a function of globalization and the United

00:31:01.159 --> 00:31:08.779
States as a society has no role to play in
the increasing inequality are just denying

00:31:08.779 --> 00:31:09.779
reality.

00:31:09.779 --> 00:31:12.889
If that were true, then every country would
have seen it go up.

00:31:12.889 --> 00:31:17.340
Rather, we have these changes in standards
and norms and our tax structure.

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:24.100
We have moved our tax structure to a point
where wealthy people often pay very little

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.100
in taxes.

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:29.470
It's not just the anecdotes that Warren Buffet
gives about him paying a lower rate than his

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:35.580
secretary, we all have the highly publicized
example of Mitt Romney making millions in

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:40.710
the last few years and paying a tax rate that
is certainly half or less than many people

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:42.749
in this room.

00:31:42.749 --> 00:31:47.570
So that's all in the income inequality, both
before and after adjustments.

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:52.139
But I really am interested in the equality
of opportunity.

00:31:52.139 --> 00:31:56.470
The equality of opportunity is something that
I take very personally because I grew up here

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:58.249
in the United States, of course.

00:31:58.249 --> 00:32:00.730
And we grew up with the American dream.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:05.639
The idea that no matter who you are, where
you came from, if you were talented, if you

00:32:05.639 --> 00:32:09.690
worked hard you could become anything you
wanted to be.

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:12.669
And that's still true, you can.

00:32:12.669 --> 00:32:20.590
But, the chances of you moving up, socioeconomically
in the United States turn out to be far less

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:22.539
than other wealthy countries.

00:32:22.539 --> 00:32:24.879
Now that’s a tremendous disconnect.

00:32:24.879 --> 00:32:31.090
It's a disconnect because intuitively Americans
grow up with the idea that we have more social

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:32.090
mobility.

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:36.749
We think of European countries as having very
class societies.

00:32:36.749 --> 00:32:40.109
We think we're very mobile socially.

00:32:40.109 --> 00:32:41.710
It's not true.

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:44.460
Here's some data to give you a feel for it.

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:50.710
If you look at quintiles, that is dividing
people up in to percentiles based on the wealth

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:58.071
of their family, the bottom 20% all the way
up to the top 20%, people who grew up in the

00:32:58.071 --> 00:33:05.090
United States in the lowest twenty percentile
of wealth, the chances of them moving out

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:08.960
of that lowest percentile, isn't very good.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:17.029
Forty-two percent, roughly, stay in that lowest
quintile, 58% roughly, leave.

00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:23.919
Well we expect that a certain percentage will
stay in the lowest quintile, just by definition.

00:33:23.919 --> 00:33:27.529
But that’s not a very good movement out
of that poorest range.

00:33:27.529 --> 00:33:28.919
What about in other countries?

00:33:28.919 --> 00:33:38.240
In other countries, roughly, high 20s to maybe
30% stay in the lowest and 70% or more leave.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:44.979
You're more stuck in the lowest quintile in
the United States than in other wealthy countries.

00:33:44.979 --> 00:33:49.840
And what about the true rags to riches story,
the Horatio Alger of going from the poorest

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.769
quintile to the wealthiest?

00:33:51.769 --> 00:33:57.989
The rate in the United States is lower than
in any other wealthy country that's been measured.

00:33:57.989 --> 00:34:03.799
We have less of chance of going from that
very poor beginning and becoming wealthy than

00:34:03.799 --> 00:34:06.759
if you grew up in other wealthy countries.

00:34:06.759 --> 00:34:12.440
Less social mobility, this completely contradicts
American intuition.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:18.649
They do these world value surveys, and in
these world value surveys Americans are far

00:34:18.649 --> 00:34:24.860
more likely to say that their country is a
meritocracy than people in other wealthy countries.

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:27.820
We have more confidence in that.

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:32.850
Americans are far more likely to believe that
people who are poor are poor because they

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:35.880
either did not try hard enough or lack of
talent.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:41.540
We blame people for not succeeding more than
other countries.

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:48.790
With that said, our perspective completely
is a disconnect from the reality of the data.

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:54.330
Believing that we have more social mobility
when in fact we have far less.

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:59.000
It's intimately related to our educational
system.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.650
The disparities in education, the person who
grew up in that poor neighborhood who had

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:09.150
a far less chance of going to pre-primary
school, which has been shown to be a strong

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:16.590
predictor of factors not just like long term
education but also affecting crime, all the

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:19.090
way up the quality of your high school education.

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:24.790
And the huge disparity, more dependent on
where you came from in terms of your score

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:29.550
on that high school exam than in other countries,
all the way up to the chances of you going

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:32.850
to college at every road along the way.

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:38.880
And college is a huge factor in moving from
poor to a wealthier area.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:47.170
Of the people who started in the poorest quintile,
if you got a college degree, only 16% stayed

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:51.610
there,1-6, that is vast, vast majority get
out.

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:57.260
If you don’t get that college degree, nearly
50% will be right back in that same quintile.

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:59.420
Intergenerational poverty.

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:02.380
So education really is a critical factor.

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:07.370
And fixing the issues with education, public
education, from the lowest levels all the

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:11.020
way up is the best way to start addressing
it.

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:15.570
But it's not just education, I want to leave
you with a key thought in this area of equality

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:21.390
which is, there are still racial inequalities,
there are still gender inequalities that will

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:26.910
exist even if we correct for many of the issues
regarding education.

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:31.630
And the area with racial inequality, here's
a powerful fact.

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:36.320
An African American and a Caucasian American
who both have finished high school, the Caucasian

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:41.060
American earns roughly 25% more.

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:46.630
African American and a Caucasian American
both have finished a college degree, Caucasian

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:51.930
American earns roughly 25% more.

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:57.310
African American, Caucasian American both
have finished Masters degrees, Caucasian American

00:36:57.310 --> 00:37:00.640
earns roughly 25% more.

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:04.840
So education will certainly help, but we still
have some pretty clear disparities that we

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:07.160
need to address as well.

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:12.340
Now I've taken you with a little bit of a
drop into health and a little drop into safety,

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:17.180
we've talked a lot about democracy, talked
a lot about education, talked a lot about

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:18.940
equality.

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:24.580
We've seen that the United States has areas
where it needs to improve, areas where it

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:27.480
used to be the best and it slipped off.

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:32.890
Education, we used to be one of the best educated
work forces in the world.

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:35.520
And we're declining.

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:40.850
In health, we used to have one of the top
10 life expectancies in the world, we're far

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:42.430
out of the top 10 now.

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:45.530
For health, we've comparatively declined.

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:49.790
Safety, we've always been a dangerous country,
much more so than other countries.

00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:52.130
And we continue to be so to this day.

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:56.390
But our incarceration rate has exploded, it's
three to four times more than it was in the

00:37:56.390 --> 00:38:02.500
'70s and that explosion has been based on
many of the laws that have been passed.

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:08.760
In other areas, in democracy, we were a leader,
we were an innovator with our Constitution,

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:13.550
with our Declaration of Independence, we created
modern representative democracies that led

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:14.550
the world.

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:19.580
But we haven't learned lessons that the other
world has learned over the last couple hundred

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:20.580
years.

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:24.500
Better ways to vote, correcting errors in
our Constitution.

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.820
There are errors, we need to correct them.

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:33.140
Lastly, in equality, we have this painful
disconnect between our belief that we're a

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:40.130
wonderful meritocracy and the data which shows
very clearly that we're actually more stuck

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:44.660
in where you came from than in any other country.

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:51.560
Case in point for that last one is the fact
that in the United States, children from poor

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:56.860
families who are top performing students have
roughly the exact same chance of going to

00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:03.320
college than the children who are the worst
students from wealthy families.

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:07.810
Wealth, unfortunately is trumping talent right
now in the United States.

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:10.020
We need to correct that.

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:17.140
It's not all bad, we have competitive advantages,
we have areas that we can use as ways to improve.

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:22.200
We have some of the best colleges, universities
and graduate schools in the world.

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:26.320
And they draw top talent, they bring them
here.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.330
What do we need to do?

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:32.140
We need to come out with better ways to help
them stay.

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:35.060
Help them build the future of America.

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:39.640
I know Google knows very well this story so
I don’t have to retell it regarding your

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:45.110
founders, but that's the point about bringing
top talent in and enabling them to stay.

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:50.550
Besides our educational system at the tertiary
level which draws top talent, we have other

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:51.550
advantages.

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:56.630
We have some of the best research in the world,
not just in medical research but in technology

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:58.580
research as well.

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:04.011
Companies like Google leading the world and
drawing that top talent in.

00:40:04.011 --> 00:40:05.880
And we need to bring them in.

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:10.330
We also have one of the most friendly business
environments in the world.

00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:16.350
This is a great country to create a new company,
and we need to bring those innovators in,

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:21.770
those entrepreneurs, draw them and give them
an environment where they can stay.

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:25.510
Let's take those competitive advantages and
use them.

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:29.300
We have a tremendous amount of racial and
cultural diversity.

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:34.080
That's an advantage; it gives us opportunities
that many countries don’t have.

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:35.520
Let's use those.

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:39.700
So we have areas that we're lagging behind,
areas that we have fallen, where we used to

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:41.340
be the best.

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:44.730
And we have these wonderful competitive advantages,
we need to use them.

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:52.780
Well, sounds great, I've heard the data, I've
heard about these best practices, roll forward.

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:56.810
We have some barriers to implementation, just
gonna mention a few of them, the barriers

00:40:56.810 --> 00:41:00.730
to implementation include lack of awareness.

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:06.150
If you talked to most Americans, they will
not believe that we're not the best in health.

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:09.920
Yet when they were having all the discussions
about the Patient Protection and Affordable

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:15.490
Care Act, the phrase that kept being used
was, 'we have the best health care system

00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:17.880
out there'.

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:22.800
It's just not true, now we do have something
that’s the best, we have the best leading

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.290
edge health technology in the world.

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:27.560
We do have something that's great.

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:30.030
But our public health is not so good.

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:36.310
And you need to make sure people realize that,
educate them on where we're actually doing.

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:37.330
Show them the data.

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:42.850
You know, the book that I wrote, "Measure
of a Nation", it uses data that's easily publicly

00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:43.850
available.

00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:47.840
The links are there; you can connect right
to all the data and compare the United States.

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.420
You'll see in many areas we're not doing so
well.

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:53.540
So the first part is awareness and showing
the data.

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:57.730
The second barrier is complacency.

00:41:57.730 --> 00:42:00.040
Complacency takes many roles in the United
States.

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:03.670
We have the reality of we're, we're a wealthy
country.

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:06.850
We don’t generally have people starving
in the streets.

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:12.580
While our social supports are much lower than
other wealthy countries, and that's related

00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:18.510
to our belief, mistaken belief, in being a
meritocracy.

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:25.400
We have enough that people are not fighting
for survival and as result, you don’t see

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:29.200
the passion in the streets, the changes in
the United States.

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:34.340
The declining performance in our health system,
the declining performance in our education,

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:39.600
the declining effectiveness of our democracy
has been gradual.

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:43.160
And it's almost like the story of the frog
in the water.

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:47.780
It's a parable, I don’t believe it's actually
true, but it's the idea of putting the frog

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:49.990
in the water and turning on the heat.

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:53.590
And the frog will only notice when it's too
late, that the water's boiling because the

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:55.600
change is gradual.

00:42:55.600 --> 00:43:01.080
Now, that particular example rings a little
bit true for the United States because we

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:03.420
have not seen a switch being flipped.

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:06.730
We didn't go from having one of the longest
life expectancies in the world and then in

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:07.730
a year dropping.

00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:08.730
It was gradual.

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:12.530
We didn't go from having the highest rate
of tertiary education in the world to dropping

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:13.530
out of the top 10.

00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:14.580
It was gradual.

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:20.330
And our democracy did not lose its power to
represent over a scale of one or two years.

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:21.710
It's been gradual.

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:25.020
So, there's the complacency.

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:28.320
The other factors are democracy itself and
that’s why I spent some time talking about

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:32.450
how we are very different in how we implement
our democracy.

00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:36.730
Our democratic system prevents a lot of change.

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:42.170
And we've also seen in a lot of studies that
those who are coming from the poorest neighborhoods

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:45.420
have almost no influence on legislation.

00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:49.880
A lot of it's due to how we elect officials
as well as the influence of money in politics

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.360
in the United States.

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:54.990
That didn’t just start with Citizens United
but it certainly accelerated with Citizens

00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:56.370
United.

00:43:56.370 --> 00:44:01.740
So we have all of those influences, things
that are holding us back.

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:07.300
Our political system, complacency, lack of
awareness and the last factor I want to mention

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:12.560
is just the reality of our system has worked
very well for some groups.

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:17.270
Not just some companies who've done very well
because of our health system, the for-profit

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:20.450
world that isn't seen in other wealthy countries.

00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:24.300
It's not just our educational system where
many areas are benefiting while others are

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:25.400
suffering.

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:30.330
It's not just in safety where we have for-profit
prisons, not a norm, an exception for the

00:44:30.330 --> 00:44:32.050
rest of the world.

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:33.950
But also in our political system.

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:38.120
Our two party system works well if you're
in the two parties.

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:42.520
And if you fundamentally believe in those
two parties, but if you have a different opinion,

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:44.650
then you're not able to express it.

00:44:44.650 --> 00:44:49.680
The groups that have benefited from our current
system, they will defend their benefits.

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:53.960
So for those who want to make change, you
want to take that competitive intelligence,

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:58.450
that data, you wanna leverage that to see
can we apply some of things that are working

00:44:58.450 --> 00:45:00.480
well in other parts of the world?

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:04.400
Remember, you're gonna have to fight the fact
that there's a low awareness of data.

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:06.580
There's complacency.

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:11.390
There's the issues in our democracy itself
and lastly you're gonna have to push against

00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:15.450
those who are benefiting greatly from our
current system.

00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:18.160
With all that said, it's a fight worth having.

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:24.120
It's a fight worth having because we have
wonderful advantages here, we have great opportunities

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:29.010
to leverage those advantages and improve on
the areas that are not doing as well.

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:30.470
Why should we?

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:35.820
Very simple, because our country has been
great.

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:40.580
It deserves to continue to be great, not just
for the next year or two.

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:43.400
But for the 50 years, 100 years down the road.

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:46.720
We need to learn how to improve.

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:51.550
Imagine if Google decided tomorrow that they
would just stop studying the competitive landscape,

00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:54.900
they would just ignore everything that's going
out there.

00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:58.680
Any new developments in algorithms, let's
pay no attention to it.

00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:04.120
Any new types of search, any new innovations
that are going on in advertising or any of

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:09.080
those, if you decide to just ignore it, well
you wouldn't be around in too many years.

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:14.180
For the United States, we can't afford to
ignore the lessons that the rest of the world

00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:15.180
has learned.

00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:19.840
Rather, we need to learn them so that we can
continue to be great over a time scale of

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:20.840
50, 100 years.

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:21.840
Thank you very much.

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:22.840
[applause]

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:30.520
&gt;&gt;female presenter: The microphones are open
for questions, if anyone has questions.

00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:43.270
And the book is available for sale up here
for $5.

00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:49.070
[pause]
&gt;&gt;female Presenter: No questions?

00:46:49.070 --> 00:46:52.550
&gt;&gt;Howard Friedman: [laughs]

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:53.710
[pause]

00:46:53.710 --> 00:47:00.560
&gt;&gt;Male#1: I'm afraid this is more in the way
of a comment than a question.

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:04.920
Very little if anything of what you said was
new or news or a surprise.

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:10.150
Very little of it was unknown, I suspect to
most people in this audience.

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:14.510
There was one theme though, that I sort of
took out as a sort of undertone to your general

00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:20.520
presentation, that we don't know what's going
on in the rest of the world.

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:24.240
We don't know that everyone else has better
health care, that we don't, and therefore

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:25.240
that we don't have it.

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:28.410
That we don't know that everyone else has
better democracy and therefore we don’t

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:30.240
have it.

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:37.100
And while it may be true that many people
do not know these things, that’s not an

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:39.790
accident and I'm not convinced it's particularly
relevant.

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:46.160
The problem as you began to allude to toward
the end of your talk, is not that we are ignorant

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:50.220
about better systems or ignorant about the
problems that exist health care, in safety,

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:53.440
in democracy, in education and other areas.

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:58.620
The problem is that this really does, the
existing system in the United States, really

00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:02.770
does serve the interests of a small group
of people very well.

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:06.440
Generally the people in power and the people
with more money and continues do so and that

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:10.300
the system as it exists and as it continues
to change toward the direction of greater

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:14.690
inequality and so forth, serves the interests
of the people in power better.

00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:17.870
It's not an accident, it's not because we
don’t know.

00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:23.630
It's a deliberate process and a deliberate
effort to change things in these directions

00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:26.781
that you don’t like and I don’t like and
probably a lot of other people sitting in

00:48:26.781 --> 00:48:28.650
the audience today don’t like.

00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:35.550
And in particular when you talk about we or
the United States, as a group, you sort of

00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:40.040
blur the differences here that are really
at the heart of the issue.

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:44.460
Because the United States does not have a
problem, some people in the United States

00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:49.590
have a problem, maybe 80% of the people in
the United States have a big problem.

00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:53.120
And the question is not does the United States
have a problem, is it better or not.

00:48:53.120 --> 00:49:01.240
The question is why, how does the 80% organize
better to take more control and take more

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:07.750
power and take their appropriate share of
the resources from the 1%?

00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:12.630
You can't talk about we, you can't talk about
the United States as if it's one thing, because

00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:16.520
then you completely miss the real problem
and issue here.

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:18.750
&gt;&gt;Howard Friedman: So, thank you for the comment.

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:20.210
I very much appreciate it.

00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:23.250
I'm gonna counter point, since it wasn’t
a question.

00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:29.370
My counter points will be first, you're saying
that yes, everyone here in the Google audience

00:49:29.370 --> 00:49:32.670
is well aware of that information and it's
not just cause you have your laptops in front

00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:34.830
and you're checking the facts as I speak.

00:49:34.830 --> 00:49:41.510
It's, you are at one of the most selective
companies in the world, for recruiting.

00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:46.660
But I'm talking about a nation of 310+ million
people and the large percentage of Americans

00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:47.770
are not aware of these facts.

00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:53.970
And awareness is a major issue because ultimately
we do have voters and voters who are greater

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:58.300
aware are less likely, not perfectly unlikely,
to vote against their interests.

00:49:58.300 --> 00:49:59.300
So-

00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:01.870
&gt;&gt;male #1: -but awareness itself is not an
accident.

00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:05.860
&gt;&gt;Howard Friedman: So I'm going to continue
with my counter point.

00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:10.170
So there's 4 points that I raised and I agree
with you that awareness is 1 factor.

00:50:10.170 --> 00:50:11.920
And I listed 4 key barriers.

00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:13.660
The other one was complacency.

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:17.080
The other one was our political process, and
I think the there's a lot of agreement with

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:20.700
that, but we have to change a lot of the political
process itself.

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:23.640
The process of electing has to be changed.

00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:26.880
And then lastly, and that's the point I think
that you were emphasizing in agreement with

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:33.480
me on was that those who are benefiting are
going to continue to defend their benefits

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:35.200
and they'll continue to take more.

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:40.580
And I want to take your point a little bit
further, because I finished the speech talking

00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:44.940
about how to leverage our advantages and to
recognize our disadvantages.

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:48.020
I wanted to finish on kind of a positive on
purpose.

00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:53.300
I would like to tell you my book does that,
it doesn't quite.

00:50:53.300 --> 00:51:00.460
The book takes actually your exact point and
it says what if we don’t and if we don’t

00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:03.960
make changes right now, the trajectory is
very clear as well.

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.730
I wanna see these changes happen.

00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:11.570
I wanna see a United States that is robust,
not just for the 1 or 2 or 3% but for the

00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:12.780
entire country.

00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:16.790
On the other hand, if we don't, the trajectory
is very clear.

00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:20.970
I've spent a lot of time traveling around
the world, we will end up in a world that

00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:24.210
looks very much like Latin America or an oil
economy.

00:51:24.210 --> 00:51:28.060
Where a few percent of the population live
in gated communities.

00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:31.880
They have concierge physicians, they send
their children to private school.

00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:35.230
They do not interact with the rest of the
country.

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:39.470
And the rest of the country is doing their
best just to make ends meet.

00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:43.870
That's the long-term trajectory if we don't
correct, if we don’t make changes.

00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:47.500
I prefer to inspire people on the positive
than on the negative.

00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:53.220
As for the idea of using we, as in America,
it's a choice.

00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:59.321
I'm making a conscious choice to focus people,
in this case it's focusing Americans on the

00:51:59.321 --> 00:52:07.200
idea of a goal of greatness rather than aiming
at particular groups who are certainly trying

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:10.710
to steer a system to their own advantages
and away from others.

00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:15.780
So I'm making a conscious choice, but I don’t
disagree with your factual statement.

00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:17.530
How about that?

00:52:17.530 --> 00:52:18.780
Other questions?

00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:28.810
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Dr. Friedman, you spent a lot of
time talking about the different comparative

00:52:28.810 --> 00:52:33.830
benchmarks and ways to compare the United
States to other industrialized nations, for

00:52:33.830 --> 00:52:36.850
lack of a better term for myself.

00:52:36.850 --> 00:52:41.670
Taking that a step further, if there are other
countries, not to be specific but if there

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:45.690
are other comparators that have figured out
that the water was starting to boil and have

00:52:45.690 --> 00:52:50.640
made changes to their Constitutions, what
can we learn from that process?

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:55.990
Is it an Occupy Wall Street?

00:52:55.990 --> 00:53:02.190
Is it, not to divide the United States into
different groups but how do you go to the

00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:03.430
next meta-level.

00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:07.660
What's the sequel, what's the 2.0 of your
book in terms of, OK, if there are things

00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:11.510
to learn, and we agree to that, how do we
now make those changes?

00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:15.790
And I care less whether it's Constitutional
Amendments or any of that stuff, but from

00:53:15.790 --> 00:53:21.810
a process standpoint, how do we now learn
and actually do that based on what you've

00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:22.810
seen other nations.

00:53:22.810 --> 00:53:26.580
Because I have to believe the British Empire
figured a few things they needed to throw

00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:31.830
away, as did the Romans etcetera, what does
our Empire need to do based on your comparative

00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:32.830
analysis?

00:53:32.830 --> 00:53:36.640
&gt;&gt;Howard Friedman: OK, so I think we're focusing
this question more on the inequality, it's

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:37.940
tied to the first comment.

00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:43.020
So I'll stay away from the health and safety
and focus it on that particular point.

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:47.500
Well, you can look at other countries, you
can look at Brazil which is a middle income

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:48.500
country.

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:51.430
They made a conscious effort, they zeroed
in on this question, and they have made huge

00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:52.430
differences.

00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:54.420
But we can stay inside the United States.

00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:58.150
We saw this rise before, we had this.

00:53:58.150 --> 00:54:02.570
We had this at the late 1800s, early 1900s.

00:54:02.570 --> 00:54:07.060
This is where the robber baron era days came
from, and we had massive inequality that took

00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:08.060
off.

00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:09.350
And then we had a counter movement.

00:54:09.350 --> 00:54:11.570
First, there was Teddy Roosevelt with the
trust busting.

00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:16.680
He didn’t just go after the companies, he
also aggressively went after income inequality.

00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:20.400
It came back later, it came back in the Progressive
Movement.

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:22.010
And in the Progressive Movement, what did
they do?

00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:28.590
They instituted increases in the rates of
taxation so that it became a much more progressive

00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:33.510
tax system, they also made other legislative
changes.

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:34.960
How did those go about?

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:36.430
They were popular movements.

00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:38.320
The people have to care.

00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:40.050
For any of the change we're talking about.

00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:44.060
Whether we're talking about the health, the
safety or in this case, focusing on the issue

00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:47.230
of equality in opportunity.

00:54:47.230 --> 00:54:51.960
The people have to get out, they have to voice
their opinion, they have to make themselves

00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:53.150
heard.

00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:56.610
If they stay in their homes and they're complacent,
nothing will change.

00:54:56.610 --> 00:55:01.960
Now, our democracy, unfortunately right now
does not listen well to the voice of the people.

00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:05.160
But it does listen enough when millions are
out there in the streets.

00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:08.810
And that seems to be way America can move
forward.

00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:13.450
Because the legislative changes to change
how we vote, those take a long time.

00:55:13.450 --> 00:55:14.580
But people in the streets?

00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:16.060
There is responses to.

00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:21.150
Take the Tea Party on one hand, they had passion,
they created changes.

00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:25.370
Whether we agree or disagree with the direction
the changes, they did make changes.

00:55:25.370 --> 00:55:30.550
Occupy Wall Street, I'm surprised that they
didn't get more momentum and maybe they will

00:55:30.550 --> 00:55:32.560
come back in full swing in the fall.

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:37.060
But you need that passion, you need it at
the top of people's agenda in order to implement

00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:38.110
a difference.

00:55:38.110 --> 00:55:41.710
Simply having conversations starts the process.

00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:46.350
But pushing it further to people actively
protesting, that's how democracy changes.

00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:50.252
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: That's all we have time
for, thank you.

00:55:50.252 --> 00:55:51.600
&gt;&gt;Howard Friedman: Thank you very much.

00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:51.720
[applause]
