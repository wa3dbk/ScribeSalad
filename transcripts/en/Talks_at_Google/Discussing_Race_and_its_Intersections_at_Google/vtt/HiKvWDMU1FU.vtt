00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.664
- Please take a seat in the yellow chair.
- OK, the yellow one.

00:00:18.664 --> 00:00:23.077
We said the yellow one 
for Mr. Thuram, and the purple for Ritza.

00:00:29.327 --> 00:00:31.021
I think Mr. Thuram is impressed.

00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:32.644
You can tell?

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.374
- Can I call you Lilian?
- Yes, Lilian is fine.

00:00:35.374 --> 00:00:38.149
Yeah, I can call him Lilian,
I feel great.

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:39.644
That's made my day.

00:00:39.644 --> 00:00:41.976
Thank you so much for agreeing to do this.

00:00:41.976 --> 00:00:44.309
I was so thrilled to think

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.019
that I could write a message
on your foundation's website

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:48.949
and have a conversation
with Mr. Gauthier

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.329
your foundation's director

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:51.569
who is here with us today.

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:54.419
I am extremely honored and super stressed

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:56.099
I'll be honest

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:59.309
to interview you today,
and, really, very honored to discuss

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.309
the work that you've 
accomplished with the foundation.

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.309
So, thank you again.
And I'm going to begin

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.349
without further introduction

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:11.309
with why you set up this foundation.
What led you to set it up?

00:01:11.309 --> 00:01:15.279
Well, first off, hello.
It's always best to greet people.

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:17.309
- That's a good start.
- Exactly.

00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:21.789
In fact, it began

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.399
at a dinner, when I was a soccer
player in Barcelona in 2008.

00:01:27.104 --> 00:01:30.189
There was a man next to me,
a gentleman of a certain age.

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.589
He asked me questions, saying:

00:01:32.589 --> 00:01:35.309
"What are you 
going to do when you're older?"

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:38.309
Because I was at the end of my career.

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:41.309
So, he thought soccer was great,
but it was for children.

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:43.709
"So, what are you going 
to do when you're older?"

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:47.309
And the answer 
I gave him was childish, I said

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:49.309
"Well, when I'm older,
I'm going to change the world."

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:51.309
He said, "How will you change the world?"

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:53.309
I said, "I would like to go into schools

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:56.309
and discuss racism, sexism,
and homophobia

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:59.309
to tell people you aren't born racist,
you become it.

00:01:59.309 --> 00:02:02.309
In fact, it's cultural conditioning."

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:05.946
People often aren't aware of this.

00:02:06.946 --> 00:02:08.946
He said, "OK, what does that mean?"

00:02:08.946 --> 00:02:12.839
I said, "For example,
tell me what black people are like?"

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:15.909
And so he replied, 
"OK, black people are like this or like that."

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.479
I said, "That is how racism starts."

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:20.309
When we think we know what someone

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:24.309
will be like based on the color of their 
skin, their sexuality, or their gender.

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:26.309
And then I gave him a few examples

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:28.659
and when he left he said

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:30.169
"Mr. Thuram,
I'm older than you.

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:32.309
You ought to know
we can't change the world."

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:34.959
And a few weeks later,
my telephone rang

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.729
It was that same man, 
and he said, "You know what?

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:41.309
You have already changed someone."
And that's what gave me the idea

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:47.417
to set up a foundation
because he was the president of a...

00:02:48.142 --> 00:02:49.815
of DDB Spain.

00:02:49.815 --> 00:02:52.815
They're a leading advertising agency.

00:02:52.815 --> 00:02:55.815
And so, little by little,
I set up this foundation.

00:02:55.815 --> 00:02:59.826
And we have been visiting
schools for 10 years now

00:02:59.826 --> 00:03:01.405
in France, and in other countries.

00:03:01.405 --> 00:03:04.471
We're always trying to 
challenge public perception.

00:03:04.471 --> 00:03:07.103
The basic premise of the foundation

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:09.172
is "you aren't born racist,
you become one."

00:03:09.172 --> 00:03:11.559
That's the idea behind
Education against Racism.

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:14.656
You present this as part of your personal
story as something

00:03:14.656 --> 00:03:16.007
instinctive, a feeling.

00:03:16.007 --> 00:03:19.399
Have you researched this premise?

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:22.089
How did you get to it?
Is it just experience

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:23.709
or have there also been studies

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.947
that support this point of view?

00:03:25.947 --> 00:03:29.001
First, it comes from a lived experience

00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:31.947
because I was born
in the Antilles, in Guadeloupe.

00:03:31.947 --> 00:03:36.749
I came to Ile-de-France in 1981

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:38.881
when I was nine years old.

00:03:38.881 --> 00:03:42.290
And I always say
I became Black when I was nine.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.989
It seems surprising, but you become black.

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.058
You become black in the eyes of the other.

00:03:47.058 --> 00:03:49.597
And the really interesting thing is that

00:03:49.597 --> 00:03:53.948
when you become black, 
you understand that it's a trivial thing.

00:03:53.948 --> 00:03:57.602
It's a very negative thing.
Some of my classmates

00:03:57.602 --> 00:04:01.645
named me after a cartoon...

00:04:01.645 --> 00:04:04.895
You are very young,
so you wouldn't know it.

00:04:04.895 --> 00:04:06.644
Sorry, I'm showing my age.

00:04:06.644 --> 00:04:09.644
It was called...
They called me "la Noiraude."

00:04:09.644 --> 00:04:11.781
Does anyone know
the cartoon "La Noiraude?"

00:04:11.781 --> 00:04:14.781
- Yeah
- Oh yeah.

00:04:14.781 --> 00:04:17.781
You read that too? OK.

00:04:17.781 --> 00:04:20.047
But, that's scary, they're really young.

00:04:20.047 --> 00:04:23.601
He's been saying, 
"They're really young" for 20 minutes.

00:04:23.601 --> 00:04:27.273
- I think that's really shocked him.
- It's extremely disconcerting.

00:04:27.273 --> 00:04:31.821
Well, there was a really stupid black cow.

00:04:31.821 --> 00:04:34.542
It makes you wonder
why the black cow was stupid

00:04:34.542 --> 00:04:39.134
while the white cow was very intelligent,
and I really didn't understand at all.

00:04:39.134 --> 00:04:41.765
And I remember I went home one day

00:04:41.765 --> 00:04:44.070
and I asked my mum

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.332
why black people are viewed negatively.

00:04:47.332 --> 00:04:50.116
And she gave me a very bad answer.

00:04:50.116 --> 00:04:51.776
She said, "That's the way it is.

00:04:51.776 --> 00:04:53.939
People are racist. That won't change."

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:56.461
And the thing with that was
that it meant that everyone was racist

00:04:56.461 --> 00:04:57.918
and it was unavoidable.

00:04:57.918 --> 00:05:01.989
So after that, I looked into it more
and spoke to some people.

00:05:01.989 --> 00:05:04.273
and I also began to understand my own family better.

00:05:04.273 --> 00:05:06.193
Because I started out 
with a lot of questions.

00:05:06.193 --> 00:05:08.170
As I said, I'm from the Antilles.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.753
We are a slightly non-conventional family.

00:05:10.753 --> 00:05:13.800
We were five children
from five different dads.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.180
And none of them were around.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.182
So I also had to ask myself

00:05:17.182 --> 00:05:19.449
why is my family like this?

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.839
Because I was faced
with another way of being a family

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:24.838
in the Ile-de-France,

00:05:24.838 --> 00:05:27.621
and so I came across 
the history of slavery

00:05:27.621 --> 00:05:30.528
which was a very
unsettling story

00:05:30.528 --> 00:05:33.697
but after I did some research
and I understood that

00:05:33.697 --> 00:05:36.949
it was not a power relationship

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:39.949
that white people or black people wanted

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:44.306
but above all,
it was a concept.

00:05:44.726 --> 00:05:46.161
It was about economics.

00:05:46.161 --> 00:05:47.712
It was an economic construct.

00:05:47.712 --> 00:05:50.712
And economic
constructs involve domination.

00:05:50.712 --> 00:05:53.576
Through domination, 
you create a discourse.

00:05:53.576 --> 00:05:55.119
So, we created a whole discourse

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:58.119
categorizing people 
according to their skin color.

00:05:58.119 --> 00:06:02.556
And this hierarchy 
still exists in today's societies.

00:06:02.556 --> 00:06:05.599
It is exactly the same thing
between men and women.

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.102
It's because of a political construct

00:06:09.102 --> 00:06:12.102
that our society

00:06:12.102 --> 00:06:15.922
still teaches men to think
they are superior to women.

00:06:15.932 --> 00:06:19.735
That's why—this comes from
your personal story, again

00:06:19.735 --> 00:06:21.961
I saw that the foundation
relies on

00:06:21.961 --> 00:06:24.961
a committee of scientists, 
and anthropologists, etc.

00:06:24.961 --> 00:06:26.896
Have they helped back up the statement

00:06:26.896 --> 00:06:28.996
"you aren't born racist, you become it."

00:06:28.996 --> 00:06:30.848
or have they researched other things?

00:06:30.848 --> 00:06:32.162
In fact, first of all,

00:06:32.162 --> 00:06:34.852
We have all of the knowledge
needed to understand racism.

00:06:34.852 --> 00:06:36.202
Because, effectively,

00:06:36.202 --> 00:06:38.453
even the subjects of racism,

00:06:38.453 --> 00:06:40.988
don't generally understand 
what is happening

00:06:40.988 --> 00:06:42.316
or what causes it.

00:06:42.316 --> 00:06:44.516
So, I think it's very important

00:06:44.516 --> 00:06:46.915
to include intellectuals 
and they help

00:06:46.915 --> 00:06:49.685
to enrich my own way of thinking as well

00:06:49.685 --> 00:06:52.568
so that when 
I'm talking to children in particular

00:06:52.568 --> 00:06:54.039
I can be quite specific.

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:55.825
For example, we have Mr. Yves Coppens

00:06:55.825 --> 00:06:58.385
and Ms Françoise Héritier, 
who has sadly passed away.

00:06:58.385 --> 00:07:02.190
And there are psychologists
as well, which is very important for me

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.637
because, more than anything else, racism

00:07:04.637 --> 00:07:07.937
is often an unconscious feeling.

00:07:07.937 --> 00:07:09.253
And we don't control it.

00:07:09.253 --> 00:07:11.944
So, it's very interesting
to look at every aspect

00:07:11.944 --> 00:07:14.273
to understand this question.

00:07:14.943 --> 00:07:17.321
The particularly interesting thing

00:07:17.321 --> 00:07:19.311
about the foundation's perspective

00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:20.855
it is the idea of unlearning.

00:07:20.855 --> 00:07:22.445
There's a great literary movement

00:07:22.445 --> 00:07:24.713
lots of people have read
Sapiens in particular

00:07:24.713 --> 00:07:28.115
which aims to give us
a different perspective

00:07:28.115 --> 00:07:30.004
on the history, or
the hierarchization

00:07:30.004 --> 00:07:32.434
according to race, of man/woman.

00:07:32.564 --> 00:07:34.176
It's all forms of discrimination.

00:07:34.176 --> 00:07:36.416
Because the foundation deals with
every type

00:07:36.416 --> 00:07:38.148
of discrimination and equality...

00:07:38.148 --> 00:07:41.598
...the caste system. 
So unlearning is an interesting approach.

00:07:41.598 --> 00:07:45.694
How do you start?
Who does it start with? How far can it go?

00:07:45.694 --> 00:07:47.469
Unlearning is a major project.

00:07:47.469 --> 00:07:50.022
But first you must 
recognize that categories exist.

00:07:50.022 --> 00:07:53.161
We have created
categories throughout history.

00:07:53.161 --> 00:07:55.741
If you are aware of that,
that's a good start.

00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:59.049
For example, men/women,
that's a category, it's not harmless.

00:07:59.049 --> 00:08:01.782
If you are a man

00:08:01.782 --> 00:08:06.724
you need to know that
you're likely to think...

00:08:06.724 --> 00:08:09.517
I'm not talking about the men in here.

00:08:09.517 --> 00:08:11.508
I'm talking about other men.

00:08:13.658 --> 00:08:16.279
You might think that you are
superior to women.

00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:18.364
And women can also
subscribe to a similar logic

00:08:18.364 --> 00:08:20.894
by thinking that there are 
things that are not for them.

00:08:20.894 --> 00:08:23.883
And it's similar with
the color of your skin

00:08:23.883 --> 00:08:25.806
There are associated categories.

00:08:26.186 --> 00:08:29.273
And I think that to begin with

00:08:29.273 --> 00:08:30.793
if you are aware of that,

00:08:30.793 --> 00:08:34.183
you know that we don't
have the same experience of society,

00:08:34.183 --> 00:08:36.676
We don't describe history in the same way.

00:08:36.676 --> 00:08:42.186
For example, whether you are called
western or non-western

00:08:42.186 --> 00:08:44.428
that also changes the way history is told.

00:08:44.428 --> 00:08:49.570
I use examples with
the children, obviously.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.275
You know that this isn't true.

00:08:51.275 --> 00:08:52.555
I ask the children

00:08:52.555 --> 00:08:54.958
"Do you know Christopher Columbus?"

00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.978
The children say, "Yes, what about him?"

00:08:56.978 --> 00:08:59.346
I say, "Are you sure you know who he is?"

00:08:59.346 --> 00:09:01.913
They say, "Of course, Mr. Thuram."
I say, "Who is he?"

00:09:01.913 --> 00:09:03.588
"He discovered America."

00:09:03.588 --> 00:09:06.248
I say, "Really?
OK, kids, let's play a little game.

00:09:06.248 --> 00:09:08.665
"Imagine you're in the classroom

00:09:08.665 --> 00:09:11.871
and someone opens the door
and says I've discovered the classroom."

00:09:11.871 --> 00:09:13.805
The children say, "That's not right."

00:09:13.805 --> 00:09:16.178
I say, "But why not?"
They say, "We we're already there."

00:09:16.178 --> 00:09:18.558
And I say, "But when Columbus
reached the Americas,

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:20.668
there were 80 million Native Americans."

00:09:20.668 --> 00:09:22.268
And they respond, "Oh yeah."

00:09:22.268 --> 00:09:24.297
But it's how we tell the story.

00:09:24.297 --> 00:09:28.365
And that's very interesting, and if 
you're not aware of this conditioning

00:09:28.365 --> 00:09:31.278
you can't understand 
the mechanisms of racism.

00:09:31.278 --> 00:09:35.824
If, for example, you haven't heard of
the Code Noir [Black Code]

00:09:35.824 --> 00:09:39.654
you can't really understand racism.

00:09:39.654 --> 00:09:41.548
Who here has heard of the Code Noir?

00:09:44.488 --> 00:09:46.925
The majority, I see, that's very good.

00:09:46.925 --> 00:09:49.852
That can go on the website,
if it goes like that.

00:09:49.852 --> 00:09:52.818
- In fact...
- That will be edited in the video.

00:09:53.058 --> 00:09:56.829
It's very interesting because
the Code Noir is really interesting.

00:09:56.829 --> 00:09:58.570
Being from the Antilles

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:03.090
I had to know the Code Noir,
it was like the civil code for

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.387
how black people were treated

00:10:05.387 --> 00:10:06.837
during slavery.

00:10:06.837 --> 00:10:11.119
So, the Code Noir started
in 1685 and ended in 1848.

00:10:11.119 --> 00:10:13.056
And so you can see that black people

00:10:13.056 --> 00:10:15.516
weren't considered to be human beings.

00:10:15.516 --> 00:10:17.703
They were seen as property.

00:10:17.703 --> 00:10:21.105
But, because that lasted such a long time

00:10:21.105 --> 00:10:23.574
it ended up being a habit.

00:10:23.574 --> 00:10:27.455
If you don't understand that
the Code Noir ended in 1848

00:10:27.455 --> 00:10:29.851
and that's extremely close to our times

00:10:29.851 --> 00:10:33.966
you won't understand
the mentalities we see today.

00:10:33.966 --> 00:10:37.562
For example, I often say that
my grandfather was born in 1908

00:10:37.562 --> 00:10:40.842
60 years after the abolition of slavery,
because there as well

00:10:40.842 --> 00:10:44.318
we think of slavery as not really being
connected to us.

00:10:44.318 --> 00:10:49.148
But that means that I was born
a few generations after slavery

00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:51.356
so if we don't recognize that

00:10:51.356 --> 00:10:52.736
we can't understand.

00:10:52.746 --> 00:10:54.946
If you don't know the 
Code de l'indigénat [indigenous peoples' code]

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:56.432
it's exactly the same thing.

00:10:56.432 --> 00:11:01.368
The Code de l'indigénat, is how 
they managed people in the colonies.

00:11:01.368 --> 00:11:03.904
And that ended in the 1950's.

00:11:03.904 --> 00:11:06.173
And in the 1950s

00:11:06.173 --> 00:11:09.860
there were still classes for 
ten-year-old children in school

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.950
which taught them there was a hierarchy

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.973
of people according to their skin color.

00:11:13.973 --> 00:11:17.018
And white people were superior.

00:11:17.018 --> 00:11:19.834
There's a gradation of color,
and black people

00:11:19.834 --> 00:11:22.596
are the missing link between
monkeys and humans.

00:11:22.596 --> 00:11:24.649
That's why, when I was a soccer player

00:11:24.649 --> 00:11:26.852
fans would make
monkey noises at me.

00:11:26.852 --> 00:11:28.882
They did not know this history

00:11:28.882 --> 00:11:32.998
but to them, 
making the link between black and monkey

00:11:32.998 --> 00:11:36.357
seemed normal.
Really, they had learned that.

00:11:36.357 --> 00:11:38.720
That's why I say
that it is very interesting

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.720
to understand history
so you can unlearn it.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.604
To understand, in effect, how you work.

00:11:44.604 --> 00:11:46.407
That is, how we interact

00:11:46.407 --> 00:11:49.407
with each other, according to skin color

00:11:49.407 --> 00:11:53.307
disability, or whether
we are male or female,

00:11:53.307 --> 00:11:57.674
I mean there are, how can I say this...

00:11:57.674 --> 00:12:00.986
Relationships that you
don't understand sometimes.

00:12:00.986 --> 00:12:04.543
For example, here in France, in any case

00:12:04.543 --> 00:12:07.650
there is always this color barrier.

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.359
People will say it's not true.

00:12:09.359 --> 00:12:14.753
But it is. I mean if 
we looked for diversity here

00:12:15.363 --> 00:12:17.659
who would represent diversity?

00:12:19.309 --> 00:12:20.659
For a French person?

00:12:21.279 --> 00:12:24.279
Do you represent diversity?

00:12:25.793 --> 00:12:28.323
You look diverse.

00:12:30.575 --> 00:12:34.137
It's the same if we look for
someone from a visible minority.

00:12:34.137 --> 00:12:37.543
That's you again. Sorry.

00:12:37.543 --> 00:12:40.314
OK, but if we say visible minority

00:12:40.314 --> 00:12:43.269
that means there's an invisible majority.

00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:45.317
And who are the invisible majority?

00:12:45.317 --> 00:12:47.456
White people.

00:12:47.456 --> 00:12:51.333
So we have made something up
about native French people.

00:12:51.333 --> 00:12:53.620
So, you are not native French.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.945
I can sense it, I don't know why.

00:12:55.945 --> 00:12:58.278
But we wouldn't class you as native.

00:12:58.278 --> 00:13:00.548
You mustn't sit next to me.

00:13:00.548 --> 00:13:06.152
This is just to show that
we don't really realize

00:13:06.152 --> 00:13:10.041
but there is often 
this barrier based on skin color.

00:13:10.041 --> 00:13:13.024
And there is another way of seeing things.

00:13:13.024 --> 00:13:16.158
And I think that the first thing
is to recognize that.

00:13:16.158 --> 00:13:20.567
And then, little by little, we can heal.

00:13:20.567 --> 00:13:23.345
The idea of becoming aware 
and unlearning is interesting.

00:13:23.345 --> 00:13:25.027
So my question to you is

00:13:25.027 --> 00:13:28.027
—because it's called
"education against racism"—

00:13:28.027 --> 00:13:31.578
what do you learn after that?
Because there's a risk of relearning

00:13:31.578 --> 00:13:34.178
a model that, could become in...

00:13:34.178 --> 00:13:37.020
20 or 40 years yet another failure.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.541
Or what do you do to teach

00:13:38.541 --> 00:13:42.471
a vision that is sufficiently broad
that you can impose it without any danger?

00:13:42.471 --> 00:13:44.531
So, if we class ourselves 
as a human beings

00:13:44.531 --> 00:13:46.481
when writing history, that's interesting.

00:13:46.481 --> 00:13:50.644
So we step outside the hierarchies,
because very often

00:13:50.644 --> 00:13:53.204
when I talk to you about
Christopher Columbus,

00:13:53.204 --> 00:13:56.368
you know the story. 
There were many people.

00:13:56.368 --> 00:14:00.829
But, the others didn't
really exist until we discovered them.

00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:02.708
Or until we saw them.

00:14:02.708 --> 00:14:05.819
I think it would be interesting 
when talking about Columbus...

00:14:05.819 --> 00:14:09.713
Who here, for example, has heard of
the Valladolid debate?

00:14:11.691 --> 00:14:14.756
No one. It's very interesting to
understand that as well.

00:14:14.756 --> 00:14:16.458
The topic in question was

00:14:16.458 --> 00:14:19.758
"Do Native Americans have a soul like us?"

00:14:20.008 --> 00:14:21.940
Because that's what's interesting.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:26.494
Showing that these questions of domination

00:14:26.494 --> 00:14:30.066
existed in the past and also exist today.

00:14:30.066 --> 00:14:35.315
What does European society
think about the world?

00:14:35.315 --> 00:14:38.228
Does the world belong to everyone?

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:41.863
Who does the world belong to?

00:14:42.768 --> 00:14:43.870
- It's a good question.
- It is.

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:46.723
But it doesn't belong to everyone,
believe me.

00:14:46.723 --> 00:14:48.717
I don't want to spoil the mood.

00:14:48.717 --> 00:14:50.437
But it does not belong to everyone.

00:14:50.437 --> 00:14:55.480
There are some people who just
have to do what other people have decided

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.480
to do, and follow them.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.480
Because there is a model to follow.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:05.593
And it was mostly us
who established that model.

00:15:05.593 --> 00:15:09.687
And again today, we end up 
thinking that we are dominant

00:15:09.687 --> 00:15:11.557
and it's right for us to be dominant

00:15:11.557 --> 00:15:13.241
because we're better than the rest.

00:15:13.241 --> 00:15:15.382
It's always this trick of...

00:15:15.382 --> 00:15:19.661
changing your perspective,
because very often

00:15:19.661 --> 00:15:22.984
we begin by thinking that we are
at the center

00:15:22.984 --> 00:15:26.019
and that we are right, us.

00:15:26.019 --> 00:15:29.517
But we often don't have a global
vision of world history.

00:15:30.407 --> 00:15:33.222
But I think that history

00:15:33.222 --> 00:15:35.159
should be told differently.

00:15:35.159 --> 00:15:37.579
Yes, told differently. OK.

00:15:37.579 --> 00:15:40.985
I'm going to explore
the foundation's work a bit more.

00:15:40.985 --> 00:15:44.742
I saw that there were four pillars
that make up your work:

00:15:44.742 --> 00:15:47.453
equality, individuality,
education and remebrance.

00:15:47.453 --> 00:15:50.123
Could you tell us a bit
more about each of those pillars?

00:15:50.123 --> 00:15:52.523
How you handle them
within this idea of education.

00:15:52.523 --> 00:15:53.714
How you approach them.

00:15:53.714 --> 00:15:57.353
Well, the idea of being unique.

00:15:57.353 --> 00:16:00.227
It seems silly, but

00:16:00.227 --> 00:16:03.228
since the dawn of time

00:16:03.228 --> 00:16:07.538
when we tell the story of racism,
sexism, or homophobia

00:16:07.538 --> 00:16:12.335
we forget that every one of us is unique.

00:16:12.335 --> 00:16:14.539
We box people in

00:16:14.539 --> 00:16:15.779
according to skin color.

00:16:15.779 --> 00:16:17.861
When we talk about people with black skin

00:16:17.861 --> 00:16:21.197
it's, "black people 
all work in the same way."

00:16:21.197 --> 00:16:25.794
And when I'm with children

00:16:25.794 --> 00:16:28.402
not the very young ones,
because the very young ones

00:16:28.402 --> 00:16:30.621
are really pure anyway

00:16:30.621 --> 00:16:33.621
but with the older ones.
When I ask the question

00:16:33.621 --> 00:16:37.807
"Tell me what black people are like?",
there are some children who respond.

00:16:37.807 --> 00:16:41.414
It's awful.

00:16:41.414 --> 00:16:44.248
It's because, in their minds

00:16:44.248 --> 00:16:48.298
these people don't exist as individuals.

00:16:48.298 --> 00:16:51.037
They exist as a collective.

00:16:51.037 --> 00:16:55.334
It's like if you said, in these schools...

00:16:55.334 --> 00:16:57.687
"What are white people like?"

00:16:57.687 --> 00:17:01.065
They say,
"Well, they're like everyone else."

00:17:03.045 --> 00:17:05.925
That means they have characteristics of...
When I ask about Asians, they say

00:17:05.925 --> 00:17:08.925
"they play ping-pong, they are yellow."

00:17:08.925 --> 00:17:10.639
It's just to show that that exists.

00:17:10.639 --> 00:17:15.894
It's the children who 
grow up with ideas about color.

00:17:15.894 --> 00:17:17.104
And that's interesting.

00:17:17.104 --> 00:17:19.805
That's why I say
we really need to teach people

00:17:19.805 --> 00:17:23.569
to understand that
every one of us is unique.

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:29.329
And when we talk, for example,
about French culture, because...

00:17:29.329 --> 00:17:32.084
what is French culture?

00:17:32.084 --> 00:17:35.084
Who is French here?

00:17:35.084 --> 00:17:36.681
Everyone? I can't tell.

00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:39.365
Listen... Because I can see
some people aren't listening

00:17:39.365 --> 00:17:40.888
so, I thought...

00:17:40.888 --> 00:17:43.080
Right, the majority, OK.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.657
We're all agreed that
I am Antillean, I am French.

00:17:46.657 --> 00:17:50.657
There are people who are Breton
or Alsatian

00:17:50.657 --> 00:17:53.486
for whom French culture is complex.

00:17:53.486 --> 00:17:57.187
But even in the Antilles,
we don't all have the same culture.

00:17:57.187 --> 00:17:59.295
It's something personal.

00:17:59.295 --> 00:18:02.796
And sometimes that unsettles me.

00:18:02.796 --> 00:18:07.196
We would like to say
that there is a French culture

00:18:07.196 --> 00:18:09.709
a French way of being.

00:18:09.709 --> 00:18:13.819
And so we say, "you will need
to integrate into French culture."

00:18:13.819 --> 00:18:14.734
But which one?

00:18:15.734 --> 00:18:17.734
Which one?

00:18:17.734 --> 00:18:19.309
The odds are already against you.

00:18:19.309 --> 00:18:25.258
And so we need to come back to this:
every one of us has our own culture.

00:18:25.258 --> 00:18:27.798
And we need to recognize that as well.

00:18:27.798 --> 00:18:29.625
That's why I talk about individuality.

00:18:29.625 --> 00:18:31.665
Because that is the problem of racism.

00:18:31.665 --> 00:18:35.431
He is black, he is like this.
He is white, he is like that.

00:18:35.431 --> 00:18:38.533
But that doesn't make sense.
That's a man, he is like this.

00:18:38.533 --> 00:18:40.504
And I think it's really important

00:18:40.504 --> 00:18:44.692
to develop that in children.

00:18:44.692 --> 00:18:46.112
Then, remembrance...

00:18:46.112 --> 00:18:49.112
remembrance is very important to me
because, once again

00:18:49.112 --> 00:18:53.156
every one of us here is
the product of history.

00:18:53.156 --> 00:18:55.139
The product of the past.

00:18:55.139 --> 00:18:59.555
And we must remind children
that societies evolve

00:18:59.555 --> 00:19:01.611
because there have always
been men and women

00:19:01.611 --> 00:19:04.001
who have said no to injustice.

00:19:04.001 --> 00:19:07.351
And I think it is very important
to recognize that.

00:19:07.351 --> 00:19:09.387
Because people frequently say

00:19:09.387 --> 00:19:11.147
"No, nothing changes."

00:19:11.147 --> 00:19:14.619
Yes, things do change. I'm proof of that.

00:19:14.619 --> 00:19:17.682
I told you that 
my grandfather was born in 1908.

00:19:17.682 --> 00:19:20.318
Things have changed because

00:19:20.318 --> 00:19:24.746
there have always been people
who fought for freedom and equality.

00:19:24.746 --> 00:19:26.836
And we tell the kids something essential

00:19:26.836 --> 00:19:30.019
that freedom is won, it is not given.

00:19:31.214 --> 00:19:34.717
And so, we must be properly
prepared to fight for this equality

00:19:34.717 --> 00:19:37.967
so for me, remembrance is very important.

00:19:37.967 --> 00:19:39.308
And then there is...

00:19:39.308 --> 00:19:42.349
There was equality, individuality,
education. You've done lots.

00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:45.372
Equality, yes. That seems obvious to me.

00:19:45.372 --> 00:19:48.497
Often, when we talk to the children

00:19:48.497 --> 00:19:50.838
about equality,

00:19:50.838 --> 00:19:54.111
they really have a problem with
homosexuality, for example.

00:19:54.111 --> 00:19:58.834
OK, and whatever their religion,
we come up against,

00:19:58.834 --> 00:20:01.724
"Yeah, but they're not like us."

00:20:01.724 --> 00:20:03.606
But, when I say, "So, kids

00:20:03.606 --> 00:20:08.186
can one person 
have more rights than another

00:20:08.186 --> 00:20:09.974
in our society?"
... they say, "No."

00:20:09.974 --> 00:20:12.663
"Can an individual have fewer rights?"
"No."

00:20:12.663 --> 00:20:16.865
And I say, "OK, there you go.
That means you think

00:20:16.865 --> 00:20:19.671
that a homosexual
is not a human being like us."

00:20:19.671 --> 00:20:21.850
That's the problem with categories.

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:23.453
They mean that sometimes,

00:20:23.453 --> 00:20:26.453
we don't see other people
as human beings like ourselves.

00:20:26.453 --> 00:20:28.741
We see them through their religion

00:20:28.741 --> 00:20:29.823
color, or sexuality.

00:20:29.823 --> 00:20:33.513
So that's why, in my opinion, equality
is always very important.

00:20:33.513 --> 00:20:36.719
And putting the human being
back at the heart of everything.

00:20:36.719 --> 00:20:38.448
When we talk about the human being

00:20:38.448 --> 00:20:40.998
it's actually easier
for the younger children.

00:20:40.998 --> 00:20:43.413
OK. So I wonder, because...

00:20:43.413 --> 00:20:49.248
In the organizations here in France
that represent minorities

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:51.248
and diversity and the minority

00:20:51.248 --> 00:20:54.248
they are ensuring success,
helping them to achieve.

00:20:54.248 --> 00:20:56.147
But the minorities, they...

00:20:56.147 --> 00:20:59.933
Well, we're coming back to the 
invisible majority and visible minority.

00:20:59.933 --> 00:21:02.867
- No, no, but...
- I won't go back to that discussion...

00:21:02.867 --> 00:21:06.105
we would need more time...
- No, but it's interesting because

00:21:06.105 --> 00:21:09.974
the majority generally speaking,
people who make up the majority

00:21:09.974 --> 00:21:11.476
because if belong to a minority

00:21:11.476 --> 00:21:14.236
- they think... I don't know.
- I don't belong anywhere.

00:21:14.236 --> 00:21:19.605
You've talked about minorities,
but what is really interesting,

00:21:19.605 --> 00:21:21.884
is that people
who think they are the majority

00:21:21.884 --> 00:21:23.704
think that they are more legitimate.

00:21:23.704 --> 00:21:25.436
They wouldn't want to say it

00:21:25.436 --> 00:21:26.731
but it's true.

00:21:27.583 --> 00:21:30.925
I am part of the majority,
I am more legitimate.

00:21:30.925 --> 00:21:34.316
I am part of the minority,
I must keep out of the way.

00:21:34.316 --> 00:21:36.589
We mustn't form groups
in case it's a plot.

00:21:36.589 --> 00:21:37.893
you never know...

00:21:37.893 --> 00:21:39.156
Wait, what does that mean?

00:21:40.156 --> 00:21:42.156
OK? Well, it's interesting.

00:21:42.156 --> 00:21:44.179
Interesting in the sense that it's like a plot.

00:21:44.179 --> 00:21:45.179
Right.

00:21:45.179 --> 00:21:47.069
The front row are laughing at that.

00:21:47.069 --> 00:21:49.171
Because we're in a group,
we're plotting.

00:21:49.171 --> 00:21:51.167
You are plotting something.

00:21:52.224 --> 00:21:55.017
I'm going to tell you 
a quick story about "plotting".

00:21:55.424 --> 00:21:57.736
Because very often
we don't realize.

00:21:57.736 --> 00:22:01.176
When you are a so-called minority

00:22:01.176 --> 00:22:02.936
and have dark-brown skin,

00:22:02.936 --> 00:22:04.697
you are noticed...

00:22:05.277 --> 00:22:08.150
when your body comes into the equation,
you are noticed.

00:22:08.406 --> 00:22:11.458
Once, when I was
at with my soccer team

00:22:11.458 --> 00:22:15.359
we were "in the green", 
which is when you go to the hotel

00:22:15.359 --> 00:22:17.427
before a match to relax and all that.

00:22:17.427 --> 00:22:20.427
And so there was a big table

00:22:20.427 --> 00:22:23.003
and we were having dinner

00:22:23.003 --> 00:22:25.254
and my trainer arrived and said to us

00:22:25.254 --> 00:22:29.089
"You blacks,
you're always together.

00:22:30.459 --> 00:22:32.981
"It doesn't bother you,
you're always there together."

00:22:33.051 --> 00:22:34.482
He said that to me in Italian.

00:22:34.482 --> 00:22:37.009
I said, "Oh yeah, it's weird though,

00:22:37.009 --> 00:22:40.508
there are 4 of us black people here,
and there are 15 white people

00:22:40.508 --> 00:22:42.198
and we're in a group."

00:22:43.185 --> 00:22:45.023
"And they're in a group there as well."

00:22:45.023 --> 00:22:47.922
And the guy looked at us and then he left.

00:22:50.025 --> 00:22:52.590
No, but it's interesting.

00:22:53.644 --> 00:22:55.782
That's why I say that sometimes

00:22:55.782 --> 00:22:57.292
there are even guys who think

00:22:57.292 --> 00:22:59.168
"We can't be in a group.

00:22:59.168 --> 00:23:00.682
They'll think we're plotting.
Let's split."

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:02.571
So, it's interesting.

00:23:02.571 --> 00:23:04.744
It's funny you have
so many stories like that

00:23:04.744 --> 00:23:08.666
both personal and from your research,
that you can tell the children.

00:23:08.666 --> 00:23:10.326
Tell me, when you talk to the kids

00:23:10.326 --> 00:23:13.980
what do you tell them are the keys
to getting on in society

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:16.071
to be successful, in whatever way?

00:23:16.071 --> 00:23:18.932
Because unlearning
and relearning allows them

00:23:18.932 --> 00:23:20.803
to better integrate in society

00:23:20.803 --> 00:23:22.160
in the positive sense.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.305
How do you help them go further,
to realize that there is a place

00:23:25.305 --> 00:23:27.549
for them in society, a good place.

00:23:27.549 --> 00:23:30.791
Well, that is the most important thing.

00:23:30.791 --> 00:23:33.498
- Yes.
- Well, we call that

00:23:33.498 --> 00:23:35.312
self-esteem.

00:23:35.312 --> 00:23:37.780
It's what helps you get ahead in society.

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:39.967
And that's why it's
extremely important

00:23:39.967 --> 00:23:42.927
to talk about racism in all its forms.

00:23:42.927 --> 00:23:45.463
Why? Because when people
are subject to racism

00:23:45.463 --> 00:23:48.369
it can affect their self-esteem.

00:23:48.369 --> 00:23:50.642
That means I don't belong

00:23:50.642 --> 00:23:53.013
or I feel inferior.

00:23:53.013 --> 00:23:54.955
And so the idea is to say, yes

00:23:54.955 --> 00:23:57.012
racism exists,

00:23:57.012 --> 00:24:00.297
however, you need to understand

00:24:00.297 --> 00:24:02.857
that you are not the problem

00:24:02.857 --> 00:24:03.833
the others are.

00:24:03.833 --> 00:24:05.858
So, when I was in Italy

00:24:05.858 --> 00:24:08.858
people made monkey noises on the pitch.

00:24:08.858 --> 00:24:11.871
I didn't doubt that there was a problem:

00:24:11.871 --> 00:24:13.330
it was the fans.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.174
And that is very important.

00:24:15.174 --> 00:24:17.834
Besides, this is what works
best with children.

00:24:17.834 --> 00:24:20.703
As soon as they understand it,
they say, "Oh, yeah."

00:24:20.703 --> 00:24:23.673
and whatever the problem is,
"you're fat, you're..."

00:24:23.673 --> 00:24:26.293
they know the other person
is the one with the problem.

00:24:26.293 --> 00:24:28.014
Because otherwise you'd never cope.

00:24:28.014 --> 00:24:32.177
And so, we also need to teach children

00:24:33.747 --> 00:24:37.219
how far they should accept
having to disguise themselves.

00:24:37.219 --> 00:24:40.117
Because, generally speaking, in life

00:24:40.117 --> 00:24:43.081
all of us are made to wear
disguises sometimes.

00:24:43.937 --> 00:24:47.693
The dominant category frequently

00:24:47.693 --> 00:24:51.067
asks you,
either consciously or unconsciously

00:24:51.067 --> 00:24:53.412
to resemble them.

00:24:53.412 --> 00:24:57.081
For example, we'll talk about
disguising your accent.

00:24:57.081 --> 00:24:59.632
Recently, I was at the house 
of some journalists

00:24:59.632 --> 00:25:01.384
and I said, "It's strange though,

00:25:01.384 --> 00:25:04.089
"on the TV, it seems like
there's only one accent."

00:25:04.089 --> 00:25:07.014
So there must be some
journalists who disguise themselves

00:25:07.014 --> 00:25:10.038
who have Southern accents,
and who have been told

00:25:10.038 --> 00:25:12.168
"Listen to your accent."

00:25:12.168 --> 00:25:13.168
And so, he said,

00:25:13.168 --> 00:25:15.694
"Oh yeah, that's true,
they did say that to me."

00:25:16.514 --> 00:25:19.899
And one of them said,
"Yeah, I say 'shore' with an accent

00:25:19.899 --> 00:25:21.822
so now I say 'coastline' instead."

00:25:23.786 --> 00:25:27.358
And so it's very interesting.
But you need to know, for example

00:25:27.358 --> 00:25:31.576
when you are called a minority

00:25:31.576 --> 00:25:33.437
that's why it's very interesting

00:25:33.437 --> 00:25:35.531
you're told
to disguise yourself sometimes.

00:25:35.531 --> 00:25:37.217
Your behavior.

00:25:38.704 --> 00:25:40.253
I don't want to shock anyone.

00:25:40.253 --> 00:25:41.572
Even sometimes the barber.

00:25:42.369 --> 00:25:43.931
For example, very often

00:25:43.931 --> 00:25:45.857
women hide their frizzy hair.

00:25:45.857 --> 00:25:49.597
Because, really, they look at

00:25:49.597 --> 00:25:53.486
the rules of beauty
and they don't see themselves.

00:25:53.486 --> 00:25:57.418
It's very interesting to think about that.

00:25:57.418 --> 00:25:59.720
And to know how far you go.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:03.337
For example, when I talk
about self-esteem

00:26:03.337 --> 00:26:06.086
In the United States, they did

00:26:07.491 --> 00:26:12.073
a test with dolls.
I don't know if you've heard of it?

00:26:12.397 --> 00:26:14.953
Do you know about the black dolls
and the white dolls?

00:26:16.001 --> 00:26:18.368
OK, you're not American, 
so that makes sense.

00:26:19.311 --> 00:26:21.671
Well, they did tests with children

00:26:21.671 --> 00:26:25.365
they said:
"Look, which doll is the most beautiful?

00:26:25.365 --> 00:26:27.894
"The prettiest? The naughtiest?"

00:26:29.062 --> 00:26:32.759
And the children attributed

00:26:32.759 --> 00:26:35.613
all of the negative qualities
to the black dolls.

00:26:36.629 --> 00:26:38.442
And at one point they said to them

00:26:38.442 --> 00:26:41.442
"But which doll looks like you?"

00:26:41.442 --> 00:26:45.343
And then they panicked
because the children were black.

00:26:46.465 --> 00:26:51.380
So, they had internalized the idea
that all bad things

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:53.584
were their color, and on the film

00:26:53.584 --> 00:26:54.879
you can see they are upset.

00:26:54.879 --> 00:26:57.652
Because they suddenly realize that—oh no.

00:26:57.652 --> 00:27:01.494
That's why I say this is really serious

00:27:01.494 --> 00:27:04.818
because, more than anything else,
racism is really dangerous.

00:27:04.818 --> 00:27:09.507
Because you can internalize
a negative thought about yourself.

00:27:10.338 --> 00:27:13.325
And I frequently say to the children,

00:27:13.325 --> 00:27:17.128
"There are a lot of young
homosexuals who take their own lives.

00:27:17.128 --> 00:27:19.884
Do you know why?"

00:27:21.024 --> 00:27:24.968
And they say, "Yes, their parents."
No, it's because of us.

00:27:24.968 --> 00:27:29.344
Because we're the ones who cause them
to think negatively about themselves.

00:27:29.344 --> 00:27:32.415
And I say to them,
"The problem isn't homosexuality.

00:27:32.415 --> 00:27:34.115
The problem is us."

00:27:34.115 --> 00:27:37.385
So, we need grow up
thinking about that.

00:27:37.385 --> 00:27:41.254
Is it normal that every one of us

00:27:41.254 --> 00:27:44.602
has at some point driven people
to suicide with our behavior?

00:27:44.602 --> 00:27:45.602
That's why I think

00:27:46.935 --> 00:27:49.935
self-esteem is very important.

00:27:49.935 --> 00:27:53.229
Because for all of us

00:27:53.229 --> 00:27:55.693
it's what helps us get on in life.

00:27:55.693 --> 00:27:57.676
If I was a soccer player

00:27:57.676 --> 00:28:00.906
you have this idea that

00:28:00.906 --> 00:28:03.314
you could do it too.

00:28:03.314 --> 00:28:05.555
And you have this potential inside of you

00:28:05.555 --> 00:28:07.483
which will help you get on.

00:28:07.483 --> 00:28:11.541
And you really deserve it. Really, there
are so many things that come together.

00:28:11.541 --> 00:28:13.160
And sometimes unconsciously.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:17.246
And they push us, but there are children
who have a handicap from the start.

00:28:17.246 --> 00:28:21.765
Because they've been told,
their sexuality, or where they're from...

00:28:21.765 --> 00:28:25.321
for example, at the moment,
I have an exhibition

00:28:25.321 --> 00:28:29.709
in the Delacroix museum
in the 6th arrondissement of Paris

00:28:29.709 --> 00:28:33.163
and recently, there were some children
who had come from Sarcelle,

00:28:33.163 --> 00:28:34.645
they had come to see it.

00:28:34.645 --> 00:28:35.675
And so I said to them

00:28:35.675 --> 00:28:37.368
"What do you think of this area?"

00:28:37.368 --> 00:28:38.139
They said

00:28:38.639 --> 00:28:42.319
"It's weird here...
everyone speaks really quietly."

00:28:42.319 --> 00:28:45.431
"It's funny when they talk like that."

00:28:45.431 --> 00:28:48.141
"And why do they dress like that?"

00:28:48.141 --> 00:28:50.107
And I said, "Do you feel uncomfortable?"

00:28:50.107 --> 00:28:52.639
They said, "It's not for us here."

00:28:52.639 --> 00:28:54.018
And I said, "But the museum?"

00:28:54.018 --> 00:28:58.408
They said, "Yeah, but listen, 
this isn't our place."

00:28:58.408 --> 00:29:02.717
That's the problem.
Lots of children grow up thinking

00:29:02.717 --> 00:29:05.072
that they're not in the right place.

00:29:05.072 --> 00:29:07.447
And its extremely dangerous.
They can't succeed.

00:29:07.447 --> 00:29:12.834
And so the idea is to provide
the knowledge to change that.

00:29:12.872 --> 00:29:16.453
You've mentioned what you were doing
at the Delacroix museum.

00:29:16.453 --> 00:29:17.483
Any other things

00:29:17.483 --> 00:29:19.743
you've done you'd like
to talk about in detail?

00:29:19.743 --> 00:29:21.029
It's very interesting.

00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:23.419
Are there other activities
you'd like to describe?

00:29:23.419 --> 00:29:24.769
I'm looking at the time too

00:29:24.769 --> 00:29:27.015
to make sure our friends
can ask questions.

00:29:27.015 --> 00:29:30.395
Listen, at the moment we are working on

00:29:30.395 --> 00:29:34.845
an exhibition, L'Orient [The East]

00:29:34.845 --> 00:29:38.080
about the painter Delacroix,

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.578
and we're showing to what extent,
when you look at a painting

00:29:41.578 --> 00:29:45.659
you need to place it
in its historical context.

00:29:45.659 --> 00:29:47.823
Because Delacroix actually traveled

00:29:47.823 --> 00:29:50.823
to the East, to Morocco and to Algeria.

00:29:50.823 --> 00:29:54.114
And it also shows that this
version of the East is fascinating,

00:29:54.114 --> 00:29:55.130
because, in fact,

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:59.198
when he paints,
the artist is also in

00:29:59.198 --> 00:30:00.913
his own reality.

00:30:00.913 --> 00:30:03.464
And it's not the true reality of the East.

00:30:03.653 --> 00:30:05.993
We tell the children,
"if you're given information

00:30:05.993 --> 00:30:08.431
or if you're looking at a work of art

00:30:08.431 --> 00:30:09.914
you need to question it."

00:30:09.914 --> 00:30:12.088
"You mustn't take it at face value."

00:30:12.088 --> 00:30:15.177
And the images of women as well.

00:30:15.177 --> 00:30:18.431
Really, when you see the paintings

00:30:18.431 --> 00:30:21.564
the women are extremely sensual,
extremely erotic.

00:30:21.564 --> 00:30:24.368
And they show that even then

00:30:24.368 --> 00:30:26.877
women were boxed into that image.

00:30:26.877 --> 00:30:32.310
And today, when you watch television,
or in bus shelters

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:36.744
there are still images of
very erotic women.

00:30:36.744 --> 00:30:41.903
And should we be looking at them
without questioning this?

00:30:41.903 --> 00:30:45.073
Because aren't women often shown

00:30:45.073 --> 00:30:47.083
as treasure to be won?

00:30:47.083 --> 00:30:50.636
And then there are also 
several rooms where

00:30:50.636 --> 00:30:52.149
we talk about disguises.

00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:54.199
When we use disguises.

00:30:54.199 --> 00:30:56.144
What are acceptable disguises?

00:30:56.144 --> 00:30:58.429
Do we know, for example

00:30:58.429 --> 00:31:02.749
that we can't use 
dark brown skin as a disguise?

00:31:02.749 --> 00:31:06.572
Some people think we can,
but we need to remember the history.

00:31:06.572 --> 00:31:08.690
And it also shows that

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:13.691
there are some things you can't
overcome with a disguise.

00:31:13.691 --> 00:31:16.224
Then there is a book called
"My Black Stars"

00:31:16.224 --> 00:31:18.482
that I wrote a few years ago.

00:31:18.482 --> 00:31:20.955
In fact, it was really important to me

00:31:20.955 --> 00:31:25.824
because, I don't know
if it's the case here...

00:31:28.192 --> 00:31:31.366
Not you, madam.

00:31:32.387 --> 00:31:33.554
The two gentlemen there.

00:31:34.507 --> 00:31:37.779
The first time—I can tell that
you're not French just like that....

00:31:37.879 --> 00:31:40.056
the first time that you heard about

00:31:40.056 --> 00:31:42.510
the history of black people

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:45.068
in your school curriculum, when was it?

00:31:46.934 --> 00:31:49.130
In secondary school? 
But what did they talk about?

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:57.037
OK, you can't just repeat the same things,
that's not how it works.

00:31:57.037 --> 00:32:00.537
What is this history?
I wanted to say more about it.

00:32:01.639 --> 00:32:05.172
No, but really, 
we often don't realize this

00:32:05.172 --> 00:32:08.172
but the first time we here about
the history of black people

00:32:08.172 --> 00:32:10.196
it's through the history of slavery.

00:32:10.196 --> 00:32:12.821
And actually, it's shocking.

00:32:12.821 --> 00:32:14.741
When you are dark brown you say

00:32:14.741 --> 00:32:18.283
"Damn, what happened next? 
Where were they before?"

00:32:19.563 --> 00:32:23.767
And so, I said to myself,
I have to write a book

00:32:23.767 --> 00:32:25.829
that questions the public's perceptions.

00:32:25.829 --> 00:32:28.617
Because if everyone is made to
come at it from that angle

00:32:28.617 --> 00:32:31.873
that creates a way of seeing the world.

00:32:31.873 --> 00:32:35.213
And so the idea was to show that there
were men and women

00:32:35.213 --> 00:32:37.638
who could tell a 
different version of history.

00:32:37.638 --> 00:32:39.916
Because, again, we are all

00:32:39.916 --> 00:32:43.067
the product of a history
that we've been told.

00:32:43.907 --> 00:32:45.978
We can't escape that.

00:32:46.858 --> 00:32:49.144
But sometimes we don't realize how much

00:32:49.144 --> 00:32:52.356
this history actually
determines the way we think.

00:32:52.356 --> 00:32:57.454
And so the idea is to question this
way of thinking, question history.

00:32:57.454 --> 00:32:59.115
And to inform.

00:32:59.115 --> 00:33:02.239
And the funny thing was, because when I...

00:33:02.239 --> 00:33:04.654
I went on TV

00:33:04.654 --> 00:33:07.941
journalists would say, "Mr. Thuram

00:33:07.941 --> 00:33:10.579
I didn't know black people
had done so many things."

00:33:10.579 --> 00:33:12.907
Because the violence is so pervasive.

00:33:12.907 --> 00:33:15.339
Although I was pleased,
the violence is everywhere.

00:33:15.339 --> 00:33:18.757
And I even remember children 
saying to me in Togo:

00:33:18.757 --> 00:33:22.226
"Yeah, I thought that black people
hadn't done anything before."

00:33:22.226 --> 00:33:26.685
And so, it's essential
to tell their stories.

00:33:26.685 --> 00:33:30.193
and, actually, when
you look at your school curriculum

00:33:30.193 --> 00:33:31.264
there are very few men

00:33:31.264 --> 00:33:34.264
or women who have done
extraordinary things.

00:33:34.264 --> 00:33:35.264
What's more

00:33:35.264 --> 00:33:38.204
there are also very few women
in the school curriculum.

00:33:38.204 --> 00:33:40.977
That is very significant.

00:33:40.977 --> 00:33:45.005
So, the idea is always to try
to broaden our knowledge

00:33:45.005 --> 00:33:47.695
to change the way we think.

00:33:48.405 --> 00:33:49.933
That little scroll.

00:33:49.933 --> 00:33:52.537
I wanted to show you,
because once again

00:33:53.927 --> 00:33:56.303
the idea is to question.

00:33:56.303 --> 00:33:58.294
So, can you see this map?

00:34:01.172 --> 00:34:02.696
There was a movement there.

00:34:02.696 --> 00:34:04.138
Can you see the map or not?

00:34:05.948 --> 00:34:07.128
They cheated.

00:34:07.128 --> 00:34:08.400
OK.

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:11.750
In fact, there were,
I'm not going to name names,

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:14.750
some people have asked me to turn it over.

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:17.853
And I often say, 
"have you ever seen a soccer ball?"

00:34:19.129 --> 00:34:20.674
You've never seen 
a soccer ball?

00:34:21.404 --> 00:34:23.928
You have seen a soccer ball?

00:34:23.928 --> 00:34:25.360
OK, thank you.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.509
I need interaction
otherwise it doesn't work.

00:34:27.509 --> 00:34:29.405
And the ball is round.

00:34:29.405 --> 00:34:31.368
You can't say the ball is upside down.

00:34:31.368 --> 00:34:35.947
However, as soon as we change our
way of looking at

00:34:35.947 --> 00:34:39.922
the world, we're told, no
we need to correct it

00:34:39.922 --> 00:34:41.339
because it is upside down.

00:34:41.339 --> 00:34:43.194
Really, it's just questioning

00:34:43.194 --> 00:34:47.004
our way of thinking about the world
and our customs.

00:34:47.004 --> 00:34:50.262
And the traditional maps you're used to

00:34:50.262 --> 00:34:52.172
often have Europe at the center

00:34:52.172 --> 00:34:54.148
and this is not by chance,
and what's more

00:34:54.148 --> 00:34:55.148
on traditional maps

00:34:55.148 --> 00:34:56.827
I don't know if you know

00:34:56.827 --> 00:35:00.465
they don't actually show the true
proportions of the continents.

00:35:00.465 --> 00:35:02.227
The scale is not right.

00:35:02.227 --> 00:35:04.067
And that is also very interesting.

00:35:04.067 --> 00:35:07.831
So, in effect, it's fixed.

00:35:08.761 --> 00:35:10.102
It's always the same.

00:35:10.102 --> 00:35:13.102
And I think that we need to
look for the complexity in things.

00:35:13.102 --> 00:35:16.715
And we often don't think about it
because we're not taught to do that.

00:35:16.715 --> 00:35:18.955
And so, with the map,
the children are the same

00:35:18.955 --> 00:35:20.533
they say, "that map isn't right."

00:35:20.533 --> 00:35:23.157
And, my son said to me the first time,

00:35:23.157 --> 00:35:25.120
"But, Dad, France isn't even on it.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.932
That's not right."

00:35:26.932 --> 00:35:29.061
Then when he saw how small
France was he said

00:35:29.061 --> 00:35:30.545
"No, that's not really France."

00:35:30.545 --> 00:35:33.594
He felt a little worse about himself.

00:35:33.594 --> 00:35:35.460
And really, that's the point.

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:39.487
It's showing that, actually,
in our customs

00:35:39.487 --> 00:35:41.512
the ones we're brought up with

00:35:41.512 --> 00:35:43.779
there are some things
that are entrenched.

00:35:43.779 --> 00:35:46.220
And they're really stupid things

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:49.652
like categorizing people based on
their skin color.

00:35:49.652 --> 00:35:53.791
One day when my son, Fred
—my second son—was four or five

00:35:54.958 --> 00:35:59.385
I said to him, "My love, tell me are
you the only black child in your class?"

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.371
And the kid said, "I'm not black, Dad."

00:36:02.371 --> 00:36:03.181
And I thought

00:36:03.181 --> 00:36:05.736
"He has a problem,
he doesn't accept his color."

00:36:05.736 --> 00:36:09.265
"There's something there 
that we need to work through."

00:36:10.483 --> 00:36:12.290
I said, "Oh, you're not black?"

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:14.630
He said, "Well no, I'm brown."

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:16.838
I said, "Ah OK, but my dear,

00:36:16.838 --> 00:36:19.408
what color are the
other kids in your class?"

00:36:19.408 --> 00:36:21.576
He said, "They're pink."

00:36:22.738 --> 00:36:25.964
But it's very interesting as
when I play the game with the kids

00:36:25.964 --> 00:36:30.612
we're using categories
that aren't actually real.

00:36:31.782 --> 00:36:34.427
Because you, you're said
to be what? Black?

00:36:34.427 --> 00:36:35.741
I don't know, dark brown?

00:36:35.741 --> 00:36:38.242
OK, there you go!
But why are you giggling, madam?

00:36:39.715 --> 00:36:42.034
Because there are different
levels of black!

00:36:42.754 --> 00:36:44.223
And that's what's interesting.

00:36:44.223 --> 00:36:46.842
And I'll tell you another story
to really make you think

00:36:46.842 --> 00:36:49.067
about these false categories.

00:36:49.067 --> 00:36:51.235
One time, I walked into a bar

00:36:51.235 --> 00:36:54.404
And a man there said, "Mr. Thuram,

00:36:54.404 --> 00:36:57.369
a person of color was asking for you."

00:36:57.369 --> 00:36:59.049
I said, "Oh? A person of color?"

00:36:59.049 --> 00:37:01.811
"What color was he?"

00:37:02.282 --> 00:37:04.452
And he said, "Damn,
Thuram doesn't understand me."

00:37:04.452 --> 00:37:06.526
He said, "Well no,
he's a person of color!"

00:37:06.526 --> 00:37:08.500
I said,
"Yeah, but was he yellow or red?"

00:37:09.456 --> 00:37:11.041
And he just left. He gave up.

00:37:11.041 --> 00:37:13.895
This is just to show that we often
"use person of color"

00:37:13.895 --> 00:37:19.155
as if white wasn't a color.

00:37:19.155 --> 00:37:21.427
But, these categories are significant.

00:37:21.427 --> 00:37:22.903
They were created in the past

00:37:22.903 --> 00:37:25.887
and they mean they are colored,
they are not like us.

00:37:25.887 --> 00:37:28.223
They can't have the same rights as us.

00:37:28.223 --> 00:37:31.031
It's never an accident
when we talk about us and them.

00:37:31.031 --> 00:37:32.618
That means something.

00:37:32.618 --> 00:37:35.365
It means some people are delegitimized.

00:37:35.365 --> 00:37:38.163
They don't need the same rights as us.

00:37:38.163 --> 00:37:39.722
That's it.

00:37:39.722 --> 00:37:42.010
I'll ask one last question
as it's one p.m. and

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:44.388
I'd like to pass the
microphone to my colleagues.

00:37:44.388 --> 00:37:47.440
When we were preparing the talk,
you said, "I'm not claiming to be the voice of truth,

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.960
I just want us to move forward together."

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.484
So, if we move forward together,
how can we help you?

00:37:51.484 --> 00:37:52.942
How can we contribute?

00:37:52.942 --> 00:37:55.942
And when I say we, I'm talking about
the people here, Googlers,

00:37:55.942 --> 00:37:58.056
but also beyond that, how do you work

00:37:58.056 --> 00:38:01.139
with people who aren't part
of the foundation?

00:38:01.139 --> 00:38:02.957
Look, there's the foundation director,

00:38:02.957 --> 00:38:05.587
if he can be of technical assistance,
or I don't know,

00:38:05.587 --> 00:38:09.583
but for me the idea is for each of us
to be able to ask questions

00:38:09.583 --> 00:38:12.911
about ourselves and the people around us.

00:38:12.911 --> 00:38:15.911
Because really,
sometimes we don't ask questions

00:38:15.911 --> 00:38:18.911
or sometimes we hear certain things,
and we don't call people out

00:38:18.911 --> 00:38:21.134
by saying, "Listen, you can't say that."

00:38:21.134 --> 00:38:23.184
"That needs to change, that's not right."

00:38:23.184 --> 00:38:26.391
And we tend to think that
as individuals, we can't do anything.

00:38:26.391 --> 00:38:30.694
But we can. Just paying attention
to your own behavior

00:38:30.694 --> 00:38:36.477
and also having the courage
to confront your own prejudices.

00:38:36.477 --> 00:38:38.845
Because some people say,
"No, I'm not prejudiced."

00:38:38.845 --> 00:38:41.123
No, every one of us has prejudices

00:38:41.123 --> 00:38:43.410
and prejudices are very important

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:47.724
for humans. Because we need to act fast.

00:38:47.724 --> 00:38:50.124
They are thoughts...
so prejudices are sort of a

00:38:50.124 --> 00:38:51.894
quick... they help us think quickly.

00:38:51.894 --> 00:38:54.963
So, sometimes, that can cause us to do
stupid things.

00:38:54.963 --> 00:38:57.581
So, pay attention. That's the first thing.

00:38:57.581 --> 00:38:59.236
That's how you can help me.

00:38:59.236 --> 00:39:01.748
- I'd be very happy to do that. Easily.
-Yeah, yeah.

00:39:01.748 --> 00:39:03.078
It's your turn, my friends.

00:39:03.078 --> 00:39:04.710
Does anyone have a question for...

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:06.788
But use the microphones
at the back, please.

00:39:06.788 --> 00:39:09.651
So we can see you on the camera
when you ask a question.

00:39:09.651 --> 00:39:12.638
OK listen, next time 
you should go at the back.

00:39:12.638 --> 00:39:16.923
The next time, you go at the back,
that's how it is.

00:39:17.701 --> 00:39:19.792
- Hello, thank you for being here.
- Hello.

00:39:19.792 --> 00:39:23.886
I had a question about
some French territories

00:39:23.886 --> 00:39:30.178
that have accepted the cosmopolitan
aspect of their populations really well.

00:39:30.178 --> 00:39:32.161
In particular, the island of Réunion

00:39:32.161 --> 00:39:36.398
in the Indian Ocean.

00:39:36.398 --> 00:39:40.821
Where many types of people come together

00:39:40.821 --> 00:39:46.520
dark brown, Asian, Hindu, Pakistani...

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:50.186
And at the end of the day, 
this mix works really well.

00:39:52.004 --> 00:39:55.685
What are the lessons,
from your experience

00:39:55.685 --> 00:39:58.685
and having discussed this in your talks

00:39:58.685 --> 00:40:03.811
that we can learn from this island?

00:40:03.811 --> 00:40:07.273
And how can we apply them

00:40:07.273 --> 00:40:10.273
to change the mentality
of all French people?

00:40:10.273 --> 00:40:13.838
OK, so first of all

00:40:13.838 --> 00:40:18.437
what they have in Réunion
is a variety of skin colors

00:40:18.437 --> 00:40:22.154
but even within this variety
of skin colors, there are hierarchies.

00:40:22.154 --> 00:40:24.841
We mustn't deny that. Even in Réunion.

00:40:24.841 --> 00:40:27.735
And the hierarchy will be
from the lightest to the darkest.

00:40:27.735 --> 00:40:31.069
Because, once again,
this culture goes back a long way.

00:40:31.069 --> 00:40:35.833
Then, I believe we need to encourage
young people in particular

00:40:35.833 --> 00:40:39.791
to understand that society
is moving in the right direction.

00:40:39.791 --> 00:40:41.977
Because it often seems

00:40:41.977 --> 00:40:45.467
like things can only get worse.

00:40:45.467 --> 00:40:48.415
And so we should always
encourage questioning.

00:40:48.415 --> 00:40:51.588
And also seriously question people

00:40:51.588 --> 00:40:54.494
from the dominant category.

00:40:54.494 --> 00:40:58.823
To show that we need to accept diversity.

00:40:58.823 --> 00:41:01.782
But, we already have diversity.

00:41:01.782 --> 00:41:04.798
I mean, when you go to the station.

00:41:04.798 --> 00:41:07.724
- Which station is near...? 
- Saint-Lazare. - Saint-Lazare.

00:41:07.724 --> 00:41:09.884
You can see diversity in the
train station.

00:41:09.884 --> 00:41:12.931
Then, the dangerous thing

00:41:12.931 --> 00:41:17.193
is the elite who want 
to make us believe we have to like this

00:41:17.193 --> 00:41:21.934
and talk about that. And I also think
it's bad... to make a change

00:41:21.934 --> 00:41:25.199
we need to cut certain people off
on the television.

00:41:25.199 --> 00:41:28.199
Because, actually

00:41:28.199 --> 00:41:32.567
they incite hatred. Because when
I talk about hierarchy

00:41:32.567 --> 00:41:36.623
when I talk about hierarchy,
according to skin color, for example,

00:41:36.623 --> 00:41:40.900
that creates certain advantages
for the people at the top

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:44.422
but it also angers

00:41:44.422 --> 00:41:48.389
the people who are subordinated.

00:41:48.389 --> 00:41:52.374
And so that's why we need to work
to destroy these hierarchies

00:41:52.374 --> 00:41:54.161
for a fairer society

00:41:54.161 --> 00:41:57.115
and so that people
don't need to be so angry.

00:41:58.584 --> 00:42:02.466
But, it is true that Réunion
is a good example to follow. There you go.

00:42:02.466 --> 00:42:05.812
Because, actually, they also have
every religion

00:42:05.812 --> 00:42:07.261
and things are fine.

00:42:07.261 --> 00:42:10.464
But there are people who say
that Réunion is not French.

00:42:11.387 --> 00:42:13.847
- In any case, they have a post code.
- Pardon?

00:42:13.847 --> 00:42:16.224
He said a post code. It's true.

00:42:18.377 --> 00:42:20.333
There you go.

00:42:20.822 --> 00:42:22.889
- Hello, so, I'm Maria Streed,
- Hello.

00:42:22.889 --> 00:42:25.893
Some of my colleagues and I founded

00:42:25.893 --> 00:42:29.746
Women at Google,
which is a network for women

00:42:29.746 --> 00:42:31.612
in Google—a global network.

00:42:31.612 --> 00:42:35.833
I would like your opinion on
this type of inter-company network

00:42:35.833 --> 00:42:38.663
because you were talking about
uniqueness, individuality

00:42:38.663 --> 00:42:42.145
that let us organize events
for men and women

00:42:42.145 --> 00:42:44.045
but also many events just for women.

00:42:44.045 --> 00:42:46.000
I would like your opinion on this.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.020
Well, personally, I think that's great.

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:51.327
Because sometimes we need
to talk to each other

00:42:51.327 --> 00:42:54.502
I mean, really, when I talk about

00:42:54.502 --> 00:42:57.094
every one of us being unique

00:42:57.094 --> 00:42:59.868
that can also be problematic.

00:42:59.868 --> 00:43:01.298
I won't lie.

00:43:01.298 --> 00:43:04.098
So, it's very important to have times

00:43:04.098 --> 00:43:07.826
where you can talk to each other
and discuss how you

00:43:07.826 --> 00:43:09.941
are going to change things.

00:43:09.941 --> 00:43:13.032
But there are also times
when you need to ask men along

00:43:13.032 --> 00:43:15.083
so you can tell them this.

00:43:15.083 --> 00:43:18.010
Because sometimes
there are things men don't understand.

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:19.927
Because we're not women.
It's true.

00:43:19.927 --> 00:43:22.677
So, it's good to talk among yourselves.

00:43:22.677 --> 00:43:25.599
To have discussions. But we often

00:43:25.599 --> 00:43:29.149
tend to see that as a very negative thing.

00:43:29.149 --> 00:43:32.478
Because we sometimes don't realize that

00:43:32.478 --> 00:43:34.341
men do this a lot.

00:43:34.341 --> 00:43:36.281
but they don't need to explain it

00:43:36.281 --> 00:43:40.111
it happens very naturally, sometimes you
go and there are only men there,

00:43:40.111 --> 00:43:42.705
but the men don't notice.
There you go.

00:43:43.805 --> 00:43:46.405
So, it's a good thing.

00:43:47.537 --> 00:43:51.444
First, congratulations on your work with
the foundation,

00:43:51.444 --> 00:43:54.390
and for your two goals 
against Croatia as well.

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:56.620
That's for the younger people here.

00:43:56.620 --> 00:44:01.113
That wasn't me, it was someone else.

00:44:01.113 --> 00:44:05.988
You talked about the racist phenomena
that you came across in the stadiums

00:44:05.988 --> 00:44:09.305
when you were in Italy,
I think it was in Parma

00:44:09.305 --> 00:44:13.062
and 20 years later we are seeing news
stories about Blaise Matuidi and in France

00:44:13.062 --> 00:44:14.792
we see these things happen

00:44:14.792 --> 00:44:16.300
more and more in the stadiums.

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:18.960
How would you explain the lack of progress

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:22.026
in this area after 20 years?

00:44:22.026 --> 00:44:25.908
Well, first of all,
when I played in Italy they were actually

00:44:26.913 --> 00:44:29.000
making monkey noises.

00:44:29.784 --> 00:44:32.764
I think that if things haven't changed

00:44:33.613 --> 00:44:37.301
it's because there is no
real desire for this to stop.

00:44:38.097 --> 00:44:41.973
And when I was
playing soccer in Italy

00:44:41.973 --> 00:44:44.180
and journalists came to ask me questions

00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:46.894
and often told me what I should do.

00:44:46.894 --> 00:44:48.845
But I said,
"You must understand that I can't.

00:44:48.845 --> 00:44:50.757
I'm not the one who can solve this."

00:44:50.757 --> 00:44:53.047
The victim of racism isn't the one

00:44:53.047 --> 00:44:54.797
who can find a solution.

00:44:54.797 --> 00:44:58.197
It's everyone else.
And this is what I said to them,

00:44:58.197 --> 00:44:59.717
"For me, it's very simple.

00:44:59.717 --> 00:45:02.237
If the people who aren't
victims of racism right now,

00:45:02.237 --> 00:45:04.222
meaning those who judge me
by my skin color,

00:45:04.222 --> 00:45:06.517
the people, 
the players who aren't black,

00:45:06.517 --> 00:45:10.488
leave the pitch, believe me,
that would have a huge impact,

00:45:10.488 --> 00:45:12.553
and that would lead to change.

00:45:12.553 --> 00:45:15.075
Because when a black player
leaves the pitch

00:45:15.075 --> 00:45:16.655
the game carries on.

00:45:16.655 --> 00:45:19.050
The problem is that it's a business

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:21.231
because that's what soccer is,
it's a business

00:45:21.231 --> 00:45:23.274
and they don't want
to damage the business.

00:45:23.274 --> 00:45:27.741
So, no meaningful decisions are taken.

00:45:27.741 --> 00:45:29.855
And I think, really,

00:45:29.855 --> 00:45:32.165
it's not that difficult

00:45:32.165 --> 00:45:34.194
to change, and to start with

00:45:34.194 --> 00:45:37.139
we can find out exactly who
people are in the stands.

00:45:37.139 --> 00:45:40.423
And so, it requires a political will
and the will of the club

00:45:40.423 --> 00:45:43.307
to stop it, and I think it's
that will that's needed.

00:45:43.307 --> 00:45:48.196
And I'll say it again, I'm convinced that
in order to change people's mentalities...

00:45:48.196 --> 00:45:50.874
it's not the people
who are discriminated against

00:45:50.874 --> 00:45:52.564
who can change mentalities.

00:45:52.564 --> 00:45:55.537
People who are discriminated against
can strongly criticize

00:45:55.537 --> 00:45:59.398
can meet up to talk,
but they absolutely need

00:45:59.398 --> 00:46:03.008
people from the other side
who think it's unjust.

00:46:03.008 --> 00:46:04.906
And what's interesting in our society,

00:46:04.906 --> 00:46:09.057
I think that more and more people who
aren't victims of racism,

00:46:09.057 --> 00:46:12.200
are intervening to denounce it.
That is why society,

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:15.390
I'm talking about nowadays, is better than
the one my grandfather

00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:17.100
or my mother lived in.

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:20.353
Because I think there are a lot of
people who won't put up with it.

00:46:20.353 --> 00:46:23.582
They don't wait to experience 
racism before they condemn it.

00:46:23.582 --> 00:46:27.496
They don't wait to experience
homophobia before they condemn it.

00:46:27.496 --> 00:46:28.999
There you go.

00:46:29.338 --> 00:46:32.433
Thank you, Lilian, and maybe,
to pick up on that point

00:46:32.433 --> 00:46:35.409
it's interesting to note what's
happened in the US this summer

00:46:35.409 --> 00:46:38.789
with the quarterback Colin Kaepernick,

00:46:38.789 --> 00:46:44.042
who wanted to make a strong statement on 
the violence against black people

00:46:44.042 --> 00:46:44.872
in the US.

00:46:44.872 --> 00:46:47.645
And it seemed like there was
a certain amount of solidarity

00:46:47.645 --> 00:46:49.907
from the owners of the
American Football clubs,

00:46:49.907 --> 00:46:52.191
but, sadly the player doesn't play anymore

00:46:52.191 --> 00:46:55.285
and it's...
It's a bit of a mixed...

00:46:55.285 --> 00:46:57.865
result.

00:46:57.865 --> 00:47:00.212
The question I wanted to ask you was

00:47:00.212 --> 00:47:05.236
OK, everyone here knows about the
French team's victory in 1998.

00:47:05.236 --> 00:47:08.910
in your opinion, is it still
a genuine political symbol

00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:12.149
or is it a sporting victory?
And finally, is the type of

00:47:12.149 --> 00:47:15.064
story they tell about this French team

00:47:15.064 --> 00:47:17.925
in your opinion, was it just journalism

00:47:17.925 --> 00:47:20.379
or do you think there was
real political impact

00:47:20.379 --> 00:47:22.219
in what you did?

00:47:22.219 --> 00:47:26.132
I think it had a genuine impact on society

00:47:27.078 --> 00:47:29.525
first of all, there were questions

00:47:29.525 --> 00:47:32.024
that were accepted more readily.

00:47:33.722 --> 00:47:40.633
The year of the victory was 150 years
after abolition in France

00:47:40.933 --> 00:47:43.205
so there as well,
people were asking questions.

00:47:43.205 --> 00:47:45.591
And since then,
people have been questioning

00:47:45.591 --> 00:47:47.669
French society.

00:47:47.669 --> 00:47:52.685
And when people ask questions,
other people get upset.

00:47:54.312 --> 00:47:58.325
But that's very important,
like your example of the quarterback.

00:47:58.325 --> 00:48:00.545
He's not part of the club anymore,

00:48:00.545 --> 00:48:02.632
but that's in keeping with history.

00:48:02.632 --> 00:48:05.876
That is, people who intervene

00:48:05.876 --> 00:48:08.879
to condemn injustice very often

00:48:08.879 --> 00:48:10.202
pay the price.

00:48:10.202 --> 00:48:12.251
But that's the same
in any group, isn't it?

00:48:12.251 --> 00:48:14.911
Even here, if someone came along saying

00:48:14.911 --> 00:48:17.544
"No, but listen, you need
to change what you're doing."

00:48:17.544 --> 00:48:20.007
The first time, OK, the second,

00:48:20.007 --> 00:48:22.293
the third time you say,
"Right, what's he doing?"

00:48:22.293 --> 00:48:25.736
OK, because in any setting
you'd get upset.

00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:28.350
And that's why we must teach
children in particular

00:48:28.350 --> 00:48:30.260
to not be afraid of upsetting people.

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:34.014
Because the more people who get upset

00:48:34.014 --> 00:48:35.644
the more things will evolve

00:48:35.644 --> 00:48:37.821
because you can't get rid of everyone.

00:48:37.821 --> 00:48:40.373
And at some point you have to listen.

00:48:40.373 --> 00:48:43.334
And that's what's happening
in France at the moment.

00:48:43.334 --> 00:48:45.334
There's tension in the air.

00:48:45.334 --> 00:48:48.509
And in my opinion something
new is going to come of that.

00:48:48.509 --> 00:48:50.753
And we need to break our habits,

00:48:50.753 --> 00:48:53.753
every one of us,
and it's difficult to change our ways.

00:48:53.753 --> 00:48:55.877
We don't want to change our customs.

00:48:55.877 --> 00:48:58.616
And when we ask you
to give us more equality,

00:48:58.616 --> 00:49:02.434
to question history, you don't want to.

00:49:02.434 --> 00:49:06.692
Recently, there was this desire,
a petition that I signed

00:49:06.692 --> 00:49:10.083
about...

00:49:10.083 --> 00:49:14.138
Damn...
the guy who established the Code Noir...

00:49:15.193 --> 00:49:17.308
Who was it? Colbert, thank you!

00:49:17.308 --> 00:49:20.590
Colbert! But none
of the journalists understood.

00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:22.588
"But what's it about? It doesn't matter!"

00:49:22.598 --> 00:49:24.768
But if you don't understand the history

00:49:24.768 --> 00:49:26.868
and if people didn't intervene

00:49:26.868 --> 00:49:29.868
sometimes, who aren't afraid
of not being understood

00:49:29.868 --> 00:49:32.451
you have to persist.

00:49:32.451 --> 00:49:34.897
And that's it really.
You have to persist, and keep persisting.

00:49:34.897 --> 00:49:36.865
To try to break through

00:49:36.865 --> 00:49:39.964
the status quo to reach the next level.

00:49:39.964 --> 00:49:45.289
Knowing that you are going to get 
criticized because you won't be understood.

00:49:45.289 --> 00:49:47.539
Because, for example, 
there might be people in the room

00:49:47.539 --> 00:49:49.653
who don't understand
what's being discussed.

00:49:49.653 --> 00:49:52.448
Or, there might be people
in the room who don't understand

00:49:52.448 --> 00:49:57.930
why you can't dress up as a black person
the way Griezmann did.

00:49:57.930 --> 00:49:59.467
They'll say, "But that's OK."

00:49:59.467 --> 00:50:02.464
If you can't do that anymore,
then you can't do anything.

00:50:02.464 --> 00:50:05.027
You'll see, we can't do anything anymore.

00:50:05.027 --> 00:50:07.133
Yes, you can do things,
but not like before.

00:50:07.133 --> 00:50:09.329
And that's the difficult thing.

00:50:10.007 --> 00:50:13.333
That's how the history of the world goes.

00:50:13.333 --> 00:50:16.972
So, we have to keep
wanting to change things

00:50:16.972 --> 00:50:19.299
and wanting to create more equality.

00:50:19.299 --> 00:50:20.700
That's it.

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:21.854
- Thanks
- You're welcome.

00:50:22.326 --> 00:50:24.893
- What's happening? It's going well.
- It's going well.

00:50:24.893 --> 00:50:27.432
We have five minutes left
and two questions, right?

00:50:28.109 --> 00:50:29.929
- Yes, two. I'll be quick.
- Perfect.

00:50:29.929 --> 00:50:32.842
I would like your opinion on
political solutions

00:50:32.842 --> 00:50:35.672
like they have in the United States
where they have quotas

00:50:35.672 --> 00:50:38.672
which, on the one hand, sadly,
put some people in boxes,

00:50:38.672 --> 00:50:40.643
and say, "OK, you are a minority, etc."

00:50:40.643 --> 00:50:42.672
But, on the other hand,
create role models

00:50:42.672 --> 00:50:45.309
and that can also change
people's mentalities.

00:50:45.309 --> 00:50:48.410
They say, "OK, you can
be black and the president, etc. etc."

00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:52.313
So, I would like to know what you think
of this solution in the United States.

00:50:52.313 --> 00:50:55.659
Well, first, I think that

00:50:55.659 --> 00:50:59.272
when we call it
"positive discrimination", in France,

00:50:59.272 --> 00:51:01.148
that's not the right word.

00:51:01.148 --> 00:51:04.973
Because, really, nobody
wants to be discriminated.

00:51:07.458 --> 00:51:10.917
I think that perhaps we need to

00:51:10.917 --> 00:51:15.003
describe its history and say that,
actually, we need to restore balance.

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:17.147
We need to restore balance.

00:51:17.147 --> 00:51:21.664
So, obviously, most people 
won't agree with that.

00:51:21.664 --> 00:51:25.986
Why? Because, effectively,
they feel rejected.

00:51:25.986 --> 00:51:29.138
And they aren't used to being rejected.

00:51:29.138 --> 00:51:32.414
That means,
this young, dark-brown woman,

00:51:32.414 --> 00:51:35.803
normally, if she understands
the society that she grew up in,

00:51:35.803 --> 00:51:38.761
would realize that
there's a chance she will be rejected,

00:51:38.761 --> 00:51:43.156
so she prepares herself, saying,
"Potentially, it could happen."

00:51:43.156 --> 00:51:46.156
But really, I think that it's about
restoring balance.

00:51:46.156 --> 00:51:50.927
Because historically, if you were a women,
you were discriminated against.

00:51:50.927 --> 00:51:54.072
But something I often notice is
that people say

00:51:54.072 --> 00:51:57.490
"Yeah, but even so, they
wouldn't give someone that position

00:51:57.490 --> 00:51:59.840
if that person weren't competent."

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:01.378
But, that's not the real story.

00:52:01.378 --> 00:52:04.693
Sometimes, you can be competent
and not get the position.

00:52:04.693 --> 00:52:06.794
And if you're a man

00:52:06.794 --> 00:52:09.884
you have the right to not be competent
and still get the position.

00:52:09.884 --> 00:52:11.731
So the idea is to restore balance.

00:52:13.157 --> 00:52:16.124
But I can understand why
some people don't want that.

00:52:16.779 --> 00:52:20.697
But I think that it's very
important to change things fairly.

00:52:20.697 --> 00:52:23.331
Because you obviously need a template.

00:52:23.331 --> 00:52:25.057
Obviously.

00:52:27.102 --> 00:52:31.285
Hello, you have spoken about
your work with children

00:52:31.285 --> 00:52:33.186
what about adults,
is there a right age

00:52:33.186 --> 00:52:36.186
for unlearning racism?

00:52:36.186 --> 00:52:40.008
Really, there's not a correct age.
But it's more complicated for adults.

00:52:40.008 --> 00:52:42.057
Because you think in terms of certainties.

00:52:42.057 --> 00:52:44.971
And you have been
brought up in a particular way.

00:52:44.971 --> 00:52:49.468
If you talk to your parents,
or your grandparents

00:52:49.468 --> 00:52:54.022
they lived in a world
where there were certainties.

00:52:54.022 --> 00:52:57.217
For example, we'll talk about the
relationship between men and women.

00:52:57.217 --> 00:53:02.046
When you look at older generations

00:53:02.046 --> 00:53:06.612
the hierarchy between 
men and women is more marked.

00:53:06.612 --> 00:53:09.373
So, that's why I say 
it's sometimes difficult to change

00:53:09.373 --> 00:53:12.970
older people, but that doesn't mean...

00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:15.039
when we have exhibitions...

00:53:15.039 --> 00:53:18.110
for example, we had an exhibition 
at the Musée de l'Homme

00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:23.909
where we explained—by the way there's a
film out at the moment, about Barnum.

00:53:23.909 --> 00:53:26.431
- You know who he is? OK.
- Yeah.

00:53:26.431 --> 00:53:28.460
- The Greatest Showman.
- OK.

00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:31.689
You need to know that not so long ago,

00:53:31.689 --> 00:53:34.230
we exhibited people in the zoo.

00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:36.432
Black people,

00:53:36.432 --> 00:53:40.746
Native Americans,
Orientals, as they called them, in fact

00:53:40.746 --> 00:53:44.023
for many Europeans, the first time
they saw these types of people

00:53:44.023 --> 00:53:45.153
was at the zoo.

00:53:45.153 --> 00:53:47.281
But, maybe you didn't know that.

00:53:47.281 --> 00:53:51.896
But that went on for a long time

00:53:51.896 --> 00:53:55.234
and that created a culture of viewing
people as exhibits.

00:53:55.234 --> 00:53:57.559
And recently, we went to

00:53:57.559 --> 00:54:01.039
I think it was the zoo
in Cologne, in Germany,

00:54:01.039 --> 00:54:03.154
and over the entrance

00:54:03.931 --> 00:54:05.827
there were animals and humans.

00:54:05.827 --> 00:54:07.614
Meaning, by walking through that door

00:54:07.614 --> 00:54:09.924
you could see animals and humans.

00:54:09.924 --> 00:54:11.949
In the Jardin d'Acclimatation in Paris

00:54:11.949 --> 00:54:15.270
they used to have human exhibits.

00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:18.470
By the way, I believe Christian Karembeu's

00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:22.530
great-grandparents were exhibited there.

00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:25.736
But, we are the products of that history.

00:54:25.736 --> 00:54:30.408
So, the way we look at people 
is significant.

00:54:30.408 --> 00:54:31.769
It comes from somewhere.

00:54:31.769 --> 00:54:34.761
And if they present

00:54:34.761 --> 00:54:36.962
people to you as savages

00:54:36.962 --> 00:54:38.652
you're going to believe it's true.

00:54:38.652 --> 00:54:41.193
And that's a cultural thing.

00:54:42.974 --> 00:54:46.325
And so when you come
across them outside of the zoo

00:54:46.325 --> 00:54:48.138
you're going to be a bit frightened.

00:54:48.138 --> 00:54:51.322
One thing I find remarkable,
that makes me wonder, is...

00:54:51.322 --> 00:54:53.708
They say that diversity scares people.

00:54:54.878 --> 00:54:58.116
Do you agree that diversity isn't scary?

00:54:59.258 --> 00:55:01.059
Maybe you are, a little.

00:55:01.169 --> 00:55:03.459
- Why me?
- I don't know.

00:55:03.459 --> 00:55:05.141
It's because I'm in the front row.

00:55:05.141 --> 00:55:08.748
But, they frequently say,
"diversity scares people."

00:55:08.748 --> 00:55:11.865
But when you are at the station,
or on a train

00:55:11.865 --> 00:55:14.205
you don't know the other people.

00:55:14.205 --> 00:55:17.047
There are people who are scared.
Take me as an example.

00:55:17.047 --> 00:55:21.694
When I was a young player
a very long time ago

00:55:22.851 --> 00:55:27.251
with my teammates who had dark-brown skin

00:55:27.251 --> 00:55:29.084
we knew that other people were afraid.

00:55:29.084 --> 00:55:30.667
I don't know why.

00:55:30.667 --> 00:55:33.097
I don't know why, because nobody had said,

00:55:33.097 --> 00:55:34.381
"Careful, they're afraid."

00:55:34.381 --> 00:55:37.222
But from the way they acted,
we knew that they were afraid.

00:55:37.222 --> 00:55:38.860
We knew it.

00:55:40.058 --> 00:55:42.985
Nobody had explained it to us,
but in our heads

00:55:42.985 --> 00:55:45.695
we said, "they're afraid of black people."

00:55:46.695 --> 00:55:48.262
Not you, madam.

00:55:48.262 --> 00:55:50.533
But that's how it was, do you see?

00:55:50.533 --> 00:55:53.447
And so, really, it's education.

00:55:53.447 --> 00:55:56.709
And that's why I think we need to
focus our efforts

00:55:56.709 --> 00:56:00.891
on children, because they
are less conditioned.

00:56:00.891 --> 00:56:04.853
When I talk about certain 
things with my mother

00:56:04.853 --> 00:56:06.435
it's surreal.

00:56:06.435 --> 00:56:08.415
When she was at school, they taught her

00:56:08.415 --> 00:56:10.197
that her ancestors were Gauls.

00:56:10.197 --> 00:56:12.644
I asked my mother,
"How could you believe that?"

00:56:12.644 --> 00:56:14.585
There's a problem there, right?

00:56:14.585 --> 00:56:17.625
She said, 
"But, that's what we learned at school."

00:56:17.625 --> 00:56:20.250
So, we need to question 
the things we learn in school.

00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:22.678
They might teach us some
strange things in school

00:56:22.678 --> 00:56:25.068
even nowadays, right?

00:56:25.068 --> 00:56:26.455
Christopher Columbus?

00:56:28.895 --> 00:56:31.176
What's your ethnic origin, madam?

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:33.515
You shouldn't sit in the front row.

00:56:33.515 --> 00:56:36.445
Central African?
Who discovered Central Africa?

00:56:37.012 --> 00:56:38.610
Oh, you don't know?

00:56:38.610 --> 00:56:40.489
It was Christopher Columbus.

00:56:41.194 --> 00:56:42.688
Did you not know that?

00:56:42.688 --> 00:56:44.531
It's an interesting example

00:56:44.531 --> 00:56:47.907
to help us understand.
That's why I tell the story,

00:56:49.313 --> 00:56:53.070
I think it was the
Treaty of Berlin in 1865

00:56:53.070 --> 00:56:54.910
when Africa was divided up.

00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:56.527
Had you heard of that?

00:56:56.527 --> 00:56:59.268
OK, but that's interesting to know.

00:56:59.268 --> 00:57:03.883
And the problems, the power relations

00:57:03.883 --> 00:57:07.003
between Europe and Africa
still exist today.

00:57:07.003 --> 00:57:08.355
We mustn't be naive.

00:57:08.355 --> 00:57:11.406
These power relations still exist.

00:57:11.406 --> 00:57:14.575
And, really, we need to question them

00:57:14.575 --> 00:57:17.456
because I think these power relations

00:57:17.456 --> 00:57:20.898
whether that's during slavery
or as part of modern colonization

00:57:20.898 --> 00:57:23.652
come from a small number of people.

00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:26.580
But that depends on the discussion.

00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:30.453
The exhibition that we put on
about the East...

00:57:30.453 --> 00:57:34.247
even today there's an element of fantasy
in the way we talk about the East.

00:57:35.537 --> 00:57:38.496
Even we end up believing in it.

00:57:38.496 --> 00:57:40.343
And that's the thing.

00:57:40.343 --> 00:57:42.457
It's taking time to ask ourselves,

00:57:42.457 --> 00:57:46.347
"Am I looking at the world

00:57:46.347 --> 00:57:48.087
in the right way?"

00:57:48.087 --> 00:57:50.057
But we often don't ask that question.

00:57:50.057 --> 00:57:53.156
For you, coming from Central Africa,
it's not the same?

00:57:53.156 --> 00:57:56.780
Right? What do people see
when they look at Central Africa?

00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:59.272
Nothing? Really?

00:57:59.272 --> 00:58:02.679
She's not answering me, 
she's having trouble.

00:58:02.679 --> 00:58:04.679
Another question.

00:58:04.679 --> 00:58:08.345
Thank you very much,
it's 33 minutes past, I know you all..

00:58:08.345 --> 00:58:11.419
Thank you.

00:58:11.419 --> 00:58:12.903
Thank you.

00:58:17.399 --> 00:58:21.466
We can do better than that, 
it's Lilian Thuram, let's give it up!

00:58:21.466 --> 00:58:22.943
Calm down.

00:58:26.321 --> 00:58:27.856
I would like to thank you all

00:58:27.856 --> 00:58:30.470
we thought there'd be
at least one question on soccer.

00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:31.695
And it was all political.

00:58:31.695 --> 00:58:33.690
We could have had a question on soccer.

00:58:33.690 --> 00:58:35.706
I thought there'd be one,
but there wasn't.

00:58:35.706 --> 00:58:38.793
- Ask a question about soccer.

00:58:38.793 --> 00:58:39.495
Yeah.

00:58:39.495 --> 00:58:41.738
- OK, soccer then.
- I have a question about that.

00:58:41.738 --> 00:58:42.738
Go ahead.

00:58:42.738 --> 00:58:45.160
Although, I'm not really into soccer.
That's OK.

00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:48.795
- Me neither,
- What's it like to...

00:58:48.795 --> 00:58:52.795
...to score a goal in the World Cup?

00:58:52.795 --> 00:58:55.220
Against Croatia.
What did you feel in that moment?

00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:57.807
Well, to tell the truth,

00:58:58.779 --> 00:59:02.024
I think I was in a daze.

00:59:02.024 --> 00:59:03.804
No, it's true.
Because I think

00:59:03.804 --> 00:59:05.206
what people noticed

00:59:05.206 --> 00:59:07.374
when I was on my knees and all that,

00:59:07.374 --> 00:59:08.762
I think people were saying

00:59:08.762 --> 00:59:11.661
"Hey, this guy doesn't know
what's going on, he looks lost."

00:59:11.661 --> 00:59:13.970
That was the reality of it.

00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:18.732
But, actually, what's really interesting,
when I talk about soccer,

00:59:18.732 --> 00:59:21.222
especially to very young people,

00:59:21.222 --> 00:59:24.022
is telling them that
it's important to have dreams.

00:59:24.022 --> 00:59:25.558
It's really important.

00:59:25.558 --> 00:59:27.950
And you can't achieve them on your own.

00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:30.408
That's why I talk about self-esteem

00:59:30.408 --> 00:59:32.918
and learning that 
you are allowed to make mistakes.

00:59:32.918 --> 00:59:36.237
And that you improve by making mistakes.

00:59:36.237 --> 00:59:38.107
I know this is an American company

00:59:38.107 --> 00:59:41.054
it's partly the culture: in 
France, you can't make mistakes.

00:59:41.054 --> 00:59:44.405
Because otherwise, and I think this is
what we need to encourage...

00:59:44.405 --> 00:59:47.175
we need to tell children,
not to be afraid to make mistakes

00:59:47.175 --> 00:59:49.221
because that's how you progress.

00:59:49.221 --> 00:59:51.701
And most importantly,
you can't succeed on your own.

00:59:51.701 --> 00:59:55.684
Because they tried
portray me as a superhero

00:59:55.684 --> 00:59:58.911
when I scored, but it's quite the opposite

00:59:58.911 --> 01:00:01.733
you don't win matches on your own,
it's not possible. There.

01:00:01.733 --> 01:00:04.533
- Thank you very much.
- And, if you train

01:00:04.533 --> 01:00:07.022
- You could also score goals like me.
- Erm, no.

01:00:07.022 --> 01:00:10.813
- You haven't seen me play. No, no...
- I thought there was something...

01:00:10.813 --> 01:00:13.886
Even as I was saying it,
I thought there was something.

01:00:13.886 --> 01:00:16.802
But you're right, I'm terrible.

01:00:16.802 --> 01:00:19.512
Anyway, thank you, Lilian,
thank you all for coming.

01:00:19.512 --> 01:00:20.297
Thank you.

01:00:21.527 --> 01:00:23.445
Thank you.
