[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:09.524
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.524 --> 00:00:10.940
KRISTI LEWIS: So
today, I'm really

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.180
excited to have you here to
talk a little bit, not just

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.640
about the coffee, but
your path to getting

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.730
to where you have today,
to talk to you guys,

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.410
and to see how Colby has been
able to successfully live

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.010
a life of work-life
balance doing things

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.400
that he's passionate about,
and really just having an idea

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.509
and going for it.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.610
So maybe we just
start out talking

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.250
about how you decided
that you wanted

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.590
to get into the business.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.921
COLBY BARR: Sure.

00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:42.170
Thank you guys for all coming.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.085
It's pretty awesome to
be here in San Francisco

00:00:46.085 --> 00:00:49.490
at Google serving
coffee to you all.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.552
Google is-- I'll totally
get to what you said.

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:53.635
KRISTI LEWIS: That's good.

00:00:53.635 --> 00:00:56.020
COLBY BARR: Yeah, Google was
actually one of our first,

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.090
back in the day,
clients, actually,

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.820
that we ever sold coffee to--

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.879
kind of a more big league
client, out of Santa Cruz.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.810
One the first people we sold
to was on the original Google

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:08.800
campus.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.412
And our 1950 blend,
in fact, that we

00:01:13.412 --> 00:01:15.370
sell-- one of our most
popular selling blends--

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.670
was named after the
1950 building at Google.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.145
So big ups.

00:01:21.145 --> 00:01:24.026
But it's our trademark so--

00:01:24.026 --> 00:01:25.390
just kidding.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:32.190
But so, yeah, I mean, I grew
up, not really, I guess,

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.500
in the Bay Area, but
in the couple of hours

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.800
north of San
Francisco in an area--

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.770
Napa, Mendocino, Lake
County, Sonoma County.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.960
Family is from
Sonoma County, and I

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.400
grew up there farming
pears and wine grapes,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.270
and in the old kind of
classic farming family.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:02.610
And work hard, and then play
hard, but mostly work hard.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.750
And you know, my dad went to UC
Davis-- did that whole thing.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.960
And so it was really
instilled in early life

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:17.784
about really caring about food
and produce, where things come

00:02:17.784 --> 00:02:19.200
from, and also
seeing really early

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.390
on how there are a lot
of people out there

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.540
doing amazing work in food.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.730
And they're very
rarely recognized,

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.570
or even less rewarded for that.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.720
And so that was kind of always
on my mind in this back burner,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.220
which I guess we
can circle back to.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.500
But it definitely
instilled to me

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.230
these core values that
there's something out

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.000
there that exists for
doing great work and food,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.760
and that there was
an opportunity there,

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.925
but that more was a
revelation I had later.

00:02:58.925 --> 00:03:01.050
But what kind of really
kicked me into just getting

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.250
into coffee is the cliché reason
most people get into coffee,

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.692
which is you go to college.

00:03:06.692 --> 00:03:07.650
You go to coffee shops.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.191
You hang out.

00:03:08.191 --> 00:03:09.372
They're cool.

00:03:09.372 --> 00:03:10.580
You try to order cool drinks.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.020
You usually don't.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.760
You know, my gateway to
coffee was drinking mochas

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.230
that I hated.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.890
I loved everything about it
except for the espresso taste.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.670
When I was in high school,
trying to go play--

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.009
I used to play jazz, and
going and playing jazz combos,

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:31.050
and going to coffee shops,
and just sort of being

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.440
enamored with this coffeehouse
vibe-- this coffeehouse

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.000
culture.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.960
Then you go to college.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.880
And then you end up studying
there and hang out there.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.840
And you find the cool one.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.256
And you go to the
one that's cool,

00:03:41.256 --> 00:03:43.620
and not the other ones
because it's not cool.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.540
And just kind of always in
the back of my mind thought,

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.800
clichély, coffee is cool.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.980
And wouldn't it be cool some
day to do something in coffee?

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.320
More in the back of the mind--

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.690
I went and did other things, and
studied environmental science.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.080
And I did GIS, and did
that for like five years,

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.540
and did a lot of computer stuff.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.420
And then wanted to really
do something on my own,

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.070
which I guess may be coming
back to that basis of growing up

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.690
on a family farm.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.339
When you're in a
family that farms,

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:19.740
you don't clock in for work.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.790
It just is life.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.930
So I always just thought
I'd work for myself.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.000
And then after five
years of not doing that--

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.720
I kind of did.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.780
I was like a contractor.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:35.200
But I really wanted to
just start my own business.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.704
And so--

00:04:35.704 --> 00:04:38.370
KRISTI LEWIS: And this was while
you were in school, in college.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.550
COLBY BARR: This was right
after I finished college,

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.260
but I still lived
in a college town

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:51.760
up north, Chico, where I ended
up living, and going to school,

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.644
and other things.

00:04:53.644 --> 00:04:55.810
KRISTI LEWIS: We can get
back to those other things.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.690
COLBY BARR: Yeah,
yeah it was cool,

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.820
learned a lot about myself.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.560
Yeah, no, it was great though.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.830
It was perfect.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.105
It was the path I was
supposed to be on.

00:05:07.105 --> 00:05:09.830
But yeah, getting into wanting
to start my own business,

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.490
and, ultimately,
taking that leap.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:18.899
But when I thought, well, what
is the business I want to do?

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:20.690
I came back to this
thought that had always

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.550
been incubating in
the back of my mind

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.290
that well, coffee is cool.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.220
Coffee shops are cool.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:28.920
I loved music.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.560
And I just loved this--

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.950
what I thought, at that
time, had a very direct tie

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:34.780
to coffeehouses.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.546
I collect vinyl,
played in bands,

00:05:36.546 --> 00:05:38.420
only played analog
instruments, and, somehow,

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:47.500
coffee fit in the same strata
as those elements of my life.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.790
And so without a ton--

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.830
without any
experience, but I went

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.100
to talk to the guy in the
cool coffee shop in town

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.162
to ask him, would you mind--

00:06:01.162 --> 00:06:02.370
what does it take to do this?

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:03.320
How do I be great?

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.970
What does great look like?

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.470
Which was an
important lesson, I've

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.489
tried to always carry
with me moving forward.

00:06:08.489 --> 00:06:10.530
And he said, actually,
I'm thinking about selling

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:11.160
this coffee house.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.493
Are you interested in buying it?

00:06:12.493 --> 00:06:15.230
One thing led to another,
and three months later, I

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.410
was standing in the coffee shop
that I owned with not exactly

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:24.530
understanding what to do,
understaffed, and, really,

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.050
had to just feel the weight
of it all, of what it's

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.720
like to take that risk, that
commitment, and just say,

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.310
screw it.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.480
Let's do this.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.920
KRISTI LEWIS: So do you feel
that it was an out of comfort

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.860
zone type thing, where you're
like, I'm in a coffee shop,

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.630
and somebody is
presenting this to me.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.310
And I hadn't planned on it, but
now here this opportunity is.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.022
Was it an easy decision
for you to just

00:06:47.022 --> 00:06:48.230
say, Yep, I'm going to do it.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.094
Or you know, how did you
feel going into that?

00:06:51.094 --> 00:06:53.260
COLBY BARR: I don't know
if it was an easy decision,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:07:00.380
but I kind of have
a point of view

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.730
on these things, which is
that decisions are hard,

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.250
so sometimes it's best
just to corner yourself.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.780
You know, burn your bridge,
or whatever you want to say.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.340
But I make the
commitment before--

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:16.870
I'm all about analysis.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.750
I was an analyst for five years.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.940
So I'm all about
analysis and research

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.610
is my favorite thing to do in
life, probably, one of them.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.779
But at some point you just
jump, and you won't ever

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:28.820
have all the information.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.630
And I do believe a saying
that once came to me.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.050
My sister who is up
here can bear witness.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.110
The classic place where you
gather all life information

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:43.410
to make important decisions,
which is after a Prince concert

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.770
at a blackjack table at
like 2:00 in the morning.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.180
But I ended up
talking to someone

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.805
who worked in
technology, and, I guess,

00:07:49.805 --> 00:07:52.170
had built a pretty
successful company.

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:55.180
And we ended up talking
for a long time.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.200
And I just said, if you
could give some piece advice

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.330
to a young person who's wanting
to really do something special,

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.705
and, really, get to, maybe,
in a position like you're in.

00:08:04.705 --> 00:08:05.622
Not necessarily like--

00:08:05.622 --> 00:08:06.913
I don't know if he was wealthy.

00:08:06.913 --> 00:08:09.060
I'm pretty sure he might
have been, but just more--

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.400
I could just tell that he
had gotten to some place

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.040
that he felt very
satisfied with.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.870
And he just, without
even blinking,

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.610
just looked right
at me and said,

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:21.110
take chances and
overextend yourself.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:26.530
And that's sort of been
my go to since that night.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.130
And, in a way, it's
this permission

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:34.240
that some dude at a blackjack
table after a Prince concert

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.740
gave me.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.490
So, of course, it's valid
and totally trustworthy.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.860
KRISTI LEWIS: I feel like
those little things come

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.750
into your life at just
different times that

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.550
reinforce that you
are on the right path

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:46.670
and doing the right thing.

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:49.190
I mean, here you are now,
co-founder of a global company,

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:50.602
right?

00:08:50.602 --> 00:08:51.310
COLBY BARR: Yeah.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.190
KRISTI LEWIS: Yeah,
so that's awesome.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.710
COLBY BARR: Yeah, and
I think, too, I mean,

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.490
to answer a question,
the decision--

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:03.150
it wasn't easy but just feeling
like I had this permission

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.100
to make it, and
then just jumping--

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.830
choosing to jump,
instead of choosing to,

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.600
let's just wait a
little bit more.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.300
I'm more of a jumper,
for better or worse.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:17.190
But I think there is something
to that that, you know,

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.970
in life you have to
make a lot of choices.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:22.940
And so I think getting
comfortable with making

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:27.070
choices, or becoming decisive
knowing you're, for sure,

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:29.040
not going to be right.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.290
Was it the best decision I
could have made in my life?

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:31.956
I'll never know.

00:09:31.956 --> 00:09:35.090
But it was the one I
made, and it got me here.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.340
It was a stepping stone.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.910
So it was definitely
a critical decision,

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:43.640
which then led me to
my next decision, which

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.680
was to start Verve with
my business partner Ryan

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.705
who's over here.

00:09:48.705 --> 00:09:49.950
Hi, Ryan.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.174
RYAN O'DONOVAN: Hi.

00:09:51.174 --> 00:09:53.090
COLBY BARR: He doesn't
like being outed, but--

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.080
KRISTI LEWIS: So you
had your store in Chico,

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.910
or your shop in Chico,
and what was the path then

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.890
to opening up your own brand?

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.810
COLBY BARR: Well,
one year into it,

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:12.260
after being super understaffed.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:19.134
And you learn a lot when you
don't have anyone you can--

00:10:19.134 --> 00:10:20.800
when you know that
there's no one else's

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.940
responsibility but yours.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.890
There's no like that--
there's no boss.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:26.480
You look for it, and you
realize, shit, I'm it.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.190
And you just, OK, now
what am I going to do?

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.775
And you have to make calls--

00:10:30.775 --> 00:10:32.980
a lot of bad decisions,
a lot of great decisions,

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.590
but decisions nonetheless
that move you forward--

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:40.540
and learning a lot about having
the right people on the bus,

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.450
and learning what it's like to
have wrong people on the bus,

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:45.580
and have to fire people,
and do all these things.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.230
It was my first
year in business.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.020
But what came through
it-- besides the business

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:56.390
parts, and sales tax, and all
these bookkeeping things that

00:10:56.390 --> 00:11:00.601
are not my big passion,
but are super important,

00:11:00.601 --> 00:11:01.850
if you want to run a business.

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:04.129
Do not think they're
not important.

00:11:04.129 --> 00:11:06.170
Hire an accountant before
you hire anybody else--

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.510
was how much I was falling
in love with coffee.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.790
Because when I got into
coffee, it wasn't for coffee.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:16.740
It was for coffee house culture.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.260
But after one year into
it, spending every day

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.840
doing it, becoming a
barista, just, and connecting

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.130
with a couple of people--

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:25.320
a friend Sean White,
who now does Flat White.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.715
He's a ceramicist for a
lot of coffee shops around.

00:11:27.715 --> 00:11:31.430
He was our first
employee at Verve--

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:35.070
a few other people, and
dropping into the world that

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:38.700
became barista culture,
third wave coffee,

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:44.160
I became completely
enamored with coffee itself.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.070
And as an analyst,
and a researcher,

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:49.850
this trap door opened.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:50.900
And I fell through it.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:54.199
And it was the universe of just,
where does coffee come from?

00:11:54.199 --> 00:11:56.240
Why are some coffees taste
different than others?

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:56.660
What's happening?

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.530
What's up with roasting?

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:58.730
What are different origins?

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:00.740
What's up with
different varieties?

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.540
I have to know everything
about all of this.

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:07.160
And I was thinking about how
do I learn-- how do I jump in?

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.660
Because I just had
this coffee shop,

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.201
and I thought about my friend
from college who I played music

00:12:11.201 --> 00:12:14.600
with, who had been in
coffee his whole life,

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.910
and was a home roaster, and
was the biggest coffee guy

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:20.000
I knew, Ryan O'Donovan,
my business partner.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.224
And we started--

00:12:21.224 --> 00:12:23.390
I called him one day just
from a park bench in front

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:24.590
of a farmers market,
and said, dude

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:26.715
we should start a coffee
roasting company together.

00:12:26.715 --> 00:12:29.050
He had just moved
back from Portland,

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.500
working at coffee shops--
coffee shops, coffee roasters,

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.670
wholesale, everything.

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.300
And, long story
short, we just met up

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.670
a few days later, started
looking for spots,

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.940
and within a couple of
months, we signed a lease

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.440
and started Verve.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.529
KRISTI LEWIS: In Santa Cruz.

00:12:45.529 --> 00:12:46.820
COLBY BARR: Yes, in Santa Cruz.

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.370
We almost-- we originally
had opened in San Francisco.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.540
And at this time--

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.880
2005, we opened-- the
only third wave coffee

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.790
company in all of California
was Ritual on Valencia.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:59.430
In all of Cali-- and
they carried Stumptown,

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.470
and that was it for
the whole state.

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:04.950
So at this point in time if you
opened a cool company anywhere,

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.960
people everywhere knew about it.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.060
We were going to open
in San Francisco,

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:12.030
then almost opened in
Berkeley, Berkeley Oakland.

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:14.347
At the last minute,
right before we

00:13:14.347 --> 00:13:16.680
were supposed to sign the
lease, I got a call from Ryan.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.130
He just said, dude, I'm
moving to Santa Cruz

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.424
because I got my lady.

00:13:21.424 --> 00:13:23.340
We're probably going to
get married some day--

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:27.630
which he did, and they
have two awesome kids--

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:30.752
and said, this is the
lifestyle I want to have.

00:13:30.752 --> 00:13:31.710
I want to able to surf.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.418
I want to be able to
ride mountain bikes.

00:13:33.418 --> 00:13:36.840
I want to build a company
where I want to be.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:42.660
And so it kind of fell
apart for like a week or so.

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.950
And then I kind of
thought, well, let's just

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.510
go look at Santa Cruz.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:49.010
And one thing led
to another, and we

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:50.968
ended up making the
commitment there, and said,

00:13:50.968 --> 00:13:54.170
well, let's see if we can make
noise even though we're here,

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:57.910
which we didn't think
we'd be able to do,

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:01.652
but, fortunately, we
were able to do that.

00:14:01.652 --> 00:14:02.860
KRISTI LEWIS: That's awesome.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:08.700
So, basically, it goes to the
idea of work-life balance,

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:14.259
and choosing a location
that can adapt to the things

00:14:14.259 --> 00:14:16.300
that you want to do in
life, where you can pursue

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.970
this passion that you
have, a dream that you

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:20.660
have that you want
to achieve, but also

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.150
to be able to maintain
like, I want to go surfing.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.620
I want to go mountain
biking and whatnot.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.160
So can you talk a little
bit more about that,

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.960
and how you're able
to achieve that.

00:14:32.904 --> 00:14:34.320
COLBY BARR: It's
a great question.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.471
KRISTI LEWIS: You're right.

00:14:35.471 --> 00:14:37.720
COLBY BARR: It was definitely
in the ethos of starting

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.210
our company as I described.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:46.460
But I think, fast forwarding
to present day, it's hard,

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:46.960
you know?

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.570
I mean, it requires you saying
that you want to do that.

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:53.050
And then, I mean,
work-life balance--

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:56.660
I've heard work-life harmony.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:57.980
Bezos talks about that.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.530
And I think it's
interesting to think

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:06.670
about it because it's really
dependent on the individual--

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:09.760
where they're at in their life,
their age, what they want,

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.860
and what's energizing them--

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.860
to determine is
that a light switch?

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.200
Is it a yin and
yang, and they have

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.320
to be opposites, and that's
how they are distinct,

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.380
but also fuel each other.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.580
How you-- or is it a fader?

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:27.370
I think of the harmony as
multiple things at once,

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:30.790
but it's like C major, or
maybe it's like D minor

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.595
depending on your mood.

00:15:33.595 --> 00:15:34.670
I love D minor.

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:44.300
But I think it takes practice.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.590
And, again, it's different
for different people.

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:59.150
I mean, one thing, for sure,
as an exercise is just-- again,

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.980
I like cornering myself--

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.230
so is to force
yourself into doing

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.060
something, where you,
for sure, can only be

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:06.990
thinking about that one thing.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:10.010
So whether that's-- a lot
of people have sports,

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:13.239
like surfing or mountain biking,
getting into your flow state,

00:16:13.239 --> 00:16:15.530
which I know can happen on
computers in a lot different

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:16.520
ways I've experienced.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:20.000
But if you take it
into outside of work,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.150
and you can pick up an activity,
or an exercise, or something,

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.644
or yoga, float tanks.

00:16:25.644 --> 00:16:27.310
I don't know, whatever
it is for people.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:28.040
I like all that.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:34.061
But that you just have
to be in that moment

00:16:34.061 --> 00:16:35.810
because it requires
all of your attention,

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:37.250
and that's one way to break.

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:40.670
Whether it's you always
have two days off in a row,

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:45.390
or every year you take off for
a few weeks to go do something.

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:47.310
So there's a lot of
different ways to do that.

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:48.685
But I like trying
to figure out--

00:16:48.685 --> 00:16:53.030
find activities that
require all your attention.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.870
KRISTI LEWIS: That
definitely makes sense.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:58.130
I think that just, in
general, the culture here

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:00.200
is, or not here as in
Google, but here as

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.680
in the US is that it's
very work-focused,

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.069
and to be on the clock all
the time, and to make sure

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:09.099
you're doing everything
all the time.

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:12.560
But there's something to
be said about breaking that

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.869
up, and doing the
things that you love,

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:17.270
making work even
something that you love,

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.339
and making sure you are
in that right headspace.

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:21.770
And I admire the
fact that you're

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:25.790
able to go to so many different
activities, and focus on them,

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:27.780
and the drive that you
have is really amazing,

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:31.040
so just going to call that out.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.540
COLBY BARR: But
I think, you were

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:33.680
saying about
enjoying what you do,

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.930
to me that's a big part of it.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:38.000
I mean, that's why I
started my own company.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.610
But I used to do all
of our orientations

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:42.770
for like, six years.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.165
Every single employee
that ever worked at Verve.

00:17:44.165 --> 00:17:45.650
I did every employee's
orientation.

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:48.494
I used to just tell
people like, we want

00:17:48.494 --> 00:17:49.660
people that want to be here.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:54.632
And if you don't want to be
here, I want you to quit.

00:17:54.632 --> 00:17:56.090
KRISTI LEWIS: Which
is hard, right?

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:58.480
COLBY BARR: And not meaning
like, because we're so cool,

00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.604
and like, you don't belong.

00:17:59.604 --> 00:18:02.560
But no, just like,
I will help you

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.165
find a-- put in
notice, whatever, I'll

00:18:04.165 --> 00:18:05.415
help you find a different job.

00:18:05.415 --> 00:18:07.300
But you owe it to
yourself to do something

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.520
you're passionate
about, whether it's

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.460
starting your own business,
or not because people

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:17.170
are energized in different ways,
or being part of a team that

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:21.580
has a huge lever for
change, like Google,

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.560
or how you get empowered
in your own way.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.930
But the one thing that kind of--

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:29.590
the work-life
balance, when I feel

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:31.990
like it's this dichotomy
that I don't like

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:34.630
is the feeling that you
would just do something

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:37.150
that you-- that
it could mean, you

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:38.980
put up with something
that you don't love

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.090
to do, or even like
to do, But you only

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:42.610
have to do it eight hours a day.

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:44.693
And then you get to live
your life, which is cool.

00:18:44.693 --> 00:18:46.600
I mean, a lot of
the best musicians

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.720
I've known in the world had
day jobs that were whatever.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:54.220
But I do think it is
important to just find

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.860
what you're passionate
about, or find

00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:00.430
how to be passionate in
what you do because it just

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:01.677
makes everything better.

00:19:01.677 --> 00:19:03.760
And, to me, a little bit,
that's the harmony part,

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:10.840
which is that your work should
be part of what fulfills you.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.330
KRISTI LEWIS: And I think
that that shows in your shops

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.430
as well.

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:19.594
I've been to a few of them,
and the staff is very friendly.

00:19:19.594 --> 00:19:21.010
They all do their
job really well,

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:24.040
and they seem to actually
enjoy being there.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.580
So maybe you could talk about
how you incorporate that

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:29.875
into your company culture.

00:19:32.167 --> 00:19:34.000
Asides from telling
them that they can quit,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.430
if they don't really
want to be there.

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:37.846
COLBY BARR: Yeah, I want to
tell people they have to quit,

00:19:37.846 --> 00:19:40.360
if they don't want
to be here because I

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:44.410
think that's what people
should do for themselves.

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:47.390
But it is something
that's probably

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:54.060
been the most difficult
thing as we have scaled.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:57.550
Because when you have one
shop, or the small team--

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:59.040
I forget the number
of people talk

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:03.250
about for a small tribe,
10, 15, 30 people,

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:05.680
but once you exceed that--

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.850
there is a lot that happens
innately, especially when you

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:10.110
have the small group.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.310
Leaders are present.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:13.950
This trickle down
effect, it's just

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:15.720
very obvious to
everyone what that--

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.670
it's easier to set
expectations without having

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:20.760
things so explicitly written.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:26.520
But as you scale, 40, 50,
80, 100, 200 employees

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.627
we have at Verve now.

00:20:27.627 --> 00:20:29.210
I don't how many
employees Google has,

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:31.890
but I'm sure it's more than 200.

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:36.450
It's probably about
200 in this room.

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.820
But it's the hardest thing
to do is to scale culture

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:43.460
because at a certain point, you
have to literally be thinking,

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.120
how am I engineering
culture now?

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:52.510
And it feels--
there's a falseness,

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:55.587
if that's a word, that
comes with that idea

00:20:55.587 --> 00:20:56.920
that you're engineering culture.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.132
But I became enamored with it
a little bit because, well,

00:21:00.132 --> 00:21:01.090
you're just trying to--

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:05.080
it's a point about being
reflective and self-aware

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.860
as a brand and as a
company, and to figure out

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:12.490
how you want to
communicate that,

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:14.871
and to build that
into the culture,

00:21:14.871 --> 00:21:16.870
to set those expectations,
and then, ultimately,

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:19.810
have the right
people on the bus.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.090
I mean, I'm a big fan of--

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:26.281
I know, maybe, it's old school
now, but "Good to Great."

00:21:26.281 --> 00:21:28.280
Jim Collins getting the
right people on the bus.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.820
There's no substitute for that.

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:34.450
You cannot train
somebody into getting it.

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:36.250
You have to just get
the right people,

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:40.450
and then figure out
how to empower them.

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:42.191
And that's what
we've done Verve.

00:21:42.191 --> 00:21:43.690
And that's what I
think we're really

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:45.850
focused on this next
year and beyond,

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.520
is to really figure out
how to build a framework,

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.390
so that people really
feel empowered, and can

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:54.490
channel their own
entrepreneurial spirit in what

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:55.680
they do.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.310
And that's a little
bit of, I think,

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:58.900
what you experience when
you come in to Verve,

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.691
and you have people
smile and greet at you.

00:22:00.691 --> 00:22:03.490
We've been criticized
for being too friendly,

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:06.820
whoops, because some
people think it's fake.

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:08.320
But I don't ever want that.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.610
I don't want there to ever
be a fake vibe at Verve.

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:11.290
It's not that.

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:12.970
We don't tell people
like, and then

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:16.240
make sure you put on your smile,
and get your flair badges.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.590
It's not about that.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:20.230
We tell people, just be
normal, just be real.

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:22.859
If you're not someone
who would smile or say,

00:22:22.859 --> 00:22:25.150
hey, how's it going, to
someone who walks in and stands

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:28.270
in front of you, then,
OK, that's your world,

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:32.290
but maybe Verve is not
the right culture for you.

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:34.950
So we just try to find
friendly, outgoing people that

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:38.020
want to take care of you, and
tell them to just be normal.

00:22:40.267 --> 00:22:42.100
KRISTI LEWIS: So I
guess, leaning into that,

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.740
we can go on the flip side
of that to your relationship

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:49.530
with your vendors, the people
who provide the coffee grounds.

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:51.380
You want to talk about
that a little bit?

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.110
COLBY BARR: Sure.

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.950
The grounds or--

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:55.033
KRISTI LEWIS: The grounds.

00:22:55.033 --> 00:22:56.282
I'm sorry, the beans.

00:22:56.282 --> 00:22:57.490
COLBY BARR: I'm just kidding.

00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:02.510
People see our roaster
sometimes in Seabright,

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:04.261
in Santa Cruz, where
we have our roastery.

00:23:04.261 --> 00:23:06.218
We've always created this
whole fishbowl effect

00:23:06.218 --> 00:23:07.040
with our roastery.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.870
It's very transparent, what we
do, and you can come see it.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:14.970
And they always see these big
round drums, cylinders, rather.

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:17.900
And they say, oh, is that
where you grind the beans?

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.740
These giant grinders but,
they're our coffee roasters,

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.630
but anyway I'm just kidding.

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:23.540
Just kidding, Kristi.

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:23.672
KRISTI LEWIS: It's good.

00:23:23.672 --> 00:23:24.505
You can call me out.

00:23:27.395 --> 00:23:28.520
COLBY BARR: Yeah, for sure.

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:35.860
I mean, our sourcing program at
Verve, farm level, we call it,

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.510
does go full circle
for me, personally,

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:43.010
back to growing up on a
farm with a parent who was--

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:46.130
with parents, but my
dad would go into--

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:48.350
my mom growing up on a farm
herself, and then my dad

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:50.110
also growing up on a farm
and going to UC Davis,

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:52.190
it was really instilled--
and being really take

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:56.420
care of business people that
never did shortcuts, and just

00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:01.455
kept the orchards and
vineyards meticulous all year

00:24:01.455 --> 00:24:03.080
round, never had
garbage on the ground,

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:08.500
everything is just perfect,
and the fruit would show that.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:12.850
They grew some of the best
sauvignon blanc in Paris,

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:15.130
anywhere in the world.

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.377
But they never really
got paid premiums for it.

00:24:20.377 --> 00:24:21.960
They were just treated
as a commodity.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.881
And it's like, kids
on laptops buying.

00:24:24.881 --> 00:24:25.380
What's this?

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:26.296
How much is the price?

00:24:26.296 --> 00:24:27.480
How much is it over here?

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.896
$0.04 cheaper per
pound over here.

00:24:28.896 --> 00:24:29.400
Buy it here.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.709
Send it to the grocer.

00:24:30.709 --> 00:24:33.000
With no sense of, but what's
the difference in quality?

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:33.875
Who are these people?

00:24:33.875 --> 00:24:35.100
What's their background?

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:38.200
Is there any value add we can--

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.020
it's just a commodity.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:43.710
And coffee being one of
the more traded commodities

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:45.992
in the world, I mean,
for perspective,

00:24:45.992 --> 00:24:47.200
how much coffee is out there.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:51.490
Starbucks buys like 2 and
1/2% of the world's coffee.

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:54.262
So there's the other 97 and 1/2%
percent of the world's coffee

00:24:54.262 --> 00:24:55.720
that's not being
sold by Starbucks.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:59.110
That's how big the market is.

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:00.520
It's a commodity market.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.400
And so, well, we got
into Verve, and wanting

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.821
to figure out how we could
do something different.

00:25:06.821 --> 00:25:09.070
And the tipping point of
what became third wave coffee

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:12.460
was to go find the best
coffees in the world,

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:19.180
and that there was this new
world happening of discovery,

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:23.500
and just extraordinary
flavors coming

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:24.730
into the world of coffee.

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:26.930
And we sought to go find them.

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:32.060
So when we started
Verve for the first,

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:35.180
I'm not sure, six,
seven years, or so,

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:36.624
I was our only coffee buyer.

00:25:36.624 --> 00:25:38.540
So I traveled like four
months out of the year

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:39.920
all around the globe--

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:43.329
Central America, South
America, East Africa--

00:25:43.329 --> 00:25:44.870
for like four months
out of the year,

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:48.320
traveling to go find coffees,
meet producers, go back and see

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:52.540
those producers again,
discover new gems,

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.880
out position people on coffees,
and to really help find them,

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:59.300
but also to help be
part of what is maybe

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:03.860
the point of the spear of
a enormous global industry,

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:08.330
but to just help say,
we're willing to pay you

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:10.070
equitably for this
work you do, which

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:14.935
produces an extraordinarily
high quality product.

00:26:14.935 --> 00:26:16.310
That same product
that we're then

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:23.920
going to take, and sell at
a higher premium than maybe

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.510
some people sell,
definitely compared

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:29.054
to what most people sell,
because there is a value there,

00:26:29.054 --> 00:26:29.720
that's worth it.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:33.900
And we think that--

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:35.490
I guess we're off
the rails here,

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:39.120
but I just fully
steered away from how

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.970
being nice to
producers, which we are.

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:45.040
But, no, to me
the economic lever

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.257
is the most important lever.

00:26:46.257 --> 00:26:48.090
If you want to help a
farmer, pay them more.

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:50.048
You can go ask every
single one of our farmers,

00:26:50.048 --> 00:26:52.290
and say, what do
you really need?

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:55.200
And they're just going
to say, just pay me more.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.600
A lot of people think farmers--

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.590
it's like a pity
thing and all this.

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:02.070
And I hate that marketing.

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:04.170
I hate that kind of cause
marketing for coffee,

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:05.010
for producers.

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:09.780
Because, growing up on a
farm, my grandpa, so badass,

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:14.100
my dad, hard as nails.

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:15.570
Those are the last
people on Earth

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:18.570
that want your pity are farmers.

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:22.470
They just want to
be treated fairly,

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:25.230
and to feel like their
hard work is worth it.

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:28.350
They have enough stress
with Mother Nature

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:30.300
and a lot of other
things then to--

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:34.992
so we built our
business around that.

00:27:34.992 --> 00:27:36.450
And it really starts
with customers

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:38.860
paying more for a cup of
coffee because there's

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.370
x amount of dollars
in a cup of coffee,

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:43.320
and then everyone
has their margins.

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.670
And I believe in supply chain.

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:47.880
I mean, you need--

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.260
someone's drinking the coffee.

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:51.426
Going back in time, someone's
delivering the coffee,

00:27:51.426 --> 00:27:55.070
roasting the coffee, buying the
coffee, importing the coffee.

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:56.664
Someone exported the coffee.

00:27:56.664 --> 00:27:58.580
Someone shipped it, and
insured it in between.

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.210
Someone milled the
coffee for export.

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:03.860
Right before that, somebody
processed the freshly

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:04.850
picked cherries.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:06.620
And then someone
grew those cherries.

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:07.970
You need all of those steps.

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:10.303
I mean, people can be vertically
integrated or whatever.

00:28:10.303 --> 00:28:12.350
But those steps don't go away.

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:15.470
I think it's cool if everyone
has a sustainable transparent

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:17.270
business model.

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:19.340
The middle man concept is that--

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.950
middle men, to
me, is a term tied

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:27.530
to people that operate
within a supply chain, that

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:29.480
take advantage of it
without transparency,

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.220
and exploit people on
either side of them.

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.870
But as far as steps in a supply
chain, everybody's critical.

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:39.830
And all through those
points of the supply chain,

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.860
we treat all of them with as
much respect, and honesty,

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:44.930
and transparency as we can.

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:50.960
Because at the other end of the
supply chain is the producer,

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.630
and at the other
end-- the bookmarks

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:57.010
are literally coffee
drinkers and coffee growers.

00:28:57.010 --> 00:28:59.360
And they're the most
disconnected physically

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:01.649
and emotionally.

00:29:01.649 --> 00:29:04.190
People that are growing coffee
on the hills in Santa Bárbara,

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:07.370
Honduras, totally can't
necessarily relate to people

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:11.430
who work at Google,
or maybe vice versa.

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:14.210
But those are the two
most important parts.

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:16.340
Everyone else is facilitating.

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:17.925
Yeah, you could
say we're curators.

00:29:17.925 --> 00:29:18.800
We go find the stuff.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.341
This is cool.

00:29:19.341 --> 00:29:19.950
This is hot.

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:20.990
This is not.

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:23.780
But you need someone to throw
down money at the one end,

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:25.881
and you need someone to
be willing to produce

00:29:25.881 --> 00:29:27.380
at the other end,
and those two need

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:30.140
to have a synergy
between the two.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:33.890
So we work really hard
in our whole business

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:39.562
to create that bridge
and foster that economy.

00:29:39.562 --> 00:29:42.020
AUDIENCE: So yeah, I was really
curious about that decision

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:44.540
to be in Santa Cruz, and
not one of the obvious

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:48.380
places that you were probably
thinking about being.

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.870
A lot of us here in
marketing or touch marketing,

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:53.397
and I would think you have
to go where the business is

00:29:53.397 --> 00:29:56.030
or where the people would be.

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:58.460
How was marketing for you,
and getting your name out,

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:00.395
and getting going,
when maybe you

00:30:00.395 --> 00:30:04.860
were thinking about just
surfers walking in for coffee.

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:07.970
It's not necessarily
someone that's going to--

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:10.287
I don't know, a business
person in the valley.

00:30:10.287 --> 00:30:12.620
COLBY BARR: Yes, being where
the people are could have--

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:14.911
I mean, if we had opened in
San Francisco 10 years ago,

00:30:14.911 --> 00:30:17.600
maybe we'd be even in a
different type of company,

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.050
as far as timing and everything.

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:22.930
But, for me, although
we were based

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:29.230
in Santa Cruz for some
personal reasons, Ryan and I,

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:32.860
our goal was never to be the
best coffee in Santa Cruz.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.400
Our goal was to be the
best coffee in the world

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.610
and to create the best
coffee company in the world.

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:39.193
We just didn't know
if anyone was ever

00:30:39.193 --> 00:30:41.530
going to even get it or care.

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:46.660
But that was our path was
I want our coffee to be--

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:50.300
our influences were my friends
out of Oslo, in Norway,

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:54.520
and just what's happening
in Australia, and Melbourne.

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.980
We were really wanting
to step up to that stage.

00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:02.620
And I think it's because of
that, and the timing of when

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:07.030
we opened as super
early adopters,

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:09.200
that's kind of how
it all came together.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.959
And then once we had those
little opportunities,

00:31:12.959 --> 00:31:14.500
we had product that
stepped up to it.

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.780
I mean, one of our first places
our brand ever went from Santa

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:19.090
Cruz, like two months in,
was straight to the heart

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:22.330
of Manhattan with
Café Grumpy out there,

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:25.482
who at the time was
the east coast Ritual.

00:31:25.482 --> 00:31:27.190
There's a lot more on
the east coast now,

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:29.020
but they were very early.

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:31.060
And someone came
through Santa Cruz,

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:32.950
and had our coffee
thought it was amazing,

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:36.224
brought a bag of Ethiopia Conga,
and brought it back to them.

00:31:36.224 --> 00:31:37.640
And I remember, I
was working bar,

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.740
and I had to duck
down by the counter.

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:40.948
And I got a call from the
manager at Café Grumpy that

00:31:40.948 --> 00:31:43.270
said, we want to feature you
on bar, here in Manhattan.

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:45.070
And then that's how Oliver
Strand from the New York Times

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.670
heard about us.

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:46.795
And then he wrote about it.

00:31:46.795 --> 00:31:51.086
It just-- so it was
based on quality.

00:31:51.086 --> 00:31:54.250
And I think the
idea that we were

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:57.160
trying to think
big, but even just

00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:01.900
because that's what we wanted
out of the company personally.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.470
And then that ended up working.

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:07.190
So I guess kind of like
secreting it a little bit.

00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:12.720
And the brand is super
important, straight up,

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:16.540
design, brand, that
always matters to us.

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.040
How we want to
design our stores,

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.734
customer experience,
how we want to look,

00:32:20.734 --> 00:32:22.150
what we think of
the brand-- we've

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:24.320
always really been into
brand and design as well.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.444
So we always thought of that.

00:32:27.444 --> 00:32:29.360
AUDIENCE: So it's kind
of a two part question,

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:33.130
but you mentioned that
when you were initially

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:36.280
picking your first location,
third wave coffee hadn't really

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.900
taken off yet, right?

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.764
And, obviously, in
the last 10 years,

00:32:39.764 --> 00:32:41.180
there's been an
explosion of that,

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.150
especially in the Bay
Area, from Equator,

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:45.730
Four Barrel, et cetera.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:50.830
The first question is, amongst
the other third wave players,

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:54.040
are there any that you
really admire, and why?

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:59.530
And the second piece of that is,
how you see Verve in relation

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:01.750
to some of the other
players in this space?

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:06.220
What, from your perspective,
really sets Verve apart

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:07.600
from the pack?

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.600
COLBY BARR: Sure,
yeah, I mean, well,

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.892
it's kind of split into two
groups really because a lot

00:33:12.892 --> 00:33:14.433
of the people that
were our biggest--

00:33:14.433 --> 00:33:17.290
a couple of people that were big
influences on us when we were

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:18.190
opening--

00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:22.690
Stumptown, Intelligentsia--
Ryan, my business partner's

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:25.540
brother worked at the Blue
Bottle kiosk on Linden Street,

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:26.680
when that was all they had.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.660
So we go back in that world.

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:30.172
Those were all influences on us.

00:33:30.172 --> 00:33:31.630
And as you know,
there's been a lot

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:33.500
of business activity
with a lot of brands,

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:34.870
including those three brands.

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:41.180
So now that they're kind of
off the table in that regard,

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.674
with the M&amp;A stuff
that's happened.

00:33:43.674 --> 00:33:46.090
Looking to the other side of
things, what other brands are

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:49.780
out there that now influence
us, or that I think

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:50.746
are influential.

00:33:50.746 --> 00:33:51.454
I mean, there's--

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:56.370
I mean, I see stuff all
the time on Instagram.

00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:58.490
New brands following us, or
something, like, who's this?

00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:58.740
I check it out.

00:33:58.740 --> 00:33:59.910
I'm like, damn,
that's a killer logo.

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:01.701
That brand package,
that packaging is cool.

00:34:01.701 --> 00:34:02.880
I like how they did this.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:05.520
I see cold beverage drinks
being made and servingware,

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.770
and I'm like, that's hot.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:09.780
I just see-- it's things
happening all the time here

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.960
and there.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:16.199
But the major brands that
had a influence on us early,

00:34:16.199 --> 00:34:19.999
just because you look up to
see like, well, who's doing it?

00:34:19.999 --> 00:34:21.040
And who else is doing it?

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.706
And those were the
ones we looked up to,

00:34:22.706 --> 00:34:26.120
so now we're kind of
on our own trajectory.

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:31.199
And how we feel
different, I mean,

00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:37.100
I feel like we've always
had service first,

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:39.080
especially like, 10 years ago.

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:46.159
And that was super not cool in
the clichés of waxed mustaches,

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:50.679
and suspenders,
and all this stuff.

00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:52.931
And rockstar baristas,
we were super anti that.

00:34:52.931 --> 00:34:55.389
In fact, that's, actually, one
of the main reasons we never

00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:58.730
opened in San Francisco, is
that we just didn't-- there was

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:03.190
an energy that was happening-- a
very young, young tense energy.

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:07.420
And we didn't want to really
get pulled into that world.

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:09.530
We wanted to just
go do our own thing.

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:12.740
And so I guess maybe
that's another way.

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:14.840
We've always just
done our own thing,

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:16.940
and worried about
what we're up to.

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.430
Totally influenced, and love
seeing what everyone's doing.

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:22.110
I'm super into
everything that happens.

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:26.400
But, at the end of the day, at
Verve, we just go our own path,

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.520
and be really nice
to people, really

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:33.300
focus on our retail environments
being more residential

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:37.470
than commercial, have wholesale
program that can step up

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:40.260
and really service
this level of business,

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:42.752
but still be down to earth.

00:35:42.752 --> 00:35:45.210
We're putting a lot energy into
our online stuff right now.

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:48.570
And then we have some RTD and
some cool single serve stuff

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:51.210
that we're working on, for
new, innovative, next step

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:53.400
stuff with our company.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.560
AUDIENCE: I drink
coffee, occasionally.

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:59.500
I don't really think about
what's in my cup too much.

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.140
Maybe everybody here knows
what it is, but I don't really

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:04.675
know much about
third wave coffee,

00:36:04.675 --> 00:36:06.330
and what that movement means.

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:09.220
And was there a first
wave, a second wave?

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:11.146
Is there a fourth one?

00:36:11.146 --> 00:36:13.270
COLBY BARR: They went ninth,
sixth, and then third.

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:15.836
AUDIENCE: OK, so I was
just kind of wondering,

00:36:15.836 --> 00:36:17.710
if maybe you could find
more context on that,

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:20.620
and also maybe talk about
where you got your name from.

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:23.860
COLBY BARR: Yeah, absolutely.

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.820
Those are great questions
because, yeah, I mean,

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:31.390
the idea of first wave,
second wave, third wave

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:34.240
loosely is first wave is like
our grandparents' coffee--

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:37.810
institutional canned coffee,
Folgers, Yuban, Maxwell House,

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:42.050
sort of that
post-war era coffee--

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:44.510
which was really where
coffee got big in the US,

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:46.640
and really started the
real commercialization,

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.280
and commoditization of coffee.

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:52.314
Second wave, so that ran for
like 30 years or so, then

00:36:52.314 --> 00:36:54.105
second wave comes about
with-- it basically

00:36:54.105 --> 00:36:55.820
is the Starbucks revolution.

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:59.520
Howard Schultz creating--
going from just coffee

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.990
is this thing that you take
two scoops, put it in here,

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:04.410
mix with water, and
you have coffee.

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:07.320
Or it's like $0.25 diner
coffee, nickel diner coffee.

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:11.880
Into now, you step into espresso
culture, espresso drinks--

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:14.640
basically, espresso culture
for starters that Howard

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:17.640
brought from Europe
after visiting there.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:20.970
And the idea of $4.00 coffee.

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:25.170
That concept of espresso
culture, $4.00 coffee,

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:28.646
and coffee houses as, he's
coined the term, third place.

00:37:28.646 --> 00:37:31.020
You know, you have your work,
home, and this other place,

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:33.200
whether it's a
coffee shop or not.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.724
But just this idea that
coffee isn't just this thing

00:37:35.724 --> 00:37:37.140
your grandpa drinks
in the morning

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:40.145
before going out
and bailing hay.

00:37:40.145 --> 00:37:40.770
It's like cool.

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:43.860
I'm going to like-- my mom does
it and meets her friends there.

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:45.680
So that is second wave.

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:50.011
And then third wave came as just
this next generation grew up--

00:37:50.011 --> 00:37:52.260
everyone grows up on the
previous generation-- grew up

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:54.020
on Starbucks.

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:57.710
Not me, personally, because I
grew up in a super small town,

00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:59.940
didn't have a Starbucks,
still doesn't.

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:04.900
But that what's next?

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:08.770
And that people started
finding these little--

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:10.360
lots of coffee that
tasted different.

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:14.890
The auction systems that in the
coffee world, the niche insider

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:18.361
world, started for the best
of Panama auctions, these cup

00:38:18.361 --> 00:38:20.860
of excellence auctions, where
they started rewarding farmers

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:22.720
based on cup quality
blind, and having

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.480
auctions for their coffee.

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:28.330
There was a book written
called "God in a Cup"

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:32.290
that really was a turning point
to put third wave on the map.

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:38.290
And the Geisha
variety of coffee that

00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:41.640
has been sort of synonymous
with the highest quality,

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:50.372
although that symbol is
definitely, it's getting

00:38:50.372 --> 00:38:52.830
planted in a lot of places that
maybe that coffee shouldn't

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.960
grow, but where it
still grows the best,

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:56.668
a lot of places where
we get that coffee,

00:38:56.668 --> 00:38:58.780
it's still one of the
best coffees in the world.

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:01.340
So those are those three phases.

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:06.032
So yeah, yeah, Grandpa's coffee,
Starbucks revolution, and then,

00:39:06.032 --> 00:39:08.490
for lack of a better term, the
hipster coffee world that we

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:11.910
all think of as coffee now.

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:15.210
Although, I'm sure like, in
1975, if you were like, 20,

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:17.070
and you got coffee,
you thought you

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:20.910
were a hipster getting coffee
at the hipster coffee shop.

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:23.380
So those are those three eras.

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:27.077
And then a lot of people
ask, what's fourth wave?

00:39:27.077 --> 00:39:29.160
People are ready to jump
to fourth wave right now.

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:30.810
And I've heard fourth
way is cold brew.

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:31.666
Fourth wave is this.

00:39:31.666 --> 00:39:32.790
Fourth wave is convenience.

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:34.710
Fourth wave is bringing
food into your cafés,

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:38.770
like we've brought a lot of
more Melbourne sort of concepts

00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:42.629
into our store-- avocado
toast, things like that.

00:39:42.629 --> 00:39:43.170
I don't know.

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:45.210
I think, to me, that's still
an extrapolation of third wave.

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:47.100
Fourth wave, probably,
shouldn't really

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.750
come for another 10
or 15 years per the,

00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:55.640
unless we're kind of on
geometric sort of growth plan

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.010
here.

00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:01.295
Yeah, and then we
got our name Verve.

00:40:01.295 --> 00:40:05.280
It originally came because it's
a record label, Verve Records.

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.031
It's a jazz label.

00:40:06.031 --> 00:40:07.780
And we were just trying
to think of names.

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:08.740
We had a million names.

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:13.482
And Ryan, because we
both play music and jazz,

00:40:13.482 --> 00:40:14.440
said, what about Verve?

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:17.190
And it kind of just stuck.

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:19.350
And we looked it up,
and it was available,

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:20.910
and sat with it for a while.

00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:24.120
And we ended up calling
ourselves that so.

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:27.450
But it means the spirit
and enthusiasm surrounding

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:29.310
the creation of art.

00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:30.900
And so once we saw
the definition,

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:36.450
I was like, damn, that
really feels right.

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:39.000
It's like passion, energy.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.940
If you have a lot of Verve,
maybe that's the energy you

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:43.530
feel when you come
into a Verve café.

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:49.571
People behind the bar, it's
trying to just be posi.

00:40:49.571 --> 00:40:52.070
AUDIENCE: I was going to also
ask you how you got your name,

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:53.150
so that was an easy one.

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:57.680
So I'm going to totally pivot
and ask you a tough one.

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.320
Thanks for coming, by the way.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:03.350
Just thinking about, coffee
has this very specific kind

00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:06.450
of climate that it
grows in, and you see it

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:07.520
in equatorial regions.

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:10.250
And I think,
anecdotally, it seems

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:13.790
like a lot of those regions are
also areas of high conflict.

00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:19.190
You look at Central America,
or Yemen, parts of Africa.

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:20.730
What's our role in all of that?

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:24.350
And we're so separated
from the growers,

00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:27.410
just because of the nature
of how coffee grows,

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:29.910
and where we are
physically, do you

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:33.420
have a role in that,
for good or for bad?

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:35.870
Do you have a point
of view on how

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:40.010
our collective hunger for
coffee is hopefully making lives

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:41.570
better?

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:45.060
COLBY BARR: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.810
I don't work for the CIA.

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:50.060
And I just watched,
I'm totally up

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:55.040
to speed on "Narcos," so, yeah,
I can answer this question.

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:01.550
I mean, you're right.

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:02.529
I mean, Latin America--

00:42:02.529 --> 00:42:04.070
I mentioned "Narcos"
because that's--

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:06.534
I mean, you hear
about this-- when

00:42:06.534 --> 00:42:07.950
you travel to all
these countries,

00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:11.150
you hear about the history
of a lot of things that back

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:15.287
in the day felt conspiratorial.

00:42:15.287 --> 00:42:17.120
And then you're like,
oh, yeah, but then you

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.120
just hear it first hand.

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:26.060
That's another talk probably
but with US involvement,

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:28.280
obviously, I'm not a
Latin American studies,

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.905
but I'm sure there's people who
could school me all up on that,

00:42:30.905 --> 00:42:35.035
but it's tough.

00:42:35.035 --> 00:42:37.410
I mean, there are certain
places that we don't buy coffee

00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:43.270
from because it's
so complicated,

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:48.612
one, to travel there, like I
can't go to Yemen right now.

00:42:48.612 --> 00:42:50.320
I mean, I've been to
Rwanda, and Burundi,

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:55.220
and I've been in Kenya,
in parts of Ethiopia,

00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:57.300
and all places in Colombia.

00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:01.346
It can get really real down
there in southern Colombia.

00:43:01.346 --> 00:43:03.850
And there are certain
places, in Colombia,

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:06.607
I can't go and be
there overnight.

00:43:06.607 --> 00:43:08.440
You can't even really
go during the daytime,

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:11.470
but we go to a lot of out
there places in Colombia.

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:17.560
But to answer your
question, I see coffee

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:19.900
as a lever for change.

00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:23.800
And I see that lever really
saying the word quality on it.

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.740
And that's the coffee
lever that we move.

00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:29.450
And, to me, I just
really believe that--

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:32.140
not like what we do is
so important, like Verve.

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:34.330
I mean, we're just a small
sliver, but all we can do

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:35.080
is what we can do.

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:38.410
And we want to do it
clearly and loudly.

00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:40.560
And that is to
just say that we--

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.120
that's part of the reason we
travel to go meet producers,

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:47.660
is to understand who they
are, and to understand

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:52.767
how our approach can help them,
again, not out of charity.

00:43:52.767 --> 00:43:54.100
Farmers don't want your charity.

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:58.960
They just want to
be treated fairly.

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:02.640
So I think one of the
best things you can do

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:05.700
is just help create,
for any farming family,

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.620
is help create a stable
economy, and something

00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:09.900
that they can count on.

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:13.200
And if you find producers
that have a good address,

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.420
their farm is in a
good spot, and they're

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:17.190
willing to put in
this extra work

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:18.690
because they're
passionate about it.

00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:19.470
You see it all the time.

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:21.386
The best farmers are the
most passionate ones.

00:44:21.386 --> 00:44:25.040
There is ones that get
lucky, but not really.

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.330
You do need to
have a good site--

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:29.130
this side of the
hill, this elevation,

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:32.040
this type of microclimate, this
aspect, this soil, all this.

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:38.350
But really it comes down to, the
farmer's passion and hard work.

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:41.230
And I do feel
like, what we do in

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:43.810
that way is good because
it opens up opportunities

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:46.390
for people to have
more opportunities,

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:51.780
and more decision-making
authority in how they live.

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:55.230
But it's super complex, I mean,
East Africa, Yemen, come on.

00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:58.520
I mean, Kenya, even, and
then all of Latin America

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:00.190
is mostly--

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:02.010
it's really simmered down a lot.

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:03.450
But then with
everything happening

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:07.750
with the cartel and stuff like
that, it's it's own thing.

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:11.280
But we try to steer
clear of it, and just

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.140
do what we can to
empower farmers.

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:17.530
AUDIENCE: I wonder about this
notion of paying for quality,

00:45:17.530 --> 00:45:21.540
and a lot of the talk about
the progression of coffee,

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:23.520
and how it's viewed.

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:26.280
Is there anything else,
or any other industries,

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:28.500
or within the food
space, even, where

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:31.860
you see an opportunity for
that transition to happen?

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:35.850
Where people have expectations
of paying very little

00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:39.470
for something, where
you can see bringing

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:43.230
either higher quality
options, or higher quality

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:47.512
brands with also that
higher price tag?

00:45:47.512 --> 00:45:49.470
COLBY BARR: I mean, it's
probably in everything

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:50.386
to be honest with you.

00:45:50.386 --> 00:45:53.070
I mean, part of it is
what industries globally

00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:54.070
are available for that.

00:45:54.070 --> 00:45:58.530
And part of it is how we
nationally think about food.

00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:00.780
So I can't remember
the statistic off hand,

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:02.100
but I've said it before.

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:05.510
But the percentage
Americans spend on food

00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:07.550
is really low in the
developing world.

00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:10.240
It's like, don't
hold me to this,

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:12.070
but it's something
like a quarter, what

00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:15.340
a lot of people in France
or Italy spend on food.

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:20.605
So part of it is just a desens--

00:46:20.605 --> 00:46:24.662
a desensitizing, a desensity?

00:46:24.662 --> 00:46:25.870
What am I trying to say here?

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:26.960
You know what I'm saying.

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:29.300
We are desensitized on
the price of food because

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:32.120
of a lot of reasons, including
subsidies, and corn, and things

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:33.110
like that.

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:36.200
And we see that as the
value add is cheaper,

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:39.210
is better, and bigger is better,
not this room, necessarily,

00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:41.780
but that's just this thing
that's been kind of drilled,

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:44.270
for good reasons
because how people think

00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:52.570
about food security is one of
the best ways to grow a nation.

00:46:52.570 --> 00:46:55.980
So I think you could
look at almost anything

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:58.290
and think, well, what
is the version of this

00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:01.200
that helps create change?

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.700
Who is in this supply chain
that wants to do better?

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:07.950
And who's already wants to
produce something better,

00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:11.080
and how do we help
them have a voice?

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:14.160
I mean, you could do, I
mean, like [INAUDIBLE] tea.

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.140
I mean, tea has
done really amazing.

00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:20.070
I mean, really, really amazing
tea growers in China and Japan,

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:22.050
can get paid really great
prices for their tea.

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:23.591
I mean, you could
pick any commodity,

00:47:23.591 --> 00:47:26.460
and dissect it, and
try to find out,

00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:29.070
how we could leverage
the people that

00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:32.190
want to do quality
because on one end,

00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:34.967
I believe it's us
helping producers.

00:47:34.967 --> 00:47:37.050
But I also think there's
just a huge audience that

00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:38.249
just wants better stuff.

00:47:38.249 --> 00:47:40.290
There's a huge audience
of people that just like,

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:42.570
I'd pay $0.50 more for
blackberries if they always

00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:45.002
tasted amazing, or strawberries.

00:47:45.002 --> 00:47:47.460
Or I mean, you could just pick
anything you eat, any fruit,

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:50.580
and say, would you be willing
to pay $0.50 more because that

00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:53.640
could be like a 20%, 30%
increase in the price.

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:55.950
It can be applied
almost anywhere.

00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:57.660
We choose just to be
focused on coffee.

00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:03.330
But I do think about that
a lot in that there's

00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:05.430
an audience that wants
quality, and they

00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:07.764
want to have this better
experience in their life.

00:48:07.764 --> 00:48:09.180
And they're willing
to pay for it.

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:11.620
And there's people that
want to produce that.

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:15.120
And it's just connecting those
two into the supply chain

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:16.650
because without them--

00:48:16.650 --> 00:48:19.309
without people producing
high quality anything,

00:48:19.309 --> 00:48:20.850
there's no product
for people to buy.

00:48:20.850 --> 00:48:23.730
And without people willing
to step up and pay premiums

00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:26.010
for quality experiences,
then there's

00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:28.160
no livelihood or reason
for people to do it.

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:29.765
And I believe,
fundamentally, both

00:48:29.765 --> 00:48:31.140
of these two ends
of the spectrum

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:33.330
exist in almost
everything we touch.

00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:35.250
It's just a matter
of connecting them.

00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:38.112
And that's what we
try to do in coffee.

00:48:38.112 --> 00:48:40.505
KRISTI LEWIS: Great, well,
thank you so much for coming.

00:48:40.505 --> 00:48:40.870
COLBY BARR: Cool.

00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:41.950
KRISTI LEWIS: Thank
you all for coming.

00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:42.741
COLBY BARR: Thanks.

00:48:42.741 --> 00:48:44.350
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:45.600
[? Thank you. ?]
