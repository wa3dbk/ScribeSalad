Lee Thomas: I really love more informal groups.
I've spoken at a few universities that were

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:11.440
just kind of a round table setting and I hope
when I'm done with my talk it's, bigger than

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.789
the book it's kinda just about me and the
book is a memoir of a few years and a few

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:17.789
difficult times.

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.230
But hopefully you guys can walk out of here
with a, with a better perspective on not only

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.910
the way that you approach work, but the way
that you approach life because I think every

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.541
moment is-is honestly and truly a gift and
you can do -- at any moment you can change

00:00:34.541 --> 00:00:38.520
your life and-and make all of your dreams
realities.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.460
So I always say I don't go anywhere without-without
a little TV --

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.460
[laughter]

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.870
and that's changed over the years 'cause literally
a little TV now really means a little TV --

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:50.870
[laughter]

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.470
but I mean I brought a little DVD for people
who might not know me or might have never

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:18.930
seen me on television. Here's a little bit
about what I do and a little bit of my story,

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:28.990
so please enjoy. It's about six minutes and
then I'll talk on the other side.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.570
[DVD playing]

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:45.000
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: "I've been on the job for well
over a decade and I'm best known for my fun

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.440
celebrity interviews.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:02:06.840
Is it 'cause she won an Oscar or 'cause she's
unbelievably hot? He goes, 'hot."

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.840
[laughter]

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.789
&gt;&gt;unidentified speaker: Would you dance with
me?

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.970
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: That's it, that's five times.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.680
So far from Fresh Prince days.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.680
[laughter]

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:29.659
&gt;&gt;Will Smith: You know I try and mix it up
a little bit, man. I try and mix it up.

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:44.290
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: If you were trying to describe
yourself to someone, 'Meryl Streep is,' how

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.909
would you finish this sentence?

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.299
&gt;&gt;Meryl Streep: A little happy.

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.310
[laughter]

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.370
It's alright. He's perfect.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:14.200
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: No one is perfect. And little
did I know my biggest imperfection would become

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.819
my biggest story. Here we go.

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:33.159
When most people see me on camera, I'm fully
covered up, fully made up except for my hands

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:38.099
are exposed and they look different.

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:47.639
[pause]
Well, here's what I really look like. This

00:03:47.639 --> 00:04:02.430
is

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:18.629
my face without makeup. I have a disease called
vitiligo. I was diagnosed with it about a

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:29.930
decade ago and it's gotten progressively worse.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:41.240
In fact, one day, I may be completely void
of color; completely white.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:52.379
Now one to two percent of the world population
has vitiligo, that's about 40 to 50 million;

00:04:52.379 --> 00:05:08.800
and right here in the United States two to
five million people have this disorder, but

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.979
I'm fighting back.

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:18.629
&gt;&gt;unidentified medical personnel: "Ready,
Lee?

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:22.620
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: Yep.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:34.590
&gt;&gt;unidentified medical personnel: Here we
go. Close your eyes.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.580
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: Uh-hum.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.569
[music and singing]

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:51.879
"Every little place seems to whisper Louise."

00:05:51.879 --> 00:06:03.900
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: Over the past five years, I've
done various treatments including the latest

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:15.630
technology, light. Why am I telling my story
now?

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.719
&gt;&gt;unidentified voices: Wiggle your little
toesies.

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:28.629
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: Over the past few years I've
met or spoken with a number of kids and adults

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:42.870
that have vitiligo and many of them have told
me that seeing me unafraid to be in the public

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.449
eye and enjoying my job helps them.

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:54.930
So frankly, I'm doing this report because
a young man asked me to.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:07:05.000
I know of a kid who wears a mask to go outside
and play 'cause he's afraid of being teased.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:15.240
I've spoken to a woman who will not leave
her house because she has this disease.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.240
[pause]

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.910
I know how they feel.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:18.910
[pause]

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:28.060
Vitiligo is not contagious and it's not life
threatening, but it is psychological warfare.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.620
It's tough.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:30.620
[pause]

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:40.910
So I hope that my story can be an extension
of strength and-and courage.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:50.699
Yeah, the first 20 minutes of my day are spent
in a makeup mirror, putting on makeup, getting

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:55.340
ready for work, but I'm happy.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.340
[pause]

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:00.749
This disease does not define me.

00:08:00.749 --> 00:08:06.469
[pause]
So if you're dealing with a health challenge

00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:14.419
or vitiligo, live your life; just make sure
you have little fun along the way.

00:08:14.419 --> 00:08:16.009
That's my story.

00:08:16.009 --> 00:08:25.699
That story aired in November of 2005 and when
we televised my story, it got the biggest

00:08:25.699 --> 00:08:35.110
viewer response my station has ever seen.
But that was only the beginning."

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.630
[rock music playing]

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:44.770
&gt;&gt;Larry King: We're back on Larry King Live.
The book is "Turning White: A Memoir of Change".

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:48.070
The author is Lee Thomas.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:52.700
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: There was Larry and Montel.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.700
[applause]

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:58.160
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: I also got a little TLC.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.160
[music]

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:09.940
My book and my story have traveled the globe
and I've even started a support group with

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:23.020
part of the proceeds of the book going back
to a charity that I started.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:36.090
But this journey has turned into so much more
than a guy with a disease. It's a life changing,

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:42.740
heartwarming mission as I show myself unmade,
unclothed, and unafraid for the whole world

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:43.890
to see.

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:47.340
[slow piano music playing in the background]

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:59.250
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: [speaking live] I used to look
at these pictures and it would be like devastating.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:11.180
I would look at myself in the mirror and I
would think that people would see a monster

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:24.780
or people wouldn't shake my hand or they wouldn't
wanna talk to me or ostracize me, but as time

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.360
went on, I started to see myself differently.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:40.520
It took a little bit of time, but where I
saw disaster, I saw something that was shockingly

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.450
beautiful in a way; it was almost like art
work.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:52.670
And where I saw destruction and the end of
a television career I- I began to see that

00:10:52.670 --> 00:11:07.530
this could be something that makes me so incredibly
unique that I am singularly defined, which

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:16.370
is what you want in a television career.

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:30.530
And-and I realize that people are simply looking
at a citizen, a man, a good person; they were

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:42.680
lookin' at a guy who works hard; they were
lookin' at somebody who tries to do the best

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:52.661
he can at everything. And no matter what the
obstacle was or no matter what they saw and

00:11:52.661 --> 00:12:08.980
knew, they were lookin' at a good person 'cause
they were lookin' at me.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:15.440
Hit them with that million dollar smile – gotta
love that.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.530
[end of DVD]

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:17.530
[audience laughter]

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:26.050
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: You know, you look at my face
and you look at a disease like vitiligo which

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:31.880
can be very devastating and you think that
it would be a show stopper.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:42.180
And for me, for awhile, it- it was. There
were times when I wouldn't go out of the house;

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:49.940
there were times when it was difficult for
me to see myself or whatever you define yourself

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:59.380
to be. But the outside coating is what you
are closely defined with and it was difficult

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.310
for me to see myself.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:12.280
But as time went on and I struggled through
the different changes my body was going through,

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:23.620
I am so much more clearly defined as a man,
as a, as a father, as a brother; so much more

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:31.880
clearly defined as a African-American, as
an individual because I had to clearly define

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:41.470
myself in my own mind and in my own heart
that who I was and what I stood for past what

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:42.650
people saw.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:53.870
And even past what I saw when people saw me,
which was the most important thing and the

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:57.190
most difficult thing that I think we all go
through.

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:05.590
Now I've-I've traveled all over the world
now talking about my story and sharing my

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:16.760
story in the book or-or just in-in speech
form, and I've realized in all this time,

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:23.890
I realized it pretty quickly that we all have
these things that we think make us different.

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:32.380
The thing that you say, "I can't do this because
of that", whatever "that" is.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:42.380
It can be something that's easily defined
as a disease like vitiligo or it can be something

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:50.660
else. Some people think they're too fat, too
skinny, can't see, not tall enough, not short

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:56.300
enough, whatever especially when it comes
to hairdos or hair --

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.300
[laughter]

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:03.870
And all kinds of issues that we deal with
that-that stop us from achieving that dream;

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:09.460
that stop you from saying, "I can't do it."

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:18.250
And a lot of times you'll find that when you
really sit down with that disaster, you'll

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:27.890
find that the person that's stopping you is
always you. It's, you're the one that says,

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:40.690
"Well I shouldn't go. I shouldn't do." And
you have to find a way to work yourself out

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:46.100
of that, that self-imposed prison, 'cause
that's what I had found myself in.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:59.530
So I'm gonna go over a few of the obstacles
that I face and not only that, I'll go over

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:07.120
how I-I overcame those obstacles and-and share
some stories as well along the way.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:15.780
I always say to people that it was not, was
not easy; getting past those-those issues

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:22.360
are-are never easy. And I always go to the-the
darkest time for me, the most difficult part,

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:30.980
and I wrote about it in the book; it's a section
of the book that I actually posted on line

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.490
and it's called: Two Little Girls.

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:39.780
Because in the situation, in these real life
events, through these two little girls, it-it

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:44.170
helped me to understand myself better and
my situation.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:51.170
One little girl about two or three, a little
cutie like the one that you have --

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:52.170
[laughter]

00:16:52.170 --> 00:17:03.600
a little cutie, we were at -- I was at a playscape
and I was just walking up to-to -- I was actually

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:14.620
getting ready to go to work and I was on the
way and I walked up and the kids were playing

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:18.500
and I just came to, "Hey, let's go have some
kids for a second before I have to go back

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:19.970
to 'the news.'"

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:20.970
[laughter]

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:28.290
So I'm standin' at this playscape and this
little girl -- she bumps into me. She's kinda

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:37.211
not watching what she's doing, you know how
kids are, bumped right into my legs and I

00:17:37.211 --> 00:17:43.210
looked down at her, she looks up at me and
she screams.

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:50.110
And if you've ever been around kids you know
there's different levels of scream --

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:51.110
[laughter]

00:17:51.110 --> 00:18:00.760
there's the, "Okay I'll get to that in a minute
scream, tell your brother to stop." There

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:08.820
is the, "Okay, what did you just do and are
you bleeding." And then there's the, "Drop

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:17.480
everything and get the heck over there as
soon as you can because something's seriously

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:21.070
wrong with this kid," any adult would know.

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:29.060
That's the scream that she screamed. And she
screamed so loud, everybody at the playscape's

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:35.890
turning and lookin' at me. So I look down
and I go, I-I do what anybody else would do,

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:46.860
I reach out say, "What's wrong?" And she screamed
louder. And I realized that she was screaming

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:50.270
'cause she saw my face.

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:55.270
So what do you do with that? Because adults
are -- they're adults, they have their own

00:18:55.270 --> 00:19:04.160
issues and their own problems and they bring
those to you and they drop it at your doorstep,

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:11.020
and then they can leave 'em with themselves.
Adults are no problem; they can do whatever

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:14.510
they want and I can handle it.

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:28.300
But a kid is pure honesty. I mean the little
girl was really afraid. So what do you, what

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.780
do you do with that?

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:40.740
So I-I backed up, I-I put my hands by my side
and I said, "Somebody come help this kid."

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:46.760
I was the one that was makin' her scream.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:55.260
And when that happened, I went home and I
stayed home for two weeks and three days.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:20:02.390
I'd only put on my makeup, I'd go to work,
I would, I would do everything that I had

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:11.790
to do; go to the grocery store, go any errands,
then I'd go home, I'd take off my makeup and

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:13.210
I'd stay home.

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:20.350
And for two weeks and three days, I lived
like that. And that's like prison to me, but

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:21.880
it was a self-imposed prison.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:30.750
But I didn't wanna go around scaring small
kids, you know what I mean? And it was tough

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:41.500
for me to get my head around that. And I'm
sittin' there one afternoon after work watching

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:42.500
Oprah --

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.500
[laughter]

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:49.390
I'm not afraid to admit it. [clears throat]

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:56.330
And I look over by the TV and-and I see my-my
gym shoes; Converse not the Chucks, just regular

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:59.980
All-Stars, you know what I'm sayin'.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.020
[laughter]

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:10.640
And I say that, "I-I just wanna go and-and
play basketball. I just wanna go play." And

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:18.460
I can't not go because of this; I can't let
this imprison me.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:31.060
So I decide that I'm gonna go to the gym where
I've been goin' for the last [clears throat]

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:42.110
years with all the guys. And the guys have
seen it go from one spot on my hand, to a

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:56.590
spot on my scalp, to a spot on my face; they've
seen it progress and they don't care. As long

00:21:56.590 --> 00:22:05.730
as I hit my jump shot and we win, we're good.

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:20.000
So I go to the gym and people look as much
as they always did, but nobody, no-no kids

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.380
were scared; no one cried so it was okay.

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:40.820
And I kept doing that. I'd go to places I
had been before; the same grocery store I

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:48.400
always go to and I start venturing out a little
bit more and it became okay again to go out

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.990
to the places I had been before.

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:58.340
And so one day I'm at my favorite grocery
store and I'm-I'm reachin', tryin' to get

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:03.110
the ranch flavored rice cakes 'cause I think
they're scrumptious --

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:04.110
[laughter]

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:10.800
and the second shelf from the bottom I'm reachin'
back and there-there, you know how people

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:22.800
tuck 'em in the back 'cause they're tryin'
to save 'em for themselves --

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:23.800
[laughter]

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:35.530
I don't get that, but I-I found it, so I'm
reachin' in the back to grab the one ranch

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:44.670
flavored one and I'm lookin' at the thing
and at the rice cakes and I hear a little

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:54.770
voice go, "You got a boo-boo?" And I go, "Oh
my God, its a little kid," right?

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:55.960
So [laughs] --

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:56.960
[laughter]

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:06.580
what's gonna happen? Am I gonna look up and
is she gonna freak out and-and is she gonna

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:17.480
go screaming through the grocery store and
everybody's gonna stare at me again? [sighs]

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:39.530
So I kinda froze there and then I go,
"Okay, I gotta do somethin'." She says, "You

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:44.950
got a boo-boo?" So I stood straight up and
I go, "No, it's not a boo-boo, I have vitiligo.

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:49.290
About one percent of the world population
 --

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:50.290
[laughter]

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:55.021
Sixty million people but only 5 million are
in the United States. I was talkin' like a

00:24:55.021 --> 00:24:56.021
three year old.

00:24:56.021 --> 00:24:57.021
[laughter]

00:24:57.021 --> 00:25:02.710
So I stop and I go, I go, "No, sweetie, it's-it's-it
doesn't, it's-it's-it's not a boo-boo. It's-it's

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:12.890
okay." And she says, "It's not a boo-boo?"
And I go, "No, it's not a boo-boo." She said,

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:14.620
"Do they hurt?"

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:15.620
[laughter]

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:18.809
And I said, I looked at her mom and said,
"What?" She goes, "Leave the man alone." I

00:25:18.809 --> 00:25:21.270
go, "No, no, no this is good.

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:22.270
[laughter]

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:27.550
I just don't know what she said." She goes,
"She wants to know if it hurts." She said,

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:28.550
"Does it hurt?"

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:29.550
[laughter]

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:31.820
Oh yeah, it is, "does it hurt?"

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:32.820
[laughter]

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:51.490
So I-I-I bend down, I get on one knee and
I say, "No, no sweetie it doesn't hurt at

00:25:51.490 --> 00:26:09.790
all. I'm fine." She said, "Does it hurt?"
I go, I go, "No." She reaches out and she-she

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:26.970
touches my face and she-she kind of looks
at it for

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:44.620
a second and she touches the dark part and
the light part and she goes, "Okay." And turned

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:48.830
around and grabbed a loaf of Wonder Bread.

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:49.830
[laughter]

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:52.560
Apparently it was, it's more interesting than
me.

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:53.560
[laughter]

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.780
But that's how kids are.

00:26:55.780 --> 00:27:02.880
And-and in the-those two little girls was
the definition of dealing with this disease.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:15.410
People have no idea what it is. I had no idea
what it was. So I freaked out completely;

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:24.510
fearful not knowing what it meant. Thinking
it was gonna be the end of everything. I freaked

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:28.920
out just as much as that little girl screaming.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:37.309
But because the other little girl thought
she knew what it was, she had nothing but

00:27:37.309 --> 00:27:46.510
compassion and-and love. She reached out and-and
healed a grown man's pain with one touch.

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:53.870
And because she thought she knew what it was,
because it was a boo-boo to her it wasn't

00:27:53.870 --> 00:28:09.170
anything of fear. And I got compassion and
love and all these things that we all want

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:17.271
anyway even though sometimes we're too tough
to admit it.

00:28:17.271 --> 00:28:18.271
[laughter]

00:28:18.271 --> 00:28:36.450
So right there I knew that if I could handle
those two extremes that I could handle a life

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:37.450
with this disease.

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:46.030
Now before that I wasn't handling it very
well. It was difficult. I would be the, I

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:52.850
called it, I called it, "the angry black-white
guy."

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:53.850
[laughter]

00:28:53.850 --> 00:29:07.350
'Cause people would look at me and I would,
I would give them -- you know that mean look

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:16.270
we all give when we're walkin' and we don't
anybody, everybody puts that face on.

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:17.270
[laughter]

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:21.660
When you're, when you're 6'2" and 190, it's
a little meaner, I guess.

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:22.660
[laughter]

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:27.220
If you're African-American, whatever, you
give 'em the mean look and you really look

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:28.220
mean.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:39.059
So I would look at people and they would give
me the mean face or the "scared -- don't attack

00:29:39.059 --> 00:29:40.070
me" face --

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:41.070
[laughter]

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:47.200
which is definitely not what I was tryin'
to get from people. But it was my own fear

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:55.890
thinking that they were gonna say something
that was gonna force me to be mean to them,

00:29:55.890 --> 00:30:00.090
when I'm really not that kind of a guy.

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:12.030
So I said, "Why am I giving this mean face
to the public when it's really not even who

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:13.280
I am?"

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:24.540
So I said, "I'm gonna hit 'em with a megawatt;
that got me on TV."

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:25.540
[laughter]

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:32.660
The smile, baby. I'm gonna hit 'em with that.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:33.660
[laughter]

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:48.179
Every time I just, that's, from here on out,
from this day forward, I'm not gonna be to

00:30:48.179 --> 00:30:53.880
anybody, white, white guy, I'm gonna hit 'em
with the megawatt.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:54.920
[laughter]

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:55.920
Know what I mean, bam!

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:56.920
[laughter]

00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:00.280
Good timing!! You watch the news. Thank you
very much!!

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.280
[laughter]

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:06.030
And from that day forward since that little
girl, I decided that-that-that's what I was

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:08.790
gonna do. And everything changed.

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:20.620
People would come up and you're thinking it's
so weird like you'll be in a situation and

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:31.830
you'll automatically think you know what someone's
thinking, just by what they do. You don't

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:39.730
know where they've been; you don't know if
they're in some kind of physical pain; you

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:51.080
don't know if they have a false leg or a bum
eye; you just see a person lookin' at you

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:57.320
funny and you go, "Well that person obviously
has [boop]."

00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:06.090
And all of a sudden it's the definition of
that person when you really have no idea what

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:13.960
that person's life is like or what they're
goin' through.

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:30.450
So I said, "I'm-I'm not gonna do that anymore.
I'm just gonna hit 'em with the megawatt smile

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:50.790
and see what I get." And I got a lot of good
stuff. People would smile back; people would

00:32:50.790 --> 00:33:10.360
actually ask me, "Is that vitiligo? Is that
the same thing Michael Jackson has? I have

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:25.690
a cousin that has that." I got 98 percent
positive response from doin' that.

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:37.830
Oh but there was the two percent; the people
who had bad things to say, but most of the

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:43.230
time it was an adult that had their own issues
along the way.

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:55.790
I-I'll give you an example how flippin' it
around changed it for me.

00:33:55.790 --> 00:34:11.480
I was at a gas station and you know when you're
pumping gas and there's that little space

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:24.669
between the-the mirror and the actual pump
where you can see the other person, but you

00:34:24.669 --> 00:34:26.950
ignore them anyway.

00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:27.950
[laughter]

00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:40.041
And you pump your gas and they're like four
feet away from you pumpin' their gas, but

00:34:40.041 --> 00:34:47.079
you swear you're on two different planets.

00:34:47.079 --> 00:34:49.089
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Right.

00:34:49.089 --> 00:34:50.089
[laughter]

00:34:50.089 --> 00:35:03.359
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: So I'm doin' my, "You pump your
gas, I'll pump mine," thing and I'm-I'm thinkin'

00:35:03.359 --> 00:35:20.160
about work or somethin' and I'm got a lady
across the way is like giving me the stink

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.160
face.

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.160
[laughter]

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:34.589
I call it the stink face because it's the
face that you make when you smell somethin'

00:35:34.589 --> 00:35:35.589
funky.

00:35:35.589 --> 00:35:36.589
[laughter]

00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:39.690
You know that one?

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:40.780
[laughter]

00:35:40.780 --> 00:36:07.470
She was givin me the stink face. And she's
like burnin' a hole on the side of my head

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:13.460
with the stink face.

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:14.960
[laughter]

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:25.430
So [laughs] I like, I hit her with the megawatt.
She's like. 'Foo!'

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:26.430
[laughter]

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:31.020
I'm like, "Okay. I'll just keep pumpin' my
gas."

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:38.960
So she finishes staring at me and-and walks
[laughs] around to go pay for her gas and

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:48.499
I'm still pumpin' my gas. So I-I hit her with
the megawatt again, "Hey."

00:36:48.499 --> 00:36:49.499
[laughter]

00:36:49.499 --> 00:36:51.829
And she goes, "What is wrong with you?"

00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:53.410
[laughter]

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:55.280
I go, "Did do the [unintelligible]good enough?"

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.280
&gt;&gt;Female: Yeah.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.280
[laughter]

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:02.970
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: So I look at her and I go, "Look
besides the price of gas, I'm good."

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:03.970
[laughter]

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:05.350
"What's wrong with you?"

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:06.350
[laughter]

00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:09.089
She's like, "Huh." And just walks off again.

00:37:09.089 --> 00:37:17.250
And ever since, ever since that little girl
and ever since I changed my attitude I have

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:31.039
experiences like that where I walk away laughing,
and the person walks away with whatever they

00:37:31.039 --> 00:37:48.470
walked up to me with. And they take it back
with them and go back to their families, God

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:49.470
help 'em ?

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:50.470
[laughter]

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:57.410
to deal with all of that. But I-I walk away
with-with dignity and humor intact; and those

00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:00.539
are two really important things to me.

00:38:00.539 --> 00:38:14.690
So I found that dealing with that in those
simple terms and-and taking those small bites

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:23.460
when it comes to that, is one way of-of my
way of finding a positive path in something

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:26.109
that could have been negative.

00:38:26.109 --> 00:38:36.309
The other thing about it is the truth of the
matter is, there's-there's like 500 channels

00:38:36.309 --> 00:38:45.550
or more, I mean you all have Dish or whatever
you have, and there's Google TV --

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:46.550
[laughter]

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:54.140
and there's like a zillion things that people
could watch. And in that landscape of global

00:38:54.140 --> 00:39:02.230
television, 'cause that's what it is, and
in any instant we can call up a video from,

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:13.119
'China's Got Talent' and a million people
will view it in a few hours, a day. There's

00:39:13.119 --> 00:39:16.349
a lot of things vying for people's attention
today and honestly, as a television personality,

00:39:16.349 --> 00:39:17.680
I want people's attention.

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:24.160
And I-I was thinking it's-it's-it's -- attention
is a commodity in this world that we live

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:37.839
in now. And people will do it, get, try to
get attention at all costs.

00:39:37.839 --> 00:39:41.690
I'll just say two words, "reality television."
Hello.

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:42.690
[laughter]

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:51.329
They will try to get attention at all costs.
I mean Paris Hilton -- what'd she do again?

00:39:51.329 --> 00:39:52.329
[laughter]

00:39:52.329 --> 00:40:03.359
But she is Paris Hilton you know what I mean?
I mean attention at all costs is worth a-a

00:40:03.359 --> 00:40:11.819
lot in this day and age 'cause it's really
about just having that bit of some person's

00:40:11.819 --> 00:40:22.460
mental property in there where they go, "Oh
yeah, I know that guy." And that can sell

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:29.640
on-on whatever platform we have -- on the
Web or whatever.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:42.700
And honestly I thought that this was gonna
be the end of my little bit of television;

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:48.079
my small bit of TV real estate.

00:40:48.079 --> 00:41:05.799
I-I got vitiligo when I had a job in Kentucky.
I got a job in New York and hid that I had

00:41:05.799 --> 00:41:22.009
it. I only had it on my hand and on my scalp
when I got to WABC in New York. Then I would

00:41:22.009 --> 00:41:28.739
just put makeup on it and nobody-nobody knew.

00:41:28.739 --> 00:41:34.240
When it got on my face completely freaked
out. I mean was walkin' in Central Park talkin'

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:45.029
to myself, "What am I gonna do? Go to trucking
school or what am I gonna do now." People

00:41:45.029 --> 00:41:53.849
were lookin' at me like, "Why does that guy
dressed so nice to be homeless?"

00:41:53.849 --> 00:41:54.849
[laughter]

00:41:54.849 --> 00:42:06.619
"No. No. I'm just talkin' to myself. Don't
worry about it." Sat on the bench and I really,

00:42:06.619 --> 00:42:15.170
I took my whole lunch break the day I-I was
completely diagnosed saying, "This is vitiligo;

00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:26.519
it's not curable. What are ya gonna do?" My
whole lunch break I was sittin' in the park

00:42:26.519 --> 00:42:30.700
talkin' to myself, thinkin' that it's over.

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:47.960
I worked my way through college, I paid for
it myself, I got my job in TV and I had been

00:42:47.960 --> 00:43:02.920
workin' ever since doin' pretty much entertainment
reporting and anchoring which is exactly what

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:18.489
I wanted to do; dream come true kinda scenario.

00:43:18.489 --> 00:43:42.440
So when I got the diagnosis, I thought it
was done. How can a guy with this kind of

00:43:42.440 --> 00:44:07.530
disease with this darker skin, and the-the
transition is gonna be crazy and one day it's

00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:24.119
gonna be, I'll be sittin' on some island with
a hat that says, "Press," on the front; one

00:44:24.119 --> 00:44:32.000
of those newsboy caps. "Well I used to be
on TV."

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000
[laughter]

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:44.290
So I could impress people at a bar, I mean
that's what I thought was my future. And-and

00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:57.670
it was hard for me to-to shake that-that image
in-in my head.

00:44:57.670 --> 00:45:17.079
But honestly, this situation that has happened
to me, this disease, has made me, not only

00:45:17.079 --> 00:45:31.099
the global spokesperson for this disease,
which is a very difficult disease for many

00:45:31.099 --> 00:45:43.569
people in a lot of countries. There are still
countries on this globe that think vitiligo

00:45:43.569 --> 00:45:57.400
is leprosy, and ostracize or even worse to
the person who has it in that culture.

00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:05.880
So I've become the face of this disease on
a global, a global platform. And also I-I

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:08.460
have become, for whatever little bit of mental
real estate that means, when people-people

00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:14.739
go, I've had people come to work for me that
say, "You know my dad knows your story; he

00:46:14.739 --> 00:46:23.089
read your book and-and-and he asked me if
I was comin' to the station to work with you.

00:46:23.089 --> 00:46:43.839
You're the first person I sought out when
I came here because I had heard your story."

00:46:43.839 --> 00:46:55.690
I was at an airport in Germany and this guys
comes up and, "Lee Thomas!" I'm thinkin',

00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:58.700
"Oh man!"

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:00.210
[laughter]

00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:08.650
I'm gonna be taken down in Germany.

00:47:08.650 --> 00:47:09.650
[laughter]

00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:12.660
Where's my mom's numbers?

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:13.660
[laughter]

00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:26.450
But he-he gives me hugs. "I see you on the
Larry King. You are incredible!"

00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:27.450
[laughter]

00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:35.499
And I'm like, "that's awesome," 'cause I really
thought I was going to go to customs on this.

00:47:35.499 --> 00:47:36.499
[laughter]

00:47:36.499 --> 00:47:37.619
He gives me a hug.

00:47:37.619 --> 00:47:43.339
It's incredible how now I've become a-a television
personality from Detroit without a doubt.

00:47:43.339 --> 00:47:55.239
But now people know all over the globe from
Australia to Taiwan who I am.

00:47:55.239 --> 00:48:02.130
I've spoken to groups in, last month I was
in Italy; month before that I was in Toronto;

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:03.969
I've been goin' all over the country and the
globe for that matter. I'm sharing my story.

00:48:03.969 --> 00:48:06.609
And I can say that what I thought was gonna
be the worst, devastating, show stopping thing

00:48:06.609 --> 00:48:08.940
in my life has turned out to be one of the
biggest blessings that I've ever had.

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:12.380
And it's incredible to even say that now.
It feels funny even coming out, but it's the

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:13.719
absolute truth. It's made me so much of a
better man than I was before in the shallow

00:48:13.719 --> 00:48:14.719
television world.

00:48:14.719 --> 00:48:15.719
[chuckles] I'm doin' an interview with a-a
Hollywood actress and-and she's got a pimple

00:48:15.719 --> 00:48:16.719
[laughs] --

00:48:16.719 --> 00:48:17.719
[laughter]

00:48:17.719 --> 00:48:18.719
Like right by her nose, like right in this
area. [laughs] And she -- like the makeup

00:48:18.719 --> 00:48:24.420
artist comes in and the other makeup artist
comes in and she says, "Oh my God, can you

00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:26.109
see it?"

00:48:26.109 --> 00:48:27.109
[laughter]

00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:40.759
Mind you this is in between my interview and
someone else's interview so I have to sit

00:48:40.759 --> 00:48:44.720
in the chair and I'm sittin' there goin' tryin'
not to laugh. She's like, "What?" I'm like,

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:45.720
"If you knew what my face looked like under
this makeup, that pimple's like small potatoes."

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:53.119
She goes, "I know, but you have to look -- this
is Hollywood." And I go, "I know. It's Hollywood.

00:48:53.119 --> 00:48:54.119
It's the way the people view you."

00:48:54.119 --> 00:48:55.119
But-but the thing that could have most devastating
for me turned out to be the-the most incredible;

00:48:55.119 --> 00:48:56.119
the most incredible.

00:48:56.119 --> 00:48:59.259
I-I say, I-I share that story especially when
I speak to people at companies because sometimes

00:48:59.259 --> 00:49:08.680
when you're in the midst of a situation, a
difficult task and you look at the difficulties

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:13.849
of that task, you-you pull yourself away from
it and pull the emotion away from the task,

00:49:13.849 --> 00:49:21.450
and you might find a gem in there that you
would not have noticed because it was a such

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:24.599
a devastating, bad thing two seconds ago.

00:49:24.599 --> 00:49:31.249
But if you pull yourself away from it and
try to look at it at every angle, different

00:49:31.249 --> 00:49:32.279
angles, all of a sudden an angle will come
out that you never would have thought of.

00:49:32.279 --> 00:49:34.950
I mean sittin' at this table I still can't
believe I still have my job. It's incredible!

00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:39.680
A hundred and twenty-five thousand people
every 15 minutes watch the number one morning

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:45.510
show in Detroit 'Fox Two News, the news that
works for you.'

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:46.510
[laughter]

00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:47.510
But --

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:48.510
[laughter]

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:52.819
I mean I never would have thought --

00:49:52.819 --> 00:49:53.819
[laughter]

00:49:53.819 --> 00:49:58.819
that —like Austin down there/

00:49:58.819 --> 00:49:59.819
[laughter]

00:49:59.819 --> 00:50:01.829
Thank you.

00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:12.260
I never would have thought that I would be
able to maintain my job and-and look like

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:20.920
this and have this disease and slowly change
over time.

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:34.130
But it's turned out to be the singular defining
thing that defines not only me, it defines

00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:40.569
how great my boss and our general manager
are, because from day one they've been nothing

00:50:40.569 --> 00:50:41.569
but supportive.

00:50:41.569 --> 00:50:47.410
'Cause I-I, went it started getting worse
when I couldn't hide it anymore, I'd go into

00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:54.599
my boss' office and I would say, "I don't
know if I'm gonna be able to stay on TV doin'

00:50:54.599 --> 00:51:00.820
this." And she goes, "We love what you do.
We love your work. Whatever you decide to

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:07.619
do, we're gonna support you. But we want you
on our television station." I'm like, "Cool.

00:51:07.619 --> 00:51:09.959
Just checking. Good to know."

00:51:09.959 --> 00:51:10.959
[laughter]

00:51:10.959 --> 00:51:21.670
And I always, especially when I talk to younger
kids, I-I try to tell 'em to have-have what

00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:33.249
I call "their-their high council" because
there's a lot of people who say a lot of stuff,

00:51:33.249 --> 00:51:38.539
talkin' about attention. You can hear opinions
from anywhere. Just click on your computer,

00:51:38.539 --> 00:51:45.209
Google something, you got a zillion opinions
on everything.

00:51:45.209 --> 00:52:00.430
But you-you can't listen to them all. You
have to pick your high council and listen

00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:05.489
to those people. And it's usually someone
that has a stake in you; someone who has some

00:52:05.489 --> 00:52:06.489
kind of emotional stake in you: family or
just a really good friend who is that honest

00:52:06.489 --> 00:52:07.489
person. And for me it-it's my sister, Beverly.
She-she has made me more money.

00:52:07.489 --> 00:52:08.489
One time I was tryin' to negotiate a contract
and I called my sister and she goes, "You

00:52:08.489 --> 00:52:09.489
can't live on that! Ask for 20 grand more!"

00:52:09.489 --> 00:52:10.489
[laughter]

00:52:10.489 --> 00:52:11.489
I go, "Are you serious?"

00:52:11.489 --> 00:52:12.489
[laughter]

00:52:12.489 --> 00:52:14.150
She goes, "Just try it; see what happens.
But be nice when you say it."

00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:15.150
[laughter]

00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:16.150
I called her back I'm like, "Get outta here!"

00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:17.150
[laughter]

00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:18.150
"Five G. Ahh!!!"

00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:19.150
[laughter]

00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:20.150
But my sister's always been very honest with
me and I said to her, "I don't know if I can

00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:21.150
continue to do this. I don't know if I can
stay doin' this."

00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:22.150
And she goes, "Why? Has-has the big boss,"
(that's the guy in the biggest office, I call

00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:23.150
him "big boss") – the general manager ?

00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:24.150
[laughter]

00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:25.150
"Has the big boss said anything?" And I go,
"No. They've been, they're still very supportive."

00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:26.150
And she go, "Well has-has the boss said anything?
Has she said anything?"

00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:27.150
My boss is the news director, my direct boss.
And I go, "No. She's, they've been very supportive."

00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:28.150
She said, "Have any of your co-workers said
that you need to quit because you have vitiligo?"

00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:29.150
I go,"No. Not to my face they didn't."

00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:30.150
She goes, "Well the only person I hear sayin'
it is you. So stop sayin' it. Just stop saying

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:33.140
it. Stop sayin' it; stop thinking it; stop
acting that way. Act like it's your job and

00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:40.859
that you're gonna have it for a long time,
even if you don't believe it right now. Just

00:52:40.859 --> 00:52:43.150
act that way."

00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:49.289
And it changed; and once again just a simple
thing as perspective.

00:52:49.289 --> 00:52:51.990
I-I beg to say, I don't beg to say, I'll just
say it --

00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.990
[laughter]

00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:59.630
that you can't define somethin' as negative
until you define it as negative. Up until

00:52:59.630 --> 00:53:02.329
that point it's just something that happened.
Up until that point, it's just something that

00:53:02.329 --> 00:53:03.329
happened.

00:53:03.329 --> 00:53:04.329
You can walk out of this room right now and-and
slip and-and-and fall right there in the hallway.

00:53:04.329 --> 00:53:05.329
You can get up and go, "I cannot believe that
just happened. Why does this kind of stuff

00:53:05.329 --> 00:53:06.329
always happen to me?"

00:53:06.329 --> 00:53:07.329
But what if while you were slippin' and fallin'
in the hallway and doin' all that stuff, there

00:53:07.329 --> 00:53:10.589
was something in your office that much worse
that would have happened if you wouldn't have

00:53:10.589 --> 00:53:11.589
fallen in the hallway?

00:53:11.589 --> 00:53:12.750
But you don't know that because you're too
busy worried about what just happened in the

00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:21.570
hallway to know that you just avoided something
much worse. That if you slipped and fell in

00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:23.390
your office and hit the side of your desk
that you'd be at the hospital.

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:24.820
So it's all about the perspective on the situation;
'cause things happen in life. Nothin's gonna

00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:26.480
be smooth sailing ever. It's all about how
you prescribe feelings or emotions around

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:27.660
that situation. And-and what you, what weight
you give it.

00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:30.329
I always say to people that if you, I have
this thing I call the five second-five minute

00:53:30.329 --> 00:53:34.230
rule; you get five seconds to let it all out
when something happens. Because things happen

00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:36.150
and you have emotions and you have to deal
with those emotions. You take five seconds

00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:37.660
and sometimes you may wanna go somewhere by
yourself and just let it all out.

00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:38.660
Whatever you wanna say, however you wanna
say it, let it happen. Stop at five seconds

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:39.660
and then take five minutes to get over it
 -- if you need five minutes to get over it.

00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:40.660
Whatever it takes: call your best friend,
write it in your journal, which I highly recommend,

00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:41.660
but take those five minutes and really get
over it.

00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:42.660
I don't mean go over it. I mean get over it.
Meaning that situation happened; it's not

00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:43.660
defining who I am; it's just the situation
that happened. And if you could figure out

00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:44.660
why it happened, do that whatever the situation
is.

00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:45.660
And then change that situation's outcome by
the end of that five minutes and go, "You

00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:46.660
know what? I'm glad this, this, and this didn't
happen and that's the only thing that happened."

00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:47.660
And make it something better in that five
minutes. And then after five minutes, let

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:51.880
it go. L-I-G. I was interviewing Snoop Dog
once he said, "L-I-G, brother --

00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:52.880
[laughter]

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:56.329
And I said, "What?"

00:53:56.329 --> 00:53:57.630
"Let it go."

00:53:57.630 --> 00:53:58.630
[laughter]

00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:59.630
Let it go. Don't go back and go, "Man it's
this-this happened two weeks ago and it's

00:53:59.630 --> 00:54:04.719
happening again." In two weeks, let it go.
Let it go.

00:54:04.719 --> 00:54:09.930
If you go over your life and there's some
things you do over and over all the time;

00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:11.490
happen every day. You get up, you take a shower,
you brush your teeth, sometimes you don't,

00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:12.490
sometimes you don't take a shower. You're
still alive; you still have the opportunity

00:54:12.490 --> 00:54:13.490
to live. Don't prescribe all these bad things
to that one moment so it's gonna devastate

00:54:13.490 --> 00:54:14.490
your life.

00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:15.490
And-and in five minutes really let it go.
And sometimes that's hard to do, because what

00:54:15.490 --> 00:54:16.490
happened is tough. And what I do is I, it-it
sounds kind of funny, but I call it a-a "happy

00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:17.490
thought." And whatever that "happy thought"
can be -- and for me I have a two-year old

00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:18.490
daughter and she cracks me up; just lookin'
at a picture of her. [laughs]

00:54:18.490 --> 00:54:19.490
But whatever that is for you for-for a guy
I was at a, at a, at a company and I was asking

00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:20.490
people what could be your happy thought for-for
a guy it was a car that he was workin' on

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:21.490
'cause every time he goes to work on that
car. it just, it just makes him, makes him

00:54:21.490 --> 00:54:22.490
happy.

00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:23.490
It could be your mom; it could be your dog;
it could be your house; could be a walk on

00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:24.490
the beach you had with your sister, your mother,
your girlfriend, your wife, your husband.

00:54:24.490 --> 00:54:25.490
But whatever that happy thought is. after
that five minutes, go there and live there

00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:26.490
for a couple minutes so that you come out
of it on the other side of it realizing that,

00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:27.490
"I'm still here. They're still here. Life
is still good. I'm gonna go home and my daughter's

00:54:27.490 --> 00:54:28.490
gonna give me a hug."

00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:29.490
Whatever just happened is small potatoes compared
to her well-being.

00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:30.490
I mean I might have fallen in the hall, somebody
might have said something a bit flippant to

00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:31.490
me about the way that I look, but they don't
sign my paycheck and what they said is not

00:54:31.490 --> 00:54:32.490
gonna hurt my daughter [someone in audience
coughing] or hurt me. So I move right on and

00:54:32.490 --> 00:54:33.490
I don't, I don't harbor, I don't harbor any
of those emotions.

00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:34.490
I just like sharing-sharing stories in that
way because maybe that's somethin' that you

00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:35.490
can take with you as you try to overcome obstacles
not only in your life, but at work.

00:54:35.490 --> 00:54:36.490
It makes, it makes the things that happen
at work so much smaller when you big picture,

00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:37.490
when you big picture something.

00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:38.490
Another thing that I end up talking about
 --

00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:39.490
[pause]

00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:40.490
&gt;&gt;female voice: Yeah. Come on in.

00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:41.490
[laughter]

00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:42.490
[several people talking at same time.

00:54:42.490 --> 00:54:43.490
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: Another thing, another thing
I end up talkin' about a lot is-is Michael

00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:44.490
Jackson. He had the disease vitiligo; he talked
about different venues and for some reason

00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:45.490
people just will not believe it; will not
believe it.

00:54:45.490 --> 00:54:46.490
I say to people, "What if you were the most
popular person on the planet? Your album "Thriller"

00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:47.490
is out and there's this album cover with you,
baddest dude in the world, women are fainting

00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:48.490
at your sight, albums are selling like hotcakes,
but you have a secret.

00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:49.490
You really look like this instead of that.
What do you do for all of those millions of

00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:50.490
fans, for all of those millions of fans? And
if you're in Hollywood, you hide it. You fix

00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:51.490
it. That's the way they do things; they fix
it – they fix their hair, nose, butt – everything

00:54:51.490 --> 00:54:52.490
else.

00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:53.490
[laughter]

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:54.490
Hair, you fix it.

00:54:54.490 --> 00:54:55.490
So I-I understand why he hid. I'm pretty sure
that's what the people around him told him

00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:56.490
to do was to hide. I understand how it became
more difficult for him.

00:54:56.490 --> 00:54:57.490
I also understand why the people who loved
him protected him, because people do it for

00:54:57.490 --> 00:54:58.490
me. It's so funny.

00:54:58.490 --> 00:54:59.490
I was at a, I was at a gas station tryin'
to get gas and I'm, I walk in to pay for my

00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:00.490
gas and the guy behind the counter goes, "Oh
come on, you cut this out." I'm like, "What?

00:55:00.490 --> 00:55:01.490
I'm just thirty on pump three." "No, no, no
stop this with the face thing. You have, you

00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:02.490
have the Halloween mask on." I go, "Dude,
it's not Halloween really. Thirty on pump

00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:03.490
three."

00:55:03.490 --> 00:55:04.490
[laughter]

00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:05.490
He's like, "No, no, no take this stuff off
your face. That is the best makeup I've ever

00:55:05.490 --> 00:55:06.490
seen. Take this off your face now. Hey come
here, look at this guy. Come here. Come here."

00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:07.490
Some other guy comes in, "Oh look at this.
Is this a Halloween mask?" [laughs]

00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:08.490
I said, "Really, just want gas. You guys are
really funny --

00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:09.490
[laughter]

00:55:09.490 --> 00:55:10.490
should be on Letterman, but I-I want, I want
gas."

00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:11.490
[laughter]

00:55:11.490 --> 00:55:12.490
"No, no, no, no, no."

00:55:12.490 --> 00:55:13.490
So the guy, there was two ladies behind me
and another guy. The guy literally pushes

00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:14.490
me out of the way and goes, "Do you know who
this is?"

00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:15.490
[laughter]

00:55:15.490 --> 00:55:16.490
"Do you know who this guy is?"

00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:17.490
And I go, "Please don't. No. No."

00:55:17.490 --> 00:55:18.490
[laughter]

00:55:18.490 --> 00:55:19.490
"Don't go that route, please. Please I just
want-want thirty on three please."

00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:20.490
[laughter]

00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:21.490
And the lady's like, "I can't believe they're
sayin' that. There must be somethin' you can

00:55:21.490 --> 00:55:22.490
do. You should call the Problem Solvers. Get
a camera out here. They don't know you're

00:55:22.490 --> 00:55:23.490
Lee Thomas."

00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:24.490
[laughter]

00:55:24.490 --> 00:55:25.490
The guy's like, "He is Lee Thomas."

00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:26.490
And I'm like, "Oh my God."

00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:27.490
[laughter]

00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:28.490
And then they realize that-that I, that it's
me; that I have a disease; not that I'm Lee

00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:29.490
Thomas. But I think the three people on the
other side of the counter would mug them if

00:55:29.490 --> 00:55:30.490
they didn't just give me my gas.

00:55:30.490 --> 00:55:31.490
[laughter]

00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:32.490
So they-they take my $30 from me and say,
"Thank you."

00:55:32.490 --> 00:55:33.490
And I walk off and [laughing] going, "You
people are great, like hey follow me around

00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:34.490
all the time."

00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:35.490
[laughter]

00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:36.490
Very entertaining."

00:55:36.490 --> 00:55:37.490
But the-the way that people react to the way
that you look is-is incredible. So could you

00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:38.490
imagine bein' Michael Jackson with all that?
I mean really.

00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:39.490
I, when I first got the disease, I got one
spot. I got a spot on my scalp, got two on

00:55:39.490 --> 00:55:40.490
my scalp and then I got one on my hand probably
the size of a quarter. And so this was one

00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:41.490
of the worse ones that happened while I was
here in Detroit.

00:55:41.490 --> 00:55:42.490
And it was like early September and I wore
one glove to do my live shots. So I'd hold

00:55:42.490 --> 00:55:43.490
the-the mic with the gloved hand so I could
shake people's hands with this hand. And the

00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:44.490
gloved hand was covering the spot. Hee-hee-Hee.

00:55:44.490 --> 00:55:45.490
[laughter]

00:55:45.490 --> 00:55:46.490
And so I was reading on Michael Jackson and-and
Michael Jackson's friend and one of his friends

00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:47.490
had said that the reason he wore the one glove
that became a fashion statement is because

00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:48.490
he had a spot on his hand and he couldn't
put makeup on 'cause it kept coming off. So

00:55:48.490 --> 00:55:49.490
he made this, he just didn't wanna wear a
glove he-he was an entertainer so he had to

00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:50.490
wear a bedazzled glove.

00:55:50.490 --> 00:55:51.490
[laughter]

00:55:51.490 --> 00:55:52.490
But-but he was really just covering the vitiligo.

00:55:52.490 --> 00:55:53.490
Then for me it went from one hand to two hands
and I tried the two glove thing, but it really

00:55:53.490 --> 00:55:54.490
wasn't that season for that either. People
were writing in, "Why is Lee Thomas wearing

00:55:54.490 --> 00:55:55.490
gloves and it's not cold?"

00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:56.490
[laughter]

00:55:56.490 --> 00:55:57.490
Thanks a lot Internet people.

00:55:57.490 --> 00:55:58.490
[laughter]

00:55:58.490 --> 00:55:59.490
Skin! [hits the table]

00:55:59.490 --> 00:56:00.490
But so people were writing in so I had to,
I had to get rid of the gloves. I had to go,

00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:01.490
"You know what? They're just gonna see the
spots on my hands."

00:56:01.490 --> 00:56:02.490
But Michael Jackson, remember, he went to
two gloves; went to two gloves for a long

00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:03.490
time.

00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:04.490
The other thing that I end up vouching for
him a lot for is that one of the procedures

00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:05.490
for this disease is that if you get it in
over 80 percent of your body, meaning that

00:56:05.490 --> 00:56:06.490
there's only 20 percent pigment left, that
you bleach out the rest.

00:56:06.490 --> 00:56:07.490
But the problem with that is you have to continue
to bleach because your, even though it's not

00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:08.490
makin' a lot of pigment, your body still tries
to make pigment. So you'll get spots of pigment

00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:09.490
all over your body.

00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:10.490
And but once, and also once you bleach the
rest out so that you're uniform, your skin

00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:11.490
becomes really sensitive to the sun. So you
have to use hats and umbrellas and scarves

00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:12.490
to cover up when you go out in the sun. I
have to carry a hat everywhere I go because

00:56:12.490 --> 00:56:13.490
you can see through my scalp that it's gone.
And it-it burns like that [snaps fingers].

00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:14.490
I can't go cover a U of M game or anywhere
for that matter on a hot sunny day and stay

00:56:14.490 --> 00:56:15.490
out in the sun for a two hour newscast. I
have to get in the truck and get in and out

00:56:15.490 --> 00:56:16.490
of the truck 'cause it'll-it'll really give
me a severe sunburn.

00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:17.490
And he had to deal with the same thing. He
had to deal with the same thing. But it all

00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:18.490
fell in the weird category and he never really,
and no one ever really addressed it with him

00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:19.490
in any in depth fashion.

00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:20.490
So as I tour the world, I end up going, "Yes,
yes, it's one the pro- yes he bleached his

00:56:20.490 --> 00:56:21.490
skin." Wow, vouchin' for Michael Jackson,
huh?

00:56:21.490 --> 00:56:22.490
[laughter]

00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:23.490
So one day I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm at my desk I think
it's CNN or one of, or USA Today or one of

00:56:23.490 --> 00:56:24.490
those, one of those newspapers websites whatever
had called and I answered the phone and they

00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:25.490
go, "Well, Quincy Jones says Michael Jackson
wants to be white. Do you have a comment?"

00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:26.490
I'm like, "You want me to refute Quincy Jones?"

00:56:26.490 --> 00:56:27.490
[laughter]

00:56:27.490 --> 00:56:28.490
I'm like, "Okay, first of all he's one of
the best music producers EVER!!

00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:29.490
[laughter]

00:56:29.490 --> 00:56:30.490
I love him. There's nothing I can do. He could
crush me like a bug without even thinking."

00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:31.490
[laughter]

00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:32.490
"Second, he's off his rocker. The guy had
a disease. Michael Jackson had vitiligo. He

00:56:32.490 --> 00:56:33.490
was not trying to be white. He was just turning
white; it wasn't a choice."

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:34.490
He would've never said he wasn't an African-American.
He addressed the disease to Oprah Winfrey

00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:35.490
and to Martin Bashir in two different interviews
that he has so much other stuff going on that

00:56:35.490 --> 00:56:36.490
he said, "I have vitiligo," and the next sentence
was, "So you have sleepovers."

00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:37.490
It was just not ever really addressed.

00:56:37.490 --> 00:56:38.490
So it gives you a different perspective and
for me, it gave me a different perspective

00:56:38.490 --> 00:56:39.490
being that I cannot hide, because if you hide,
it lets people draw their own conclusions,

00:56:39.490 --> 00:56:40.490
and man their conclusions can be way out there,
way out there.

00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:41.490
So not that he did the wrong thing, because
I think each person has to define what's best

00:56:41.490 --> 00:56:42.490
for them. And I'm not saying the way that
I treated this situation or I treat this situation

00:56:42.490 --> 00:56:43.490
is the right way to do it.

00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:44.490
But he was a great example of what not to
do for me. I mean when he died, I had a whole

00:56:44.490 --> 00:56:45.490
'nother set of interviews where people wanted
to just talk about vitiligo, and-and hopefully

00:56:45.490 --> 00:56:46.490
one day people will stop-stop asking me because
it's understood; or even better, even better,

00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:47.490
it's cured. It could be, it could be cured.

00:56:47.490 --> 00:56:48.490
How we doin' with time?

00:56:48.490 --> 00:56:49.490
&gt;&gt;commentator: So we-we have, we have about
10 minutes left --

00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:50.490
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: Okay.

00:56:50.490 --> 00:56:51.490
&gt;&gt;commentator: So if you have a [some coughing]
couple other key things or if you just wanna

00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:52.490
just open it up to questions --

00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:53.490
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: Um-hum.

00:56:53.490 --> 00:56:54.490
&gt;&gt;commentator: it's up to you.

00:56:54.490 --> 00:56:55.490
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: I'm sure you-you guys might
have some questions, yeah? No, yeah, no?

00:56:55.490 --> 00:56:56.490
But well I'll leave you with this real quickly;
real quickly.

00:56:56.490 --> 00:56:57.490
As I, and you can tell I talk for a living,
so --

00:56:57.490 --> 00:56:58.490
[laughter]

00:56:58.490 --> 00:56:59.490
but if-if-if you walk out of this room with
anything, hopefully you'll walk out realizing

00:56:59.490 --> 00:57:00.490
that there are-are some insurmountable things
or seemly insurmountable things that happen

00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:01.490
throughout a lifetime that make you think
that you cannot do, and I say not only do,

00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:02.490
but dream.

00:57:02.490 --> 00:57:03.490
Because not only is it gonna make you happy
to do and live your dreams, but I really feel

00:57:03.490 --> 00:57:04.490
like we need each other to live our dreams,
because I wouldn't be drivin' a car if it

00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:05.490
wasn't for the guy who dreamed of makin' the
car. Not only that, dreamed of making it affordable

00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:06.490
for everyone to be able to drive a car. I
wouldn't be sitting here if Al Gore didn't

00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:07.490
in-invent the Internet for us to use.

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:08.490
[laughter]

00:57:08.490 --> 00:57:09.490
That's still funny, isn't it?

00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:10.490
[laughter]

00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:11.490
Years later, that's still funny.

00:57:11.490 --> 00:57:12.490
[laughter]

00:57:12.490 --> 00:57:13.490
But I only say that to say that it's-it-it's
up to you to figure out how to get past your

00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:14.490
obstacles at work, at home, whereever you
are. But we help each other in every way.

00:57:14.490 --> 00:57:15.490
If you subtract money from the equation, and
I know that's hard to do so please bear with

00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:16.490
me for a moment. If you subtract money from
the equation, there's not one part of your

00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:17.490
life that's not bent on somebody else, that's
not up to someone else.

00:57:17.490 --> 00:57:18.490
Did you grow all the food you eat? Yes and
no. Somebody else did. Did you make the clothes

00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:19.490
you're wearing right now? Yes and not. Somebody
else pretty much made those.

00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:20.490
Anything, and you go get in your car, did
you drill for oil and turn it into petroleum

00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:21.490
and put the gas in there for you to drive
home?

00:57:21.490 --> 00:57:22.490
I mean you look in your refrigerator and it's
like a slice of the globe. You can have oranges

00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:23.490
from somewhere in South America; you could
have containers from China; all these things

00:57:23.490 --> 00:57:24.490
that you use on a daily basis that you do
on a daily basis from-from haircuts to shoes

00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:25.490
are based on someone helping you; subtracting
money from the situation.

00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:26.490
So I say not only find a way past your difficulties,
living your best life actually helps me and

00:57:26.490 --> 00:57:27.490
you and you and you and you; it helps each
other, especially in a work environment like

00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:28.490
that, like this where you guys are. It-it
literally does; it literally does.

00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:29.490
'Cause you know you're in a work group situation
and someone has a problem and that problem

00:57:29.490 --> 00:57:30.490
becomes the one where they go and talk about
the problem to the next person, and that problem

00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:31.490
becomes a problem that's talked about by the
next person and it goes.

00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:32.490
Then the next day you come to work and you
find out that you have a fake leg and you

00:57:32.490 --> 00:57:33.490
really couldn't walk when you made that decision
'cause that's how far the story has gone;

00:57:33.490 --> 00:57:34.490
when if the first person with the problem
didn't call it a problem, then it wouldn't

00:57:34.490 --> 00:57:35.490
be a problem. It would be a situation that
we're all helping with.

00:57:35.490 --> 00:57:36.490
So it's just a perspective thing that changes
lives. And it, and it changed mine. And it

00:57:36.490 --> 00:57:37.490
did change mine.

00:57:37.490 --> 00:57:38.490
So could we have some questions?

00:57:38.490 --> 00:57:39.490
[pause]

00:57:39.490 --> 00:57:40.490
Anyone?

00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:41.490
&gt;&gt;commentator: Please.

00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:42.490
&gt;male #1: I've heard looks are everything.
Is that --

00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:43.490
[laughter]

00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:44.490
[many people talking at once]

00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:45.490
or is it something dumb?

00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:46.490
[laughter]

00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:47.490
&gt;&gt;female #1: Well I just have a little one.
How do you, how is the reaction then because

00:57:47.490 --> 00:57:48.490
you do deal with so many celebrities --

00:57:48.490 --> 00:57:49.490
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: Um-hum.

00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:50.490
&gt;&gt;female #1: has the reaction in your journey
been different in that spotlight with celebrities

00:57:50.490 --> 00:57:51.490
 --

00:57:51.490 --> 00:57:52.490
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: It has.

00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:53.490
&gt;&gt;female #1: versus us everyday kind of people.

00:57:53.490 --> 00:57:54.490
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: It has.

00:57:54.490 --> 00:57:55.490
I walk in and this has happened more than
a few times since, but the first time it happened,

00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:56.490
I walk in to interview George Clooney for
"Leatherheads", which I didn't think was a

00:57:56.490 --> 00:57:57.490
bad movie; I thought it was okay. But I just
like Clooney.

00:57:57.490 --> 00:57:58.490
And I walk in the room he goes, "Hey, Lee,
man I knew you were comin' and I've been watchin'

00:57:58.490 --> 00:57:59.490
your story; you were on 20/20 and I saw you
on Larry King and I have one of my best friends

00:57:59.490 --> 00:58:00.490
has vitiligo and he's had it all his life.
And he almost stopped acting because he had

00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:01.490
this, so what you're doin' is a good thing;
don't stop doin' that; just don't stop."

00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:02.490
Before I even sat down in the chair he said,
"Don't stop doin' that. You're doin' a great

00:58:02.490 --> 00:58:03.490
job at that. Keep doin' that."

00:58:03.490 --> 00:58:04.490
And I go, "You're George Clooney."

00:58:04.490 --> 00:58:05.490
[laughter]

00:58:05.490 --> 00:58:06.490
And I just start laughing. He goes, "Yeah,
but I pay attention." He's just an astute

00:58:06.490 --> 00:58:07.490
guy; he pays attention to the news as well.
And it was just weird that the minute of my

00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:08.490
interview was George Clooney talkin' to me
about me. So naturally I go, "So he was talkin'

00:58:08.490 --> 00:58:09.490
for the first minute --

00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:10.490
[laughter]

00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:11.490
do I get another minute here 'cause I only
have seven minutes, George, and you steal

00:58:11.490 --> 00:58:12.490
one of my minutes talkin' about me --

00:58:12.490 --> 00:58:13.490
[laughter]

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:14.490
"unless I can use that." He goes, "Yeah, yeah
use it. Use it" I'm like, "Okay good 'cause

00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:15.490
 --

00:58:15.490 --> 00:58:16.490
[laughter]

00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:17.490
I only got a few minutes here, brother."

00:58:17.490 --> 00:58:18.490
[laughter]

00:58:18.490 --> 00:58:19.490
That happened with Ashton Kutcher; it's happened
with Loretta Devine, it's just what-what's

00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:20.490
the guys name, just was in there, his name
was Donal Logue. Same, he-he said, he's a

00:58:20.490 --> 00:58:21.490
great actor isn't he?

00:58:21.490 --> 00:58:22.490
[laughter]

00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:23.490
He's a great actor.

00:58:23.490 --> 00:58:24.490
But anyway he was just in the studio the other
day and he did the same thing. He goes, "Oh

00:58:24.490 --> 00:58:25.490
man I saw you at, I thought you worked in
Atlanta." I go, "No, I've been here in Detroit."

00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:26.490
"So when you told your story it was from Detroit?"
And I go, "And we're live with Donal Logue,

00:58:26.490 --> 00:58:27.490
we're gonna talk about his television show
 – right, Donal?"

00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:28.490
[laughter]

00:58:28.490 --> 00:58:29.490
"Right."

00:58:29.490 --> 00:58:30.490
Like of course we are.

00:58:30.490 --> 00:58:31.490
[laughter]

00:58:31.490 --> 00:58:32.490
That's the-the thing that's made it a little,
a little weird when people -- they've seen

00:58:32.490 --> 00:58:33.490
my story and-and I've-I've never had a-a negative
response from-from the celebrities who see

00:58:33.490 --> 00:58:34.490
my story, when they bring it up.

00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:35.490
Now there have been some celebrities that
don't wanna shake my hand for whatever reason;

00:58:35.490 --> 00:58:36.490
it's happened.

00:58:36.490 --> 00:58:37.490
I went, I'll tell you this story 'cause it
turns out well 'cause I'd never dump on anybody.

00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:38.490
But I went --

00:58:38.490 --> 00:58:39.490
[laughter]

00:58:39.490 --> 00:58:40.490
I went to sha-shake Seth Green's hand and
I shake his hand and he looks at my hand he

00:58:40.490 --> 00:58:41.490
goes, "What's your deal?"

00:58:41.490 --> 00:58:42.490
[laughter]

00:58:42.490 --> 00:58:43.490
And I go, "What's my deal? What do you mean?"

00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:44.490
He goes, "What's with the white hand and black-black
face thing?"

00:58:44.490 --> 00:58:45.490
And I go, "Oh yeah, yeah, yeah." I go, "I
have a disease called vitiligo."

00:58:45.490 --> 00:58:46.490
He goes, "Vitiligo, I know what that is."
He goes, "It turns you completely,"

00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:47.490
I go, "Yeah, completely."

00:58:47.490 --> 00:58:48.490
He goes, "You know one of my buddy's had that
and he started gettin' spots everywhere; he

00:58:48.490 --> 00:58:49.490
freaked out." He says, "Is that what that
is?"

00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:50.490
I go, "Yeah, yeah." I go, "So you've heard
of it."

00:58:50.490 --> 00:58:51.490
He goes, "Yeah, Michael Jackson had that man."

00:58:51.490 --> 00:58:52.490
And I go, "I know."

00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:53.490
[laughter]

00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:54.490
And I go, "Can I get another minute here?

00:58:54.490 --> 00:58:55.490
[laughter]

00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:56.490
'Cause Seth, you just killed one of my minutes
 --

00:58:56.490 --> 00:58:57.490
[laughter]

00:58:57.490 --> 00:58:58.490
'cause they're really tight on time."

00:58:58.490 --> 00:58:59.490
But it's been, it's been incredible; it really
has; it really has.

00:58:59.490 --> 00:59:00.490
&gt;&gt;female #2: I wanna say like how his like
specifically to the African-American community

00:59:00.490 --> 00:59:01.490
has reacted to the disease since it's, I think
for African-Americans much more obvious --

00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:02.490
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: Um-hum. When we have it.

00:59:02.490 --> 00:59:03.490
&gt;&gt;female #2: when people of color, yeah.

00:59:03.490 --> 00:59:04.490
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: Yeah, it-it's-it's been very,
very embracing. I made a best-seller list,

00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:05.490
my book made a best-seller list. It was the
Essence Best Seller List which was very cool

00:59:05.490 --> 00:59:06.490
 --

00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:07.490
[laughter]

00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:08.490
It was very cool. So the ladies at Essence
are readin' my book.

00:59:08.490 --> 00:59:09.490
[laughter]

00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:10.490
What are you doin', girl?

00:59:10.490 --> 00:59:11.490
[laughter]

00:59:11.490 --> 00:59:12.490
So no, it's been really --

00:59:12.490 --> 00:59:13.490
[laughter]

00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:14.490
it's been really, really cool because I think
that a lot of times, whatever community it

00:59:14.490 --> 00:59:15.490
is, but especially the African-American community,
didn't have a lot of information about the

00:59:15.490 --> 00:59:16.490
disease. And Michael Jackson when it comes
to the disease 'cause they interviewed him

00:59:16.490 --> 00:59:17.490
before Essence specifically and-and Ebony
and all-all of the African-American publications,

00:59:17.490 --> 00:59:18.490
but no one really talks to him about this.

00:59:18.490 --> 00:59:19.490
So I've been in Jet Ebony, I've been in Essence,
I've been all these magazines and they featured

00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:20.490
me in different ways, and on B-E-T and all
this stuff kind of givin' people the-the real

00:59:20.490 --> 00:59:21.490
skinny on vitiligo and-and-and everyone of
'em asked about Michael Jackson.

00:59:21.490 --> 00:59:22.490
Because it, the other thing it helped me do
is to clearly define myself as an African-American

00:59:22.490 --> 00:59:23.490
man. 'Cause no matter much my pigment goes
away, I'm still going to be that just as much

00:59:23.490 --> 00:59:24.490
as-as-as someone's Italian-American or-or
Is-Israeli-American, or whatever you might

00:59:24.490 --> 00:59:25.490
be. It's not gonna go away just because your
pigment goes away.

00:59:25.490 --> 00:59:26.490
So I had to clearly, clearly define that.

00:59:26.490 --> 00:59:27.490
It's funny 'cause I was on a plane, a long
plane ride back from London, and a guy, a

00:59:27.490 --> 00:59:28.490
guy was sittin' next to me; he ended up being
a college professor at State, and so we were

00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:29.490
talking back and forth and after he figured
I was cool he goes, "Can I ask you a question?"

00:59:29.490 --> 00:59:30.490
And I go, "Shoot."

00:59:30.490 --> 00:59:31.490
He says, "Are you, are you a black guy turnin'
white or a white guy turnin' black?"

00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:32.490
'Cause I'm on a, I'm on a plane and always
wear a hoody and alls you can see if pretty

00:59:32.490 --> 00:59:33.490
much this, right?

00:59:33.490 --> 00:59:34.490
So he sees this and my hands and he goes,
"I have no idea. Which one are you?"

00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:35.490
And I go, "I'm a brother, man.

00:59:35.490 --> 00:59:36.490
[laughter]

00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:37.490
Don't make me prove it." [raises his hand]

00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:38.490
[laughter]

00:59:38.490 --> 00:59:39.490
But it's really a-a question when your, when
your pigment goes away. And a lot of people

00:59:39.490 --> 00:59:40.490
that not only African-Americans but there's
a large Indian population. There's one city

00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:41.490
in India specifically that has a large portion
of their population that has vitiligo. And

00:59:41.490 --> 00:59:42.490
even though their skin isn't as dark as mine,
it's still devastating, a devastating disease

00:59:42.490 --> 00:59:43.490
when you start watching your pigment; especially
an-an African-American man, a dark-skinned

00:59:43.490 --> 00:59:44.490
African-American man when you are so clearly
defined by the color of your skin. So when

00:59:44.490 --> 00:59:45.490
it starts going away you have to go, "Okay."

00:59:45.490 --> 00:59:46.490
&gt;&gt;female #2: So it could be the other way,
too? It could be let's say you're of-of European

00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:47.490
descent ?

00:59:47.490 --> 00:59:48.490
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: Um-hum.

00:59:48.490 --> 00:59:49.490
&gt;&gt;female #2: your pigment could become darker
 --

00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:50.490
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: Um-hum.

00:59:50.490 --> 00:59:51.490
&gt;&gt;female #2: too so – oh really?

00:59:51.490 --> 00:59:52.490
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: There is a disease, not vitiligo.

00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:53.490
&gt;&gt;female #2: Okay.

00:59:53.490 --> 00:59:54.490
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: But there is a disease that
can turn, make your pigment get hyper-pigmentation,

00:59:54.490 --> 00:59:55.490
where you get darker than, than you would
want to be. But it's not gonna go like a person

00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:56.490
with-with-with white skin gets dark like an
African-American.

00:59:56.490 --> 00:59:57.490
&gt;&gt;female #2: Okay.

00:59:57.490 --> 00:59:58.490
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: It would get dark like a dark,
dark tan; as dark as they could get. You know

00:59:58.490 --> 00:59:59.490
what I mean?

00:59:59.490 --> 01:00:00.490
&gt;&gt;female #2: Yeah.

01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:01.490
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: So there-there is diseases that
can, that can do that as well.

01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:02.490
[pause]

01:00:02.490 --> 01:00:03.490
&gt;&gt;male #1: As I said earlier I see you, I
always see you on the news quite a bit ?

01:00:03.490 --> 01:00:04.490
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: Um-hum.

01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:05.490
&gt;&gt;male #1: if you, if people hadn't seen your
story they would never know.

01:00:05.490 --> 01:00:06.490
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: Right.

01:00:06.490 --> 01:00:07.490
&gt;&gt;male #1: Have you ever given any thought
to, is there any, I mean what's the reason

01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:08.490
why you --

01:00:08.490 --> 01:00:09.490
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: Don't?

01:00:09.490 --> 01:00:10.490
&gt;&gt;male #1: Yeah.

01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:11.490
&gt;&gt;Lee Thomas: The reason why I-I still wear
makeup on television is because I'll talk

01:00:11.490 --> 01:00:12.490
to everybody and their granddad about it,
but there is a portion of the population who

01:00:12.490 --> 01:00:13.490
can't get past it. There are people who can't
hear what I'm saying because of it.

01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:14.490
It's funny because I-I can tell when somebody
just can't get past it 'cause I'll be standin'

01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:15.490
in a group of people and one person will be
staring at like my ear the whole time --

01:00:15.490 --> 01:00:16.490
[laughter]

01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:17.490
goin' like this.

01:00:17.490 --> 01:00:18.490
[laughter]

01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:19.490
You can tell they think, "What is that? It's
on his ear, and it's on his neck and look

01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:20.490
at his scalp, it so --

01:00:20.490 --> 01:00:21.490
And they're just gone.

01:00:21.490 --> 01:00:22.490
And because of that, if-if I were to do that
to where it distracted from whatever I'm talking

01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:23.490
about, I'm a journalist and the story isn't
really about me, it's about whatever I'm talkin'

01:00:23.490 --> 01:00:24.490
about. So if they're payin' attention to me,
I'm not doin' my job right.

01:00:24.490 --> 01:00:25.490
[sound of phone ringing]

01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:26.490
So that's why I still wear it. But Hugh Perkins
swears up and down, "You should just go on

01:00:26.490 --> 01:00:27.490
TV --

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:28.490
[laughter]

01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:29.490
If I made as much money as you make, I would
just go on TV, and if I go bounced, I would

01:00:29.490 --> 01:00:29.492
call it.
