00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.969
&gt;&gt;female speaker: Just a quick introduction,
because many of you already know Van Jones

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:11.020
very well.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.670
So this is really short.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.120
Yale Law school graduate, former green jobs
adviser to the Obama White House.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.610
Co-founder of numerous progressive nonprofit
organizations.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.720
A husband and a father.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.290
And he is here today to talk about Rebuild
the Dream, that platform as outlined in his

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.400
new book.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.400
Here's the advertisement.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.520
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;female speaker: Anyway please welcome, Van

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.960
Jones Johnson.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:43.470
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;Van Jones: See you're kind a lopsided on

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.500
the side so I might favor this side a little
bit more, no offense.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.120
Well first of all I'm glad to be here.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.390
This is the first talk I've given on the book.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.330
I've been on TV, but it's been really short.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.660
So I'm gonna get a chance to talk for a little
bit longer.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.810
I also want to acknowledge that my colleagues
are here.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.890
The name of the book is Rebuild the Dream.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.830
But also the name of the organization is Rebuild
the Dream.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.620
And I want to just give a round of applause
to Natalie Foster, Jim Pugh, and Tyler who's

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.580
taking my picture right now.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.140
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;Van Jones: So you guys just, just turn around.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.490
So, since it was such a short introduction
which I kind of appreciate.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.950
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Van Jones: I was, that was good.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.120
For people who may have missed some episodes
in the Van Jones sitcom.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.979
I used to be a grass-roots outsider.

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.810
In the Bay Area.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.869
And I used to work with low income kids.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.300
Kids of color.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.080
My job was trying to get kids out of jail
and into jobs.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.409
And discovered that there was a big wave of
jobs coming in the green sector, in the clean

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:55.670
tech sector.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.770
And so I came up with this great slogan, 'Green
Jobs Not Jails'.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:00.770
You see.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.430
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Van Jones: Which I thought was genius.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.870
[Laughter]
Van Jones: And it wound up turning my life

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:14.950
completely upside down because it turns out
at that point in time if you went into Oakland

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.579
and you talked about green jobs they would
say, "I'm for that you mean jobs with money?"

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.889
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Van Jones: I'm like, no.

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:26.010
And so big education on that side.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.659
And then on the clean tech side, they were
for the green.

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:30.620
They didn't understand the connection between
the jails thing.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.730
So it wound up being a really tough thing
to sort through but we were able to achieve

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:36.870
something in Oakland.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.519
And it was called the Green jobs Corps.

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:48.319
When we got the Oakland city Council in 2007
to pass I guess a piece of local legislation

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.169
that led a lot of young kids in the community
get trained to put up solar panels.

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:56.250
And to weatherize homes.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.510
And so it was a huge light bulb moment for
a lot of people.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.980
And there was a woman named Nancy Pelosi who
at the time when we first started was just

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.559
getting underway as Speaker of the House.

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:14.810
And she took me and my friends to Washington
DC and we got this guy named George W. Bush,

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.980
who you may have heard of, to sign into law
something called the Green Jobs Act to make

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.129
that possible all across country.

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.599
And I wrote a book and it came out and it
was called 'The Green Collar Economy', also

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.269
on sale.

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.370
[Laughter]
And a guy named Barack Obama read it.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.439
And I wound up going to the White House to
help implement some of these programs.

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:38.709
It was the best six months of my life.

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.659
Followed by the worst two weeks of my life.

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:46.150
So, you can Google and find out about that
if you don't know about it.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.859
But I then took some time off.

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.389
I taught at Princeton for a year.

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:55.019
And I tried to kind of make sense of what
I had observed.

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:01.999
And having been a grass-roots outsider and
then having become a White House insider and

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:08.019
then being an outsider again I kind of had
this 360° view of some of the ways that people

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.400
who have ideas and values like mine were just
missing each other.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.109
And missing opportunities to make a bigger
difference and a better impact.

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.720
And so I wanted to write both a book to express
ideas but also to try and do something about

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.720
it.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.660
For me, and I again.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.700
Before I went to work for the Administration
I could sort of kind of have a more nonpartisan

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:29.700
pose.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.780
I kind of have to confess I'm on the left.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.350
This may shock some of you.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:41.280
[Laughter]
And from that perspective I remember 2008.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.820
And I remember November 2008.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.620
And I remember how that felt.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.680
My father had just passed away a few months
before.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:05:00.330
He, growing up poor in the segregated South
he had to fight just to be able to get any

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.330
job.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.400
He was finally able to get a job in a school
system after lawsuits.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.740
And then he was able to become a principal
of a small junior high school.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.740
And he had grown up in poverty.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:11.800
He got himself out of poverty.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.800
He put himself through college.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.300
He put his little brother through college.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.330
He put his cousins through college.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.330
He put me through college.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.340
He put my sister through college.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.680
He's kind of an original bootstrapper.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.430
And then he spent the rest of his life trying
to get other kids out of poverty.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:35.880
And his view at the end of his life was that
kids trying to get out of poverty and into

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.430
the middle class have to climb that ladder
themselves.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:45.330
You couldn't give them anything that would
stop a child from being poor.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.810
You can give them money.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.150
But if they're poor in their heart, or poor
in their mind, or poor in their spirit.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.000
It'll stop them from being broke but they'll
be broke again.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.140
To get out of poverty, you got a climb that
ladder yourself.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.530
I saw that myself in Oakland.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.940
But he also had a view, which is my view which
is that even though that child has a responsibility

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.530
to climb that ladder, him or herself.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.850
Grown folks have a responsibility to.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.560
Society has a responsibility to.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.390
To make sure that each child has a ladder
to climb.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.410
And that's my basic view.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.990
And that's a view in this book that yes I'm
all for individual responsibility.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.220
I'm a dad now.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.370
I'm a lot more for it now than I was when
I was younger.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.030
Anybody here got any children?

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:35.940
Okay so chores have a totally different meaning
when you're a parent.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.040
It's good for you.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.570
But when I was a kid I hated it.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.990
My only point is simply this.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.760
I think that the ladder's fallen over.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.680
The ladder's falling over.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.700
And if we're to be able to be a middle-class
country.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.781
If the next generation of people like my dad
are gonna be able to get out of poverty and

00:06:54.781 --> 00:06:55.781
into the middle class.

00:06:55.781 --> 00:06:59.380
And frankly if people who are in the middle
class right now are going to be saved from

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.250
falling over into poverty we're gonna have
to do a lot of things differently.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.700
And one of the things that were going to have
to do is to take a real assessment of what

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.370
happened to that movement for hope and change.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.370
What happened?

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:19.570
November 2008 people were crying in the streets.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.470
Hugging.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:27.050
Strangers in New York, I mean that's weird.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.410
It wasn't just a partisan thing.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.260
It wasn't just Democrats and like that.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.710
There were, Republicans, people on all political,
sides of the political spectrum and divide

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.200
felt moved.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.421
They thought something important had happened
or shifted in the country.

00:07:40.421 --> 00:07:43.410
And it seemed like something was possible
there.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:48.930
And yet within a year not only were we back
to the same kind of fighting, it felt worse.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:53.500
And I think that a lot of people went from
hope to heartbreak pretty fast.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.210
And I think a lot of us have been just kind
of confused since then.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:02.510
I think a lot of us looking at this election
coming forward have some confusion.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:05.980
I call it the post-hope Democrats.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.639
The post-hope Independents.

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:15.320
Probably like this President, probably not
as in love with him as people were in 2008.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.230
Probably like a lot of what the folks in the
Occupy Movement were saying back in the fall

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.100
but don't want to go get pepper sprayed.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.580
[Laughter]
So what are we supposed to do?

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:30.169
And the book is really aimed towards the post
hope Democrats and Progressives and Independents

00:08:30.169 --> 00:08:34.169
who are trying to figure out how we make sense
of what just happened and how we go forward.

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:40.529
My big insight that I try to share in the
book is I think the White House had the wrong

00:08:40.529 --> 00:08:42.490
view of the grassroots.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.650
I think they have the wrong theory of the
grassroots.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.939
I think the grassroots have the wrong theory
of the Presidency.

00:08:48.939 --> 00:08:55.930
And those two fundamental pieces of misunderstanding
created I think a lot of missed opportunities.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:59.939
So on the one hand, I think that there was
a tendency not for everybody at the national

00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:05.600
level but there certainly was a tendency for
some of the DC Democrats to think about the

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.940
grassroots progressive movements almost sort
of like something that can be pulled out of

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:15.220
the refrigerator, microwaved up and encouraged
to take action.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:19.980
But then put back the refrigerator without
a real sense that these are kind of living

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.509
movements often.

00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:26.769
And that the movements themselves really predated
Obama's run.

00:09:26.769 --> 00:09:32.540
In fact I make the claim in the book that
the movement for hope and change did not start

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.050
with Barack Obama.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:39.410
That Barack Obama was not the author or the
creator of the movement for hope and change.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:47.019
And that in fact you can see the precursors
all the way back in 2003 with the rise of

00:09:47.019 --> 00:09:50.910
the concern about the war in Iraq.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:58.069
And then you begin to see this sort of multiracial,
people power, technologically enabled movement

00:09:58.069 --> 00:10:01.730
starting to form that had higher hopes for
the country and wanted to change.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:03.170
All of that back in 2003.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.290
And you had groups like MoveOn.org that were
tapping into that.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.490
There was no one leader.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:13.080
There was no superstar celebrity savior that
was going to fix everything.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.220
In fact, that was the beauty of it.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.589
It was completely desegregated.

00:10:16.589 --> 00:10:22.050
And yet the New York Times called it the world's
second superpower, that movement, those millions

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.009
of people that were marching against the war.

00:10:24.009 --> 00:10:27.470
We've almost forgotten that history but that
was really the start of something important.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:30.529
That poured right over into 2004 with Howard
Dean.

00:10:30.529 --> 00:10:34.759
2005 we had Katrina which broke people's hearts
across the country.

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:42.350
By 2006 this movement was strong enough that
we elected Pelosi to be the Speaker of the

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:43.350
House.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:49.399
Now mind you, 2004 Carl Rose said the Republicans
are gonna run the house and run the Congress

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:51.759
for 20 or 30 years.

00:10:51.759 --> 00:10:53.649
This movement held them to 24 months.

00:10:53.649 --> 00:10:57.959
By the time you get from 2004 to 2006 there's
been a complete flip over.

00:10:57.959 --> 00:11:01.199
All of this was before Obama runs.

00:11:01.199 --> 00:11:04.279
Mainstream concern about the war, before Obama
ran.

00:11:04.279 --> 00:11:05.920
Al Gore came out.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.350
Mainstream concerns about climate and energy
before Obama ran.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.269
So there was a big movement happening in the
country.

00:11:12.269 --> 00:11:18.220
And that movement luckily met this man who
needed a movement and the movement frankly

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:23.130
needed someone to articulate the concerns
that were beginning to rise up in the people.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:28.259
And luckily somebody like Obama came along
because he took this movement to a place and

00:11:28.259 --> 00:11:31.790
a level that nobody I know was even thinking
was possible.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:32.939
And he made history.

00:11:32.939 --> 00:11:39.499
And when the man in the movement met, he just
created this global supernova.

00:11:39.499 --> 00:11:45.769
But I think sometimes we forget as inspiring
as Obama was at that time and often is now,

00:11:45.769 --> 00:11:48.269
we the people inspired him first.

00:11:48.269 --> 00:11:50.360
That's the most important thing I can say.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.240
It was people inspired him first.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.420
He said he had no plans to run for President
in 2004, 2005.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.369
And yet something was evoked in him.

00:11:58.369 --> 00:12:00.700
He said, this is the time.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.119
Which means if there is a hope gap in America.

00:12:04.119 --> 00:12:05.850
You can't just point at Obama.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.869
You can't just blog about Obama.

00:12:07.869 --> 00:12:12.529
Yeah we have this whole phenomenon now where
people it's like, I call it, 'if only the

00:12:12.529 --> 00:12:15.750
President would read my blog'.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:18.819
[Laughter]
'All would be well', right?

00:12:18.819 --> 00:12:23.839
You know it's this is kind of phenomenon for
at least the past two or three years most

00:12:23.839 --> 00:12:29.930
Progressives have been in this whole kind
of the debate with Obama in their brain forgetting

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:32.009
that we were doing stuff before Obama was
around.

00:12:32.009 --> 00:12:33.970
In fact we were doing a lot of great stuff.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:38.290
In fact it was because we were so active and
so passionate that we created the space for

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.999
someone like him to run and to win.

00:12:41.999 --> 00:12:46.310
So on the one hand I think that there might
have been a failure to understand the grass

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:48.730
roots by some of the folks in Washington DC.

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:52.480
But I think also a failure for us to understand
ourselves.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:59.879
And that became the strange projection with
regard to Obama.

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:05.579
We began to almost expect him to be a social
movement leader and not head of state.

00:13:05.579 --> 00:13:09.399
And I think that's a very fundamental misreading
of American history.

00:13:09.399 --> 00:13:14.040
Think about the most liberal President ever
right?

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.689
Not Nixon.

00:13:15.689 --> 00:13:18.650
[Laughter]
Though he did pass a lot of cool stuff that

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:20.329
I'm gonna talk about.

00:13:20.329 --> 00:13:21.679
But LBJ right?

00:13:21.679 --> 00:13:25.290
I think we all have to agree that LBJ is probably
the most liberal President.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:27.370
The war on poverty.

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:28.389
Not on the war fine.

00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:32.600
But the war on poverty, the other war.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.459
Civil rights stuff passed, he signed like
two big civil rights bills.

00:13:35.459 --> 00:13:39.410
Probably the high point of American liberalism.

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:44.600
Did LBJ lead the civil rights movement?

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.670
You guys must've taken some history classes
at some point.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:50.129
I know you're at Google.

00:13:50.129 --> 00:13:51.730
[Laughter]
No, not at all.

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:55.519
In fact there was a vigorous civil rights
movements in the streets, grassroots people.

00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:58.690
And there was a head of state, LBJ.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:02.790
LBJ was willing to listen to and respond favorably
to the movement.

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:04.550
But there had to be a mover to do the moving.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:08.639
And I think what happened to some of us was
Obama kind of looks like a social movement

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:09.639
leader.

00:14:09.639 --> 00:14:14.209
I mean people think he's cute.

00:14:14.209 --> 00:14:16.600
[Laughter]
Talks good.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.879
You know.

00:14:17.879 --> 00:14:20.620
And I think there was this thing well this
is MLK.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.649
And he's President, right?

00:14:23.649 --> 00:14:26.749
[Laughter]
How cool is that?

00:14:26.749 --> 00:14:30.699
And so then you kind of sit and you kinda
wait for him to do what a social movement

00:14:30.699 --> 00:14:31.699
leader would do.

00:14:31.699 --> 00:14:35.989
Which is to go and challenge the consensus
and disrupt everything and stick up for the

00:14:35.989 --> 00:14:36.989
little.

00:14:36.989 --> 00:14:40.519
But that's not what any US President has done.

00:14:40.519 --> 00:14:44.050
LBJ didn't lead the civil rights movement,
the people had to do that.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:50.290
FDR didn't lead the labor strikes that led
to the new deal we the people did that.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:57.329
Lincoln wasn't even an abolitionist that was
Frederick Douglass and John Brown and a bunch

00:14:57.329 --> 00:14:58.350
of other people.

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:01.670
Nixon, you thought I was just making a funny.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:10.700
But Nixon famously didn't lead the environmental
movement but he signed into law the EPA, Clean

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.079
Air Act, Clean Water Act right?

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:18.279
So you can have an arguably crappy President
but if you have a strong enough movement,

00:15:18.279 --> 00:15:21.239
the environmental movement you can actually
get a lot of good things done.

00:15:21.239 --> 00:15:28.180
So really we thought we had all we needed
when we got to Washington DC.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.420
We had the House with Nancy Pelosi.

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.199
Best speaker ever.

00:15:34.199 --> 00:15:38.879
We had 60 votes in the Senate and we had Barack
Obama as President we thought we had always

00:15:38.879 --> 00:15:39.879
needed.

00:15:39.879 --> 00:15:40.879
It turns out that's one third.

00:15:40.879 --> 00:15:42.670
That's a big take away.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:44.360
That's only a third of what you need.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:49.209
You also have to have popular movements, the
Tea Party was out there as a popular movement.

00:15:49.209 --> 00:15:52.529
They had a big impact even though they didn't
have governmental control.

00:15:52.529 --> 00:15:56.220
And you have to have big media coordination.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:01.699
Fox and the right wing bloggers played a huge
role in impacting policy even though they

00:16:01.699 --> 00:16:04.360
had none of those levers of power.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:10.790
I would argue as a Progressive that under
Bush we had the right movement for peace but

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:11.790
the wrong President.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:17.629
And as a Progressive I would say under Obama
we had the right President but the wrong movement,

00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:18.949
the Tea Party.

00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:22.769
So my hope is that going forward we can both
have the right President and the right movement.

00:16:22.769 --> 00:16:25.339
That's what I want to do, that's what the
book is about.

00:16:25.339 --> 00:16:28.850
Can you have the right President who's willing
to be moved by the people.

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:32.519
But can you also have a movement willing to
do the moving.

00:16:32.519 --> 00:16:34.589
And I think that it's possible.

00:16:34.589 --> 00:16:37.179
And I'll tell you why I think it's possible.

00:16:37.179 --> 00:16:41.350
I think there's a level of economic pain in
the country.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.339
That it is historic.

00:16:44.339 --> 00:16:48.399
You guys probably have people in your families,
cousins who you went to school with.

00:16:48.399 --> 00:16:53.920
They are not living the lives expected to
live.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:58.829
We have people who if you think about a lot
of the young people who are graduating now

00:16:58.829 --> 00:17:04.520
off a cliff into the worst economy since the
Great Depression.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.949
With massive debt and no jobs.

00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:13.870
That is a relatively new, and I mean people
who went to good schools, who are struggling.

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:17.270
That is a relatively new development in our
country.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:23.910
You think about the young veterans who are
coming home to very little hope.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:29.660
Many of them with a lot of psychological and
physical scars.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:35.340
When they were overseas they got a chance
to get a lot of support.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.910
They did some nation building over there.

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:41.990
You know Halliburton took too big of a cut
of it from my point of view but there they

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:43.390
are in another country.

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:50.620
We dump them off at the hometown airport now
with very little support.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:54.380
And they go from a military battleground with
a lot of support to an economic battleground

00:17:54.380 --> 00:18:01.250
with very little support and the suicides
are starting to be bigger than the casualties

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:04.370
of war.

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:06.670
Now my dad's generation already went through
that.

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:11.290
I think we should eliminate the term homeless
veteran from the English language.

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.070
That just shouldn't be happening.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:14.790
But it is happening.

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:15.910
You look at the homeowners.

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:21.570
I mean, we got a quarter of American homes
are underwater right now in terms of financially.

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:26.530
11 million homes people are spending more
money on the home then the home is worth because

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:29.640
the home got evaluated during that fantasy
bubble period.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.100
And so you have people.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:35.090
Think about this, this is the American dream
upside down and inside out.

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:38.510
It used to be if you were a poor person like
my dad.

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:40.170
How do you get out of poverty?

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:41.420
And into the middle class.

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:46.470
You go to college, you buy a home, you're
safe.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:51.400
That used to be the pathway out of poverty
into the middle class.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.500
Not anymore.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:57.530
Now that can be the trap door from the middle
class into poverty.

00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:01.210
Because you graduate with all this debt but
you don't have a job.

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:06.230
And the house you got may not be worth what
the bank told you it was worth.

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:09.880
And so you got to make a choice do you walk
away?

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.880
Do you keep bleeding yourself dry?

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.960
These are the kind of problems that are new
for the country.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.450
But when you have problems that big then big
solutions make sense.

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:28.880
And what I'm hoping to do with this rebuild
the dream idea is to begin to talk about solutions

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.990
at the scale of the problem.

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:35.530
There's only a couple of ways you get to have
a middle class in your country.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:39.140
And it's the middle class right now that's
coming under fire.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:43.120
It used to be if you do economic justice work,
you're just trying to get poor people into

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.120
poverty.

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.610
Now you got it try to get poor people out
of poverty and the middle class.

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:51.670
Now you got it try to keep the middle class
from falling over into poverty, that's a totally

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:52.990
different fight.

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:56.770
And it's not a fight for which we are prepared
as a country.

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:58.290
We haven't thought this all the way through.

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:03.100
But you can begin to propose solutions at
the scale of the problem if you recognize

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:06.850
there's only a couple ways you're gonna have
a middle class in your country.

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:12.880
You're either going to have high skilled manufacturing
jobs or you're going to have a big knowledge

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.880
economy.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:14.880
Right?

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.670
Well, we've already given away a lot of our
manufacturing jobs.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:23.490
So the only real option for people in a certain
age group, 'cause you can't go get a decent

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:27.650
job at the factor anymore is to try to go
to college.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.990
And try to become, get a job here with you
guys.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:33.100
That would be a great outcome.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:41.410
When I was growing, I was born in '68 for
us it was you know is your kid gonna go to

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:42.410
law school.

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:43.680
That was like the big deal.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:48.230
You guys, you probably eat lawyers for lunch
you're like, "What, lawyers?"

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:51.260
[Laughter]
Like it's not, not that big a deal.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.660
Come and work at Google that's the big deal.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.680
But how do you get here?

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:01.960
Somewhere along the way if it didn't happen
at your house, somebody had to have some program,

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:06.510
some computer summer camping thing, something
had to happen where people got a chance to

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:10.240
get connected to these jobs of the future.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:16.070
The problem is we're the only country in the
world for this next generation that's both

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:21.060
sending away the manufacturing jobs and making
it harder for people to get educated and go

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:25.050
to college because of the incredible high
cost of college and the big debt you gotta

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.690
take on.

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:28.960
That's not just bad for kids.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:32.010
It's bad for the country.

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:37.560
How do you maintain a middle class country
when you have a whole generation you're just

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:42.560
gonna throw overboard into the global marketplace
with very little help?

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:46.760
I don't know how America gets to compete in
the world that way.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:52.440
So it's not just "Oh you know why should I
care about somebody else's kid.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.820
When I went to college I paid off my own debt.

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.840
I had several hundred dollars in debt."

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.890
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Van Jones: "I paid it off myself."

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:06.360
I mean you hear this you know.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:13.120
And then it's kinda like this failure to understand
that were talking about $25,000 or $50,000

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.240
in debt just for a BS or BA.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:20.280
It costs more money now to go to UC Berkeley
than to go to Harvard.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.280
Why is that?

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:26.770
It's because we used to think that educating
a generation was good for the country it's

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:28.160
good for all of us.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:32.530
And now we think well maybe it's good for
you, you and your kids good luck.

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:39.180
It's a fast glide path down to a third rate
status for a country if you do that.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:47.120
So we think it's an opportunity to try to
become a nation of neighbors again.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:56.860
That American dream which is very easy to
make fun of if you already got it.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:02.930
If you're kinda on the cosmopolitan coast
of the country or some of those like blue

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:05.530
dot college towns it's very easy to pooh-pooh.

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:10.400
"That's just consumerism.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.400
Commercialism."

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:18.120
Maybe.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.120
That's not all it is.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.790
That's not the best part of it.

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:28.530
You know first thing Dr. King said about his
dream, he said "I have a dream.

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:33.120
It's a dream deeply rooted in the American
dream."

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.530
He wasn't talking about commercialism.

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:37.050
He wasn't talking about consumerism.

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:42.510
He was talking about living in a country where
everybody counts.

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:44.280
Where everybody's dreams matter.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:50.980
You shouldn't have to be born rich or of parents
with a famous last name to be able to work

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.260
hard and get somewhere.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:56.970
To be able to work hard and get somewhere
and give your kid something better than what

00:23:56.970 --> 00:24:00.270
you got.

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:04.600
People have come here from all around the
world, all around the world.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.980
Just to try to get a little piece of that
promise.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:11.320
And you know my family we're African-American
we didn't choose to come here but we chose

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.410
to stay because of the beauty of that promise.

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:18.120
And I don't think we should just let it be
thrown overboard because some folks don't

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:22.110
want to pay their taxes because we decided
that we can just all go on our individual

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:23.110
routes.

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:24.110
We are still one country.

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:25.480
And were gonna rise or fall together.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.830
We're gonna turn to each other or on each
other.

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:31.190
To each other or on each other.

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:35.460
And our hope is that we can find some common
ground now.

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:39.630
Because the pain, and will have this nonsense
for, till November.

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:42.810
It's just the way DC works.

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:47.180
But my hope is that, my hopes are pinned on
December.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:52.341
I think in December we have a chance to stand
together again look in the eyes of these young

00:24:52.341 --> 00:24:53.360
people.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.260
They're in red states and blue states.

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:58.180
They're liberals, they're conservatives.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:03.380
They're people of faith they're people of
no faith.

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:08.310
Some of them like a Game of Thrones, some
like Avatar you know you've met these people.

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:12.230
And they deserve a shot.

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:16.390
They deserve a shot.

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:23.710
And I would reject any idea now that says
you're a great patriot if you say "I just

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:27.840
believe in liberty, individual liberty, good
luck to you."

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:32.990
That there is no other value in America that's
worth defending than just individual economic

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:34.210
liberty.

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:36.440
For you.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:44.040
I believe in liberty and justice for all.

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:48.220
It's a different way of looking at the country.

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:56.070
Yes liberty, yes economic liberty, yes markets,
yes the opportunity to excel.

00:25:56.070 --> 00:26:00.540
But if all you have is that, you don't have
a country.

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:04.560
If that's all you've got, you don't have a
country.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:09.540
We learned in the last century I'll say in
conclusion that if you just care about justice

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:14.190
and you don't care about liberty you get totalitarianism.

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:15.530
That's the big lesson of the last century.

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:20.860
"In the name of justice, were gonna obliterate
people's economic freedom, their individual

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.790
liberty in the name of justice."

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:24.380
And what ya got, totalitarianism.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.530
That was the big lesson of the last century.

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:30.770
Justice without liberty is totalitarianism.

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:33.230
In this century we got to learn a different
lesson.

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:35.010
Keep that one and learn something more.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:39.620
If all you've got is individual economic liberty
and no justice.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.710
No concern about justice for all.

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:43.320
No concern about the community.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.180
No concern about the next generation.

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:48.420
No concern about your neighbor.

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:53.380
You wind up with a different kind of tyranny.

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:59.380
You wind up with the kind of not excess concentration
of political power, but an excess concentration

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:00.640
of economic power.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.730
And a lot of people left behind.

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:03.730
Good people.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:07.200
Who have dreams and whose hopes matter.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.640
So the book is an attempt to try to bring
us back together.

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:14.080
Throw a couple punches at some ideas I don't
like.

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:18.890
But also hopefully to be able to put that
ladder back up so we can keep the climb going

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:22.430
toward a country with liberty and justice
for all.

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:29.480
Thank you so much.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:33.010
[Applause]
Questions?

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:38.680
&gt;&gt;male#1: Hi, it's amazing to see you speak
here.

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:42.450
I'm wondering if you could tell me why you
think college is so expensive today compared

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:44.090
to in the past.

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:47.140
&gt;&gt;Van Jones: Well it's two things.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:51.210
The cost of education is not significantly
higher.

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:56.620
It's the price of education for the individual
young person.

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:59.430
There's something, something has gotten out
of alignment.

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:03.910
Part of it is that the private schools are
different conversation but I'm mainly concerned

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:05.330
about the public schools.

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:09.350
Schools like UC Berkeley that now cost more
than Harvard.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:14.380
It used to be the case that again we thought
that it was good for society to have all these

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:15.380
kids educated.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.810
And so therefore college was free.

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:20.410
Practically free, if you know anybody here
from New York?

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:26.210
Alright, so the CUNY system was free until,
into my lifetime right?

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:31.020
And then we decided that it didn't make a
lot of…

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:32.900
Since we wanted to have some economic.

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.950
What did you say Nina?

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:37.160
Okay sorry.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.990
And produced Nina.

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:44.110
See, Nina is here from one part of your team
who came from that system.

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:47.800
So a lot of good people can make that claim.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:51.120
But we backed away from the public commitment.

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.700
And there's really only two ways to pay for,
three ways to pay for school.

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:58.680
Debt, the individual family, and the taxpayer.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:03.740
And as the families aren't making a ton of
more money and as the taxpayer backs away

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:06.200
what happens is that debt gets bigger and
bigger.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.600
So now we've gotta take a look at this as
a country.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.900
And I don't think either the Right or the
Left have all the answers on this.

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:16.560
But I will tell you something that shocking.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.800
This month, what's the date of it Natalie.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:27.280
April 20, April 25 this month there's going
to be, were gonna hit this historic marker

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.610
of shame.

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:32.980
$1 trillion of student debt in the US economy.

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:33.990
$1 trillion.

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:41.990
You say well, it's a rich country maybe $1
trillion dumped on this next generation is

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.990
not that much money.

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:46.920
Let me give you a sense of how much money
that is.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:53.140
That's more than all of the credit card debt
in America combined.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:57.480
Take all, wander around taking everybody's
credit card out in the whole country pile

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.660
it up.

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:03.760
It's a smaller pile of debt then just what
we have right now in student debt.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.960
So that's bad.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.630
I don't want to get too technical.

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:12.580
[Laughter]
That's bad.

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:16.240
And so we've got to, there's something wrong.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.450
And I'm sure that there is plenty of blame
to go around.

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:22.560
But the thing about young people and I see
some people in here who look like you might

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.560
be young.

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:27.110
The thing about young people is when you have
a system like an education system that goes

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:28.110
haywire.

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:31.370
You know you think we'll get around to fixing
it in 10 years?

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:33.010
You know what happens in 10 years?

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:37.810
In 10 years those people who were 15 are 25.

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:39.310
People who were 10 are 20.

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:41.120
That's a long time.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:45.010
And so we can't, from my point of view this
should be a national emergency.

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:48.440
When you have young people graduating off
a cliff every spring.

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.680
Graduation needs to be happy.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.700
Remember that?

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:54.510
People would graduate and they would be happy?

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:59.270
Now they graduate, they look like you know
panic stricken because they got the debt and

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:00.270
no jobs.

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:03.530
And so one thing that we're doing.

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:04.850
We're getting broadcast everywhere.

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:07.640
So I want to make sure I mention this.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:11.630
One thing that we should do is make sure we
don't make the problem worse.

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:13.050
And we're about to.

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:22.920
July 1, remember this date July 1 if Congress
does nothing which they tend to do.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:28.730
The interest rate on the student loans is
gonna, the Stafford student loans is gonna

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:30.070
double.

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:35.500
From 3.4% to 6.8%.

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:37.310
Now think about this.

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:39.960
This is a big deal.

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.450
First of all what are Stafford student loans.

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:45.740
Those are that loans that the smart low income
kids get.

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:46.740
Right?

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:49.230
You're smart enough and supported enough to
get into college but you can't afford it.

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:52.160
You go get a Stafford subsidized student loan.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:57.610
The banks right now are getting their money
for about free.

00:31:57.610 --> 00:31:59.550
About free.

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:05.910
In the most needy promising young people in
America are gonna have to pay 6.8% to get

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:06.910
their money.

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:09.190
To go to college.

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:17.040
Just that delta will represent for the 8 million
of them that will be impacted $20 billion

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.040
sucked out of their pockets.

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.220
They don't have a nickel to spare, 20 billion.

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:24.830
That's the kind of stuff that Congress can
fix by July 1.

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:25.900
We're pushing them to do so.

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:30.930
If you care about that, rebuildthedream.com
is where we are gathering our forces to fight

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:31.930
back.

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:33.220
Thank you.

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:36.270
Hello
&gt;&gt; Raquel: Hi, you talked about the difference

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:39.840
between leadership in Presidential office
and the social movement.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.630
And I guess that it's really not a coincidence
that in many administrations their social

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:46.800
movement is in crisis and opposition to whoever
is in power.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:51.800
So, you know were lucky when, well from a
Progressive point of view you might say that

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:56.360
this was an opportunity here with Obama in
power and then kind of the first time since

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:59.630
he was in power for people to show that they
were passionate about something in the Occupy

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:00.630
Movement.

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:06.730
But it seemed to have fizzled so, first like
what's your take on how is it possible to

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:08.900
get those to both occur at the same time?

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:12.980
It seems like, they're always like it's like
a seesaw.

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:18.210
And why didn't it go anywhere you know or
maybe it still has a chance with the Occupy

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:19.210
Movement.

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:21.330
&gt;&gt;Van Jones: You know, that's a great question.

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:22.470
What's your name?

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:23.470
&gt;&gt;Raquel: Raquel.

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:25.130
&gt;&gt;Van Jones: Raquel great question.

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:28.020
This is a question that was driving me nuts
when I wrote the book.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:31.330
So the book attempts to try to answer this.

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:34.900
She mentioned occupy Wall Street.

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:37.230
You notice it wasn't called the Occupy Silicon
Valley.

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:40.270
I'm serious, you notice that.

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:44.730
They said, "This is a class warfare movement.

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:49.880
These young people are just jealous and they
hate rich people and they should be ashamed

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:50.880
of themselves."

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.860
You remember this?

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:57.820
There's this TV station that's named after
a sneaky furry animal that –

00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:59.970
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Van Jones: You may have heard of.

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:01.470
You know they talk like that.

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:06.430
[Laughter]
So, but it wasn't true.

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:11.760
I mean if they were just mad at people who
had money they'd been out here after you guys.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:12.760
Right?

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:16.300
It would have been Occupy Silicon Valley,
Occupy Google or something.

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:18.820
It wasn't, it was Occupy Wall Street.

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:19.820
Why?

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.690
Just to make sure to be clear about the values
of the people that were talking about let's

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:25.760
talk about what happened.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:29.300
People in America aren't mad at economic winners.

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:32.330
People in America admire economic winners.

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:35.200
People in America hate economic cheaters.

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.770
The cheaters.

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:38.399
There is a difference.

00:34:38.399 --> 00:34:39.780
See there's a difference.

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:44.380
There is a sense that you got some people
who have rigged the rules, rigged the game

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:45.890
for themselves.

00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:50.360
So no matter how hard some of us work, we
can't really succeed.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:54.630
And no matter how badly they perform, they
can't fail 'cause they're already too big

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:55.700
to fail.

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:59.180
And, but our dreams aren't and our neighborhoods
aren't and our schools aren't and our kids

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.180
aren't.

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:01.180
There's something wrong with that.

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:03.130
That just seems, it just makes people angry.

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:08.350
And so you saw finally this young generation
go out there and struggling folks but led

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:09.350
by young people.

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:13.070
And they went to the scene of the crime against
their future.

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:14.070
Wall Street.

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:17.260
They said "Listen, we didn't wreck this economy
you guys wrecked the economy.

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:20.610
But we don't have any jobs, and our parents
can't even get a break from you guys on their

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:24.150
mortgages and were getting charged up the
wazoo every time we use our ATMs and you guys

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:25.770
suck and we're mad."

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:26.770
Right?

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:35.170
Now this may not seem very sophisticated but
I tell you it totally had a positive impact,

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:39.000
not on necessarily Wall Street but on Washington
DC.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:45.760
Because before they started talking the only
discussion in DC was: "Government's the problem

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:51.680
the deficit's the problem how much are we
gonna cut out of the programs for ordinary

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:52.680
people?"

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.990
Now if you're a progressive Democrat like
myself you say "Wait a minute, if the, the

00:35:55.990 --> 00:36:00.790
deficit is the problem why are we cutting
stuff out of people's programs?"

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:05.480
We didn't, in case you guys missed a couple
episodes, we didn't go broke because we helped

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:06.660
Grandma too much.

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:07.660
Right?

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:13.270
It's like you know this is not true.

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:17.130
Clinton and Gore administration was over,
huge surplus and we just gave it all away

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:19.520
to Grandma on Medicare.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.730
[Laughter]
Greedy old Grandma.

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:23.290
Wait a minute.

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:26.610
That's not what happened.

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:27.940
Bush tax cuts and Bush wars.

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:30.160
You know God bless him but Bush tax cuts and
Bush wars.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.800
So if you want to fix the deficit you should
probably do something about Bush tax cuts

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.800
and Bush wars.

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.830
Why are you messing with Grandma?

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:36.830
Right?

00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:40.480
But you couldn't have that conversation in
DC.

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.040
These young people went out there.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:45.080
They started their protest.

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:49.990
And it proved that grassroots movements matter.

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:52.260
And it opened up a whole new conversation.

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:56.410
Now here's the problem.

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:59.320
Changing the conversation is not enough.

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.760
You got to change the conditions for people.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.020
Frankly, changing the composition of government
is not enough.

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:10.550
Ask me how I know, we changed it from Republican
to Democrat and then Democrat and the conditions

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:11.640
haven't changed.

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:14.561
So just changing the conversation or just
changing the composition of government is

00:37:14.561 --> 00:37:15.561
not enough.

00:37:15.561 --> 00:37:16.920
You gotta be able to change the conditions.

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:23.990
And in order to do that, you got at some point
be able to move from anger to answers.

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:27.550
And that's what we were not able to get done
in the fall.

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:29.720
How do we go from confrontation?

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:35.050
How do you balance that with some inspiration
and aspiration.

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:36.050
Clarity about your goals.

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:39.980
How you take away that protest energy and
turn it into electoral power so you can change

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:41.120
the conditions?

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.390
That is the big question.

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:49.820
I wrote a book about the answers which is
freely available to each and all.

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:54.390
[Laughter]
Rebuild the Dream is the name of the book.

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:59.310
But the basic point I want to make about the,
what I think is possible going forward is

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:01.420
simply this.

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:08.950
I think if you reelect this President he gets
a chance to do, have another run at it.

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:10.900
But we also are different now.

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:14.820
The vote and hope strategy is over.

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:19.250
We're not gonna vote and hope.

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:21.770
Some of the young Occupiers say they don't
want to, they don't believe in the electoral

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:23.630
system at all anymore because it's so disappointed
with Obama.

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:28.000
They said they just don't believe in voting
at all.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.670
And I tell them listen man, you know, if anybody
has a right to be disappointed or frustrated

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:33.560
with the Obama moment.

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:38.530
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Van Jones: I might qualify.

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:43.140
So, but I know something about elections.

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:48.320
You cannot get everything you want in that
voting booth.

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:53.640
But if you don't vote, you can lose everything
you've got in the voting booth.

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:56.470
You can't get everything you want out of voting,
but if you don't vote you can lose everything

00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:57.880
you got out of not voting.

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.630
So it's messy.

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:01.380
So you gotta vote and do something else.

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:05.120
So my view is we have a shot.

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:09.850
Even though the occupations are over and Occupy
Wall Street itself isn't getting as much attention.

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:14.590
The themes they made popular are just as popular.

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:17.410
The concern about this economic inequality.

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:21.850
The concern that the people who've done well
in America don't want to do well by America

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:24.500
and pay their taxes without complaining about
it.

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.651
The idea that you have this generation that's
falling behind.

00:39:26.651 --> 00:39:30.980
The idea that Wall Street got bailed out and
Main Street got left out.

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:34.780
That is just as salient today as it was when
people were out there in those tents.

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:41.020
I think it's up to us to figure out then how
we get Fannie and Freddie for instance.

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:46.040
Who have half of America's mortgages just
cut the principal.

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:48.400
Just reevaluate the houses fair.

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.730
Let America's families pay the mortgages back
fair.

00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:55.120
You know what that would be, that would be
$90 billion back in the pockets of ordinary

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:56.120
people.

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.240
And 1 million jobs created, you know why.

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:02.410
Because if you got a house that's underwater,
you're not gonna go buy a sofa.

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:04.530
You're not remodeling.

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:08.820
You're not creating local economic activity,
all your money is being sucked out to Fannie

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.930
and Freddie and the Wall Street banks.

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:12.340
Stop it.

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:13.840
Stop it.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.470
You reevaluate those houses fair.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:19.080
And give American families a chance to get
back on their feet so we can start.

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:20.470
That's 1 million jobs and $90 billion saved.

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:22.680
You know what we can do that, tomorrow.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.850
One guy named Ed DiMarco, he works for President
Obama.

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:29.070
He could do it [snap] tomorrow.

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:32.610
But we don't have a movement that's making
that demand salient yet.

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:36.600
So now if you take, if you don't have President
Obama there.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.130
Maybe you have somebody else that I would
like less.

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:43.820
The movement you've got to have to get that
victory might have to be 10 times bigger.

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:48.600
So it's pretty smart to try to win in November
I try and tell the younger people.

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:50.850
Try to win in November politically.

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:56.450
So we can win December, January, February,
March, April, economically.

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:57.450
It is possible.

00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:00.290
It's not the normal thing, but these are not
normal times.

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:04.390
&gt;&gt;Raquel: Thank You
&gt;&gt;Van Jones: OK

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:11.040
&gt;&gt;male#2: So just along those same lines in
terms of an effort to try and align the aspirations

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:16.960
of a movement and the willingness of federal
political leaders.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.130
What's the role of the private sector in that
effort?

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:27.110
And then if you have specific ideas on what
our company can do to try and work towards

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:29.820
that as an organization and not just as individuals.

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.440
&gt;&gt;Van Jones: Sure.

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:33.100
Well I mean.

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:36.950
First of all the private sector is gonna be
the main engine in the recovery.

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:38.600
And it's trying to be.

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:42.810
The problem that we have right now is that
the best people, the best new companies, the

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:50.320
best new ideas right now I think have a big
problem.

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:53.470
I'm a Green guy, clean energy person.

00:41:53.470 --> 00:42:00.630
I know how many great ideas there are out
there on the clean and green side of our economy.

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:04.770
I know how many entrepreneurs are out there,
how many products are out there.

00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:10.290
And I also know that both political parties
McCain and Obama said when they were running

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:14.010
in 2008 "Climate change is real."

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:16.850
Both of them said that.

00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:22.180
Both of them said that we've got to have a
cap and trade system to deal with it.

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:23.780
Both of them said that.

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:25.520
And both of them said it would create more
jobs.

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.119
And they were both right.

00:42:27.119 --> 00:42:34.200
I mean if you don't believe me, go on YouTube
and find the clip where McCain turns to Obama

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:37.380
and says "Climate change is a hoax."

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:39.890
You'll never find it.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:43.720
Find the ad where McCain says global warming
is a hoax.

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:45.790
Or cap and trade socialism.

00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:49.190
Or clean energy will destroy American jobs.

00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:50.780
Doesn't happen, why?

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:53.940
Because at that moment both parties had faced
reality.

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:57.590
And they were actually competing with each
other, who was going to have the best energy

00:42:57.590 --> 00:43:00.850
solutions for America.

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:05.980
So we failed to take advantage of that bipartisan
moment.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:09.990
I think frankly, the other side has a lot
of responsibility for that.

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:15.670
But what did that mean for us, talk about
our private sector here in the US.

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:18.730
It meant that the $80 billion the President
put on the table in the stimulus package for

00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:25.320
green solutions was then swamped by what our
friends in China did.

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:29.300
We had a moment to put those dollars on the
table with the stimulus bill and then pass

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:30.300
cap and trade.

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:33.750
How you get the private sector unleashed on
some these problems, creating more jobs and

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:34.800
better technologies?

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.530
You get the public investments right?

00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:40.790
Did that, $80 billion stimulus package for
green and clean solutions.

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:44.860
At that time the biggest investment in clean
energy in the history of the world.

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:49.010
At that point Obama was not the black President,
he was the green President.

00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:50.010
Okay.

00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:52.950
That's where he was in February of 2009.

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:57.170
Big public investment, but that's still puny,
$70 billion $80 billion still puny compared

00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:58.270
to what the private sector could do.

00:43:58.270 --> 00:44:00.369
So you got to get the public investment right.

00:44:00.369 --> 00:44:03.320
And then you get the public rules right, cap
and trade.

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:05.650
To get the private sector to come in and play.

00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:08.970
That was, and we were set up to do it.

00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:16.850
And then it just became politically better
to call it socialism and say that Obama is

00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:20.930
trying to take over the energy system and
score political points in the short term and

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:22.460
we dropped the ball.

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:23.721
So then what do you have?

00:44:23.721 --> 00:44:27.740
You have American new energy companies and
entrepreneurs out there, standing out there

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:31.180
now naked with no help from the, a change
of rules.

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:39.290
And our good friends in China say "Phew, we
almost got outflanked by the Americans."

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:43.980
And they went triple down on clean energy.

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:50.680
And are now wiping out American solar companies
by flooding the world with cheap solar.

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:52.520
Short term that's great, cheap solar for me
and you.

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:56.680
Long term that means you lose all your American
industries.

00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:01.190
You go from importing dirty energy from the
Middle East to importing clean energy technology

00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:03.920
from Asia and you skip all the jobs in the
middle.

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:05.820
And who's responsible for that?

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:07.500
These people call themselves patriots.

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:11.150
Here's my problem with it, now listen.

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:16.050
You take a company like a Solyndra and everybody
uses that to just beat the crap out of the

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:17.050
President.

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:25.619
But when they don't talk about is that Solyndra
benefited from a George W. Bush loan program.

00:45:25.619 --> 00:45:28.119
That loan program was George Bush's loan program.

00:45:28.119 --> 00:45:33.020
$2.4 billion loan program that had a 99% success
rate except for Solyndra.

00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:35.070
Why'd it get knocked down?

00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:40.840
Because that $2.4 million loan program was
going up against a $30 billion grant program

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:42.580
in China to knock it out.

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:47.420
But rather than us talking about how we protect
the next round of innovation in our own country,

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:50.400
we're doing food fight politics in Washington
DC.

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:54.770
Now my view is that we're, I'm all for the
private sector.

00:45:54.770 --> 00:46:01.930
But the private sector has to work according
to rules and the rules right now are nutty.

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:05.540
The rules right now don't let innovators innovate.

00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:07.890
Especially in our energy sector and that's
got to change.

00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:12.320
No you talk about a company like Google and
some of the things that Google can do as a

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:13.460
company.

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:21.080
You know, it's very hard I think for you guys
to understand how important you have become

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:22.100
to the world.

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:27.010
I mean you guys look like normal people, I
was expecting you know wings and.

00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:30.950
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Van Jones: [Laughing] That you guys would

00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:32.340
come gliding in.

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:33.430
Come out of some chrysalis.

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:36.609
I didn't know what to expect.

00:46:36.609 --> 00:46:40.330
So, you know I honestly haven't thought all
the way, I was just happy to meet you guys.

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:46.040
I haven't thought all the way through what's
possible.

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:50.050
But I'll tell you where the needs are.

00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:56.250
First of all, I don't know if we're gonna
be able to create enough jobs in the short

00:46:56.250 --> 00:47:01.700
term to take a real bite out of the pain for
this next generation.

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:07.280
And I think we've got, we need your help to
be honest about this.

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:12.970
If the big fact on the world stage is: Asian
middle classes are gonna to get bigger which

00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:15.859
is a good thing, especially if they can grow
green, that's a great thing.

00:47:15.859 --> 00:47:20.030
Pull people out of poverty and do it in a
green way, that will be a huge achievement

00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:21.420
for this new century.

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:25.820
But if Asian middle classes are gonna get
bigger which is a good thing you may have

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:30.740
Western middle classes getting smaller at
the same time while that gets sorted out.

00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:40.410
If that's gonna be an undeniable fact, then
that gap, what we do with that gap, determines

00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:42.840
what kind of country we are.

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:48.650
Now that gap will be filled out by something
that we would now call an informal set of

00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:49.650
economies.

00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:54.940
There are only two kinds though.

00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:57.650
There's negative informal economies.

00:47:57.650 --> 00:48:05.110
That's also known as drugs, gangs, stealing
stuff right?

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:09.000
And then there's positive informal economies.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.520
And I think there's an opportunity here for
the tech sector to really partner with people

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:14.630
on this.

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:18.760
We could become a nation of neighbors.

00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:20.240
And share.

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:27.640
This sounds crazy to you.

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.070
But there's this new movement that's happening.

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:30.240
It's a shareable economy.

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:35.300
It's this thing called shareable.net, I'm
fascinated with it.

00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:39.260
Maybe we can get our income level up, up,
up, up, up.

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:41.910
Maybe some income levels might even come down
a little bit.

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:44.410
But what if our quality of life went up?

00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:47.000
Because we used our social capital to help
each other.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.130
Is there some way for us to use our social
capital to begin to help each other?

00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:55.370
Now the thing about this is we already have
a bunch of stuff in America.

00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:57.570
You know, were still the richest country in
the world.

00:48:57.570 --> 00:48:58.850
Richest country in the history of the world.

00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:00.500
Got a lot of stuff here.

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:05.980
But we tend to hoard it.

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:13.360
I want to figure out some way for us to unlock
the wealth we already have and use it better.

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:17.859
You guys will have much smarter answers about
that than I do, but I have some insight.

00:49:17.859 --> 00:49:19.110
Because I'm a dad.

00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:21.630
And I know about sharing.

00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:26.720
'Cause I have two boys who never want to share.

00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:33.609
Here's the cool thing about sharing and then
we'll probably be out of time.

00:49:33.609 --> 00:49:38.710
Sharing can either be really cool or really
uncool.

00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:41.720
If you have to share.

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:44.930
If you are forced to share.

00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:47.790
Sharing sucks.

00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:50.770
But if you get to share, sharing is great.

00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:53.640
It's called making friends right?

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:54.720
So think about that.

00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:59.770
If you, is there some way to make sharing
easy and cool.

00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:01.070
Right?

00:50:01.070 --> 00:50:07.599
If you're sharing, if you are forced to share
because the system screwed you that sucks

00:50:07.599 --> 00:50:08.599
right?

00:50:08.599 --> 00:50:12.700
"The system screwed me, now I'm on my mom's
couch and I have to share this couch with

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:14.990
my cousin who's also screwed.

00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:18.320
This sucks right?"

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:21.880
If you're sharing because the system screwed
you, but if you're sharing because you're

00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:25.990
saying screw the system that's cool.

00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:27.119
See.

00:50:27.119 --> 00:50:32.290
If you are opting out of some of the rampant
materialism and that kind of thing and you're

00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:35.930
opting into a community of people who just
share their tools and share their cars.

00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:40.380
And you got zipcar, you got Kiva, you got
Kickstarter.

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:44.160
There's something beginning to happen and
technology's supporting this idea that we

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:46.880
could maybe do better with the stuff that
we've got.

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:49.510
Instead of always trying to get more and more
of it.

00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:54.530
That won't in America displace the whole economy.

00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:56.300
It probably shouldn't.

00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:58.630
But it could sure make life a lot better.

00:50:58.630 --> 00:51:01.210
And I would love to figure out some way to
be in communication and conversation with

00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:03.220
people here.

00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:06.220
The stuff you guys do on a regular basis if
it could be.

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:11.150
If we could help people not fall so far.

00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:13.570
Just don't let people fall so far, can we
help each other?

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:16.300
Can we hang onto each other?

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:17.300
So we don't fall so far.

00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:20.200
When people fall real far they get mad they
get angry.

00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:24.940
They do things that are scary.

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:30.510
People start to fall and somebody catches
them that's a good thing.

00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:33.180
&gt;&gt;male#3: You got another time for one more
question.

00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:34.340
&gt;&gt;Van Jones: Yeah, one more question.

00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:35.340
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Thanks.

00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:39.730
A couple weeks ago Obama was in Oklahoma and
it was about the Excel pipeline.

00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:47.400
And I'm curious to know what your senses on
juggling environmental and economic development

00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:49.000
issues in the country.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:57.750
So looking at that and also the shell and
the fracking in Pennsylvania.

00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:58.750
And that debate.

00:51:58.750 --> 00:51:59.750
Thanks.

00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:06.350
&gt;&gt;Van Jones: A couple things.

00:52:06.350 --> 00:52:21.700
The problem with fracking is that it's short
term smart, long-term, mid-term unknowable

00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:25.130
and possibly not smart and long-term stupid.

00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:26.420
Okay?

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:29.230
And we don't do that well with those kind
of problems right.

00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:32.310
Short term, it's pretty smart why?

00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:38.500
Because it sure would be great to be able
to get methane out of the ground if it's there.

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:43.890
And use it to keep energy prices down.

00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:53.210
Mid-term kinda questionable because nice to
have cheap energy bad to have kids with cancer

00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:56.270
because the water is poisoned right?

00:52:56.270 --> 00:53:00.940
So can, they won't tell us what's in there.

00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:03.700
Which makes me assume it's not a sugar pop.

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:05.369
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Van Jones: Right.

00:53:05.369 --> 00:53:09.280
If there like we're doing this fracking with
Kool-Aid right.

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:12.970
[Laughing]
&gt;&gt;Van Jones: They'd probably let us know.

00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:17.670
But since they won't let us know it makes
me think that maybe it's not Kool-Aid.

00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:19.700
Maybe it's something I don't want in my kid's
water.

00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:22.609
So mid-term it's unknowable but kinda scary.

00:53:22.609 --> 00:53:27.220
You know fracking, forcing this chemical down
and breaking up the rocks and getting more

00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:28.670
methane and now they call it natural gas.

00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:30.920
You know natural gas comes from chili.

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:35.191
[Laughing]
&gt;&gt;Van Jones: That's methane, that's what it

00:53:35.191 --> 00:53:37.250
is.

00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:42.800
So, but long-term.

00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:46.250
You got my joke, thank you.

00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:48.870
It's not the country.

00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:51.990
We'll talk later.

00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:54.660
But long-term it's kind of foolish.

00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:58.730
Because it's still carbon based.

00:53:58.730 --> 00:54:07.000
It's still taking dead stuff, burning it,
and putting it up into the atmosphere that

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.200
already has too much carbon.

00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:14.990
And so, and it's doing so in a way that's
disrupting the short term markets for wind

00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:16.590
and big solar.

00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:21.150
So now again we're just about to make the
leap into big wind projects and big solar

00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:25.160
products which will the price is just about
work out for that.

00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:28.000
And then you got something that's gonna be
there for a long time that won't cook the

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.110
planet.

00:54:29.110 --> 00:54:35.180
And then "Eh never mind you know it's like
like going from one bad drug to an even cheaper

00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:36.180
easier to get drug."

00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:37.960
It's just bad, it's bad.

00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:40.520
So I'm not a big fan of that stuff.

00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:44.040
I think it's taking us away from the right
direction.

00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:47.510
And then the whole Keystone pipeline thing.

00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:53.190
Has really, it just makes me sad.

00:54:53.190 --> 00:55:04.220
Because the food fight politics in Washington
DC is increasingly pushing us to do things

00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:07.599
that just are actually bad for the country.

00:55:07.599 --> 00:55:10.790
People say we should have the pipeline because
it will create jobs.

00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:15.160
That's just not true.

00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:18.730
We will create some jobs if we do this thing.

00:55:18.730 --> 00:55:24.560
It's about 1000 temporary jobs.

00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:28.330
Now if you count where like every piece of
metal that's used.

00:55:28.330 --> 00:55:31.410
If you count like you can do anything with
job numbers.

00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:36.060
You can 1 million people worked on this you
know because like somebody was at the toll

00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:37.490
booth when the thing drove by.

00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:40.040
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Van Jones: That counts as a job I mean you

00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:41.040
can count.

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:44.900
But if you actually look at the actual number
of jobs here you're talking about 1000, 2000

00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:45.900
temporary jobs.

00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:49.650
Those are important jobs for people who have
them and we want them because a lot of jobs,

00:55:49.650 --> 00:55:50.859
whoever built this was a temporary job.

00:55:50.859 --> 00:55:53.119
So I'm not saying the temporary jobs are bad.

00:55:53.119 --> 00:55:55.670
But I'm just saying let's just be clear were
talking about a small handful of temporary

00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:56.940
jobs.

00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:59.869
And frankly if we're gonna do temporary jobs
we might as well do that building wind turbines

00:55:59.869 --> 00:56:00.970
and other stuff.

00:56:00.970 --> 00:56:06.040
Because if the only thing you can imagine
for your temporary jobs is to like, with a

00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:10.400
toxic pipeline through America then I challenge
your imaginational capacities.

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:13.500
You probably can't work here if you think
that way.

00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:18.810
So I think that's bad.

00:56:18.810 --> 00:56:20.820
The permanent jobs are about 100 permanent
jobs.

00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:22.160
But what people don't get.

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:31.030
They say this is gonna be good for gas prices
in America.

00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:34.660
I mean this is gas.

00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:38.640
This is first of all the dirtiest most toxic
worst stuff on the planet Earth.

00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:42.290
We are now scraping the bottom of the barrel
for the last of the poly carbons.

00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:43.530
That's what tar sands are.

00:56:43.530 --> 00:56:45.230
The last of the poly carbons.

00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:48.930
The most toxic worst fuel.

00:56:48.930 --> 00:56:54.740
And then it comes all the way through America
down that pipeline across our aquifers over

00:56:54.740 --> 00:57:01.280
our farmland to be refined in Louisiana and
shipped to China.

00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:05.230
It's not even for the US to use it.

00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:07.980
It's gonna be refined and sent to China.

00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:10.060
So now I don't want the people in China using
the stuff.

00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:16.890
But here's what I know about tar sand oil.

00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:18.390
It's the most corrosive.

00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:20.060
It's the most corrosive.

00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:23.090
They've already had so many spills up in Canada
already.

00:57:23.090 --> 00:57:24.820
It's the most corrosive.

00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:29.790
Now you saw the oil spill we had down there
with the BP oil spill.

00:57:29.790 --> 00:57:31.810
Imagine if that is American farmland.

00:57:31.810 --> 00:57:32.970
And aquifers.

00:57:32.970 --> 00:57:38.280
You could knock out huge--
I mean why?

00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:41.910
For a couple of thousand temporary jobs and
frankly rather they be building wind turbines.

00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:47.510
And for a couple hundred permanent jobs and
so China can have dirty oil process here.

00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:49.250
That doesn't make sense.

00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:53.630
Listen, if we were having a normal conversation
with normal people on the either side of the

00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:55.970
political divide it wouldn't even be on the
table.

00:57:55.970 --> 00:57:59.520
They say it's just not worth the risk.

00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.720
But it's good politics.

00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:05.589
Its good point scoring.

00:58:05.589 --> 00:58:09.750
It's good to make your bigger point about
the President being out of touch even if it

00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:11.330
hurts Americans.

00:58:11.330 --> 00:58:16.500
So you know I think that people who are in
your situation.

00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:18.530
I mean you guys.

00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:22.530
I mean I'm sure you got jobs or something
here.

00:58:22.530 --> 00:58:26.850
But stuff you gotta do.

00:58:26.850 --> 00:58:28.820
But what we have seen.

00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:31.890
And this is in closing now.

00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:40.070
We've seen young people who don't know a lot
about politics and new people in technology

00:58:40.070 --> 00:58:46.430
fields who don't know a lot about politics
have tremendous impact on the political system.

00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:51.000
We have a young woman on our staff named Molly
Katchpole.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.000
Young woman, 22 years old.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:59.359
She happened to before she got on our staff
happened to find out that Bank of America

00:58:59.359 --> 00:59:04.369
was gonna start charging her five extra bucks
a month to use her debit card.

00:59:04.369 --> 00:59:09.820
She said, "I don't have five extra bucks a
month to give the biggest bank that we've

00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:10.820
got".

00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:18.109
It's not fair so she put up a petition on
change.org which went viral and Bank of America

00:59:18.109 --> 00:59:25.820
faced with either having to deal with Molly
Katchpole and her viral petition or have billions

00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:29.099
of dollars for its own said "Never mind.

00:59:29.099 --> 00:59:32.849
Never mind."

00:59:32.849 --> 00:59:33.849
Same young woman.

00:59:33.849 --> 00:59:38.130
Verizon said they were gonna charge five extra
bucks to use her phone.

00:59:38.130 --> 00:59:40.460
She said, "I don't have five extra bucks."

00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:43.020
She put up a petition up on change.org.

00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:50.820
They found out that Molly put the petition
up.

00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:55.290
And within 48 hours they said "Never mind,
we quit.

00:59:55.290 --> 00:59:58.550
Why should we have billions of dollars?

00:59:58.550 --> 01:00:00.350
Leave us alone."

01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:05.880
We'll now she's on our staff and she's helping
to run this student loan campaign.

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:11.010
If I were Sallie Mae, I'd just surrender now.

01:00:11.010 --> 01:00:14.250
But she wrote from her heart about it.

01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:17.780
And she used the tools that were available
and she made a huge difference.

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:21.963
And I think about somebody like Molly and
you probably, some you guys probably even

01:00:21.963 --> 01:00:25.720
know her since you're all about the same age.

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:28.880
Don't underestimate what you can get done.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:29.880
You know.

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:31.720
You are so privileged.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:35.210
And I don't mean that like you know if you
guys went to college like privilege is bad

01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:36.740
like "I'm sorry.

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:39.240
I'm sorry I'm privileged."

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:41.119
No it's like.

01:00:41.119 --> 01:00:44.070
Most people like the word privileged is a
good thing.

01:00:44.070 --> 01:00:49.390
You've been gifted you been blessed you have
the opportunity to think about problems in

01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:51.300
completely different ways.

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:56.020
To see trends way before anybody else and
start pre-adapting.

01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:57.570
And to help people.

01:00:57.570 --> 01:01:00.960
And everybody who uses your product is out
there right now.

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:05.060
I'll tell you what they're googling if they're
googling anything.

01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:09.510
Debt forgiveness.

01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:12.580
Clinical depression.

01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:15.410
Education.

01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:21.070
Home mortgage.

01:01:21.070 --> 01:01:23.310
Look at what people are looking up right now.

01:01:23.310 --> 01:01:26.990
People are hurting.

01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:33.840
I would love for us to live in a country where,
we're as good to our grandkids as our grandparents

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:34.859
were to us.

01:01:34.859 --> 01:01:40.240
You look at what our grandparents went through
to give us this country.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:45.800
They didn't say "Every kid for themselves",
they said "We're gonna create the best country

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.430
in the world for our kids to prosper in."

01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:52.339
And they weren't a lot older than us when
they made those decisions.

01:01:52.339 --> 01:01:55.510
And so now we are in that same situation.

01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:59.740
And we have a responsibility to give our kids
as good a country as we got and I appreciate

01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:00.740
your time and attention.

01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:01.740
Thank you very much.

01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:01.741
[Applause]
