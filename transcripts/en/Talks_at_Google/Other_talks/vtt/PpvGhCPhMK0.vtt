00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:04.540
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Today it is my pleasure
to introduce our speaker to you.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:11.360
Born right here in the Bay Area, Michael Ellsberg
is a renowned expert in entrepreneurialism,

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.860
career development, and education, whose work
has been featured in the New York Times, the

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.410
Wall Street Journal, CNN, and Good Morning
America to name just a few.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.090
Michael is author of the incredibly popular
"The Power of Eye Contact: Your Secret for

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.539
Success in Business, Love, and Life," a book
that provides simple tools for improving relationships

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.020
throughout all areas of your life.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.710
He also writes the Need to Know blog for Forbes
dot com, which is full of even more valuable

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.379
tips for personal success.

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.269
His new book, "The Education of Millionaires:
It's Not What You Think and It's Not Too Late,"

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.910
will be released on September 29th, but we
were lucky to get a few pre-release copies

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.190
over here if you're interested.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.760
While the workplace today often places heavy
importance on a person's alma mater, for his

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.749
new book, Michael spent the past year and
a half interviewing some of the world’s

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:06.010
most successful individuals who did not obtain
a college degree.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.960
Instead, these individuals were self-taught
and learned the skills they needed for success

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.790
through their experiences in the real world.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.690
In his talk today, Get Rich and Invest In
Your Own Human Capital, Michael will explain

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.510
how to make the most fast-acting, direct,
high-impact investments in your own human

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.890
capital and career success based on what he
learned from these masters of self-education

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.600
and from his own personal experience.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.230
And with that, please join me in welcoming
Michael Ellsberg.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.760
[applause]

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:51.550
&gt;&gt;Michael Ellsberg: So, what I plan to do
in the next 45 minutes is to radically alter

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.310
the way you all think about the concept of
investing.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:03.940
Now, you are all highly accomplished engineers,
managers, executives, professionals in Silicon

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.850
Valley, the heart of innovation in America.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.470
You all work for a legendary company in the
history of capitalism.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.070
So, for me to stand up here and say that in
45 minutes I might alter the way you think

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.300
about a concept as fundamental as investing
is a tall order, but that is what I'm gonna

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.260
aim for today.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.510
So, I'm not here to talk about stocks, bonds,
real estate, 401Ks.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.569
You've all heard those kinds of lectures before.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.870
You all know the rap about that kind of investing.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.850
The type of investing I wanna talk about is
one you've probably heard less about 'cause

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.870
it's discussed a lot less.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.890
But I think it's very, very important.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.819
And that is investing in your own human capital.

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.230
And the title of the talk today is "Get Rich
Investing In Your Own Human Capital."

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.280
If you haven't guessed already, its slightly
tongue in cheek title, I wanted to poke a

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.030
bit of fun at all those books about the other
kind of investing.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.069
Get rich investing in real estate!

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:08.810
But in all seriousness, I do think that investing
in your human capital can potentially much

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.370
more lucrative than all those other kinds
of more traditional investments.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.560
It's possibly much more safe, which is something
that we're all interested in now given the

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.480
craziness of the markets in the last several
years.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.330
And it also can be possibly more rewarding
and more fitting in with the fabric of your

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.010
career and your sense of meaning.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.069
So, that's what we're gonna be talking about.

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.280
And I'm gonna start with a pretty uncontroversial
statement.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.020
We'll get to a bit on controversy later.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.170
But let's start with uncontroversy.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:47.320
Most economists, most career development professionals,
will agree that spending your time, spending

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.570
your money, investing in human capital is
a really good investment.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.470
So, you're not gonna find many people who
disagree with that statement.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:02.870
But almost all the discussion around that
concept focuses on investments in formal credentials

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.239
and formal higher education.

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.300
And those can be very powerful investments.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.599
And I know that Google, as a corporate culture,
highly values educational attainment, educational

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.500
investments in its employees and its recruits.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.650
And you've all probably in this room made
a lot of those investments.

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.130
And those can be very powerful, very worthwhile
investments.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.160
But almost all the discussion centers around
those.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.760
And there's a whole world of investments that
I've been exploring over the last several

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.910
years talking to very successful people who
didn't go that path, who boot-strapped their

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.150
human development, their human capital.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.870
And so, if you think of formal education,
it might be thought of as almost a venture

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:52.800
capital model of investing in your human capital
in that there's often a lot of financing involved,

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.810
a lot of effort in money up-front; sixteen,
eighteen years to get through elementary school,

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.880
undergraduate, more years for graduate education.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.870
And then, after all this investment, all this
potentially financing in debt, then you get

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.570
some benefit afterwards.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:17.010
And what I want to talk to you about today
is styles investing in yourself that can just

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.910
be put into action right now with not a lot
of expenditure of money.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.100
You don't have to leave this wonderful campus
where there's all this free food available

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.680
that I've already been enjoying.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.180
And you don't have to take time off from your
career.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.470
You don't have to go into student debt.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.490
It's available to you right now.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:40.380
So, these might be thought of as more of a
boot-strapping model of human capital development.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.450
Or, lean.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:46.680
Lean is a very hot word now in the investing,
entrepreneurial world.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.400
Or, you could think of it as a guerilla-style
of investing.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.220
So, that's what we're gonna be talking about
for the next 40 minutes or so.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.460
Now, before I dive in, who am I?

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.800
Why the heck do I have any credibility at
all to be talking with you about this today?

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.780
So, I'm a professional author, book author.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.620
This is my second book that's been published.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.961
There's a few before that weren't published.

00:06:09.961 --> 00:06:12.330
I won't talk about those.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.080
But this one is coming out in a couple weeks
from Penguin.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.580
It's called "The Education of Millionaires."

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.090
And you're actually some of the first people
to hear about it or even see it.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.110
I just saw this book like two days ago for
the first time.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:34.070
And what I did is I got very interested in
this question of how can you develop your

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.600
talents outside of the normal ways that we
hear about developing your talents, going

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.600
back to school.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:45.310
And to explore that question, I decided to
interview some of the most successful people

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.419
on the planet who don't have college degrees.

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:50.270
And I went around the country.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:55.860
I talked to about 35 millionaires, self-made
millionaires, entrepreneurs, who didn't finish

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.300
college, about four billionaires.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.430
Some of them are pretty famous.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.860
Dustin Moskovitz, co-founder of Facebook.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.400
I talked to Sean Parker, founding president,
who by the way, if you've seen the movie "The

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.930
Social Network," I think he is totally different
than Justin Timberlake.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:18.810
They did him a disservice in that movie after
hanging out with him for a couple hours and

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:21.820
picking his brain about this stuff.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.420
I interviewed Matt Mullenweg, who is the founder
of Wordpress.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.620
I run my own personal blog on that.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.680
Probably a lot of you are familiar with Wordpress.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.180
Outside of the tech world, I spoke John Paul
DeJoria.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.850
He's the co-founder of John Paul Mitchell
Systems.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.930
He was homeless at two points in his life
early.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:47.150
Lived out of a car with his son and was at
one point collecting soda bottles to make

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.669
sure that he had enough money to feed his
son.

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:54.270
And he went in business with a hairdresser
called Paul Mitchell.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:59.259
They invested, I think, like 700 dollars in
creating their first formula.

00:07:59.259 --> 00:08:04.000
They went salon to salon, built it into a
multi-billion dollar business.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.680
And he's been on the Forbes 400 forever now.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:16.080
And another person on that list I interviewed
was Phillip Ruffin, who started out building

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.080
a hamburger ch--.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.330
Not even a chain, a stand.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.380
A hamburger stand in college.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.410
He eventually decided to drop out to build
that.

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:25.550
Built it up quite successfully.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.240
Just kept building businesses.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:31.780
Now he owns Treasure Island Resort and Casino
on Las Vegas strip.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.919
So, a bunch of famous people.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:39.960
I also just interviewed people you probably
haven't heard of, but who are just doing really,

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.320
really interesting cutting edge things.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:47.550
The inspiration for my book actually was my
wife, Jenna, who's here in the front with

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:48.550
my mother.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.850
And Jenna is a successful entrepreneur.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:57.690
She has a thriving weight loss coaching practice
and wellness center in Manhattan.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.529
And she dropped out of college in Australia.

00:08:59.529 --> 00:09:03.730
So, she was the inspiration for me getting
excited about this topic.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:07.251
For the record, I did graduate--Brown class
of '99.

00:09:07.251 --> 00:09:12.680
So, I'm not an example of the people that
I write about.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.640
[pause]

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:23.320
So, we're gonna get into some really specific
takeaways that I wanna give you in this next

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.370
40-odd minutes.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:29.850
You're gonna come away with some really specific
things you can implement for your career success.

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:35.720
Before we dive into that, I wanna get a kind
of more Google Earth view of the issue and

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:40.430
then we'll zoom in more specifically towards
the end of the talk.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.660
And we'll also have plenty of time for questions.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.990
So, the Google Earth view.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:51.130
In my write-up for this talk, which you may
have seen or not, I'm not sure, I start out

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:55.860
with a comparison about two different types
of people.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.450
Take a billionaire executive.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:04.190
You probably know of a few here in this company,
or just someone who is at the top of their

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:05.980
game in the corporate world.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:11.200
And then you take someone who's earning minimum
wage, which is around seven fifty an hour

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.160
these days.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.550
These two people don't have very much in common
professionally.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.700
They pretty much couldn't be more opposite
professionally.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.800
Except, they have one really, really important
thing in common.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:29.070
Can anyone guess what that one thing they
have in common is?

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.830
They both have 24 hours in the day.

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:33.390
I don't care how much money you have.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:36.240
There are ways you can use money to leverage
your time.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.330
But I don't care how much money you have,
even if you owned all the stock of Google

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:46.340
on IPO day and cash it out that day, all that
money could not buy you a 25th hour of the

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:47.340
day.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.560
So, we're all working with 24 hours.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:55.269
So then the interesting question becomes,
what distinguishes these two kinds of workers

00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:57.670
who have the same amount of time to work with?

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:00.410
Why is one earning so much more than the other?

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:01.930
And it's quite dramatic.

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:07.260
The average executive compensation for CEO
of a major corporation is around ten million

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:13.680
dollars in both salary and stock options and
benefits.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.800
I know that Larry and Sergey were at one point
taking one dollar, so they're not the best

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:18.800
example here.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.140
But your average CEO of a large corporation
is around ten million dollars.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:29.790
They don't get paid hourly, but if you break
that down say, 80 hour weeks, 50 weeks a year,

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:33.279
you're looking at somewhere around three thousand
dollars an hour the market is valuating their

00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:40.080
time versus someone whose minimum wage pouring
coffee kinda thing is getting valued at seven

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.640
fifty.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.330
And they're both putting in roughly the same
amount of time each day.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.310
So, what is the difference between them?

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:51.810
Well, economists, when they look at who's
earning what and why people are earning more,

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:58.100
they have this concept called "productivity,"
the productivity of someone's work.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.459
And productivity is a pretty simple function.

00:12:00.459 --> 00:12:05.570
It's just a function of labor, the time you're
putting in, mixed with capital.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.720
So, you take the same amount of labor.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.300
You mix it with more capital.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.490
And you get more productivity, more compensation.

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:19.320
So you think of someone who's earning minimum
wage, their capital is a mop and very basic

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.620
level of training to clean what they're cleaning.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.149
It's a low amount of capital.

00:12:24.149 --> 00:12:29.920
They're mixing their time and they get low
results financial-wise, whereas very highly

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:35.890
compensated executive is putting in roughly
the same hours, but they are mixing those

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:40.080
hours with an enormous amount of capital for
each minute they're putting in.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.920
It's being mixed with an enormous amount of
capital.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.630
They have, of course, a human capital.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:51.160
They have their training, formal education,
and their informal training, all their experience

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.160
on the job.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:57.060
They have a rolodex, which is a form of human
capital, or it might be called social capital.

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.740
Then they have all the capital of the company.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:05.779
They have executive teams that can put their
vision, execute on their vision.

00:13:05.779 --> 00:13:08.089
They have all the financial resources accompanied.

00:13:08.089 --> 00:13:14.000
So each minute is being mixed with a lot of
capital and that's why more value gets created

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.529
out of each minute.

00:13:15.529 --> 00:13:18.240
So, what I wanna do today--.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:23.620
You all have a lot of human capital already
in your expertise, your education, of course

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:31.070
your experience, but I wanna give some really
guerilla-style boot-strapped ways you can

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:36.160
start adding even more to your human capital
so that each minute of your time, each hour

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:41.269
you spend here is mixed with more capital
and therefore, more valuable.

00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:46.660
And that your career will develop that much
faster, your compensation, your earnings will

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.270
develop that much faster.

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:55.800
So, I'm gonna talk about four main types of
lean, or boot-strapped, human capital that

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.860
we can all add to.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:01.080
And the first one I'm gonna talk about is
sales.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.810
And that might sound a little bit crazy.

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:06.329
I'll bet a lot of you in the audience are
engineers.

00:14:06.329 --> 00:14:12.899
You may not ever in your career get in a position
of formally selling something in the context

00:14:12.899 --> 00:14:13.899
of the business.

00:14:13.899 --> 00:14:16.769
Maybe some of you do, but my guess is probably
most of you don't.

00:14:16.769 --> 00:14:22.089
So, why would I be standing up here telling
you that learning about sales is a valuable

00:14:22.089 --> 00:14:24.290
way to add to your human capital?

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:30.420
Well, even if you're not selling a product
for money, all of us, all of you, are working

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.600
in a knowledge economy, a knowledge society
here.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:40.080
And we'd like in a certain sense, you're getting
paid for your creativity and your ideas.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:45.889
And we'd like to think that the best ideas
win, but we know in office politics, in just

00:14:45.889 --> 00:14:49.800
the way things work, that isn't always the
case.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:56.480
The ideas that win are the best ideas multiplied
by the best persuasion, the best influence,

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.019
the best sales, if you will, of those ideas.

00:14:59.019 --> 00:15:04.589
So, formal education, which we've all had,
I've had, teaches us about the ideas.

00:15:04.589 --> 00:15:10.779
It's a pure idea environment where there's
this very high premium on coming up with brilliant

00:15:10.779 --> 00:15:11.779
ideas.

00:15:11.779 --> 00:15:16.490
But the thing that you don't tend to learn
in a formal environment is how to pitch and

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:21.660
sell and persuade those ideas to real world
teams in the real world.

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:27.850
And someone I interviewed for this book actually
once went through the entire course catalog

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:35.740
of Harvard's, Stanford, and Wharton Business
Schools and was looking for courses in sales.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:40.550
And there was not a single course in sales
in the entire MBA catalogs of those three

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:44.850
most prestigious business MBA programs.

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:48.820
There was one course in sales force management,
which is very different from sales.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:53.370
Now, if you talk to the people I interviewed
in my book, these self-made millionaires,

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:58.160
self-made billionaires, successful entrepreneurs,
if you talk to them about what was behind

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:05.980
their success, they are almost all very, very
passionate about the concept of sales, both

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:10.890
traditional sales in the sense of selling
things for money, but just as much, sales

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:16.139
in a sense of persuasion and a sense of getting
people excited about your ideas.

00:16:16.139 --> 00:16:18.230
And you all are very idealistic.

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:20.470
You wanna make a big impact on this company.

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:24.660
You want a big impact in the world of tech,
Silicon Valley.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:30.150
And what I'm putting forth to you is that
your impact, the leverage point here is actually

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:34.829
gonna be your persuasiveness in pitching your
ideas.

00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:38.880
Now one resistance that a lot of people have
and I used to have around the idea of learning

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:42.620
sales or persuasion is that it sounds kinda
manipulative.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.380
The word sales has a bad ring to it.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.230
The word persuasion has a manipulative ring
to it.

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:56.540
And the truth is, there is a lot of really
manipulative, cheesy, low-grade sales out

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:57.540
there.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:00.190
And that's where we get that impression is
that it exists.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:05.720
And it has that connotation of an encyclopedia
salesman or a used car salesman.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.569
Well, I'm not here to tell you to learn that
kind of sales.

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:10.569
I promise.

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:11.649
That's not what I'm talking about.

00:17:11.649 --> 00:17:17.839
Hopefully, well, Wikipedia is putting encyclopedia
salesmen out of business.

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:21.369
Maybe the Google's Car project will put used
car salesmen out of business.

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:22.369
We don't know.

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:23.859
You can just order your car off the internet.

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:29.379
If you guys did a good job on your algorithms,
you could put insurance salesmen out of business,

00:17:29.379 --> 00:17:34.679
auto insurance salesmen, if these cars aren't
crashing into each other.

00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:37.100
So, I'm looking forward to that.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.210
No more of that kind of sales.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:42.029
The kind I'm talking about is high integrity
sales.

00:17:42.029 --> 00:17:44.629
And it does exist.

00:17:44.629 --> 00:17:49.809
If you're somehow resisting the concept of
learning to be more persuasive because you

00:17:49.809 --> 00:17:54.639
think it's cheesy or manipulative, that is
actually, I think, an excuse that is holding

00:17:54.639 --> 00:17:57.320
you back from furthering your career.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:02.649
'Cause there are ways to learn this stuff
that are high integrity, that are befitting

00:18:02.649 --> 00:18:05.889
of your careers of the Google brand.

00:18:05.889 --> 00:18:12.970
So, a very specific recommendation I wanna
make is a book called "SPIN Selling," S-P-I-N

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:15.610
Selling, by Neil Rackham.

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:18.620
And this is, in my opinion, the best book
on sales ever written.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:27.239
As far as I know, the only book that is based
on actual observation of in-field sales sessions.

00:18:27.239 --> 00:18:28.309
And they were doing--.

00:18:28.309 --> 00:18:35.100
They had a budget of a million dollars and
I think dozens and dozens of researchers and

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:40.429
they went all around the country observing
in-field sales sessions of high-ticket priced

00:18:40.429 --> 00:18:44.489
items that were considered major sales by
the buyer.

00:18:44.489 --> 00:18:50.529
And what they found, fortunately for all of
us, is that that kind of slickster manipulation

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:52.979
doesn't actually work.

00:18:52.979 --> 00:18:58.159
That's not what is ultimately what is persuasive
in pitching your ideas to your teams, to people

00:18:58.159 --> 00:18:59.759
who are gonna buy your ideas.

00:18:59.759 --> 00:19:07.850
And what works is two things: asking the right
questions and listening very closely to the

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:08.850
answers.

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:13.799
And so that, actually, the more the person
you're trying to persuade talks, the more

00:19:13.799 --> 00:19:17.379
likely you are to persuade them of your vision.

00:19:17.379 --> 00:19:23.009
And so, sales becomes not a cheesy pitch,
but actually a human conversation where you're

00:19:23.009 --> 00:19:30.309
listening to your team, you're listening to
what you want, and you're finding ways to

00:19:30.309 --> 00:19:34.639
demonstrate that you really get what these
people care about and that tailoring what

00:19:34.639 --> 00:19:37.960
your pitching, what you're selling, quote,
unquote, to their needs.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:42.899
And when people get that feeling that you're
tailoring that way, they listen and they're

00:19:42.899 --> 00:19:43.899
persuaded.

00:19:43.899 --> 00:19:47.080
And your ideas start diffusing through your
team and through the company.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:56.590
So, there is one example of a very highly
leveraged way to invest in your human capital.

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:57.759
I just mentioned one book.

00:19:57.759 --> 00:20:00.649
I think it's probably 30 bucks at most.

00:20:00.649 --> 00:20:02.369
You can read it in a few evenings.

00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:05.230
You don't have to leave Google.

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:10.889
You don't have to go into a master graduate
program and take on student debt to start

00:20:10.889 --> 00:20:14.139
making these kind of investments in your career.

00:20:14.139 --> 00:20:18.820
You can do them in this boot-strapped, on
the fly way.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:27.210
So, the second type of human capital I wanna
talk about today, the second type of investment

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:30.750
is attention, investing in the quality of
your attention.

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:37.019
Now, this is a huge issue in the tech world,
in all of us who are involved with computers.

00:20:37.019 --> 00:20:42.649
We know Facebook, Twitter, now Google+ is
just one more thing to keep us distracted

00:20:42.649 --> 00:20:44.049
in the day.

00:20:44.049 --> 00:20:47.460
Everyone, email, IM, text message, everyone
is struggling with this.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:53.669
I don't know anyone who's not struggling with
issues of attention during their workday.

00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:59.889
And if you take two people who have roughly
the same educational credentials, roughly

00:20:59.889 --> 00:21:05.659
the same training, technical knowledge, same
background, and one of them has a fantastic

00:21:05.659 --> 00:21:08.259
attention and just gets to work.

00:21:08.259 --> 00:21:09.559
They've got a clear mind.

00:21:09.559 --> 00:21:10.559
They're focused.

00:21:10.559 --> 00:21:15.059
They can get right to work and not be distracted
and they're going throughout the day with

00:21:15.059 --> 00:21:18.830
a great level of energy and focus and attention.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:25.169
And you compare that to your typical corporate
worker, who is drinking three or four cups

00:21:25.169 --> 00:21:30.179
of coffee just to get awake in the morning,
get started, gets distracted by all these

00:21:30.179 --> 00:21:34.809
social media things, doesn't really know where
they're going in a workday, maybe has to have

00:21:34.809 --> 00:21:39.249
another huge jolt of caffeine in the afternoon
just to get through the day.

00:21:39.249 --> 00:21:45.430
You compare those two people and the first
person I mentioned is gonna win in a career

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.009
ten times out of ten.

00:21:47.009 --> 00:21:53.289
So, that's again another type of investing
in your human capital that is highly leveraged

00:21:53.289 --> 00:21:55.580
in that it doesn't take a lot of money.

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:56.840
This is stuff you can learn about.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:02.309
You can focus on your time and your money
and your attention and you can change yourself.

00:22:02.309 --> 00:22:04.099
And we can all change ourselves this way.

00:22:04.099 --> 00:22:06.769
And it has a huge impact on our careers.

00:22:06.769 --> 00:22:16.450
And if you think again about productivity
is being labor times capital, you all have

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:20.239
a certain amount of labor that you're bringing
to the table here.

00:22:20.239 --> 00:22:21.779
Eight, ten, twelve hours a day.

00:22:21.779 --> 00:22:25.720
I don't know quite how much all of you are
spending each day, but it's a fixed amount.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:30.580
So, we're talking about changing things in
ourselves that makes each of those minutes

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:33.330
you bring to the table more productive.

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:37.539
And that ends up in bringing much, much higher
career results.

00:22:37.539 --> 00:22:40.950
So, there's a lot of ways to focus on attention.

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:43.840
I just saw a wonderful sign there about meditation.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.860
So, there's techniques you can learn.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:49.909
I mean, there's a sign right there you can
check out about a meditation group.

00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:56.390
There's a specific kind of investing in your
attention span and the quality of your attention

00:22:56.390 --> 00:23:00.429
that I wanna talk about that's very near and
dear to my heart.

00:23:00.429 --> 00:23:04.299
I had a pretty serious problem with this issue
in my 20s.

00:23:04.299 --> 00:23:06.279
I'm 34.

00:23:06.279 --> 00:23:11.909
Four years ago, on the eve of my 30th birthday,
I was suicidal.

00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:17.369
And I had struggled throughout my 20s with
Bipolar II, which a pretty serious mental

00:23:17.369 --> 00:23:20.989
illness that involves really strong mood swings.

00:23:20.989 --> 00:23:23.480
So, my attention was really either--.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.480
It was one of two things.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:29.049
It was either super jacked up, where I was
like this and could barely contain myself,

00:23:29.049 --> 00:23:34.919
which was surprisingly actually hard to be
productive 'cause my mind was just so jacked

00:23:34.919 --> 00:23:35.919
up.

00:23:35.919 --> 00:23:41.639
Or, I was in bed and I could barely get out
of bed and pull the covers off of me.

00:23:41.639 --> 00:23:45.450
So, neither of those was very conducive to
good work.

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:51.549
And if you think this stuff about attention
is airy-fairy and New Age, it really isn't.

00:23:51.549 --> 00:23:55.489
It has a very direct correlation with your
earnings.

00:23:55.489 --> 00:24:02.779
So, in the darkest moments of that period,
I was working as a freelancer and I earned

00:24:02.779 --> 00:24:07.059
in my lowest year eight thousand dollars in
one year.

00:24:07.059 --> 00:24:12.460
'Cause I just wasn't able to bring quality
attention to my hours in a day.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.710
And it showed in my pocketbook.

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:16.879
And the way I got out of this, it was a long
story.

00:24:16.879 --> 00:24:19.389
I actually wrote an article about it on Forbes.

00:24:19.389 --> 00:24:24.149
If you Google my name and Bipolar II, I have
a very detailed article about it.

00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:27.940
But essentially, I got of this through better
nutritional and eating habits.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:31.960
And I went through a whole gauntlet of doctors,
psychiatrists.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.389
I was on all kinds of drugs.

00:24:34.389 --> 00:24:42.519
And eventually, I came to a doctor who knew
that there were nutritional components to

00:24:42.519 --> 00:24:44.450
attention and to mood.

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:48.899
And he told, specifically with these mood
swings, that sugar was a really big issue

00:24:48.899 --> 00:24:50.120
and blood sugars issues.

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:57.929
And he told me to get off caffeine, alcohol,
and refined sugar, which I was all of them

00:24:57.929 --> 00:25:00.159
consuming in rather high quantities.

00:25:00.159 --> 00:25:03.149
I resisted this advice for quite a while.

00:25:03.149 --> 00:25:07.729
I basically told him to F-off and that I didn't
wanna live without those things.

00:25:07.729 --> 00:25:10.509
Eventually, it got really bad, as I mentioned.

00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:12.940
I was literally on the verge of suicide.

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:14.880
I was like, "I need to make a change."

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.529
I implemented what this doctor told me.

00:25:17.529 --> 00:25:21.549
And within two weeks, my life had radically
transformed.

00:25:21.549 --> 00:25:27.229
And so, you don't need to be in the brinks
of that level of darkness to have this effective.

00:25:27.229 --> 00:25:32.299
Google is on the forefront, literally the
forefront, and I'm not saying this to flatter

00:25:32.299 --> 00:25:33.299
you.

00:25:33.299 --> 00:25:41.289
It's actually true, of paying attention to
people, worker's nutrition as a component

00:25:41.289 --> 00:25:44.869
of their value in the company and the attention
they're bringing.

00:25:44.869 --> 00:25:49.110
And Google has gotten deservedly a ton of
great press about the healthy food that's

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:52.409
available to you in the cafe and all of that.

00:25:52.409 --> 00:25:53.639
But we can always do better.

00:25:53.639 --> 00:25:54.960
We can always learn more.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:26:00.379
There's a very high leverage way to increase
the value of each minute you're bringing to

00:26:00.379 --> 00:26:03.929
your day, is to get this part of your life
handled.

00:26:03.929 --> 00:26:07.389
To get your nutrition, your health, really
handled.

00:26:07.389 --> 00:26:13.840
And probably all of us could tick off a list
of the basic things you need to do to be healthy.

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:19.440
We all know it's basically eat more fresh
fruits and vegetables, cut down on refined

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:24.241
sugars, cut down on alcohol consumption and
caffeine consumption, get more exercise, get

00:26:24.241 --> 00:26:25.241
better sleep.

00:26:25.241 --> 00:26:26.489
All of us know these things.

00:26:26.489 --> 00:26:28.070
But really the difference--.

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:31.970
The difference is whether we implement them
or not.

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:38.359
So, again, this is in some ways one of the
fallacies of formal training and education

00:26:38.359 --> 00:26:43.229
is that it's really about like what you know
and do you know things intellectually and

00:26:43.229 --> 00:26:47.099
can you tick them off on a test.

00:26:47.099 --> 00:26:50.219
But what you know is only part of the issue.

00:26:50.219 --> 00:26:52.090
Really, it's what you put into practice.

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:56.379
And that is actually in some ways the more
challenging part.

00:26:56.379 --> 00:26:58.929
And you really have to train at these things.

00:26:58.929 --> 00:27:01.490
I think there's an analogy to training like
an athlete.

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:08.779
You actually have to train your taste buds,
your senses to respond to healthier eating.

00:27:08.779 --> 00:27:10.980
And it is a training process.

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:13.710
I have another specific recommendation.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:19.729
A book that was very helpful to me in this
process of transforming my own life is called

00:27:19.729 --> 00:27:23.979
"The UltraMind Solution" by Dr. Mark Hyman.

00:27:23.979 --> 00:27:25.859
He's an MD.

00:27:25.859 --> 00:27:32.539
It's a very straight-forward, scientifically-based
book on the nutritional aspects of mental

00:27:32.539 --> 00:27:34.779
performance and mental health.

00:27:34.779 --> 00:27:39.700
A lot of books on alternative nutrition have
woo-woo New Age concepts.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:43.359
This is a very straight ahead book written
by an MD.

00:27:43.359 --> 00:27:44.989
I highly recommend it.

00:27:44.989 --> 00:27:48.580
And again, this is the kind of thing maybe
that book is 15, 20 bucks.

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:49.580
You can read it.

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:54.929
You don't have to leave your job to bring
this kind of education into your life.

00:27:54.929 --> 00:28:01.349
And that's really what I've been talking about
in this book is that I think institutions

00:28:01.349 --> 00:28:06.489
of higher learning have inappropriately monopolized
the word "education."

00:28:06.489 --> 00:28:11.500
They all undoubtedly provide very good education
and important and valuable education.

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:17.179
But that's all we think of when we think of
the word "education" is going to school, taking

00:28:17.179 --> 00:28:20.019
classes, getting a degree, getting advanced
degrees.

00:28:20.019 --> 00:28:25.669
And we don't think about all the other ways
that we can educate ourselves for, oftentimes,

00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:30.259
much less expensively and often much more
relevant to what you're doing right now in

00:28:30.259 --> 00:28:31.259
your careers.

00:28:31.259 --> 00:28:35.320
There's just all these ways available to us
and that's really what I interviewed all these

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:40.989
people about was just the more street smart
ways that they went about educating themselves.

00:28:40.989 --> 00:28:45.980
'Cause this group that I talked to is really
probably the group in the world that has the

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:52.909
most success with the least formal credentials
for that success; the most success with the

00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:54.399
least formal credentials.

00:28:54.399 --> 00:29:00.109
And so, all of their success came in these
more street smart, practical intelligence

00:29:00.109 --> 00:29:01.109
type ways.

00:29:01.109 --> 00:29:03.960
So, we've talked about sales, persuasion.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:07.429
We've talked about your attention.

00:29:07.429 --> 00:29:14.330
The third one I wanna talk about might ruffle
some feathers, but I think it's really important.

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:18.029
And that is what I call "overcoming emotional
liabilities."

00:29:18.029 --> 00:29:20.549
Overcoming emotional liabilities.

00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:24.039
And I have a very technical definition of
emotional liabilities.

00:29:24.039 --> 00:29:27.450
You might want to take notes on this technical
definition.

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:33.070
I define an emotional liability as any emotional
issue you haven't dealt with that could come

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:35.690
back and bite you in the ass.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:36.879
And we all have these.

00:29:36.879 --> 00:29:37.879
All of us.

00:29:37.879 --> 00:29:38.960
I definitely, definitely have these.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.899
All of us in this room have emotional liabilities.

00:29:41.899 --> 00:29:45.019
Usually, we're not aware of them.

00:29:45.019 --> 00:29:48.340
Another way you might think of them is blind
spots.

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.351
So, everyone else is aware of them.

00:29:51.351 --> 00:29:55.129
I assure you your team is aware of your emotional
liabilities.

00:29:55.129 --> 00:29:56.820
You're the only one who isn't.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:58.220
Same thing goes for me.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:00.539
One that I struggle with a lot--.

00:30:00.539 --> 00:30:05.809
So, there's several kinds that I'll talk about
that are very common in the work world.

00:30:05.809 --> 00:30:10.839
One that I personally struggle with a lot
is defensiveness, which is essentially being

00:30:10.839 --> 00:30:15.070
totally unopen to any kind of feedback around
your improvement.

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:16.429
My wife is laughing.

00:30:16.429 --> 00:30:19.879
She is the one who is the mirror to my blind
spots.

00:30:19.879 --> 00:30:27.950
So, she'll say something very reasonable,
very normal, wifely criticism of a husband.

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:32.249
And I'll get extremely defensive and I'll
deny it and I'll start criticizing her right

00:30:32.249 --> 00:30:33.249
back.

00:30:33.249 --> 00:30:34.249
And she's very patient.

00:30:34.249 --> 00:30:38.549
I'm very lucky to have such a patient wife,
who will patiently and compassionately say,

00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:41.249
"Honey, you're doing that defensiveness thing
again."

00:30:41.249 --> 00:30:44.589
And she's gotta actually point it out to me
'cause when you're in the grips of it, you're

00:30:44.589 --> 00:30:46.009
actually not aware of it.

00:30:46.009 --> 00:30:50.279
You're possessed by this and you don't see
it, but everyone else sees it.

00:30:50.279 --> 00:30:52.029
So, defensiveness.

00:30:52.029 --> 00:30:57.669
Another one that's extremely common in the
work world is what I "victim mentality."

00:30:57.669 --> 00:31:00.100
And I have a whole chapter about that in here.

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:04.459
I call it the "entrepreneurial mindset versus
the employee mindset."

00:31:04.459 --> 00:31:05.459
And these are mindsets.

00:31:05.459 --> 00:31:08.589
This is not about whether you're actually
an entrepreneur or an employee.

00:31:08.589 --> 00:31:10.309
It's about mindset.

00:31:10.309 --> 00:31:14.299
And one thing that I noticed about all the
people I interviewed is they seem to have

00:31:14.299 --> 00:31:15.469
a mindset in common.

00:31:15.469 --> 00:31:18.320
And I call that mindset the "entrepreneurial
mindset."

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:22.359
And it's very relevant if you're an employee
also.

00:31:22.359 --> 00:31:29.979
The essence of that mindset is a complete
absence of any kind of victim mentality and

00:31:29.979 --> 00:31:34.839
a sense that these people are creating the
results around them.

00:31:34.839 --> 00:31:36.609
They are the cause of the results.

00:31:36.609 --> 00:31:40.919
So, if you're in a victim mentality, everyone
else is the cause of your results, of your

00:31:40.919 --> 00:31:42.009
bad results.

00:31:42.009 --> 00:31:46.029
So, if your team doesn't do well on a project,
"Well, it's my team members.

00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:50.989
They didn't get that piece of programming,
that piece of code in on time."

00:31:50.989 --> 00:31:53.249
All those kinds of excuses that we always
hear.

00:31:53.249 --> 00:31:59.529
So, you're not really the cause of the bad
things in your life, but the problem with

00:31:59.529 --> 00:32:01.589
that is that it throws the baby out with the
bath water.

00:32:01.589 --> 00:32:07.639
If you're adopting this mentality where everything
else is the cause, then you're not really

00:32:07.639 --> 00:32:09.709
the cause of good things in your life, either.

00:32:09.709 --> 00:32:13.989
And so, the people I interviewed have a very
different mindset around this.

00:32:13.989 --> 00:32:16.789
And I think it stems from them being entrepreneurs.

00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:24.190
Where, if you're an entrepreneur and one of
your employee’s screws up, maybe some entrepreneurs

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:25.899
say, "Oh, well the employee is terrible.

00:32:25.899 --> 00:32:27.249
It's their fault.

00:32:27.249 --> 00:32:28.499
That's why we messed up."

00:32:28.499 --> 00:32:30.469
But those kinds of entrepreneurs don't last
very long.

00:32:30.469 --> 00:32:33.039
The ones that are successful say, "OK, this
is my fault.

00:32:33.039 --> 00:32:34.129
I created this.

00:32:34.129 --> 00:32:37.639
Either I made a bad hiring decision, in which
case I need to fix that.

00:32:37.639 --> 00:32:43.519
Or, I didn't provide the leadership necessary
to have that employee do the right thing.

00:32:43.519 --> 00:32:44.690
So, I'm in control.

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:46.019
I'm in the driver's seat.

00:32:46.019 --> 00:32:47.619
I'm creating my reality."

00:32:47.619 --> 00:32:53.669
There's a lot of cheesy stuff out there about
this issue, the law of attraction and "you

00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:54.999
create your own reality."

00:32:54.999 --> 00:33:00.229
I think for a lot of things that gets overblown
and overhyped.

00:33:00.229 --> 00:33:06.940
And you can fairly have skepticism about some
of the more extreme New Age ways that this

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:10.109
gets expressed in like that movie "The Secret."

00:33:10.109 --> 00:33:18.099
But just on a basic level, overcoming this
emotional liability of "I'm a victim," "other

00:33:18.099 --> 00:33:22.619
people are screwing me over in my career,"
"if just that one employee, if just that one

00:33:22.619 --> 00:33:27.679
boss did something different than I'd get
the results I want," that's an emotional liability.

00:33:27.679 --> 00:33:35.440
And learning to overcome that is a very, very
powerful way to invest in your own human capital.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:38.719
So, if you think about the most successful--.

00:33:38.719 --> 00:33:46.159
Think about the best leader you can imagine,
either a boss you've had or just an idealization

00:33:46.159 --> 00:33:47.679
of your perfect boss/leader.

00:33:47.679 --> 00:33:55.740
So, this person is highly inspiring, highly
motivating, makes you wanna work for her,

00:33:55.740 --> 00:34:01.769
makes you want to bring out your best to perform
for the vision she's setting out, is giving

00:34:01.769 --> 00:34:07.070
you really hard-hitting solid feedback, but
done in a very compassionate way that's not

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:10.419
aimed at cutting you down, but rather in helping
you grow.

00:34:10.419 --> 00:34:13.649
So, you think about the most inspiring leader
like that.

00:34:13.649 --> 00:34:17.849
And we've all probably had one or two in some
context or another.

00:34:17.849 --> 00:34:24.169
That person has overcome a lot of their emotional
liabilities 'cause we've all got them from

00:34:24.169 --> 00:34:25.169
childhood.

00:34:25.169 --> 00:34:26.230
My mother is here, also.

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:31.470
I had a very happy childhood, but just from
normal growing up stuff, we've all got this

00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:37.030
baggage that we carry around and if we don't
learn to let go of the baggage, it will come

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:38.609
back to bite us in the ass.

00:34:38.609 --> 00:34:41.579
And it will affect, this is not airy-fairy
New Age stuff.

00:34:41.579 --> 00:34:44.820
it will affect your bottom line.

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:53.290
And so, again on the theme of specific takeaways,
on this one, emotional liabilities is very

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:56.230
hard to do just on your own because as we
said, they're blind spots.

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:58.260
So, you need feedback.

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:01.150
And I'm a very big believer in executive coaching.

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:06.250
I'm almost like a religious convert to executive
coaching.

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:09.110
It's transformed my own life, my own earning
power.

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:15.000
I mentioned in the darkest days of my professional
life, I earned eight thousand dollars in one

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
year.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.869
That was just about four or five years ago
until I finally got my health issues taken

00:35:20.869 --> 00:35:25.319
care of, which is the second kind of human
capital we talk about.

00:35:25.319 --> 00:35:29.910
And then I was in a place to start, once I
got my health taken care of, to start focusing

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:30.910
on my money.

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:31.910
And I said, "You know what?

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:35.190
I can't be in this place any longer.

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:37.340
I've got to get my money handled.

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:39.839
And I'm not gonna attract--.

00:35:39.839 --> 00:35:45.349
No woman that I want to spend my life with
is gonna wanna be married to such a financial

00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:46.360
basket case."

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:49.740
And this is before I met Jena and I really
had my vision.

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:54.190
I needed to get this handled to meet the kind
of partner that I wanted to have in my life.

00:35:54.190 --> 00:36:00.849
So, I invested and it was literally a financial
investment in really high-quality coaching.

00:36:00.849 --> 00:36:05.450
And there's all kinds of workshops out there,
coaching you can get.

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:08.770
Again, there's enormous amount of BS out there.

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:15.140
I would say, I'm probably gonna piss some
people off for listening to this on the video,

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:20.440
but I would say 80% of coaches I've come across
are pretty messed up in their own life and

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:25.380
they're using coaching as a way to sort out
their own life by coaching other people.

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:29.450
That's a really, really common meme that you'll
see out there.

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:33.230
So, you gotta find the people who aren't like
that, who actually have their stuff already

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:34.230
handled.

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:39.849
And who can help you get your emotional liabilities
handled.

00:36:39.849 --> 00:36:42.730
What's the best way to find them?

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:45.819
Referrals is always the best way I think.

00:36:45.819 --> 00:36:47.690
Find people who've got this stuff handled.

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:49.660
Find people who are where you wanna be.

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:54.589
Find, whether in this company or elsewhere
in the Valley, find people who are where you

00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:59.339
wanna be and ask who they learned from.

00:36:59.339 --> 00:37:00.690
What books did they read?

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:01.799
What teachers did they have?

00:37:01.799 --> 00:37:03.070
What mentors did they have?

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:07.520
It's possible that those people teach workshops,
teach classes.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:12.039
I'll make two recommendations right here if
you're looking for specific recommendations.

00:37:12.039 --> 00:37:13.099
I have no--.

00:37:13.099 --> 00:37:15.140
I'm not affiliated with these people.

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:20.710
I have no benefit from recommending them,
but one is actually a former Googler, Jenny

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:26.570
Blake, who used to organize this Authors@Google
series.

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:32.089
And she was an executive coach here at Google
and she decided to go out and do it full-time

00:37:32.089 --> 00:37:33.089
herself.

00:37:33.089 --> 00:37:34.490
She's great.

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:36.490
She's helped me a lot.

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:37.700
She's a friend now.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:39.981
I actually pay an executive coach also.

00:37:39.981 --> 00:37:43.779
So, there's a mix of informal and formal.

00:37:43.779 --> 00:37:46.890
So, you can find mentors, which is a form
of coaching.

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:52.430
But I really do believe in investing with
your wallet and paying for some executive

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:53.430
coaching.

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:55.920
I pay for an executive coach.

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:59.079
He's a guy called Peter Shallard.

00:37:59.079 --> 00:38:00.079
S-H-A-L-L-A-R-D.

00:38:00.079 --> 00:38:02.849
He goes by the moniker, "The Shrink for Entrepreneurs."

00:38:02.849 --> 00:38:08.539
And I think we're all, whether employees or
not, we all live in an entrepreneurial environment.

00:38:08.539 --> 00:38:12.410
We all need some kind of shrink quote/unquote.

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:17.040
And so, go out and find one that works for
you and make that investment.

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.529
A good executive coach--.

00:38:19.529 --> 00:38:23.849
The going rate for a really good one who knows
what they're doing is about a thousand dollars

00:38:23.849 --> 00:38:25.029
a month.

00:38:25.029 --> 00:38:32.050
And that may sound like a lot, but compare
that, for example, to going back and getting

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:33.319
a master’s degree.

00:38:33.319 --> 00:38:39.630
That could be 50 thousand dollars a year for
a good program plus forgone earnings.

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:43.630
That could be another 50 to 100 thousand dollars
a year in forgone earnings.

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:45.450
Much of that will be put on debt.

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:48.819
So, there's gonna be interest associated with
the debt.

00:38:48.819 --> 00:38:55.930
So, you're looking at possibly 150 thousand
dollars a year to get that kind of formal

00:38:55.930 --> 00:39:01.070
increase in your human capital, whereas a
really good executive coach might be one-tenth

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:02.849
of that in a year.

00:39:02.849 --> 00:39:09.329
It's gonna be a form of education, but highly
tailored to your specific needs and your specific

00:39:09.329 --> 00:39:12.230
circumstances.

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:18.680
And again, this is like a more kind of guerilla
lean style where you don't have to leave your

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.250
job.

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:25.049
This is done in dialogue with your job, this
kind of education.

00:39:25.049 --> 00:39:30.890
And all the people I talked to in this book
are really, really big believers in the power

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:32.430
of mentorship.

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:36.650
And since they didn't have formal educations,
they didn't have professors, they had to go

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:38.540
and find their professors in the world.

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:44.390
So, I have a chapter, the second chapter in
the book, is a step-by-step way to go on how

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:49.619
to find informal mentors who can help you
with these issues and help us get to that

00:39:49.619 --> 00:39:56.329
higher, more clean level of leadership where
we're not getting triggered and weighed down

00:39:56.329 --> 00:39:57.930
by emotional baggage issues.

00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:04.170
So, that's the third kind of human capital
investment.

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:11.950
And the last type of human capital that I'm
gonna talk about today is meaning and bringing

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:14.700
meaning to our careers.

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:19.900
And I have another pretty serious personal
story around this.

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:24.309
After dealing with that whole bipolar health
issue, I got out of it.

00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:26.150
I got out alive.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:30.549
Pretty soon after that, I got diagnosed with
testicular cancer about two and a half years

00:40:30.549 --> 00:40:31.720
ago.

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:38.060
And knock on wood, I got the surgery four
days after I found out about it.

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:39.390
I was on the surgery table.

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:40.430
I got the surgery.

00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:41.730
Everything seems to be OK now.

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:46.030
So I am a cancer survivor of two and half
years.

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:52.000
And it's kind of clichéd or cheesy, but there's
something about being diagnosed with a potentially

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.250
fatal illness that gives you a permission
slip to really start thinking about these

00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:58.330
big issues.

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:01.579
Like, what does my life mean?

00:41:01.579 --> 00:41:05.079
What impact do I really want to make here
on the planet?

00:41:05.079 --> 00:41:11.960
And so, I thought about those a lot during
the time of the surgery and after.

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:16.250
And I just spent a lot of time thinking about
those issues.

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:23.220
And to me, it's actually kind of sad that
it generally takes a life-threatening illness

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:27.940
for us to give ourselves permission to start
thinking about these issues in our life.

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:34.089
Steve Jobs just stepped down from his incredible
tenure of leadership.

00:41:34.089 --> 00:41:41.210
There's a really beautiful commencement speech
he gave in 2005 at Stanford where he talks

00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:46.769
about this and he talks about his cancer diagnosis
and how he started thinking about these big

00:41:46.769 --> 00:41:51.539
picture issues facing death.

00:41:51.539 --> 00:41:57.109
And my hope is that we all in this room don't
have to face those issues for a very long

00:41:57.109 --> 00:42:01.160
time and we all live very, very healthy long
lives.

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:07.069
But I want us to give ourselves permission
to think about those issues without facing

00:42:07.069 --> 00:42:08.980
mortality and do it now.

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:13.589
And again, this is not an airy-fairy concept.

00:42:13.589 --> 00:42:17.779
It has direct relevance to your success in
your career.

00:42:17.779 --> 00:42:23.130
So, if you take two people again, same educational
background, same training, same technical

00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:24.130
skills.

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:28.740
One of them is just showing up for work like,
"Hey, Google's a cool place to work and get

00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:30.150
this free food.

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:31.740
It sounds cool on my resume."

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.569
And that's their relation to their work.

00:42:33.569 --> 00:42:34.769
Not a lot of meaning.

00:42:34.769 --> 00:42:42.410
And you take someone else who has a very clear
sense of what they want to accomplish on this

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:47.740
planet, of what impact they want to have made
in their company, in the industry, in the

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:49.940
world, through their work.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:52.460
Which one of those two people is gonna be
promoted faster?

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:55.130
Which one is gonna advance in their career?

00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:57.250
Which one is gonna earn more over their career?

00:42:57.250 --> 00:42:59.050
It's really clear the latter one will.

00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:04.369
So, I'm gonna give you my definition of meaning
and how we can add more to it.

00:43:04.369 --> 00:43:09.970
I'm sure that you did not expect coming at
12 PM at a lunchtime talk to get a definition

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:15.690
of the meaning of life, but I'm gonna give
you mine right here from a lot of reflection.

00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:19.619
The way I like to think about it is the way
we can add more meaning to our lives and our

00:43:19.619 --> 00:43:28.440
career is making a difference in the lives
of people you care about.

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.940
Making a difference in the people you care
about.

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:32.460
And there's two components to that.

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:35.170
Making a difference and the people you care
about.

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:39.190
And both of those components need to be there
for a sense of meaning.

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:45.269
So, I have two of the most important people
in my life here: my mother, who gave me life.

00:43:45.269 --> 00:43:49.859
My wife, who gives me life every day and inspiration.

00:43:49.859 --> 00:43:54.319
And these are people I deeply, deeply care
about.

00:43:54.319 --> 00:43:57.440
And Jena and I just had our one year wedding
anniversary.

00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:03.190
And a year ago, a little over a year ago,
I was giving her my vows in the wedding and

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:10.420
I said, "Jena, I vow to you that if you're
ever in danger, if you're ever in harm's way,

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:12.400
I will sacrifice everything.

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:17.589
I will sacrifice even my own life to protect
you and to get you out of harm."

00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:23.070
And I meant those words and there's very few
people on the planet I would say those words

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:26.060
to, but I said them to Jena that day.

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:29.320
And that is a level of meaning that I'm talking
about here.

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:32.960
That's the level of care and we all have that
in our families.

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:38.560
We all have that with people we love, whether
it's a spouse or significant other, children,

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:41.220
siblings, parents.

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:46.030
And so, we get this is in our personal life
that that's what gives us meaning is making

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:47.030
a difference.

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:50.849
On that difference point, it's not just caring.

00:44:50.849 --> 00:44:52.089
It's also--.

00:44:52.089 --> 00:44:53.089
This is--.

00:44:53.089 --> 00:44:57.220
Jena is someone I care deeply about and I
know I'm making a difference in her life.

00:44:57.220 --> 00:45:02.750
I know that her life is very different because
I'm in it and we have a relationship.

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:03.930
And it goes both ways.

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:09.970
My life is completely different and pretty
much unrecognizable because of Jena's care

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:12.529
and the difference she's making on me.

00:45:12.529 --> 00:45:14.970
So, it's the caring and the making a difference.

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:18.579
So, how does this translate into the professional
realm?

00:45:18.579 --> 00:45:24.640
Well, the level of care may or may not be
that intense, but you all work with people.

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:25.740
We like to think--.

00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:32.410
We may think that we're here because of technical
skills, because of training background.

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:35.519
But nothing gets done without people.

00:45:35.519 --> 00:45:38.300
And you all work on teams.

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:41.329
And presumably, you care about your teams.

00:45:41.329 --> 00:45:44.440
And there's an analogy here.

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:50.670
If you interview soldiers about why they fight,
why they put up with these horrendous, hellish

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:55.839
conditions, what keeps them going day after
day on no sleep, risking their life every

00:45:55.839 --> 00:45:56.839
day?

00:45:56.839 --> 00:46:01.930
If you interview people like that about why
they do it, they may say something about the

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:03.869
cause or the reason they're fighting or their
country.

00:46:03.869 --> 00:46:09.569
But if you really dig deep and read the interviews
with them, almost always they're talking about

00:46:09.569 --> 00:46:14.730
their team mates, their fellow soldiers and
this profound love and care they have for

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:16.759
the people that on are on their side.

00:46:16.759 --> 00:46:21.450
And it's very elemental thing in our psychology,
this caring for teams.

00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:27.759
So, the more you learn how to get in touch
with why you're here, why you care about what

00:46:27.759 --> 00:46:33.410
you're doing, the people you care about, and
getting really, really inspired by making

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:39.610
a difference in what they're doing, the more
powerful your career is gonna be, the more

00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:42.730
powerful each minute of your labor, which
is fixed.

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:44.579
You only have a certain amount of it each
day.

00:46:44.579 --> 00:46:47.609
So we're talking about how to make it the
most effective.

00:46:47.609 --> 00:46:50.839
The more each minute of that labor is gonna
be powerful.

00:46:50.839 --> 00:46:54.770
And there's not really books or things you
can do.

00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:55.770
This is inquiry.

00:46:55.770 --> 00:47:00.160
This is internal inquiry that we all have
to do.

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:04.910
And it tends to get put aside for other types
of investing.

00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:09.780
So, people, when they think of investing,
they think of stocks, bonds, real estate,

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:10.780
portfolios.

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:21.339
A common benchmark is that you're supposed
to put 10% of your pre-tax earnings into retirement

00:47:21.339 --> 00:47:23.500
and that kind of savings and investment.

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:28.039
So, that's roughly 10% of your energy going
towards that kind of investment.

00:47:28.039 --> 00:47:33.259
But we never ever talk about these, giving
ourself time for these kinds of investments

00:47:33.259 --> 00:47:34.740
in our human capital.

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:38.930
And the people I talked to for the last two
years, this is their focus.

00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:45.039
I mean, these are masters, masters, of investing
in their own human capital in very inexpensive

00:47:45.039 --> 00:47:49.690
ways, without having to go into debt, without
having to take out student loans.

00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:51.700
Again, I'm not trying to bash those things.

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:53.789
All of you have probably done a lot of that
in your life.

00:47:53.789 --> 00:48:03.440
I'm just trying to expand the conversation
in a direction that it hasn't gone very much.

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:14.400
[pause]
So in closing, I hope that this talk has inspired

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:19.269
you to change the way you view the concept
of investing.

00:48:19.269 --> 00:48:23.190
That all of the things that I'm talking about
are actual investments of things that matter

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:24.630
to you.

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:30.760
I mean, even than money, what's more valuable
to all of us than money is time.

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:33.130
And all of these things are gonna take time.

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:38.890
I'm not minimizing the amount of time that
these things are gonna take: to learn to be

00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:44.430
a more persuasive communicator about your
ideas, to learn to increase the quality of

00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:51.000
your attention through better health habits,
to learn to get over these emotional baggage

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:58.690
issues that we all have, to do this deep inquiry
into what is meaningful for you about your

00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:02.400
career, why you show up every day other than
just collecting a paycheck.

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:03.670
Those are all gonna take time.

00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:09.849
But in my view, these are extremely powerful,
lucrative ways to invest your time, your energy,

00:49:09.849 --> 00:49:10.849
and your money.

00:49:10.849 --> 00:49:13.540
Thank you so much.

00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:15.599
[applause]

00:49:15.599 --> 00:49:22.999
So, we have some time for, let me just see
how much time we have here.

00:49:22.999 --> 00:49:32.720
We have some time for about ten minutes for
questions, so any questions from the audience.

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.480
Yes.

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:38.000
&gt;&gt;Audience: [inaudible]

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.269
&gt;&gt; Michael Ellsberg: Here.

00:49:43.269 --> 00:49:50.910
&gt;&gt;MALE #1: So, thank you for the talk.

00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:57.079
One of the things, though, when you're talking
about attention, you gave these two examples.

00:49:57.079 --> 00:50:02.369
The person who comes in, has to drink a ton
of coffee to wake up and then the person who's

00:50:02.369 --> 00:50:04.019
naturally there and they're fully focused.

00:50:04.019 --> 00:50:07.299
I mean, those are two rather extreme examples.

00:50:07.299 --> 00:50:11.390
I think probably the majority of people here
fall into the middle.

00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:13.020
They know they need to focus.

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:14.609
They're trying to focus.

00:50:14.609 --> 00:50:18.560
But distractions still come up.

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:23.901
Do you have any thoughts or specific things
that you do or that some of the people in

00:50:23.901 --> 00:50:29.290
your book do to actually be able to maintain
that focus for extended periods of time at

00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:31.650
work amidst all the distractions?

00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:33.079
&gt;&gt;Michael Ellsberg: Right.

00:50:33.079 --> 00:50:34.079
Great.

00:50:34.079 --> 00:50:38.349
So, the question, if you didn't hear it is
probably all of us in this room are more in

00:50:38.349 --> 00:50:43.740
the middle of that range that I gave that
we're not complete basket cases with our attention,

00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:49.269
but even if we're in the middle of that road,
how can we improve even further?

00:50:49.269 --> 00:50:53.519
So there's the street eye view and the bird's
eye view.

00:50:53.519 --> 00:50:57.589
A lot of the books out there on this topic,
a really popular one in the tech world is

00:50:57.589 --> 00:51:00.079
"Getting Things Done" by David Allen.

00:51:00.079 --> 00:51:02.530
It could be useful for you.

00:51:02.530 --> 00:51:07.819
It focuses on really day-to-day strategies
of this kind of stuff.

00:51:07.819 --> 00:51:13.259
The issue I have with that book and those
kinds of books is that they tend to be very

00:51:13.259 --> 00:51:20.970
good about how you should plan your tasks,
but they don't really get you thinking that

00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:25.380
much about which tasks you should be doing
and which ones are gonna have the highest

00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:26.380
impact.

00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:32.160
And I actually think, again, that that inquiry
into your meaning about, like what you really,

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:35.920
what are the really important things you wanna
be accomplishing here?

00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:43.279
That is a big picture inquiry that can cut
out 80% of the low-level tasks that you have

00:51:43.279 --> 00:51:46.490
to do if you really get in touch with that
meaning.

00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:50.059
On the more street eye view, a system--.

00:51:50.059 --> 00:51:52.730
This is an area I'm still working on a lot.

00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:56.280
A system that I have found very useful is
called the Pomodoro Technique.

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:58.079
Has anyone heard of that one?

00:51:58.079 --> 00:52:01.460
If you look it up, Pomodoro, there's a lot
of stuff of it online.

00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:08.380
The name comes from the Pomodoro kitchen timers,
those tomatoes that you twist and it tick-tocks

00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:10.130
in the kitchen.

00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:14.950
And the idea is that it's basically a timer
and you can get digital versions of this.

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:18.119
That goes for 25 minutes.

00:52:18.119 --> 00:52:25.609
And in 25 minutes, you focus on one thing
and you turn off all the email and the notifications

00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:28.619
and the Facebook and the Google+ and all these
things.

00:52:28.619 --> 00:52:30.849
You focus on one thing for 25 minutes.

00:52:30.849 --> 00:52:32.240
The timer goes off.

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:34.790
You get a five minute break and you can do
whatever you want.

00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:36.060
You can go and get tea.

00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:37.680
You can make some cell phone calls.

00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:39.180
You can check your Facebook.

00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:40.920
Then the timer goes off in five minutes.

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:43.109
You go back to 25.

00:52:43.109 --> 00:52:45.240
That cycle, they call it a Pomodoro.

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:48.170
You do four of those Pomodoros, which is roughly
two hours.

00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:50.160
And then you can take a longer break.

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:54.680
And I found that to be really, really effective
in my own life.

00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:55.750
I'm self-employed.

00:52:55.750 --> 00:53:00.920
I work at home, so I don't have a team that's
keeping me on track.

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:06.579
So, I have needed to implement something like
this to stay on track.

00:53:06.579 --> 00:53:13.670
But there's all kinds of things out there
like that available to you really cheaply.

00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:17.999
And I guess my big picture point is to not
view those things as extras.

00:53:17.999 --> 00:53:22.249
Like, "Well, maybe if I have some time I'll
learn those things."

00:53:22.249 --> 00:53:28.329
These are things that are going to make your
labor more valuable next week, the week after

00:53:28.329 --> 00:53:32.619
that, day after day, month after month, and
you will see the results in your career and

00:53:32.619 --> 00:53:40.109
in your earnings and in the leadership you're
able to take.

00:53:40.109 --> 00:53:42.749
[applause]

00:53:42.749 --> 00:53:45.150
There's books available over there.
