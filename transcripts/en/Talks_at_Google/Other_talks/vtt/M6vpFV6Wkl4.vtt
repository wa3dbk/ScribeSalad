00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:09.390
&gt;&gt;presenter: This talk is part of the Authors@Google
of the Health@Google series. We'll have a

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:16.110
lot of time at the end for questions and there's
a mic here.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:23.339
So, I'm very pleased to welcome today, Gary
Taubes, who is a contributing correspondent

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:31.609
for Science Magazine. His work has appeared
in the New York Times, the Atlantic, the Esquire.

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:40.399
His work has also been included in The Best
of The Best American Science Writing and also

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:47.120
has received three Science in the Society
Journalism awards from the National Association

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.670
of Science Writers.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:56.390
He's the author, also, of 'Good Calories,
Bad Calories' that I'm sure many of you know

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:11.780
about. And currently, he is the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation investigator in health

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.200
policy research at the University of Berkeley.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.200
So, with this, we'll have Gary Taubes talk
about his latest book.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.200
[applause]

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.860
&gt;&gt;Gary Taubes: Thank you very much. This book
is basically -- 'Good Calories, Bad Calories'

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.970
took me about five years to write and was
500 pages long.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.580
This is the screen I used to use for this
talk and I had written that book hoping to

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.310
get both the lay readers and to the public
health authorities around the country and

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.430
the medical research community. 'Cause the
goal of these books are to convince people

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.160
that--I mean, it's almost a cliché--but that
our fundamental understanding of why we get

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.789
fat, of obesity, is completely incorrect and
that a new paradigm is in order.

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:55.759
And that Google should change the foods that
they're serving at their wonderful, healthy,

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.870
low-fat cafes. So, after 'Good Calories, Bad
Calories' came out, I wrote 'Why We Get Fat',

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:07.039
in effect, to make it the kind of airplane-reading
version of 'Good Calories, Bad Calories' for

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:08.979
people who don't have the time.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.950
I got a lot of emails from people, from doctors,
who asked me if I could write a book that

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.810
their patients could read, from patients who
asked me if I could write a book that their

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.730
doctors would read.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.930
[laughter]

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.810
So, in this lecture, 'Why We Get Fat' is actually
based on the lecture. So, once you've seen

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.819
this, you don't actually have to read the
book. Let me see if this works a little. That's

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:33.819
better.

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.970
This is just background. You know there's
an obesity epidemic in the works. I'm not

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.970
gonna go over it because, as usual, I'm probably
gonna run a little long on this talk. The

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.739
obesity epidemic goes along with the diabetes
epidemic. Diabetes diagnoses have tripled

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.400
in the past 30 years in the United States.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:58.990
And let's see if this. [pause] Diabetes, obesity
are associated with a host of chronic diseases

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.409
that are known as metabolic diseases, which
include fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis,

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:09.319
hypertension, stroke, cancer, asthma, sleep
apnea, osteoarthritis, neural degeneration.

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:15.349
Actually, Alzheimer's disease is a disease
that's now associated with what's called insulin

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.120
resistance in obesity.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.910
And one of the subtexts of the talk I'm gonna
give today is that the conventional wisdom

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:31.049
is that as we get fatter, that increases the
risk of all these diseases and the fundamental

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.049
problem is us getting fatter.

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.519
And I'm gonna suggest that the same foods,
the same thing that makes us fat, also causes

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:42.319
these diseases. So, it's a fundamentally different
causality.

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:48.269
So the question we want is why do we get fat?
Obvious question. And the officials answers

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.799
are, "Obesity occurs when a person consumes
more calories from food than he or she burns."

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.689
"Overweight is the result of a caloric imbalance
and is mediated by genetics and health." That's

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:00.560
what the old Surgeon General and the NIH tells
us.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.430
So how many people in this room actually believe
this and think it's meaningful? That's not

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.430
bad.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.090
You know, I gave this talk at Tufts a couple
weeks ago to the nutrition department. And

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.560
the Tufts people have been behind every dietary
guidelines for the past 20 years. And I asked

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.780
how many people believe this and nobody--literally,
nobody--raised their hand. And then I said,

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.100
"Are you kidding? 'Cause if you don't, I can
leave." And then everybody raised their hand.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.360
And then after the talk, they said, "Well,
we don't really believe it."

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.800
So here's a conventional wisdom: "Energy in
is greater than energy out." And that's why

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:38.320
we get fat. We take in more energy than we
consume. We overeat and the excess calories

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.890
go to our fat tissue. You hear about this
in a lot of different ways.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.820
In the medical literature, they'll refer to
"over nutrition". "Positive energy balance"

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.920
is another way to phrase it. And often, virtually
every article you read on obesity, they'll

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.290
say, "Obesity is a disorder of energy balance."

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.940
And when they say that, what they mean is
we take in more calories than we consume and

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.160
that's why we get fat.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.950
So here's the general image of what's going
on here. And what you wanna do when we talk

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:12.000
about this, one of the key things you wanna
do in any science is explain the observations.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.920
So we have this observation of an obesity
epidemic and we want to explain it by our

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.790
hypothesis, which is that we take in more
calories than we expend.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.030
And the way it's been done over the years
is that the idea is "increased prosperity."

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.490
This is what Marion Nestle, a New York University
nutritionist, wrote in 'Science', "As we get

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.950
richer, more food becomes available. We have
less reason to become physically active."

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.960
That food's on every street corner. You don't
have to work to get it.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.040
And so we get fatter and fatter. Kelly Brownell,
a Yale University psychologist, used, coined

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.570
the term "toxic environment," which is an
environment that promotes overeating and sedentary

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.840
behavior. And so physical activity, and as
Kelly put it, he said, "Cheese curls and French

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.880
fries,[audience chuckles] fast food joints
are as much a part of our environment as trees

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:05.400
and clouds. Mothers keep their kids home from
school. We sit in front of computer screens

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.910
all day long and video games and television."

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:13.840
So a lot of reasons to eat too much, not enough
reason to burn it off. And the question we

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.250
wanna know -- here's the hypothesis: increased
prosperity leads to overeating--energy in

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:24.160
is greater than energy out-- and that leads
to obesity and the obesity epidemic. And what

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.371
we wanna know is, is this true? 'Cause this
is a science and in science, this is a hypothesis.

00:06:29.371 --> 00:06:34.330
So you just ask a question. Is this true?
Does it explain the observations?

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.120
When I'm lecturing to nutrition departments
and obesity research departments, I often

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.770
wanna piss them off in the beginning. It's
part of my nature. And I'll say, "Let's pretend

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:49.020
this is a science for a second [audience chuckles]
and see if this can actually explain the observations."

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.410
There are a lot of observations out there,
but they're less than obvious. They're not

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:57.580
-- right now, we know we've got McDonalds
on every street corner. We know a lot of people

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.330
watch television. And we know a lot of people
are getting heavier.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:05.420
So we put them all together, these associations,
and we say. "That's the cause". But we could

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:13.811
find populations that didn't have all these,
this toxic environment as we define it, and

00:07:13.811 --> 00:07:16.740
we could look to see if the obesity existed
there.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.730
And one of the underlying contexts here, one
of my underlying hypothesis, and also of any

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:26.800
science, the underlying principles is Occam's
Razor. So we should find the simplest possible

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.800
hypothesis.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:33.330
So we're gonna work from the hypothesis of
whatever makes any population fat is what

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.720
makes our population fat, until we have to
change it.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.970
So, here we have a photo. This young woman,
or middle-aged woman, was known as 'Fat Louisa'.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:47.900
This photo was taken in 1902. And Fat Louisa
was a Pima Indian. And the Pima live on the

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:52.250
Gila River reservation. Now, it's the Gila
River reservation, south of Phoenix, Arizona.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:57.620
What's little-known about the Pima is today,
they are the poster children for obesity and

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:02.780
diabetes in the United States cause they have,
conceivably, the highest risk of any population.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:08.510
In the 17th, 18th, 19th Century, they were
the most affluent Native American tribe. They

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:13.940
were hunters and gatherers. They hunted in
the nearby mountains. They fished in the Gila

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:24.960
River. They raised sheep--not sheep--cattle,
pigs. They had warehouses full of food available

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.081
in the 1840s.

00:08:26.081 --> 00:08:31.810
When the first US Army Battalion moved to
the Pima territory on the San Jose Trail,

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:38.241
they reported that the Pima had this incredible
amount of food available. And they were all

00:08:38.241 --> 00:08:44.050
lean and sprightly. And by 1849, gold was
discovered in California.

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:51.460
And over the next 20 years, 20 to 60 thousand
49ers went west to the Pima territory and

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.700
the US government asked the Pima to feed them,
which they did, and protect them from the

00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:00.960
hostile tribes farther West. And then by the
1870s, 1880s, Mexican Americans and Anglo

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.540
Americans started moving into the Pima territory
and they overhunted the nearby mountains.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:10.430
They diverted the Gila River water to irrigate
their own fields, and the Pima went into what

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:14.860
they called the Years of Famine, which lasted
for 20 or 30 years.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:24.490
And by 1902, when Frank Rosso, a Harvard anthropologist
came to live with the Pima and wrote the Seminole

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:29.200
text on the Pima Indians, they were living
on a reservation. They were struggling as

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:36.830
farmers to survive, and it was [pause] it
was Rosso who took the photo of Fat Louisa

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:41.250
on the right. And he said many old people
in the tribe, unlike the classical image of

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:47.070
the strong, buff Native American, many old
people in the tribe were actually obese and

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:48.070
overweight.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:52.740
And this was an observation that was seconded
a few years later by Alex Hrdlicka, who was

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:58.660
the physician-anthropologist who went on to
become the curator of the Smithsonian, Department

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:03.820
of Physical Anthropology. So, the point about
the Pima was that they went from being affluent

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:10.740
in the 1840s -- that drawing was actually
made in 1851 -- to poor in 1902. And they

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:15.050
went through 30 years of famine in the middle.
And 30 years of famine, you could think of

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:20.280
as 30 years of being on a diet. And they should
have been leaner, right? 'Cause our hypothesis

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:26.940
says if poverty leading to prosperity causes
obesity, not prosperity leading to poverty.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:32.210
And yet, in the early 19th Century, we have
a high level of obesity observed by two separate

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:38.360
anthropologists living with the tribe. If
this was the only example, we could probably

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:43.380
toss it and assume something else was going
on. But there are a lot of examples of obesity

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:47.840
in what we would call "non-toxic environments."

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.760
And one of the things that sort of pissed
me off doing my research for 'Good Calories,

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:57.610
Bad Calories', which took five years, is you
only had to go to look for them to find them.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:02.190
And yet, the obesity research community hadn't
bothered 'cause they had settled on their

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:06.500
hypothesis. It's all about overeating. It's
all about taking in too many calories. It's

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:11.310
all about fast food joints. And so they never
looked. If you go look, you'll find a lot

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:17.570
of different populations. The Sioux on the
South Dakota Crow Creek Reservation, in 1928

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:22.850
-- this was a study done by two University
of Chicago economists.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:29.030
And this, this population was so poor that
you could use it. You could put it in the

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:32.480
dictionary next to the definition of "dirt
poor." They lived four to eight people per

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:38.240
room. Something like 15 families with 32 children
on the reservation were living only on bread

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:44.851
and coffee. There were no bathrooms. There's
no plumbing. They had to get water from the

00:11:44.851 --> 00:11:51.010
river. And yet, 40 percent of the women, 25
percent of the men, and 10 percent of the

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:55.260
children were distinctly fat. And 20 percent
of the women, 25 percent of the men, and 25

00:11:55.260 --> 00:12:00.779
percent of the children were distinctly thin.
And there were definite signs of malnutrition.

00:12:00.779 --> 00:12:07.230
The economists documented all kinds of deficiency
diseases among these Native Americans. And

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:14.190
this combination of obesity and malnutrition,
or under nutrition, existing in the same population

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:21.560
is an observation I'm gonna come back to shortly
-- many times, in fact. OK, African Americans

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:28.090
in Charleston, South Carolina in 1959. Thirty
percent of the women are obese and 18 percent

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:31.050
of the men. Family incomes are nine to 53
dollars a week. That's less than 400 dollars

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.720
a week in 2011 dollars.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:39.240
Zulus in Durban, South Africa in 1960. Forty
percent of the women are obese. Women in their

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.510
40s averaged 175 pounds. Today in the United
States, the average weight for adult women

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:50.990
is around 165 pounds. Trinidad, early 60s,
Trinidad's having a malnutrition, a famine

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:55.320
crisis. The US government sends a team of
nutritionists down to help out and they come

00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:01.630
back reporting that a third of women over
25 are obese. They report obesity as a "potentially

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:04.980
serious medical problem in women." The per
capita data.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:10.610
The next year, an MIT nutritionist goes down
to Trinidad to figure out what's going on.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:15.529
She studies the diet of the obese women, compares
it to the diets of the lean women in Trinidad

00:13:15.529 --> 00:13:21.070
and concludes that the per capita daily diet
was less than 2000 calories a day, 21 percent

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:26.710
fat. Fewer calories than were recommended
at the time by the Food and Agricultural Organization

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:27.730
for a healthy diet.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:34.930
Bantu "pensioners" in South Africa in the
mid-60s. These are the poorest of a disenfranchised

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:40.790
population. 30 percent of the women are severely
overweight and the mean weight of women over

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:47.450
60 is 165 pounds. Raratonga in the South Pacific.
Forty percent of the women are obese, 25 percent

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:51.110
are greatly obese, grossly obese. That's in
1971.

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:56.700
And then, factory workers in Chile in 1974.
Thirty percent are obese. Nearly 50 percent

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:02.490
of the women over 54 are obese. Ten percent
suffer undernourishment. OK, so here's that

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:08.160
combination again of obesity and malnutrition
in the same population and most are engaged

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.450
in heavy labor.

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:14.050
So, these are factory workers. They probably
don't belong to a gym. They probably don't

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:19.050
have gyms in their factory in Chile in the
70s. They're not working out regularly. They're

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:22.520
not training for marathons. They're probably
not doing triathlons.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:26.520
But they're engaged in heavy labor, heavy,
manual, physical labor. So we can assume on

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:31.460
a day-to-day basis they are more physically
active than we are. And yet, 30 percent are

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:35.279
obese and nearly 50 percent--half of them--over
54.

00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:39.339
And here's the last study I'll show you. This
is Mexican Americans in Starr County, Texas

00:14:39.339 --> 00:14:45.860
in 1981. Fifty percent of the women in their
50s are obese, 40 percent of the men in their

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:50.110
40s. And the living conditions, most inhabitants
are employed in agricultural labor and who

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:58.370
work in the oil fields. So again, very physically
active population, but high levels of obesity.

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:03.240
And there was one restaurant in Starr County,
Texas in 1981. Starr County is on the border

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:08.500
of Mexico, about 200 miles due South of San
Antonio. And that was a Mexican restaurant.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.940
So again, this definition, there's no increased
prosperity for many of these populations.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:18.880
There's no prosperity at all. There's no toxic
environment as we would define it today. But

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:23.730
something's making them fat and we wanna know
what. Why were these populations fat? So if

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:28.540
we can figure out why these populations were
fat, we can probably figure out why our populations

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:29.940
are getting fat.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:35.410
So here's how this question was phrased in
1973. Ralph Richards was a university – he

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:42.360
was a British-trained diabetes specialist
who went to Jamaica in the early 1960s, founded

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:46.300
a diabetes clinic at the University of the
West Indies, and in the early 70s reported

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:52.020
that a third of the women over 25 were obese
and that obesity reached what he called "monstrous

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:56.380
proportions" in this age group. And he said,
"It's difficult to explain the high frequency

00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:01.660
of obesity seen in a relatively impecunious
society such as exists in the West Indies,

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.600
when compared to the standard of living enjoyed
in the more developed countries."

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.839
He's asking the same question I'm asking and
we all should be asking. If poor people are

00:16:08.839 --> 00:16:14.750
so fat, our theory says it’s the rich ones
who should be fat. "Malnutrition and sub nutrition

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:18.610
are common disorders in the first two years
of life in these areas and account for almost

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:23.110
25 percent of all admissions to pediatric
wards in Jamaica." So, by "sub nutrition",

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:28.080
he means not enough food. "Sub nutrition continues
in early childhood to the early teens."

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:32.970
So the children are stunted and show signs
of emaciation and then "obesity begins to

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:38.780
manifest itself in the female population and
reaches enormous proportions from 30 onwards."

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:44.190
So here's that question asked again. Exactly
the same observation, exactly the same question

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:48.580
30 years later, this time by Benjamin Caballero
of Johns Hopkins.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:57.450
And now, within this paradigm of calories
in, calories out, of overeating. When, when

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:02.180
Richards asked in 1973, he had an open mind.
He didn't know what the answer was. But now

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:07.470
Benjamin Caballero thinks he knows the answer,
which is the answer we all think we know.

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:11.959
And he says, a few years ago, this was in
the New England Journal of Medicine in 2005,

00:17:11.959 --> 00:17:16.350
an article called 'Obesity and Malnutrition:
A Nutrition Paradox'.

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:20.200
He says, "A few years ago, I was visiting
a primary care clinic in the slums of São

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.380
Paulo, Brazil. The waiting room was full of
mothers with thin, stunted young children,

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:25.760
exhibiting the typical signs of chronic under
nutrition. Their appearance, sadly, would

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:32.570
surprise few who visit poor urban areas in
the developing world. What might come as a

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:36.600
surprise is that many of the mothers holding
those under-nourished infants were themselves

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.600
overweight."

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.650
And then he says, "The coexistence of underweight
and overweight poses a challenge to public

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:47.300
health programs, since the aims of programs
to reduce under nutrition" --which is get

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:52.940
people to eat more, make more food available—"are
obviously in conflict with those for obesity

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:57.300
prevention" --which is make less food available.
So we have a problem.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:04.440
And I put this "poses a challenge to public
health programs" in italics because the coexistence

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.991
of underweight and overweight poses a challenge
to your paradigm, your belief system. If you

00:18:08.991 --> 00:18:13.230
believe that the mothers got fat because they
took in more calories than they expended,

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:19.200
they took in superfluous calories that they
didn't need, and the children aren't getting

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:24.360
enough food, then you believe that the mothers
are willing to starve their children to death

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:28.420
so that they can sneak outside and eat a Snickers
bar, in effect.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:32.980
And I don't know how many, this is a young
audience, how many mothers are there in this

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.780
audience? OK. How many of you would do that?

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:36.990
[laughter]

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:42.460
Let your children starve so you can get fat,
as opposed to, perhaps, the other way around,

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:47.980
right? So you've got two paradigms colliding.
We've got our paradigm maternal behavior that

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:54.429
says population, species don't survive unless
the mothers make sacrifices for their children.

00:18:54.429 --> 00:19:00.230
And we have the paradigm of obesity that says
these mothers are just happily guzzling excess

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:03.050
calories while they're watching their kids
starve to death.

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:09.200
And this is an anomalous observation. I used
to, started my career writing about high-energy

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.460
physics, and high-energy physics, they just
built the Large Hadron Collidor at CERN that

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:18.580
costs I forget how many billions of dollars,
all designed to just create an observation

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:22.250
that their theory can't explain so they can
proceed onward.

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:27.710
Here, we've had this observation going back
probably to 1928 at least, and nobody cares.

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:31.880
And my point is you have to throw out one
of the two paradigms. And I'm gonna throw

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:36.230
out the obesity paradigm 'cause my mother--
may she rest in peace-- would have killed

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:41.510
me if I threw out the maternal behavior paradigm.

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:44.870
Let's look at some other inconvenient observations,
Okay?

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:49.840
"Eating less doesn't work." Our hypothesis
is that if we eat more, if we take in more

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:55.090
calories than we expend, we will gain weight.
So the idea is if we take in less calories

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:59.780
than you expend, you'll lose weight. All you
have to do is create what's called "negative

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:06.520
energy balance." So you go on a semi-restricted
calorie diet and there are a lot of meta-analysis

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:11.559
over the years, systematic reviews, showing
how poorly these work.

00:20:11.559 --> 00:20:15.500
The Cochrane Collaboration a few years ago
when they looked at this. The Cochrane Collaboration

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:22.750
is a collaboration created just to do unbiased
reviews of the data. Their assumption being

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:27.309
every other review of the data is biased.
So we have to create the methodology that

00:20:27.309 --> 00:20:31.471
doesn't allow bias to enter into it. And with
this, they put it back in--I think it was

00:20:31.471 --> 00:20:37.679
2002, I can't see my notes, unfortunately,
because we're not in notes mode, here--the

00:20:37.679 --> 00:20:43.900
weight loss achieved, that was 2002. It's
so small as to be clinically insignificant.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:48.220
And what you see in the literature is fascinating
'cause people, they try to deal with this

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:52.179
when they write about obesity; the fact that
eating less doesn’t work. But they believe

00:20:52.179 --> 00:20:54.710
that a calorie-restricted diet is crucial.

00:20:54.710 --> 00:21:02.280
So you'll see these chapters in obesity textbooks,
like the 'Task Force of Obesity', Task Force

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:09.690
textbook, where the researchers will write
that restricting calories is the fundamental

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:17.590
approach, the -- I forget the word they use
because I don't have my notes-- to curing

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:21.870
obesity, yet it rarely, if ever, works.

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:26.920
Exercising more also doesn't work. One of
the problems here, I could also show you meta-analyses

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:33.480
that talk about how clinically insignificant
this effect is. But there's, the best evidence

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:38.610
I found so far for this is the American Heart
Association and the American College of Sports

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:44.510
Medicine in 2007, put out their physical activity
guidelines. And the physical activity guidelines--these

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:50.010
are people, two organizations, that want us
to engage in healthy lifestyles, that believe

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:52.340
that physical activity should make a difference.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:57.640
And you would expect them to spin the data
in favor of physical activity for exercise,

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:02.350
for weight loss--and the way they put it is
this. They said, "It is reasonable to assume

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:07.330
that persons with relatively high daily energy
expenditures would be less likely to gain

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:11.170
weight over time, compared to those who have
low energy expenditures."

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:15.210
That's logically equivalent to saying, "It's
reasonable to assume that if you're a couch

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:20.170
potato and you increase your energy expenditure,
you will be less likely to gain weight than

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:22.970
if you remain a couch potato."

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:27.679
And then they say, "So far, data to support
this hypothesis are not particularly compelling."

00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:33.500
And the point of this is this hypothesis is
in the neighborhood of 100 to 150 years old.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:38.980
There, you could find obesity texts in the
1860s in which somebody like William Banting

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:44.040
talks about his doctor telling him to go for
a row every morning to burn off calories.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:48.710
He also talks about how it didn't help. You
could find in, by the 1890s, when the laws

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:54.100
of thermodynamics [clears throat] had been
shown to hold with animate objects as well

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:58.370
as inanimate objects, with living beings as
well as inanimate objects, researchers said,

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:02.750
"Hey, maybe if we just get people to expend
more energy, they'll gain weight. I mean they'll

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:08.120
lose weight and over the course of a hundred
years, 150 years, this is the best we could

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:12.290
say about it. "The data to support this hypothesis
are not particularly compelling."

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:17.730
And that's a bad sign. When I was writing
about high-energy physics, it was an unwritten

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:22.850
rule of high-energy physics by Pief Panofsky,
who's a founder of the Stanford Linear Accelerator

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:28.060
Center here. And Pief said, "If you throw
money at an effect and it doesn't get bigger,

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:30.230
it means it's not really there." Okay?

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:35.270
And the corollary here is if you've been studying
an effect, for a century and the best you

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:37.190
could say about it is "the data to support
this hypothesis are not particularly compelling",

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:44.720
there's a very good chance that your hypothesis
is wrong; that increasing energy expenditure

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:49.340
and physical activity will have no effect
on how much you weigh, or how much weight

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:50.340
you've gained.

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:56.780
And one way to think about this and to this
I owe a British blogger. Imagine that I'm

00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:03.190
having, I'm hosting a dinner party tonight
and I've got the ten last finalists from Top

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:09.880
Chef cooking. And they're making this amazing
feast and I send you all invitations and I

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:14.320
say, "I've got this feast. It's gonna be a
ton of the best tasting food you've ever eaten

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:22.080
in your life. Come hungry." What would you
do to make sure you came hungry? And here

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.140
I'll take questions. Anyone wanna answer?
What would you do during the day?

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:29.921
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: Skip snacks.

00:24:29.921 --> 00:24:30.921
&gt;&gt;Gary Taubes: Skip snacks, eat less.

00:24:30.921 --> 00:24:32.540
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: I would take
a long walk.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:36.290
&gt;&gt;Gary Taubes: And take a long walk. Exercise
more. You'd work out.

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:40.580
So the exact same things that we prescribe
overweight people to lose weight are the two

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:46.590
things that you're going to do if you wanna
guarantee that you get hungry and eat more.

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:47.900
And we're gonna explain that in a while.

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:53.049
But you can see already that there's something
wrong here. Here's another problem with our

00:24:53.049 --> 00:24:58.580
energy balance idea. Practicing energy balance
is impossible. This is a new phrase you hear.

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:04.410
The past two or three years, the idea there
are now industry programs developed in collaboration

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:08.810
with the government to help you practice energy
balance, to make sure you match calories in

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:10.549
to calories out so you don't gain weight.

00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:14.690
And the industry loves the idea. The food
industry loves the idea of obesity being all

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:19.570
about calories, because you can't demonize
anything. It's all about just it's your fault

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:23.050
if you're overweight. You just have to eat
less and exercise more and if you wanna build

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:26.910
a gym in your neighborhood, or a track or
a park, go to Coke or Pepsi and ask them for

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:30.610
money. They'll give it to you 'cause they
would like you to exercise more so that way,

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:33.110
they can't be blamed for your obesity epidemic.

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:37.740
So, let's see what it takes actually to practice
energy balance. A typical American's food

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:43.150
intake is about 2700 calories a day. Okay?
That's men and women. So that's a million

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:48.990
calories a year. Ten million calories in a
decade, Okay? It's about ten to twelve tons

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:51.250
of food per decade.

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:57.190
Now, all you'd have to do is ask the question.
Let's say, right now, I'm a 25 year old and

00:25:57.190 --> 00:26:04.860
I'm lean and I wanna ask the question, "How
well do I have to maintain energy balance?

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:09.940
How well do I have to practice energy balance
so that I don't gain 20 pounds in a decade,

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:17.330
40 pounds in 20 years, so by the time I'm
in my mid-40s I'm obese?" What is that entail,

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:19.260
because that's what the government is trying
to get us to do.

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:24.780
And the answer is you have to maintain your
energy balance to 20 calories per day. If

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:30.300
over 20 -- this is actually a trick answer,
because if 20 calories per day goes into your

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:36.550
fat tissue that you don't burn, you will gain
40 pounds in 20 years. Here's the calculation.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:38.240
It's pretty simple. Very simple.

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:45.760
Even I could do this and I don't work at Google.
Twenty calories times 365 days a year times

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:50.110
ten years, divided by 35 hundred, which is
the number of calories, roughly, in a pound

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:55.500
of fat. And you end up with 21 pounds in a
decade. Okay? So if you go over that, if you

00:26:55.500 --> 00:27:00.230
can match your energy in to your energy out,
to 20 calories a day and not exceed that on

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:04.290
average, you'll only gain 40 pounds. If you
only want to gain 20 pounds, it's ten calories.

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:08.250
If you don't want to gain any weight, of course,
the idea is you have to do it perfectly.

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:15.419
Twenty calories a day is .8 percent accuracy.
Nobody can do that. Nobody, even I will bet

00:27:15.419 --> 00:27:23.110
my life's income--it's not that big--that
the world champion calorie counter in the

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:27.190
world, Guinness -- if there is such an entry
in Guinness, cannot gauge within 20 calories

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:30.799
how much food they were eating per day and
then you have no idea how much you're expending.

00:27:30.799 --> 00:27:37.210
You're just guessing, even when you go in
to do research sessions. They just do calculations.

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:43.390
So the point here is I got this calculation
from a 1937 Nutrition and Metabolism textbook,

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:47.960
written by a fellow named Eugene Dubois, who's
a leading expert on metabolism in the United

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:53.660
States, pre-World War II. [pause] And Dubois
uses calculations. He said what's interesting

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:59.539
about it is since nobody can do that, how
do we maintain our weight? The question isn't

00:27:59.539 --> 00:28:03.870
why are some of us fat? The question should
be why aren't all of us fat? Okay?

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:08.990
Because if you overshoot by even 20 calories
a day on average, you're gonna end up getting

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:13.950
obese. And you could say, "Okay. Maybe one
way to do it is I just watch my weight. I

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:18.360
look in the mirror. I see I'm getting fatter.
My belt's getting snug, or my pants, or my

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:22.650
skirt doesn't fit. So therefore, I'm gonna
eat less for a while until I get my weight

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:23.650
back."

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:26.370
So you oscillate around perfect energy balance,
but then you have to ask the question, how

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:30.760
do animals do it? Because they don't. They're
not looking in the mirror. They don't have

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:34.820
clothes they're putting on. So how do they
maintain their weight and virtually all animals

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:39.110
do? They don't get chronically obese. So the
idea that Dubois says it's obviously something

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:43.510
else is going on here, other than consciously
matching calories in to calories out, which

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:44.910
none of us can do.

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:51.070
So let's look at some other inconvenient observations.

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:54.990
Genetics is one of them. I gotta apologize
now. If you go to an obesity textbook today,

00:28:54.990 --> 00:29:00.169
you will not see photos of naked human beings.
But if you go to an obesity textbook pre-

00:29:00.169 --> 00:29:04.820
World War II, you would. Because those researchers,
those clinicians, thought you could learn

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:09.480
a lot about watching how people fatten, as
well as just whether they do or not.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:14.090
And one of the things I'm doing now is just
channeling these pre-World War II researchers.

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:20.470
And in fact, all I'm saying in my books is
I'm taking the theory that German and Austrian

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:25.000
researchers developed pre-World War II, back
when the Germans and Austrians did the best

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.850
medical research in the world and there was
virtually no meaningful medical research being

00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:31.400
done in the United States.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:36.960
And I'm taking that theory and I'm updating
it. Okay? Because they didn't survive the

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:42.270
war. That community didn't survive the war.
So, for starters, here's genetics. And there's

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:50.030
a pair -- and this comes from a 1940 textbook.
Here's a pair of lean identical twins. Here's

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:55.190
a pair of obese identical twins. Our overeating
hypothesis might explain why these women are

00:29:55.190 --> 00:30:00.350
fatter than these women. These took in too
many calories and these practiced perfect

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:01.570
energy balance.

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:05.540
But what about this combination? Why do they
have the same body type? And why do they have

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:09.450
the same body type? It's been known since
the 1930s that obesity has a strong genetic

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:14.070
component. Identical twins – it's not that
their faces look alike. Their body types are

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:16.160
the same, too. So what's going on here?

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:21.530
What do these genes determine? Do they determine
exactly how much these women, how many forkfuls

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:27.000
of food these women overate over 20, 30, 40
years? And exactly how long they sat on a

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.160
couch versus going for a walk?

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:34.650
Or, did they determine something else about
how much and where they accumulated fat 'cause

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:37.610
they have the identical body?

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:41.330
Here's a different variation of an animal
husbandry and it's even easier to see here

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:46.580
what I'm talking about. Farmers, livestock
breeders, have been breeding more or less

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:54.539
fatty cows, pigs, sheep, for centuries, probably.
And here's a particularly fat breed of beef

00:30:54.539 --> 00:30:59.380
cattle. This is an Aberdeen Angus. Here's
the meat. I should say it's stocky, but you

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:07.890
can see all the subcutaneous fat, the intramuscular
fat, here. And here's a lean species, a lean

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:12.580
breed of cattle, the Jersey Cow. And you can
see the ribs showing, you can see the swollen

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.550
udder. It's definitely a dairy cow.

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:18.419
And you can ask yourself simply, there are
different breeds. Obviously, different genes

00:31:18.419 --> 00:31:22.160
are determining how much they get fat. What
exactly is going on here? What are these genes

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:27.870
determining? Do they determine how much these
animals eat and exercise? Do they determine

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:35.809
how many calories per graze, or per bite of
grass, this cow takes? The Aberdeen Angus

00:31:35.809 --> 00:31:41.090
grazes for 12 hours. The Jersey only grazes
for ten a day. Does the Jersey want to go

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:47.880
to work out? So, on the Far Side cartoon when
it gets dark at night, the Jersey goes for

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:53.130
a jog. The Aberdeen Angus goes in and watches
television. And it's obviously absurd, Okay?

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:56.990
Whatever determines how much these animals
get fat, we can be confident that how much

00:31:56.990 --> 00:32:02.040
they eat and exercise has nothing to do with
it. More likely, and again, this is a beef

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:07.760
cow. So what you want is it's an effectively,
brutally speaking and I apologize for the

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:16.470
vegetarians here, to the vegetarians here.
It's a machine that takes in fuel here and

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:19.929
deposits it here and you want it all to go
here.

00:32:19.929 --> 00:32:24.640
So you could assume that it just partitions
the calories it eats into fat and protein.

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:29.970
And the Jersey Cow, you want to create milk.
So you take in the fuel and it's all gonna

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:34.730
go to the udders to produce milk. And you
don't want it wasting energy, in effect, bulking

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:39.640
up. So maybe what these genes determine is
not how many calories we take in, but how

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:43.590
we partition the fuel we take in.

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:48.870
That's a technical term. Sexual variations.
Men and women fatten differently, Okay? Men

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:52.881
fatten above the waist. Women fatten below
the waist. Both these people would have had

00:32:52.881 --> 00:32:57.809
to overeat, take in more calories than they
expend to get fat. This has doubled his risk

00:32:57.809 --> 00:33:01.919
of heart disease. This has not doubled her
risk. If the weight's below the waist, it

00:33:01.919 --> 00:33:05.410
doesn't double your risk. What do the calories
have to do with it?

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:09.720
Okay? And what do the calories have to do
with where they get fat, because obviously,

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:14.299
that's a huge component of it. And another
way to look at it is puberty. Men and women,

00:33:14.299 --> 00:33:20.669
when they go through puberty, boys, they begin
puberty with roughly the same amount of body

00:33:20.669 --> 00:33:25.510
fat. When boys go through puberty, they lose
fat and gain muscle. When girls go through

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:29.370
puberty, they gain fat and breasts and hips
and buttocks.

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:34.080
And by the time they're out of puberty, the
girls have about 50 percent more fat on their

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:39.080
bodies than the men. Both boys and girls got
bigger. So they both overate. They both took

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:43.890
in more calories than they expend, but the
boys lost fat and gained muscle. The girls

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:44.890
gained fat in specific places.

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:49.560
So you just ask the question, what do the
calories have to do with it? What did the

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:55.400
fact of their overeating have to do with whether
or not they gained muscle or fat? And this

00:33:55.400 --> 00:34:03.260
is obviously controlled by sex and growth
hormones and that's an issue we'll get to.

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:08.899
Now, lipidystrophies. This is again, from
the same 1940 textbook, which took it from

00:34:08.899 --> 00:34:13.110
a 1933 German text book. This is a lipidystrophy
called a progressive lipidystrophy. In the

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:19.079
1950s, there were about 200 of these on record.
Most of them were in women. It's called progressive

00:34:19.079 --> 00:34:24.200
'cause these cases, they begin losing all
subcutaneous fat in the face, in their forehead,

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:26.469
and it moves downward with time.

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:31.190
One British physician reported that his patient
lost fat at about one inch a year. That's

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:35.469
why it's progressive. And then it usually
stops above the hips. And then they often

00:34:35.469 --> 00:34:40.659
get this lower body, localized obesity below
the waist. So the way these Europeans asked

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:46.599
it, they said, "Are we gonna blame the top
half on under eating and bottom half on overeating?"

00:34:46.599 --> 00:34:47.599
[laughter]

00:34:47.599 --> 00:34:52.010
Right? And this is again, obviously absurd.
It's like a Gedanken Experiment. But if this

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:56.859
woman had ten pounds more fat on her upper
body, maybe even five pounds, just to smooth

00:34:56.859 --> 00:35:02.569
out her curves, her BMI was about 32 already
just cause of her lower body obesity. And

00:35:02.569 --> 00:35:07.059
she went into the doctor then. The doctor
wouldn't recognize the lipidystrophy. And

00:35:07.059 --> 00:35:10.430
he would just say, "Look, eat less and exercise
more."

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:17.160
And the point that the Europeans are making
is if you can't explain the localized conditions

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:21.420
by under eating and overeating, why would
you even think to explain the generalized

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:25.680
obesity by overeating? Or, in those cases,
often these textbooks, pre-World War II were

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:30.829
titled 'Obesity and Leanness' because they
were looking at cases that today we would

00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:35.859
call anorexia and assuming that that also
wasn't an under eating problem. It was some

00:35:35.859 --> 00:35:38.839
problem of how the fat tissue was regulated.

00:35:38.839 --> 00:35:42.769
So why do we believe this? And let's look
at a little physics here, Okay? And this is

00:35:42.769 --> 00:35:46.640
the reason.

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:50.380
[pause]

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:54.549
We believe it 'cause of the first law of thermodynamics.
Every time somebody like me makes this point

00:35:54.549 --> 00:35:59.779
for the past 50, 60 years, you get accused
of not believing that thermodynamics holds

00:35:59.779 --> 00:36:00.789
for human beings.

00:36:00.789 --> 00:36:06.019
I had one of the high points of my life. I
was on the Larry King Show after 'Good Calories,

00:36:06.019 --> 00:36:10.950
Bad Calories' came out. And they had Jillian
Michaels, the trainer from 'The Biggest Loser',

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:15.479
come on. And she gave me a lecture on the
laws of thermodynamics on national television.

00:36:15.479 --> 00:36:17.799
And I have a physics degree from Harvard.

00:36:17.799 --> 00:36:18.799
[laughter]

00:36:18.799 --> 00:36:23.809
I mean, I was a, I was a lousy student, but
it was definitely, I literally, I'm sitting

00:36:23.809 --> 00:36:28.329
next to. I just, I didn't respond. If you
watch the show, it's on, you can Google it.

00:36:28.329 --> 00:36:31.489
I didn't know what to say. I mean, how do
I respond to this?

00:36:31.489 --> 00:36:36.760
So lemme give you a little, thermodynamics
is pretty simple. The first law of thermodynamics

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:40.469
-- it's the law of energy conservation. It
says a change in energy in a system--this

00:36:40.469 --> 00:36:43.819
is the simplest possible way to put it-- is
equal to the energy in minus energy out. All

00:36:43.819 --> 00:36:48.099
it's saying is you can't create energy from
thin air.

00:36:48.099 --> 00:36:52.950
So, if a system gets bigger, delta E goes
up. And it's gotta take in more energy than

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:56.880
it expends. And if a system gets smaller,
it's got to expend more energy than it takes

00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:02.200
in. For our sake, we'll make delta E the fat
mass E in is energy consumed, E out energy

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:06.729
expended. So change in fat mass equals energy
consumed minus energy expended.

00:37:06.729 --> 00:37:12.979
And the problem, the fundamental problem,
and it's almost unbelievable to me, is that

00:37:12.979 --> 00:37:19.200
there's no arrow of causality here. And by
that I mean it doesn't say in any way if energy,

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:23.769
energy consumed greater than energy expended
causes change of fat mass. It just says this

00:37:23.769 --> 00:37:24.900
is the way the universe is.

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:29.965
If a system gets bigger, it takes in more
energy than it expends. And if a system gets

00:37:29.965 --> 00:37:34.680
smaller, it takes in less. It says nothing
about what causes it. And to understand that,

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:39.029
a metaphor I could use. Like, let's assume
I was asking the question why is this room

00:37:39.029 --> 00:37:41.749
crowded right now? Okay?

00:37:41.749 --> 00:37:45.489
And it's as similar when we're talking about
fat mass. We wanna know, why is there so much

00:37:45.489 --> 00:37:48.920
energy accumulated in the fat mass? And I
wanna ask the question, why is there so much

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:53.819
energy accumulated in this room in the form
of people? So you ask me, "Gary, why is it

00:37:53.819 --> 00:37:58.319
crowded?" And I say, "Well, because more people
entered than left."

00:37:58.319 --> 00:37:59.319
[pause]

00:37:59.319 --> 00:38:03.599
Right? Have I told you anything meaningful
at all about why this?

00:38:03.599 --> 00:38:04.599
[laughter]

00:38:04.599 --> 00:38:07.910
I mean, of course more people entered than
left. But why is it crowded? And then I say,

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:13.549
"Well, look. If more people enter than leave,
it's gotta get crowded, right?" And I still

00:38:13.549 --> 00:38:14.839
haven't told you anything meaningful.

00:38:14.839 --> 00:38:22.569
This is what magicians would call--I forget
the word--vacuous? It's the equivalent as

00:38:22.569 --> 00:38:26.029
saying, why did you get fat? Because you took
in more energy than you expended. Well, of

00:38:26.029 --> 00:38:31.329
course I took in more energy than I expended.
I got fat. But why did I get fat? And then

00:38:31.329 --> 00:38:35.680
you just turn around and say, "Well, if you
take in more energy than you expend," there's

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:39.819
no arrow of causality. There's nothing meaningful
here.

00:38:39.819 --> 00:38:45.960
This is a mistake that was made occasionally
prior to the Second World War. It became ubiquitous

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:50.299
after the Second World War. Whenever we tell
someone, "You got fat 'cause you overate,"

00:38:50.299 --> 00:38:55.660
you are misinterpreting the laws of thermodynamics
on an eighth grade mathematics level.

00:38:55.660 --> 00:39:00.359
And the more I talk about it, the more it's
almost unbelievable that this ever happened.

00:39:00.359 --> 00:39:04.489
And yet, it did. And so there's another way
you could play with this thermodynamics. And

00:39:04.489 --> 00:39:09.369
for this I owe University of Washington grad
student named Sonya Trejo, who said, "What

00:39:09.369 --> 00:39:11.950
happens if you start transposing elements?"

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:16.809
So how about this. Instead of, we had delta
E over here and E out over here. How about

00:39:16.809 --> 00:39:20.940
if we say energy out is equal to energy in
minus delta E? And so now, the energy expended

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:24.569
is equal to energy consumed minus change in
fat mass, Okay?

00:39:24.569 --> 00:39:29.960
So if fat mass gets bigger -- for we don't
know why, we're working on that -- and the

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:35.880
person doesn't eat anymore, then energy expenditure
has to go down. Okay? So you look at it this

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:42.509
way and an increase in fat mass causes sedentary
behavior. If fat mass gets smaller, energy

00:39:42.509 --> 00:39:44.670
expended has to go up.

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:48.900
So if somebody's losing weight, they have
to get more physically active. Or how about

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:53.309
this one? We just do a little more transposing
and we end up with energy in equals delta

00:39:53.309 --> 00:39:58.200
E plus energy out. So the energy we eat is
equal to change in fat mass plus energy expended.

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:03.569
Let's assume change in fat mass is fixed by
biology. And if you read the New York Times

00:40:03.569 --> 00:40:08.660
today there was an article about that. And
energy expenditure goes up 'cause I just told

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:13.380
you to work out. What's gonna happen to energy
consumed? It has to go up. You're gonna get

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.230
hungry. You will work up an appetite.

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:19.950
This used to be something that everyone believed
in the 1960s and beyond. There used to be

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:24.700
this term, "working up an appetite." So it
used to be, if you worked out, you worked

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:28.230
up an appetite. Now if you work out, you're
supposed to lose weight and energy consumed

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:32.880
is supposed to stay fixed. But there's no
guarantee this'll happen.

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:39.089
So here's the alternative hypothesis. This
is the way that the pre-World War II Europeans

00:40:39.089 --> 00:40:44.380
thought about it. They said, started from
first principles, obesity is a disorder of

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:46.130
excess fat accumulation.

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:52.469
So today, you read obesity is a positive energy
balance, or obesity is an energy balance problem

00:40:52.469 --> 00:40:56.469
and those are assumptions. They just started
at the beginning. Having too much fat is a

00:40:56.469 --> 00:41:00.739
disorder of having too much fat. So it's not
energy balance. It's not overeating. It's

00:41:00.739 --> 00:41:04.789
not sedentary behavior. And if you ask it
this way, the next question you're likely

00:41:04.789 --> 00:41:09.180
to ask, which we'll get to, is what regulates
fat accumulation? Because what we know is

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:10.180
there's too much fat.

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:14.539
Like, if I was standing in here with Yao Ming,
whose seven feet six inches tall, and we wanted

00:41:14.539 --> 00:41:18.719
to know why he grew to be seven foot six,
we wouldn't care that he was in positive energy

00:41:18.719 --> 00:41:22.680
balance. We would want to know what regulates
growth, right. So we wanna know what regulates

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:27.359
growth. So, by this hypothesis, overeating
and inactivity are compensatory effects. They're

00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:28.739
not causes.

00:41:28.739 --> 00:41:33.029
And the way it was put to me by several different
individuals doing animal research, so we don't

00:41:33.029 --> 00:41:38.660
get fat because we overeat. We overeat because
our fat tissue is accumulating excess fat.

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:42.390
Overeating is a given. If you're getting fatter,
you have to take in more calories than you

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:49.690
consume. But we're saying the positive energy
balance is in effect.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:53.970
Here's a way to see it. This comes from the,
again, straight out of the pre World War II

00:41:53.970 --> 00:42:01.779
text. Although the child is mine, I use these
photos 'cause he's so cute. He was. Here he

00:42:01.779 --> 00:42:09.200
was one year old, 20 pounds. Okay? 2006. Here
he is 2009, 45 pounds. He's gained 25 pounds

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:13.130
in three years, right? He's been in positive
energy balance. He has overeaten.

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:14.130
[laughter]

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:18.789
He's taken in more calories than expended.
But he did not take in, he did not grow because

00:42:18.789 --> 00:42:25.910
he overate. He overate because he was growing.
He grew cause he was secreting growth hormone.

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:31.309
And the growth hormone sparked his tissues
to grow muscle, organs, fat, bone. And he

00:42:31.309 --> 00:42:36.890
had to take in more calories than he expended
to fuel that growth. And if he wasn't growing

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:41.450
fast enough, we might have even given him
more growth hormone to speed his growth, at

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:44.680
which point that would have created even more
positive energy balance.

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:50.510
Here's a gruesome analogy: cancer. Here's
a tumor. You can barely see it. Then it's

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:55.309
growing at Day 10. It's growing at Day 20.
It's bigger and bigger. This tumor is in positive

00:42:55.309 --> 00:43:01.700
energy balance; nobody cares. We care if we
want to starve it to death, but that's a given.

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:06.109
Like, just if we don't want this room to get
crowded, we'll shut the doors before anyone

00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:11.880
comes in. But what we care about is what genes,
what hormones are disruptive that drive the

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:15.619
growth because the positive energy balance
is in effect.

00:43:15.619 --> 00:43:21.549
And in every other example in nature, positive
energy balance is always an effect of growth,

00:43:21.549 --> 00:43:23.230
not the other way around.

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:27.349
So, this was a German-Austrian hypothesis
prior to World War II. It was known as the

00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:33.719
lipophilia hypothesis. I'll explain that in
a second. The primary proponents where Gustav

00:43:33.719 --> 00:43:39.730
von Bergmann, who was a German specialist
in internal medicine. Today the highest award

00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:44.200
in the German Association of Internal Medicine
is the Gustav von Bergmann Award.

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:49.950
And then Julius Bauer, who was a geneticist
and endocrinologist at the University of Vienna,

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:54.959
Bauer was very famous in Austria. If you have
any molecular biology or genetics friends

00:43:54.959 --> 00:44:00.559
in Austria, email them and say, "Have you
ever heard of Julius Bauer?" And they'll probably

00:44:00.559 --> 00:44:01.559
say, "Oh, yeah. Absolutely."

00:44:01.559 --> 00:44:06.650
And the theory was more or less fully accepted
in Europe by 1940. This comes from the 1940

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:12.209
textbook. And the problem was 1940 was a bad
year for Europe. So, the German and Austrian

00:44:12.209 --> 00:44:19.641
medical research communities evaporate. Unlike
in physics, where we, we embraced all the

00:44:19.641 --> 00:44:23.670
European physicists who got chased out of
Europe because we had atomic bombs to build

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:28.539
and hydrogen bombs and a Cold War to fight.
In medicine and public health, we didn't.

00:44:28.539 --> 00:44:33.869
So Julius Bauer ended up working in Hollywood,
California for the Hospital of Medical Evangelists

00:44:33.869 --> 00:44:38.160
and publishing articles that just said, "Julius
Bauer, Hollywood, California," and nobody

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:42.880
took his work seriously, although his son
became Dean of the USC Medical School.

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:48.500
So here's lipophilia in a nutshell. The idea
is lipophilia means 'love of fat'. Okay. The

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:54.380
way these people saw it, is that some tissues
are more or less predisposed to accumulate

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:59.239
fat, in the same way that, you can think of
it, we grow hair in some places and not in

00:44:59.239 --> 00:45:00.239
others.

00:45:00.239 --> 00:45:03.579
And we get fat in some place and not in others.
So we don't tend to get fat on our foreheads

00:45:03.579 --> 00:45:09.001
or the back of our hands, but we put in fat
on our guts, under our chins. And so they

00:45:09.001 --> 00:45:13.940
said maybe fat is just like hair. And so,
some people are hairier than others, just

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:15.720
like some people are fatter than others.

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:20.140
When men start losing their hair, we don't
accuse them of under eating because they're

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:23.839
losing weight. We know that there's a lot
of different issues involved.

00:45:23.839 --> 00:45:28.059
So Bauer put it like this. He said, "Like
a malignant tumor or like the fetus, the uterus

00:45:28.059 --> 00:45:33.339
or the breasts of a pregnant woman, the abnormal
lipophilic tissue seizes on foodstuffs, even

00:45:33.339 --> 00:45:37.819
in the case of under nutrition. It maintains
its stock, and may increase it independent

00:45:37.819 --> 00:45:41.779
of the requirements of the organism. A sort
of anarchy exists; the adipose tissue lives

00:45:41.779 --> 00:45:46.359
for itself and does not fit into the precisely
regulated management of the whole organism."

00:45:46.359 --> 00:45:50.900
And this phrase, "even in the case of under
nutrition," begins to tell us why these women

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:56.299
could get obese in a population where their
children are starving because it didn't matter

00:45:56.299 --> 00:46:01.339
how little food there was. If there was something
driving their accumulation of fat, they were

00:46:01.339 --> 00:46:02.339
gonna get fat anyway.

00:46:02.339 --> 00:46:07.650
So when you look at animal models of obesity,
which you can, what you'll find--what I found--was

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:14.249
they all fall into two categories. Either,
well, let me just explain. If you have an

00:46:14.249 --> 00:46:19.140
animal model of obesity, how do you want to
test what's driving it, like a genetic model,

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:26.739
a surgical model. You could lesion the ventromedial
hypothalamus for rat and it'll get obese and

00:46:26.739 --> 00:46:31.420
eat voraciously. So you'll see voracious eating
and obesity. And you wanna know which causes

00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:32.420
which.

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:38.329
Did this regulation of fat tissue cause what's
called hyperphasia? Or did the hyperphasia

00:46:38.329 --> 00:46:42.719
cause the accumulation of fat? So what you
do, is you just do the experiment and then

00:46:42.719 --> 00:46:46.450
you put the animals on a diet and see whether
they get fat anyway. Okay?

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:50.479
And what you'll find for every animal model
of obesity is they will get obese anyway,

00:46:50.479 --> 00:46:55.529
even if you put them on a diet. You can, in
some cases, starve them.

00:46:55.529 --> 00:47:00.839
There's a genetic strain of mice that M.R.C.
Greenwood studied in the early 1980s, when

00:47:00.839 --> 00:47:06.309
she put these animals on a diet from the moment
they were weaned and they became more obese.

00:47:06.309 --> 00:47:12.760
They became fatter than their lean control
than their genetic controls, even though they

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:18.180
were on a diet their whole life. They actually
weighed less. Their organs were smaller. Their

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:22.329
muscle tissue was smaller and they had more
fat. And in effect, their drive to accumulate

00:47:22.329 --> 00:47:27.900
fat was, in order to do that they cannibalized
their organs and their brain.

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:34.729
And Jean Meyer, a Tufts nutritionist who played
a large role in this, usually to the detriment

00:47:34.729 --> 00:47:39.829
of society. The way he put it, he studied
a genetic strain of mice. He said, "These

00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:43.559
mice will make fat out of their food under
the most unlikely circumstances, even when

00:47:43.559 --> 00:47:49.219
half-starved." Okay? So it's not that these
mice got fat because they ate too much. They

00:47:49.219 --> 00:47:52.359
got fat if you let them eat anything basically.

00:47:52.359 --> 00:47:56.529
And we're gonna propose, again, that the same
thing's happening in humans. So here's some

00:47:56.529 --> 00:47:59.390
obvious questions. Why vertical growth but
not horizontal?

00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:05.099
When we look at children, we know that overeating
is the effect. Growth is the cause. Why animals

00:48:05.099 --> 00:48:12.690
but not man? An animal's model of obesity,
when you break the gene, you intervene surgically.

00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:18.029
There are even dietary models. What you're
doing is disregulating the fat tissue. You're

00:48:18.029 --> 00:48:19.779
not making the animals eat too much.

00:48:19.779 --> 00:48:24.079
And then the question, if obesity is sort
of excess fat accumulation, what regulates

00:48:24.079 --> 00:48:29.170
fat accumulation? So here's a regulation of
fat. Adiposity 101. If you learn this, you'll

00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:36.480
know more than your doctors do. [pause] By
the way, what gets me is that again, it's

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:40.719
2011. I lecture in medical schools. I lecture
to obesity research centers.

00:48:40.719 --> 00:48:45.160
And I'm telling them, it's like I'm telling
them something new. I mean, they don't learn

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:49.910
this in medical school but they forgot it.
But when it comes to the relevance of obesity,

00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:55.349
or why we get fat, the idea that your fat
tissue is regulated and has anything to say

00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:58.180
about this, it's considered radical and quackish.
Okay?

00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:03.789
And the point I'm making is any other growth
problem, like I said, from cancer to height

00:49:03.789 --> 00:49:07.400
to anything, all you're gonna care about is
what hormones, what enzymes, are driving growth.

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:12.230
So let's care about it here, too. And what
you learn is fat is stored as triglycerides

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:16.130
in your fat tissue. Here's a triglyceride.
Its three fatty acids bound together by a

00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:22.059
glycerol molecule. Fatty acids are burned
for fuel and the fat enters and exits the

00:49:22.059 --> 00:49:27.650
cell as these fatty acids. And the reason
that is, is because the triglycerides themselves

00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:32.359
are too big to fit in and out of the cell
to get through the cell membrane of the fat

00:49:32.359 --> 00:49:33.359
tissue.

00:49:33.359 --> 00:49:37.250
So, the fatty acids enter the fat tissue.
And then they're bound together inside the

00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:42.599
fat tissue into a triglyceride and as a triglyceride,
it's fixed in the fat tissue. It's that simple.

00:49:42.599 --> 00:49:44.099
It's too big to get it out.

00:49:44.099 --> 00:49:48.390
And if you wanna get it out, you have to break
it down into its component parts again. So

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:54.430
the fatty acids can get out. So, it's a very
simple mechanism for storing fat. Here it

00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:59.349
is in a, in a diagram. Here's fatty acids
outside the cell. They pass through the fat

00:49:59.349 --> 00:50:04.699
cell membrane. Inside the cell, there's this
triglyceride fatty acid cycle. So the fatty

00:50:04.699 --> 00:50:10.259
acids are bound to an activated glycerol molecule
and you'll have a triglyceride. And as a triglyceride,

00:50:10.259 --> 00:50:14.079
they're fixed in the fat cell. And then they
break down.

00:50:14.079 --> 00:50:18.059
There's a hormone, several hormones; a primary
one called hormone sensitive lipase, which

00:50:18.059 --> 00:50:22.690
breaks down the triglycerides into the fatty
acids and then they can escape again.

00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:27.830
So, here's where we care about energy in minus
energy out. You will get fatter if more fat

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:32.359
enters your fat tissue than leaves. And you
will get leaner if more fatty acids leave

00:50:32.359 --> 00:50:36.829
your fat tissue than enter it. And what we
wanna know is what determines this balance

00:50:36.829 --> 00:50:43.160
of fatty acids going in versus fatty acids
going out. It's that simple.

00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:48.940
So here it is, circa 2010. I could've used
the same diagram from the mid-1960s, 'cause

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:53.240
this was figured out by the mid-1960s. Unfortunately
the Germans and Austrians weren't around by

00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:58.619
then. We required two technologies to do it;
a way to measure fatty acids in the bloodstream,

00:50:58.619 --> 00:51:02.760
a way to measure hormones accurately. By 1960,
it was done.

00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:07.609
And by 1961, it was clear that insulin, the
hormone insulin, is a principle regulator

00:51:07.609 --> 00:51:12.209
of fat metabolism. This is Rosalyn Yalow and
Solomon Berson who invented the radioimmunoassay

00:51:12.209 --> 00:51:17.970
for measuring hormones. Yalow won the Nobel
Prize for it. Berson had died by then.

00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:23.890
And you could see when it comes to white fat
tissue, here's fat storage. Here's fat mobilization.

00:51:23.890 --> 00:51:29.099
TAG is triglycerides. And so you just ask,
you know the little pluses show that it up

00:51:29.099 --> 00:51:30.099
regulates it.

00:51:30.099 --> 00:51:34.290
And the only hormone this particular author
is interested in in metabolic regulation is

00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:39.470
insulin. It up regulates here. It up regulates
there. It up regulates here, it up regulates

00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:43.970
here. It down, it suppresses fat mobilization
and then there's some role from other hormones

00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:50.299
in increasing fat mobilization. But it's basically
insulin that puts fat in the fat tissue and

00:51:50.299 --> 00:51:53.930
it's insulin that suppresses fat mobilization.

00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:59.509
Here, it's putting fat in. Here, it's putting
fat in. Here, it's suppressing it. And release

00:51:59.509 --> 00:52:03.759
of fatty acids, as Yalow and Berson said,
from fat cells requires only the negative

00:52:03.759 --> 00:52:08.130
stimulus of insulin deficiency. So, if you
wanna get insulin, if you wanna get fat out

00:52:08.130 --> 00:52:11.259
of your fat tissue, you have to lower your
insulin levels.

00:52:11.259 --> 00:52:18.999
That's the fundamental thing that the adiposity
101 tells you. So, and what's funny is we've

00:52:18.999 --> 00:52:23.819
known for like, 50 years that insulin is a
fat-producing hormone. This is Best and Best

00:52:23.819 --> 00:52:28.650
of the Banting and Best who discovered insulin.
The fact that insulin increases the formation

00:52:28.650 --> 00:52:30.469
of fat has been obvious ever since the first
emaciated daughter diabetic patient demonstrated

00:52:30.469 --> 00:52:39.739
a fine pad of fat tissue, made as a result
of treatment with the hormone. This is insulin

00:52:39.739 --> 00:52:40.739
and fat stored.

00:52:40.739 --> 00:52:45.219
This is a 2001 textbook, Endocrinology 101,
and here's a young woman who basically, she

00:52:45.219 --> 00:52:49.789
was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when she
was something like 17 years old. And for the

00:52:49.789 --> 00:52:55.010
next 47 years, she injected herself with her
insulin in two spots on her thighs. And she

00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:59.119
ended up with these huge fat masses. In this
picture in the textbook, the caption is "the

00:52:59.119 --> 00:53:04.029
overall action of insulin on the adipocyte,
the fat cell, was to stimulate fat storage

00:53:04.029 --> 00:53:05.680
and inhibit mobilization.

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:11.099
That's the remarkable effects of locally injected
insulin on the accumulation of fat into fat

00:53:11.099 --> 00:53:16.230
cells are graphically illustrated here." That's
what happens when you raise insulin levels.

00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:20.869
So here's the bottom line. When insulin is
secreted or chronically elevated, fat accumulates

00:53:20.869 --> 00:53:25.769
in the fat tissue. When insulin levels drop,
fat escapes from the fat tissue and the fat

00:53:25.769 --> 00:53:31.490
depots shrink. And we secrete insulin primarily
in response to the carbohydrates in our diet.

00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:37.719
This is how George Cahill, he was a Harvard
diabetes specialist, who co-authored in 1965,

00:53:37.719 --> 00:53:46.269
a 500 page handbook of adipose tissue, metabolism;
co-edited. It was put out by the American

00:53:46.269 --> 00:53:50.180
Physiological Society. They wanted to take
this science of fat metabolism and make it

00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:54.410
available to the people who didn't read biochemistry
and physiology textbooks.

00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:58.670
And as Cahill put it to me, "Carbohydrate
is driving insulin is driving fat." That is

00:53:58.670 --> 00:54:03.130
basically the message in that textbook. And
the interesting thing is you can take out

00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:08.359
"is driving insulin" and get "carbohydrate
is driving fat." It's logically equivalent.

00:54:08.359 --> 00:54:12.641
So, and when I give this lecture at medical
schools, it's really funny 'cause I could

00:54:12.641 --> 00:54:16.269
watch the audience and I see, "Oh, wait a
minute. Geez, He used that word 'carbohydrate'.

00:54:16.269 --> 00:54:21.199
That means this is that Atkins crap." And
the doctors immediately shut down. They've

00:54:21.199 --> 00:54:29.180
been with me up until then, up until now.
And then they start thinking "Fad Diet Alert!"

00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:33.180
Not all carbohydrates are equally fattening.
If you care about the underlying science,

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:37.680
the key words, you have the high glycemic
index carbs are fattening, the easily digestible

00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:44.220
carbs, the base of the food guide pyramid,
bread, cereal, rice, and pasta. We break those

00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:49.529
carbs down easily. They get glucose into the
bloodstream. You get insulin spikes from them.

00:54:49.529 --> 00:54:56.670
And then, sugar. Sugar is a unique case. Sucrose,
high fructose corn syrup. It's half glucose,

00:54:56.670 --> 00:55:00.989
half fructose, for all intents and purposes.
We metabolize the fructose in our livers.

00:55:00.989 --> 00:55:06.859
And it's quite likely that sugars, as I wrote
in the New York Times magazine article a few

00:55:06.859 --> 00:55:12.150
weeks ago, are the fundamental cause of this
condition insulin resistance, which then makes

00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:14.319
all carbohydrates bad.

00:55:14.319 --> 00:55:21.209
So the question is should this be surprising?
This idea that carbohydrates are inherently

00:55:21.209 --> 00:55:26.940
fattening. And the answer is, well, it wasn't
up until 1960. In the 1820s, when a Frenchman

00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:32.840
named Anthelme Brillat-Savarin wrote what
was then, has been for many years, the single

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:36.670
most famous book ever written about food,
'The Physiology of Taste'. Brillat-Savarin

00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:42.719
basically said after 500 conversations with
stout, exceedingly stout people, it was fairly

00:55:42.719 --> 00:55:47.829
clear that the cause of obesity was a genetic
predisposition to fatten. Plus, starches,

00:55:47.829 --> 00:55:53.049
what he called farinaceous foods, and sugar
made everything worse. And for the next 140

00:55:53.049 --> 00:55:57.509
years, the conventional wisdom in this country
and elsewhere was that carbohydrates make

00:55:57.509 --> 00:56:02.719
you fat. This was the first line of a British
Journal of Nutrition article in 1963, written

00:56:02.719 --> 00:56:08.010
by the two, one of two most prominent British
dieticians, "Every woman knows that carbohydrates

00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:12.569
are fattening, this is a piece of common knowledge,
which a few nutritionists would dispute."

00:56:12.569 --> 00:56:17.279
Dr. Spock's 'Baby and Child Care', which was
the Bible of child-raising in our country

00:56:17.279 --> 00:56:22.990
from the 1946, the first edition, to the end
of the century. This one sentence was in every,

00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:28.030
single edition. "The amount of plain, starchy
food, cereals, breads, potatoes taken is what

00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:31.779
determines, in the case of most people, how
much weight they gain or lose."

00:56:31.779 --> 00:56:37.420
If you went to a hospital in the 1940s and
1950s and were obese, this is the kind of

00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:41.880
diet they would put you on. I could've shown
the same diet from Harvard Medical School,

00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:44.890
from Stanford Medical School, from Cornell
Med School.

00:56:44.890 --> 00:56:50.309
This is actually from 'The Practice of Endocrinology',
a British textbook written by Raymond Greene,

00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:55.119
who was the brother of Graham Greene and the
most influential British endocrinologist of

00:56:55.119 --> 00:57:00.039
the mid-20th Century. Foods to be avoided:
bread and everything made with flour, cereals,

00:57:00.039 --> 00:57:04.999
potatoes, foods containing much sugar, all
sweets. And you can eat as much as you like

00:57:04.999 --> 00:57:09.180
of the following foods: meat, fish, birds,
all green vegetables, eggs, cheese, fruit

00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:14.729
except bananas and grapes. These foods are
fattening. You limit them. These foods you

00:57:14.729 --> 00:57:15.940
can eat as much as you like cause they literally
do not make you fat.

00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:21.390
It's not about calories. It's about the effect
of the food on the hormones that regulate

00:57:21.390 --> 00:57:27.869
fat accumulation, insulin. So here are the
conclusions. Biology, not physics. This is

00:57:27.869 --> 00:57:32.930
a biological problem. The laws of thermodynamics
have nothing to do with it, no more than the

00:57:32.930 --> 00:57:38.740
laws of relativity do. Obesity disorder, fat
accumulation, not energy balanced, not overeating

00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:43.699
and sedentary behavior. Fat accumulation is
regulated fundamentally by insulin and dietary

00:57:43.699 --> 00:57:47.660
carbohydrates. Carbohydrates driving insulin
is driving fat.

00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:52.180
And the only non-pharmaceutical remedy is
to restrict or remove the causative agent,

00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:55.079
carbohydrates. Now, here's the problem.

00:57:55.079 --> 00:58:02.130
If you lower the carbohydrate content of the
diet, but you keep calories high because it's

00:58:02.130 --> 00:58:06.789
not about calories and you wanna make sure
the person has enough calories to fuel, to

00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:10.029
run their body and if you're obese or you're
overweight, you need a lot of fuel 'cause

00:58:10.029 --> 00:58:11.759
you have a big body.

00:58:11.759 --> 00:58:16.529
If you lower the carb content and keep calories
high, you raise the fat content. So, you end

00:58:16.529 --> 00:58:20.999
up with a high-fat diet. Fat, actually, happens
to be the one nutrient that does not stimulate

00:58:20.999 --> 00:58:23.699
insulin secretion. Protein does.

00:58:23.699 --> 00:58:28.509
So, a healthy diet, if you're overweight and
obese, and I would argue in my books for everyone,

00:58:28.509 --> 00:58:34.519
is a high-fat carbohydrate restricted diet.
Okay. Usually I just added that -- I don't

00:58:34.519 --> 00:58:39.519
go through that, but I've seen what you've
been, what the cafeteria is here feeding.

00:58:39.519 --> 00:58:44.380
It's this low-fat dogma. It's gotta be about
lowering the fat. And it’s not about the

00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:48.799
fat. It’s about the carbohydrates. So, you
can just ask this question, "Where did the

00:58:48.799 --> 00:58:54.049
science go?" And there's two places. First,
the calories in, calories out hypothesis just

00:58:54.049 --> 00:58:55.509
swept it away.

00:58:55.509 --> 00:58:59.969
So, you'll find textbooks today, like 'Principles
of Biochemistry', Lenningers'. It's sort of

00:58:59.969 --> 00:59:04.839
the seminal biochemistry textbook. This is
the latest edition from a couple years ago.

00:59:04.839 --> 00:59:08.549
What makes fat tissue fat? High blood glucose--that's
carbs--elicits the release of insulin, which

00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:14.529
speeds the uptake of glucose by tissues, favors
the storage of fuels as glycogen--it's a good

00:59:14.529 --> 00:59:21.380
thing-- and triglycerols--fat, a very bad
thing--while inhibiting fatty acid mobilization.

00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:26.200
What makes people fat? To a first approximation,
obesity is the result of taking in more calories

00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:30.059
in the diet than are expended by the body's
energy-consuming activities. The point I'm

00:59:30.059 --> 00:59:34.069
making is that the same thing that makes your
fat cells fat is what makes you fat.

00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:38.160
Because if you're fat, for the most part,
it's 'cause all your fat cells are too fat.

00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:44.660
And this disconnect, I was interviewing this
British Oxford University fat metabolism specialist,

00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:49.119
who took 15 minutes on the phone explaining
to me all the ways that insulin makes fat

00:59:49.119 --> 00:59:55.099
cells fat. And then got around to people and
evoked this overeating, over nutrition mechanism.

00:59:55.099 --> 01:00:01.029
And the point I made was, why did you suddenly,
you switched mechanisms? You had one mechanism

01:00:01.029 --> 01:00:04.539
for the fat cells and then when you got to
people, you brought in this vague overeating

01:00:04.539 --> 01:00:09.619
thing. And he literally said to me, "I never
thought of that." He's like, in his mid- to

01:00:09.619 --> 01:00:10.619
late- 60s.

01:00:10.619 --> 01:00:14.180
Here's the other thing that happened. In the
1960s, we started to believe that dietary

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:19.449
fat causes heart disease. So when dietary
fat causes heart disease, you remember I just

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:23.150
told you that a carb-restricted diet is a
high-fat diet.

01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:29.089
And so the same year that the American Physiological
Society put out its high-fat diet, its handbook

01:00:29.089 --> 01:00:35.539
of adipose tissue metabolism saying carbohydrates
drive insulin, drive fat. That's the simplified

01:00:35.539 --> 01:00:39.489
eight-word version of a 500 page text.

01:00:39.489 --> 01:00:45.069
The New York Times was already panning carbo-light,
low-carb diets. "New diet decried by nutritionists.

01:00:45.069 --> 01:00:48.349
Its dangers are seen in low carbohydrate intake.
Some of the nation's top nutrition experts

01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:53.019
are concerned at the new popularity of the
low-carbohydrate reducing diet, which one

01:00:53.019 --> 01:00:57.640
of them calls 'nonsense'—'cause you don't
have to restrict calories 'cause it’s not

01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:00.199
about calories—"and another compares to
'mass murder.'"

01:01:00.199 --> 01:01:04.559
This is Jean Meyer, who was the most influential
nutritionist in the country; went on to become

01:01:04.559 --> 01:01:09.829
president of Tufts University. 'Mass murder'
'cause you're giving people high-fat diet.

01:01:09.829 --> 01:01:14.130
So the science says carbohydrates is driving
insulin is driving fat. Cut the carbs out.

01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:17.170
And the nutritionists are saying, "You can't
do that. You're gonna kill people."

01:01:17.170 --> 01:01:21.150
And that's how we've seen it ever since. And
you get to the point by the 1980s when you

01:01:21.150 --> 01:01:26.130
end up with the food guide pyramid because
we believe fats are fattening and we believe

01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:32.009
red meat causes colon cancer, or God knows
what. We're gonna tell an entire nation to

01:01:32.009 --> 01:01:37.890
eat bread, cereal, rice, pasta. And sweets,
weirdly enough, get a free pass 'cause they're

01:01:37.890 --> 01:01:38.890
nonfattening.

01:01:38.890 --> 01:01:44.939
So, Coke, Pepsi, SoBa ice tea, Snapple. There
was actually a theory in the 1980s, you could

01:01:44.939 --> 01:01:49.960
drink as much, you could eat as much any food
you want if it didn't have fat in it. 'Cause

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.520
if it didn't have fat in it, you couldn't
put fat on.

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:58.920
So, [pause] just to wrap up. I've already
gone too long cause I always do.

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:05.640
I started off asking question, why were these
populations fat? Rolf Richards, in 1973, "Most

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:11.259
third world countries have a high carbohydrate
intake as their economic dependence is predominantly

01:02:11.259 --> 01:02:15.630
agricultural, with a heavy dependence on non-dairy
produces. It is conceivable that the ready

01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:19.690
availability of starch in preference to animal
protein, contributing as it must the main

01:02:19.690 --> 01:02:24.219
caloric requirements of these populations,
leads to increased lipogenesis and the development

01:02:24.219 --> 01:02:25.829
of obesity."

01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:30.359
In this country, we took the conventional
wisdom that carbohydrates make you fat.

01:02:30.359 --> 01:02:35.059
And over the course of 20 years, from the
1960s to the 1980s, turned it into the conventional

01:02:35.059 --> 01:02:40.359
wisdom that you grew up with, that carbohydrates
are heart healthy diet foods and it’s the

01:02:40.359 --> 01:02:45.110
fat that makes you fat. And that's why there's
an obesity epidemic. I mean, surely the sugar

01:02:45.110 --> 01:02:47.689
and high fructose corn syrup didn't help.

01:02:47.689 --> 01:02:51.469
And that's why we all have trouble struggling
with our weight 'cause the approach we use

01:02:51.469 --> 01:02:59.539
to cure it--eat less, exercise more and eat
low fat diets--is exactly the wrong thing.

01:02:59.539 --> 01:03:02.949
Basic question is, I'll phrase it the way
it’s usually phrased. What about those Southeast

01:03:02.949 --> 01:03:08.289
Asians who live on low-fat, high carb diets
and don't get fat? And one of the fundamental

01:03:08.289 --> 01:03:12.670
issues here, and actually, this is partially
why I wrote the sugar story in the New York

01:03:12.670 --> 01:03:15.819
Times a couple weeks ago. Basically in the
beginning I showed you populations that ate

01:03:15.819 --> 01:03:19.049
high carb diets that were very poor and were
fat.

01:03:19.049 --> 01:03:23.140
And then there are populations, the Japanese,
the Koreans, the Chinese, elsewhere, the Kitavans

01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:28.759
who eat high carb diets and aren't fat. And
what's the difference, or is it not the carbohydrates?

01:03:28.759 --> 01:03:33.609
And again, what I'm saying it's the high glycemic,
high refined carbs and the sugars. And if

01:03:33.609 --> 01:03:38.679
you look at the populations that don't get
fat, they have, they eat effectively very

01:03:38.679 --> 01:03:43.211
little sugar. So, the Japanese, for instance,
in the 1960s were eating the amount of sugar

01:03:43.211 --> 01:03:50.519
that we were eating in the 1860s. The Kitavans
eat virtually no sugar. The way the research

01:03:50.519 --> 01:03:55.619
will talk about it is these nations don't
have sweet tooths. Sweet teeth?

01:03:55.619 --> 01:03:59.569
So my answer would be, and this is one of
the reasons why I believe it may be necessary,

01:03:59.569 --> 01:04:05.410
sugar may be necessary to trigger this. And
that's what the biochemistry, the science

01:04:05.410 --> 01:04:08.720
suggests today. And once sugar's in the diet
often.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:13.929
One of the interesting things, one of the
suggestions I made in the New York Times magazine

01:04:13.929 --> 01:04:17.489
article was that sugar could actually be the
fundamental cause of cancer.

01:04:17.489 --> 01:04:21.759
So remember, you want to explain observations
and one observation is that Japanese women

01:04:21.759 --> 01:04:29.160
in Japan have relatively very little breast
cancer. And then they come to the United States

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:33.589
and within two generations, you have virtually
the same breast cancer rates as any other

01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:37.749
population. And what could explain this? There's
something happening here that causing it,

01:04:37.749 --> 01:04:42.189
or there's something that's preventing it
in Japan. It's a common observation throughout

01:04:42.189 --> 01:04:47.009
the world. And one of the things I would suggest
is they come here and more sugar gets into

01:04:47.009 --> 01:04:51.609
their diets. And the reason they don't have
it there is because there's such little sugar.

01:04:51.609 --> 01:04:55.359
They don't have insulin resistance and they
don't have all these triggers. But so, the,

01:04:55.359 --> 01:04:58.789
the, no hypothesis to me would be "it's a
sugar."

01:04:58.789 --> 01:05:03.519
You could evoke other hypotheses; the length
of time that the refined carb, in this case,

01:05:03.519 --> 01:05:09.259
rice, or white rice or the grain, had been
in the population. But the sugar is the thing

01:05:09.259 --> 01:05:16.509
that would seem the most obvious.

01:05:16.509 --> 01:05:17.509
[pause]

01:05:17.509 --> 01:05:20.660
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: Hi, I have a couple
of personal questions. You're free to not

01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:23.589
answer them. One is, do you follow this diet
that you recommend?

01:05:23.589 --> 01:05:24.589
&gt;&gt;Gary Taubes: Yeah.

01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:25.589
[laughter]

01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:27.269
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: And what is your
waist size in inches?

01:05:27.269 --> 01:05:28.269
[laughter]

01:05:28.269 --> 01:05:29.499
&gt;&gt;Gary Taubes: My waist size in inches? Well,
the question is, see this is always one of

01:05:29.499 --> 01:05:34.640
the mistakes people make in life. I mean,
I'm OK. Okay? Basically, I have the same body

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:38.781
I had when I was in college. I was a defensive
tackle at Harvard. I was a bad one.

01:05:38.781 --> 01:05:43.769
Actually, I'm 20 pounds less than I was then.
But when you're trying to be a defensive lineman,

01:05:43.769 --> 01:05:49.700
you're trying to be as heavy as you can. It
is actually not important how big I am on

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:55.450
my diet. What would be important is how much
bigger I would be if I added carbohydrates

01:05:55.450 --> 01:05:59.699
back into the diet. That would be the relevant.
Like, I am never, I could starve myself.

01:05:59.699 --> 01:06:03.630
Actually, my good example is my brother. My
brother is a professor of mathematics at Harvard.

01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:09.199
A very smart guy. He was always lean and I
was always thick. He was always, you could

01:06:09.199 --> 01:06:14.109
see when he was seven, you could see his muscles
and his veins and you could see my pot belly.

01:06:14.109 --> 01:06:18.339
And when we grew up, we both ate all the food
we could. As a matter of fact, we ate as fast

01:06:18.339 --> 01:06:22.729
as we could 'cause if I didn't eat fast, he'd
eat it first. He was more physically active.

01:06:22.729 --> 01:06:28.799
Well, he wasn't. He could run longer distances.
I could starve myself to death and never look

01:06:28.799 --> 01:06:29.799
like my brother.

01:06:29.799 --> 01:06:34.509
I will die of starvation before I am as lean
as my brother is 'cause we are physiologically,

01:06:34.509 --> 01:06:41.939
we partition fuel differently. But the question
is what would happen if I added carbs back

01:06:41.939 --> 01:06:46.949
to my diet? Would my waist size be bigger?
Right now, I'm six foot two, 220 pounds. My

01:06:46.949 --> 01:06:49.339
waist size is probably 35.

01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:55.359
When I was in college, I was six foot two,
220 pounds. Actually, and my waist size was

01:06:55.359 --> 01:07:01.699
35. In between I was heavier. Never had the,
never likely to be obese. Although because

01:07:01.699 --> 01:07:11.530
I'm a big guy, my BMI could go over 30. So
for me, well, it might kill me. That's the

01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:12.530
question.

01:07:12.530 --> 01:07:16.619
The question is not whether I'm heavy or light.
The question is am I going to die sooner because

01:07:16.619 --> 01:07:21.189
I ate a lot of saturated fat? And one thing
I don't have time to do in this lecture, I

01:07:21.189 --> 01:07:24.749
do in another lecture. If you actually look
at the clinical trials, which compare high

01:07:24.749 --> 01:07:31.670
fat diets to low fat diets, the way these
have been done over the past decade is basically

01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:36.119
putting people, randomizing people to an Aitkin’s
diet, which is high fat, high saturated fat.

01:07:36.119 --> 01:07:41.400
Eat as much as you want. And a low fat, American
Heart Association, low calorie, restricted

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:47.380
diet. So one diet, you cut fat. You cut saturated
fat. You cut calories. You're eating like,

01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:52.189
skinless chicken breast and lettuce. And the
other diet, you can eat as much as you want.

01:07:52.189 --> 01:07:58.819
So, you're eating eggs and bacon for breakfast
and meat and double cheeseburgers without

01:07:58.819 --> 01:08:02.653
the bun in a sort of iconic Atkins’s thing.
And nobody really sticks to these diets the

01:08:02.653 --> 01:08:03.653
way they should.

01:08:03.653 --> 01:08:08.390
But when the trials are done, what you find
is not only the people on the high fat diet,

01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:13.680
ad lib the eat as much as you want diet, weigh
less. Even though they're told they could

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:18.440
eat as much as they want, their heart disease
risk profile factors improve. And this is

01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:21.089
what actually got me into this subject.

01:08:21.089 --> 01:08:25.750
When I was writing a story for the New York
Times magazine in 2002, I found five of these

01:08:25.750 --> 01:08:30.040
trials that had been done and not been published
yet. And again, if we say, "Let's pretend

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:34.750
this is a science," we have a hypothesis,
we have two of them. One of them is that saturated

01:08:34.750 --> 01:08:39.589
fat causes heart disease and one of them is
that if you eat more you'll get fat. So now,

01:08:39.589 --> 01:08:44.100
I'm gonna put you on a diet that says you
can eat as much as you want and as much saturated

01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:47.480
fat as you want and I recommend you do it.

01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:53.670
Our hypothesis predicts that you will gain
weight and get heart disease. And instead,

01:08:53.670 --> 01:08:59.170
what happened in these trials is these people
lose weight and their heart disease risk factors

01:08:59.170 --> 01:09:04.380
improve. Across the board, everything improves.
So the question then becomes, maybe our hypothesis

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:05.380
is wrong.

01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:06.380
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #3: You answered my
question to some extent. You answered the

01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:09.060
last one, but clarify for personal happiness.

01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:20.140
In the beginning of your talk you spent a
lot of time on genetics and you had the fat

01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:26.120
twins and the skinny twins, and the fat cow
and the skinny cow, and the fat mouse. And

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:27.120
you sort of abandoned that toward the end
of the talk.

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:33.130
So could I infer that everybody has their
genetic predisposition, which they start with

01:09:33.130 --> 01:09:39.440
and their sugar intake regulates them around
that? Or how would you describe it?

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:42.920
&gt;&gt;Gary Taubes: The question is what role does
genetics play when it comes to -- like there's

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:48.780
an obesity epidemic? The experts will tell
you, obviously our genes haven't changed.

01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:53.330
What I'm arguing is again one of the fundamental
observations is that you don't see obesity

01:09:53.330 --> 01:09:58.950
in any animals in the wild. On the East Coast,
where I used to live, there's a deer epidemic.

01:09:58.950 --> 01:10:02.770
There's obviously enough food for all the
deer to overeat. But you don't get fatter

01:10:02.770 --> 01:10:05.440
deer. You get more deer. You don't get obese
deer.

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:10.100
So the question is why do they get fat? Why
do they stay lean, in effect, regardless of

01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:15.170
how much they eat. And actually, it's interesting
for hibernators, for instance. They'll get

01:10:15.170 --> 01:10:18.480
fat yearly, regardless of how much they eat.
So their fat tissue's regulated.

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:22.920
And what are the genes responding to with
us? And I would say they're responding to

01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:25.910
basically how we process the carbs in the
diet.

01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:32.980
So if we all grew up in a carb free environment,
if we were Inuits or Masai, or Native Plains

01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:38.660
Indians of the Great Plains, and we didn't
have the carbs in the diet, we would all basically

01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:40.770
have, we would all be lean.

01:10:40.770 --> 01:10:48.310
And then, when you live, grow up, in a high
carb environment, then the phenotype manifests

01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:53.930
itself of obesity. And what the genes are
responding to are the carbs in the diet. It's

01:10:53.930 --> 01:10:56.850
basically how you metabolize them, how much
insulin you secrete, how sensitive your fat

01:10:56.850 --> 01:11:02.050
tissue is to that insulin, and things like
that.

01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:05.580
And what's interesting again is I used to
live in New York, up until a year ago, and

01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:10.960
I'd get my coffee from a bagel shop downstairs.
This was right around the corner from NYU.

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:15.160
And it was full of these heavy set young girls
from NYU who were eating their low fat bagels

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:18.920
and their low fat soy cream cheese and their
low fat soy lattes.

01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:23.400
And they were doing exactly what the government
thinks they should do and what they've been

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:28.040
told to do to live a healthy lifestyle. And
I assumed they believed they were just doomed

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:33.940
to be overweight because they were doing what
they were told to do. And the argument I would

01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:37.891
make is that they're doing it in a high carb
environment. And if they didn't live in a

01:11:37.891 --> 01:11:42.100
high carb environment, that they didn't eat
the carbs, they would be lean. Their phenotype

01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:44.090
wouldn't manifest itself.

01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:49.500
And the message I'm trying -- this is the
battle that I'm trying to fight, is to get

01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:54.170
these ideas across because there are a lot
of people out there, like obese children,

01:11:54.170 --> 01:11:59.560
who are being tortured with starvation diets
and being made to run five miles a day, or

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:04.861
whatever. And that's not why they're fat.
And the problem is they're tortured like that

01:12:04.861 --> 01:12:11.710
and then they get their Gatorade when it’s
over. And they count the 300 calories of Gatorade

01:12:11.710 --> 01:12:13.390
and they go, "Oh, OK. This is good. I'm in
negative energy balance." And they're still

01:12:13.390 --> 01:12:14.390
driving fat accumulation.

01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:17.480
So we have to get the carbs out of their life
and I sound like a quack diet book doctor

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:21.560
when I say that. That's what the research
shows.

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:22.560
[pause]

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:31.020
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: I have a very practical
question. So, my question is how do you actually

01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:35.470
do it? How do you avoid carbs? You go into
a store. You want to buy bacon. You look in

01:12:35.470 --> 01:12:36.470
the ingredients. There's sugar in there. You
come here in Google cafes. There is sugar

01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:41.870
everywhere. Like, every main dish, every stew,
they gotta put sugar in it. If you want to

01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:47.010
buy meat, they're gonna give you lean cuts
of meat. You can't get like nice fat cut of

01:12:47.010 --> 01:12:48.360
meat. So how do you get fat?

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:51.600
&gt;&gt;Gary Taubes: Well, you can but it's difficult.
I mean, the idea is you can always eat less

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:57.500
of it. So if you're not, if you get the kids
off the sodas and the fruit juices and you

01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:02.740
don't try to give them low fat foods, you
don't try to give them the low fat yoghurts.

01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:07.520
I actually have this ongoing argument with
my wife where I say, "Look, this Michael Pollan

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:13.320
kind of thing. If a food makes a health claim,
look to see how much sugar is in it."

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:17.970
There's almost invariably, with the exception
I think, of Cheerios, weirdly enough, it's

01:13:17.970 --> 01:13:24.640
gonna have a high sugar content. So the best
you can do is eat less. So again, my kids

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:29.480
will go eat bacon that's cured, apple-cured
bacon, which I assume means it’s sweet and

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:35.750
it tastes sweet and there's sugar in it. But
it's still better than Frosted Flakes, or

01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:39.770
Coco Puffs, or getting apple juice with their.

01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:44.850
So you can always improve. And everyone, it
sounds more difficult than, you made it sound

01:13:44.850 --> 01:13:52.200
difficult. But the reality is when you, when
people try it without looking as closely as

01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:58.020
you do, at least the ones who succeed email
me and tell me. I don't know if there's this

01:13:58.020 --> 01:14:01.680
huge background of people who fail on these
diets. I don't think they work for everybody

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.380
because I think after a point, you can get.

01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:10.830
And this is what the British physician wrote
about 50 years ago, looking at his 1500 people

01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:15.180
he put on a low carb diet. And he said the
ones who had been fat for a long time, who

01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:19.580
were very obese, who had been obese the longest,
and women more so than men, because women

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:24.780
have the sex hormones are much more, that
play a much greater role in their fattening.

01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:29.240
And these people – it's sort of -- they
may reach the point of no return.

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:32.880
But again, the argument I'm making is that
if you look at the heart disease risk factors

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:38.310
and other profiles, I recently had to post
on my blog, my own lipid profile, which I

01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:43.320
got measured cause people wanted to know if
I appeared to be killing myself. And I'm not

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:44.670
by standard measures anyway.

01:14:44.670 --> 01:14:48.251
But if you look at that, it would still be
a healthier diet. So you do better, but you

01:14:48.251 --> 01:14:53.950
don't have to avoid sugar entirely. You might
be healthier if you do, but we could certainly

01:14:53.950 --> 01:14:54.950
all cut back on it.

01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:55.950
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: Okay. So maybe
I should give a little bit of clarification.

01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:59.670
So, yes, I mean, if you want to go healthier
than the average, you can certainly do it

01:14:59.670 --> 01:15:04.100
if you're gonna [ ] and you are gonna make
lots of progress. Me personally, I made lots

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:10.810
of progress. But if you want to go to the
next step, and if you want to really completely

01:15:10.810 --> 01:15:16.850
cut the sugar out, and be really healthy,
how do you practically do it?

01:15:16.850 --> 01:15:21.040
&gt;&gt;Gary Taubes: First of all, you stop working
in an office. See, I work at home. So I can

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:25.400
control and I live in Berkeley. I'm sure you
have it here. So we have these gourmet butchers

01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:31.380
from farms that raised their animals humanely
and don't put sugar in things.

01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:36.230
Again, I'm just a journalist. I can't solve
every problem. I'm trying to fight this particular

01:15:36.230 --> 01:15:41.420
battle. And then I hope that if I make some
progress and the other people out there fighting

01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:46.900
this battle make some progress, then maybe
the whole society will move into a point where

01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:48.650
it will get easier.

01:15:48.650 --> 01:15:53.460
I have a lot of fans at Microsoft, I hate
to say, and they've been trying to get the

01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:59.790
Microsoft Wellness Group to put low carb lines
in their café. So they have at least the

01:15:59.790 --> 01:16:08.420
effect of the Atkins like choices. And so
far, as far as I know, they've had no luck.

01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:09.780
But give them time.

01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:14.900
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: Hi. I was wondering,
you mentioned five studies that were unpublished,

01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:26.470
and how many of them are now published, or
do you think there's a publication bias, where

01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:29.750
these studies that talk to the dogma don't
ever get published?

01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:35.980
&gt;&gt;Gary Taubes: Actually, they virtually have
all been published that I know of. Probably

01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:39.870
several dozen studies published. I mean, the
results are always the same.

01:16:39.870 --> 01:16:43.500
People on these diets, they lose more weight.
Their triglycerides go down more. Their HDL

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:48.390
goes up more. Everything gets better and it's
basically the metabolic syndrome in some resistance

01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:52.450
resolved. It goes away and should go away
if I'm right, cause it’s pretty obviously

01:16:52.450 --> 01:16:56.440
caused by the carbs in the diet. There are
publications biases.

01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:01.930
For instance, people who go in believing that
it’s all about calories, will interpret

01:17:01.930 --> 01:17:06.790
their data to make it all about calories,
even if they published that the Atkins’s

01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:11.210
group does better than the American Heart
Association group.

01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:16.310
There are people who own, there are now like,
low carb journals out there, 'Journal of Nutrition

01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:22.490
and Metabolism'. So some people will do, there's
a great study done on Type 2 diabetes at Duke

01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:27.280
University where most of the subjects were
able to get off their diabetes medications.

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:31.930
This is supposedly an irreversible disease.
And the author, the first author only sent

01:17:31.930 --> 01:17:36.250
to the 'Journal of Nutrition and Metabolism',
where it would basically be read by the converted,

01:17:36.250 --> 01:17:42.290
because he didn't wanna deal with all the
flack he would get trying to publish in the

01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:43.290
mainline journal.

01:17:43.290 --> 01:17:48.300
So there are definitely biases, but if you
do these studies now, I think you almost have

01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:54.250
to. There's a clinical trials website where
you have to register them and part of the

01:17:54.250 --> 01:17:58.790
reason for that is to make sure that people
don't only publish positive results. So the

01:17:58.790 --> 01:18:05.900
pretty much all get published, but they do
get spun. And often, the spin takes over.

01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:14.010
The biggest study ever done came out of -- it
was Pennsylvania, UPENN, Colorado, and University

01:18:14.010 --> 01:18:19.830
of Cincinnati. And they put 300 subjects on
an Atkins diet in effect and an American Heart

01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:24.330
Association diet. And they referred to it
as a low carb versus a low fat diet. This

01:18:24.330 --> 01:18:26.120
is a classic way to do it.

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:30.960
But the low fat diet is calorie restricted.
So when you're told to go on the low fat diet,

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:37.070
you're told to eat 14, 15 hundred calories
a day, basically semi-starve yourself. And

01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:42.520
when you go on the low carb diet, you're told
to eat as much as you want. Just don't eat

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:44.110
carbohydrates.

01:18:44.110 --> 01:18:48.270
And one of the lessons I learned writing about
physics is it's absolutely crucial to define

01:18:48.270 --> 01:18:51.670
your terms carefully, so people know what
they've done and what you've done and can

01:18:51.670 --> 01:18:55.500
replicate it. And so, you're not in effect
trying to fool people.

01:18:55.500 --> 01:19:00.140
And if I was writing that study, it would
say "low fat, low calorie versus low carb,

01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:04.220
ad libitum. 'Ad libitum' means eat as much
as you want. And I would always use those

01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:08.750
terms because you never want them to forget
that one group is low calorie and one group

01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:12.660
is ad libitum. 'Cause that also suggests,
and in this case they got essentially the

01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:16.940
same weight loss. The Atkins group did better
on heart disease risk factors, but the weight

01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:18.810
loss was virtually the same.

01:19:18.810 --> 01:19:23.630
And you want people to remember that one group
is being semi-starved and one group isn't

01:19:23.630 --> 01:19:27.950
'cause that evidence that it’s not about
the calories. And they just didn't do it.

01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:33.280
They mentioned it in their methodology that
the low fat group was calorie restricted and

01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:38.670
then they ignored it. And the title was 'Low
Fat Versus Low Carb', and the papers picked

01:19:38.670 --> 01:19:44.170
it up: Low Fat versus Low Carb. And they left
out the crucial ingredient, which is one diet

01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:48.010
restricts calories and the other diet doesn't,
which is the ingredient that tells you you're

01:19:48.010 --> 01:19:49.960
paradigm might be wrong. OK.

01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:56.740
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: I'm just wondering
if any of your research, you came across any

01:19:56.740 --> 01:20:01.220
connections between people who drop the carbohydrates,
but coincidentally, they're also dropping

01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:07.280
the trans fats, because most of the carbohydrates
we purchase commercially are covered with

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:11.880
trans fats, which tend to be the worst fats
for you in terms of heart disease risk.

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:15.350
&gt;&gt;Gary Taubes: It's funny 'cause I would always
argue it the other way. To me, the evidence

01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:20.930
that trans fats are bad comes from mostly
from observational studies where you compare

01:20:20.930 --> 01:20:24.230
people who eat a lot of trans fats to people
who eat very little. Like the nurses health

01:20:24.230 --> 01:20:27.880
studies, what they're doing is there, when
you think who eats a lot of trans fats and

01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:32.650
who doesn't, you're comparing in effect, people
who buy a lot of processed foods and fast

01:20:32.650 --> 01:20:34.640
foods, to people who cook most of their meals
for themselves.

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:35.730
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: You can't separate
the carbohydrates.

01:20:35.730 --> 01:20:41.110
&gt;&gt;Gary Taubes: You can, but you're also, but
the point is, as you put it, the processed

01:20:41.110 --> 01:20:44.780
foods come with the carbs. The trans-fat data
just doesn't wow me.

01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:49.850
I mean, it is true if you give up the carbs,
you're gonna have to give up the trans fats.

01:20:49.850 --> 01:20:54.890
But remember all those populations I talked
about in the beginning, Like the Trinidadians,

01:20:54.890 --> 01:20:59.630
the Sioux -- Native American Sioux. They would
not have been getting trans fats. So we don't

01:20:59.630 --> 01:21:04.140
know what their heart disease risk was. But
we know that they weren't getting margarine.

01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:09.060
They weren't getting -- there wasn't food
industry forcing trans fats on them. So it's

01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:22.450
quite likely, the obvious, again, the null
hypothesis would be the carb content of the

01:21:22.450 --> 01:21:23.450
diet.

01:21:23.450 --> 01:21:25.450
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: And then my second
question is, that there are populations that

01:21:25.450 --> 01:21:26.450
tend not to eat meat, like India. There's
so many vegetarians and they get their proteins

01:21:26.450 --> 01:21:27.450
mainly from legumes. So what is your take
on the glycemic index of legumes and other

01:21:27.450 --> 01:21:30.390
non-meat sources of proteins for people who
aren't really eating meat?

01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:34.270
&gt;&gt;Gary Taubes: Well, I do think, again, the
argument I make in the book. The book is called

01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:38.771
'Why We Get Fat'? Not 'How to Lose Weight'.
The reason why I call it 'Why We Get Fat'

01:21:38.771 --> 01:21:42.760
is I wanna make this argument that it’s
literally about the carbs, high glycemic index

01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:48.240
carbs. It doesn't -- the -- legumes are lower
glycemic index. Green vegetables are low glycemic

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:50.170
index. And the sugars.

01:21:50.170 --> 01:21:56.950
And anyone can improve their diet if they
just remove the sugars and the white flour

01:21:56.950 --> 01:22:00.810
and to some extent, what we call whole wheat
flour in the United States. And actually,

01:22:00.810 --> 01:22:05.890
even one of observations that I wrote about
in 'Good Calories, Bad Calories'.

01:22:05.890 --> 01:22:13.240
As early as 1907 the British Medical Association
had a meeting in which they had a discussion

01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:16.850
about the diabetes problem in India 'cause
diabetes was rampant. They said that it's

01:22:16.850 --> 01:22:22.530
actually worse among the vegetarians sects.
Probably 'cause they were also eating the

01:22:22.530 --> 01:22:25.980
most sugar, which they suggested in 1907.

01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:32.990
But you can improve the diet by removing the
fat and the carbohydrates regardless, is the

01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:39.040
point. But if somebody’s very predisposed
to get fat, if someone's 300 pounds, I would

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:43.080
argue that you have to get basically, they're
not gonna get enough calories that they.

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:50.650
The easiest, the way to maximize calories
and minimize carbs is with animal products.

01:22:50.650 --> 01:22:55.630
And so, that's the problem. So if these people,
they could improve on a vegetarian diet. And

01:22:55.630 --> 01:22:59.920
I get emails all the day from people telling
me how much they lost, just giving up sugars.

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:05.190
I don't think that's enough. In my experience,
I can just ask myself, like, "What would happen

01:23:05.190 --> 01:23:09.340
if I added whole wheat pasta back to my diet?
Maybe three times a week."

01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:13.620
And I could pretty much bet that I'd gain
ten pounds.

01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:18.240
But the point is anyone can lose weight just
by getting rid of, and improve their risk

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:23.020
profiles, 'cause the argument I make is these
high glycemic index carbs and sugars are the

01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:29.150
cause of the chronic diseases that associate
with obesity and diabetes and insulin resistance.

01:23:29.150 --> 01:23:34.690
So, and then, if it's an all vegetarian or
vegan diet, you're still gonna be better.

01:23:34.690 --> 01:23:38.720
You may not be as lean as you could be if
you threw your ethical considerations to the

01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:44.810
wind and switched to meat, but you will be
healthier than if you keep these foods in

01:23:44.810 --> 01:23:47.340
your diet.

01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:55.470
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #3: I was wondering
about people who do a lot of athletics, especially

01:23:55.470 --> 01:23:59.200
like endurance stuff and talk about things
like carbo loading, and other studies that

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:02.930
have recently suggested that women typically
will recover better when they eat carbs after

01:24:02.930 --> 01:24:05.331
a meal too. And how that fits into all this.

01:24:05.331 --> 01:24:09.710
&gt;&gt;Gary Taubes: The question is about how,
what about athletics and endurance exercise.

01:24:09.710 --> 01:24:14.280
Don't you need the carbohydrates? Aren't they
crucial? [pause]

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:21.890
This is not my area of expertise and I was
not an endurance athlete. But in the late

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:26.740
1970s, early 1980s, there was some research
done at the University of Vermont by a fellow

01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:31.000
named Steve Finney, who's now an emeritus
professor of nutrition at UC Davis.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:36.790
And he put professional bike racers on ketogenic
diets. And it takes about three weeks to what's

01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:43.740
called "ketoadopt," where you adopt completely
to the complete lack of carbs in the diet,

01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:47.770
in effect. And the bottom line was they did
fine. They lost a little bit of their sprinting

01:24:47.770 --> 01:24:52.920
ability, but they lost a lot of – they lost
none of their endurance.

01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:58.090
The interesting thing, I get a lot of emails
from bike racers, long distance bike racers,

01:24:58.090 --> 01:25:03.910
and mountain bike racers, cause weight is
an issue there. Whereas marathoners, you might

01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:05.280
wanna be as light as possible.

01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:13.350
Or, actually, this is where I get confused.
The evidence suggests you can do just fine

01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:18.310
without any carbs and I actually recommend
-- email me. I'll forward your email to Steve

01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:24.600
Finney. He'll write three thousand words back
in response cause that's what he does.

01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:29.670
But -- and that's a different issue than whether
or not if you carb load like two days before

01:25:29.670 --> 01:25:33.830
the race, you'll do better. Although, I think
Steve would argue that it's not necessary.

01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:38.180
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: This is a question
about the data. So, in the 1970s, Americans

01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:48.580
ate an average of 2200 calories a day. And
as your slide says, now they eat 27 hundred

01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:58.762
calories per day. And in those days you had
less than ten percent obesity and now you

01:25:58.762 --> 01:25:59.762
have like 30 percent or something. Do you
think their genetics change over 30 years,

01:25:59.762 --> 01:26:00.762
or with the calories is there no correlation
there?

01:26:00.762 --> 01:26:02.900
&gt;&gt;Gary Taubes: I mean this is again, these
numbers, by the way, are very iffy.

01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:09.050
But certainly the question was, if you look
at the food consumption numbers, in the 1970s

01:26:09.050 --> 01:26:14.060
we were eating around 2200 calories. Then
it went up by 500 calories. So doesn't that

01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:17.880
prove that it’s about the calories? That's,
in effect, the, and the point is first of

01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:19.000
all, this is an observation.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.820
Remember I said, if somebody gets heavier,
they gotta eat more, or exercise less because

01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:29.440
they're gonna be in positive energy balance.
So even if, and it's pretty much assumed that

01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:33.440
food availability went up, our food portion
sizes got bigger, etc., etc.

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:37.670
But did people get fatter because they consumed
more? Did they get hungrier because they were

01:26:37.670 --> 01:26:43.500
getting fatter? And those numbers don't, associations
like that tell you nothing about causality.

01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:49.230
They only tell you that two things happened
simultaneously.

01:26:49.230 --> 01:26:54.200
The price of tea in China probably also went
up since 1970, but we're not gonna blame obesity

01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:58.440
on that. Why would we blame it on the availability
of calories in the food supply? When you look

01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:04.630
at what those calories were, they were almost
exclusively carbohydrates and most of it was

01:27:04.630 --> 01:27:08.420
high fructose corn syrup.

01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:11.940
If you actually look at the number in fat,
it's something like three percent of the increase

01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:16.150
is from fat. Or actually fat -- the USDA has
screwed up the numbers and that's another

01:27:16.150 --> 01:27:20.700
story. But fat consumption, basically, went
down a little bit. Protein consumption went

01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:25.080
up a little bit and carbohydrate consumption
went up a lot. And it reflected the public

01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:32.370
health advice. The shift to pasta, breads,
potatoes and then this increase in sugar consumption

01:27:32.370 --> 01:27:36.930
that I believe was driven high fructose corn
syrup, by the fact that we first didn't know

01:27:36.930 --> 01:27:41.810
that high fructose corn syrup was sugar. And
second, believed it wasn't a problem because

01:27:41.810 --> 01:27:44.050
the problem was all about fat. Thank you.
