00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.759
&gt;&gt;Neil Strauss: Yeah, I spent, like, ten years
writing for the New York Times and more, more

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:09.495
than that kind of writing for Rolling Stone.
If you're a writer you have always have your

00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:13.731
dream of doing your, like, a journalist anthology
so you save, like, every article you've done

00:00:13.731 --> 00:00:19.579
I put it into a folder called like 'anthology'.
I figured that, you know when the time came

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:24.180
and it was right for it, I would do my kind
of journalistic anthology. And what happened

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.419
was, so I started collecting these pieces
like I remember that were like my first big

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:31.170
break was going to Seattle in '94 and like
covering Kurt Cobain's suicide. It was an

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.900
intense thing for, like, a young guy, to be;
so I put that in there. Then my second thing,

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.040
the other stories I started putting in, even
before 'The Game'. And 'The Game' even though

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.600
they say it is more of a book on how to pick
up girls, for me it was really was to me a

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.100
book about male insecurity and my own insecurities
and fears. But, before 'The Game', I realized

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.910
that when I did this book, I spent six months
for the New York Times going like undercover

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.950
as a stand-up comic, trying to make it as
a stand-up comic. The reason I had them, made

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.390
them give me that assignment is I wanted to
get over, like, my nervousness, I wanted to

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.630
get over stage fright. I wanted to get over
social anxieties. Even like pre-'Game', that

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.330
was kind of like my first attempt to do that.
So anyway, I saved all these in a folder and

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.750
my last book after 'The Game' was such an
intense experience. It was called 'The Emergency';

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.440
it was kind of based on all the shit that
was going on and is still going with like

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.452
the economy and natural disasters. And everything
that we've still kind of seen happen in the

00:01:28.452 --> 00:01:33.970
last kind of scary last eight or so years.
So and for that book I basically was; 'the

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.920
Game' was an intense kind of two, two year
experience. This was like kind of an overlap

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.850
of the Game and it was two years of learning
how to be self-sufficient. Learning how to

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.670
get off the grid. Learning how to basically
like recreate civilization, on my own. Uh,

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.760
with no one else. So it was such an intense
experience I thought maybe now was time to

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.080
take a little break. I told my publisher 'give
me two months and I will put together this

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.090
anthology.'
So, I opened up that little folder with all

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.740
those articles and I started reading them.
And I was like 'you know what? these kind

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.911
of suck.' Like, they weren't that good. Like
I thought all along they'd be like a whole

00:02:03.911 --> 00:02:06.530
book then I realized, you know what? They
weren't as interesting as I kind of thought,

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.320
as I thought they were. And, and, I ordered
a bunch of anthologies by other writers and

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.180
I read them. All of them, like it was just
hard to read a book front to back that's a

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.129
collection of random articles written over
time. And also you just kind of get tired

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.599
of the writer's voice after a while. Like
gee, do you really want to read a profile

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:28.609
of like Tom Cruise written ten years ago in
a movie that we all forgot about?

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:34.129
So what I decided instead, was, that I would
get all the cassettes of all the interviews,

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:40.020
all the transcripts and all the recordings
of every interview I ever did. And I had them

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.040
all like re-transcribed. And I had them all
re-transcribed by a medical transcriber. And

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.689
I told her I want everything, like everything.
I want every cough. I want every pause; I

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:55.749
want every change in tonality. I want every,
uh, uh, every interruption, every background

00:02:55.749 --> 00:03:00.879
noise. I want any, everything. So I got, you
know, twenty thousand plus pages of all these

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:05.439
cassettes. And by the way, these two months
turned into like two years [chuckles]. So

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:10.029
and it turned, I looked for these little moments
of authenticity.

00:03:10.029 --> 00:03:13.540
And, and, that's kind of what we'll talk about
today. Which is my kind of goal as a writer,

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.309
when I go and do in an interview, especially
for like Rolling Stone and the New York Times,

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:22.010
it's not, I'm not gonna spend just an hour
in a room with a person; you're not going

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.879
to spend a day, a week, a month, or in one
case a year, embedded in someone's life. And

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:31.629
I'm looking for the moment where the mask
falls and I get to see who that person really

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:37.730
is. And that may not, may not, may not be
like a traditional sort of interview moment.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.640
For example, when I was interviewing to Mötley
Crüe, the moment where the mask fell, was

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.890
like the moment I met them and they were getting
arrested. And like, as they were walking,

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.650
led away, and in handcuffs, it was just that
Nikki Sixx and Tommy Lee were getting arrested,

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.730
the moment that showed me who they were, was
when Vince Neal was like kind of blow drying

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.900
his hair the whole time. I thought 'OK'. That's
a moment. And then even better, like two fans

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.599
kind of ran up to them with copies of 'Shout
at the Devil' trying to get them to autograph

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:09.199
them as they were walking out. That's how
used to it the fans are to seeing these guys

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:10.799
get arrested.
Others were like so fun.

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.799
So I collected all those moments and went
through this whole long process to kind of

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.370
find the moments in the book. And the good
news is that as I was pulling up in my car

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.001
that I just found out from my editor from
Harper Collins that it made the New York Times

00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:28.440
best seller list so I am really excited. Yeah.
[applause]

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.340
Which again is so awesome for an anthology.
So what I thought I'd do is I'd just read

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.031
a short thing and then I'd go over sort of
some lessons that we can apply to our lives.

00:04:36.031 --> 00:04:43.430
[pause]. And uh, these are the things so even
though I on the surface it seems like the

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.400
book's about celebrities, to me it's just
about people. Like I feel I could stand on

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.010
any street corner and interview people for
a couple months and come up with something

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:56.070
as interesting as this. So um, tell you what,
we can read one of two things that I can read

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.880
to you this, when I spoke last time, I did
this. I am trying to decide which one. I'll

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.320
kind of read, I'll do, I will either read
A: 'Things overheard in my dangerous neighborhood

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.360
in New York' that I kind of wrote down. I'll
read that. I'll read that. Ok, I'll read that.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.230
I haven't read this, I didn't read these last
time.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.400
So these are in the books that I find it interesting,
I just take notes on life. I write nonfiction

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.720
because it's more interesting than anything
I can make up.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.260
So I used to live in the East Village in New
York, before it was kind of cool and funky,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.930
when it was just like dangerous [chuckles].
I remember like one time walking home, like,

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.870
three guys, just started kicking the shit
out of me and then they left. What was scary

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.720
wasn't just that they beat me up was that
they did not take my money. [laughter] Like

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.111
the whole event was just random violence.
If they took my money, I would have felt better

00:05:38.111 --> 00:05:43.150
about it. It would be a goal-oriented behavior.
Instead it was just violence for the fuck

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.420
of it.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.020
Um, so and then when I heard like a couple
people getting like held up by gunpoint outside

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.080
my window, I figured you know what, time to
move out. But before I moved I collected these

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.530
sayings. For those of you guys who haven't
been to New York or been to the East Village,

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.400
of course, I as soon as I moved out like six
months later, there's like velvet ropes and

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.080
nice restaurants and clubs there. But how
it works is that obviously New York is on

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.680
the grid system and there are numbers and
the streets are numbered and the avenues are

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.810
numbers. But as you go further east, they
turn into letters. The higher the letter in

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.140
this case, the worse the neighborhood; the
worst the block.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:18.550
So this was overheard on Avenue B, two men
talking. "Just because I killed someone, doesn't

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.050
mean I'm expert."
[laughter]

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.030
On the same block, a man talking to a woman,
"I'm not a jealous guy, I'm just violent."

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.200
[audience chuckles]
Like he sounds like a keeper there.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.610
[audience chuckles]
On East Seventh Street, a guy saying "I'm

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.870
going to break your face, sucker" to a lamppost,
or maybe it was me. I don't know.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.870
[chuckles]
Overheard this at a rave, "And the last thing

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.880
he did was drink a glass of orange juice.
Now he's in a mental institution and he thinks

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.880
he's an orange."
[chuckles].

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.240
Imagine if the last thing you did was take
a shit. That would have sucked! [chuckles]

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.080
On Avenue A, two well dressed white men talking
"I'm not a racist or anything. But have you

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.950
ever beaten up an African American?" And like
that is going to make it OK if he uses the

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:04.580
right PC term?
And then there's this bar, Seven B, two women

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:09.530
talking "He's a total fox so I love him. He
completely has no personality and he doesn't

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.711
speak a word of English."
So I took to running around the East Village

00:07:12.711 --> 00:07:18.180
in a fox outfit, didn't work. [laughs]
And this was over on Avenue D some ways, two

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:23.680
guys talking "I don't take a life, I bury
a soul." I don't know what that means but

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.560
it's scary as fuck. [chuckles]
And then when I thought, since you guys were

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.620
here, and I actually have to do like a book
reading tonight. When I was in New York, I

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.640
started collecting a list of things I never
heard people say ever. What I thought is that

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:41.020
when I went to my reading tonight, do any
of you have like a regular pen. I would write

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.170
a list of things that I've never heard in
San Francisco. So this would be a collaborative

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:45.871
effort so I could do this during my reading
tonight.

00:07:45.871 --> 00:07:52.860
I'll give you a couple examples to get your
mind working. So these are a few things, a

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:57.150
couple that apply to San Francisco so these
are things I've never heard in New York.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.980
'No, go ahead. Take the parking space; you
were here first.' [audience laughs]

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:05.950
That one would be heard in San Francisco.
Um, 'thank God the police are here.'

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.330
Never heard that.
'Oh yeah, would you like at that? My bike

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:14.150
is still here.' [laughter]
'Um, are you Neil Strauss, the famous writer?'

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:18.310
Never heard that. [laughter]
So, there are a couple of others that I could

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.830
add for San Francisco that would be like specific?
[pause]

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:27.690
Things you would never heard in San Francisco.
[pause]

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:34.219
&gt;&gt;Male #1 member: [inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Neil Strauss: Yeah, Yeah, Nice sun, I love

00:08:34.219 --> 00:08:36.759
your sun tan. All right we'll work on that
one.

00:08:36.759 --> 00:08:38.810
[laughter]
We'll work on that one, I love your suntan.

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.899
&gt;&gt;Male #2: It's much too early for wine.
&gt;&gt;Neil: That's good.

00:08:40.899 --> 00:08:47.449
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Yes, I am a mister.
&gt;&gt;Neil: [laughing] Ha, ha, ha, yeah,

00:08:47.449 --> 00:08:50.769
[audience laughs]
&gt;&gt;Neil: That's good.

00:08:50.769 --> 00:08:54.491
[Pause]
&gt;&gt;Neil: Uh, I've been searching all day and

00:08:54.491 --> 00:08:57.740
I can't find a Chinese restaurant. No, is
that yes or no? I don't know. Maybe

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:58.740
&gt;&gt;Female #1: [inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Neil: What's that?

00:08:58.740 --> 00:08:59.850
&gt;&gt;Female#1: Maybe Thai food.
&gt;&gt;Neil: I can't find a Thai restaurant.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:08.490
[pause]
&gt;&gt;Neil: OK, we'll go with those. If you think

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.100
of others, just yell them out as I'm speaking
later.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.180
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Go to brunch.
&gt;&gt;Neil: What's that?

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:18.519
&gt;&gt;Female #1: I can't find a good brunch place.
&gt;&gt;Neil: I can't find anywhere for brunch.

00:09:18.519 --> 00:09:19.540
[audience yells]
&gt;&gt;Neil: What the hell, yeah, what the hell

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.920
is Burning Man? That's a good one.
I love the night life here. No. [laughter]

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:31.139
&gt;&gt;Female #2: So many taxis.
&gt;&gt;Neil: Yeah,

00:09:31.139 --> 00:09:38.350
[pause]
&gt;&gt;Neil: [laughing] Ha, ha, ha, that's good.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:39.540
OK, awesome.
That was quick. Good job, guys.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.830
All right, so here's the, so I'll give you
a choice of what we do next. We'll do one

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:47.550
of two things and then we'll do some questions
and answers, especially since I know we started

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:52.129
late. So choice one is once I went through
all these interviews for the book and put

00:09:52.129 --> 00:09:55.290
them all together, and with the benefit of
twenty-twenty hindsight, you start to see

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:59.230
like themes that are immersed through them.
Like themes of lessons that you can kind of

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.431
learn for your own life. And I thought it
was like really interesting and there a lot

00:10:01.431 --> 00:10:05.699
of surprises. Some were more intuitive, some
were counterintuitive. Some were like interesting

00:10:05.699 --> 00:10:10.930
themes that I learned that to me I think about
all the time in terms of my behavior. Like

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:15.569
there's lessons in the book that I directly
apply to my behavior or try to apply. In fact

00:10:15.569 --> 00:10:20.410
one I should be applying right now. [chuckles]
Then there's another one, That's choice one.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:26.259
Choice is two is, uh, there's education and
then there's humor which is obviously I did

00:10:26.259 --> 00:10:29.170
that book 'The Game' which means that for
the rest of my life I will be getting the

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:35.610
most insane emails. Probably most, the most
anyone than ever gets. So I collected like

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:40.350
the funniest emails. I'll give you small example.
I didn't write down; I just got it today.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:45.600
It was a guy writing saying um, he was saying
"I've got a question: I'm twenty-seven years

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:52.839
old, I'm a virgin, um, you know, a few girls
said if I would pay for their, uh, breast

00:10:52.839 --> 00:10:55.970
implants, they would let me touch them. Do
you think I should do that?"

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:58.360
[audience laughs]
So, they're along, they're along, they're

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.800
along those lines.
So, humorous emails, educational life lessons?

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.370
What do we feel like?
[audience shouts]

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:07.792
Emails? What's that?
[audience shouts]

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:08.990
Life lessons.
[laughs]

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.990
Who said emails?
[laughs]

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:12.649
Alright,we'll do life lessons and we'll end
with two emails

00:11:12.649 --> 00:11:15.540
So, you're pretty good with your life is that
what you're trying to say? [audience laughs]

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:21.699
But I felt like it would have given me a good
like temperature of the company and people

00:11:21.699 --> 00:11:26.420
as well. If everyone's like emails, then we
work too hard, we think too much, just entertain

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:30.589
us. If everyone wants life lessons, it really
means like you know you want to get out of

00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:34.330
here at some point in our lives and do something
else. [laughs]

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.801
So life lessons.
You don't have to comment on that. If you

00:11:36.801 --> 00:11:44.029
laughed, you've all been recorded.
So first one and this it was the first was

00:11:44.029 --> 00:11:47.249
really Let Go of the Past.
What was amazing when I did these interviews

00:11:47.249 --> 00:11:50.249
and I interviewed people like Chuck Berry
who invented Rock and Roll basically, and

00:11:50.249 --> 00:11:56.879
Bo Diddly who and Jerry Lewis who left like
such a huge legacy on music. And it here's

00:11:56.879 --> 00:12:00.880
these guys, who like are almost afraid to
go outside, who think everybody hates them

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:06.160
because of some scandal that happened like
thirty years ago. The lesson from that is

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.250
that literally, we've all have shitty things
happen to us in the past. We all have, you

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:15.671
know, whatever whether it's relationship or
a parenting thing or a scandal or a, you know,

00:12:15.671 --> 00:12:19.210
some humiliation something that didn't work
out. You deal with it the best you can at

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:24.410
the moment. Then you have to let go and move
on. And the crazy thing is that all the shitty

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:29.410
things, in the moment, like enrich you later.
Not just as a person, but actually to other

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:32.559
people. And you'll see in the book, like I
was trying to explain to Chuck Berry, that

00:12:32.559 --> 00:12:37.240
yeah, maybe when you transported a minor across
state lines for immoral purposes, that was

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:41.529
bad at the time and you went to jail. That's
true. And at the time, it really did hurt

00:12:41.529 --> 00:12:46.050
and destroy your career. The crazy ironic
thing is that although that may that is still

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:50.339
wrong, it actually just made you more interesting
to people now. No one's judging you for it

00:12:50.339 --> 00:12:56.180
anymore; it's just a story now. And I think
if like that's true for that, a lot of what

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:59.990
we've been through, it becomes that too.
So letting go of the past, and focusing on

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:06.010
what, you know, focusing on being great at
what you enjoy and be glad of your accomplishments

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:11.889
is important.
Next one is, and this is, definitely true

00:13:11.889 --> 00:13:17.179
that it's a west coast thing thing. That fame
and wealth won't make you feel any better

00:13:17.179 --> 00:13:22.480
about yourself. Because I see so many people,
and especially in LA, like trying to feel,

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.610
like feeling like, if they get famous or get
a lot of money, that's going to fix all their

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:32.569
problems of insignificance; of insecurity;
of worthlessness and disconnection. And of

00:13:32.569 --> 00:13:38.660
course, the real lesson is that rather than
fixing one's problems like the more fame and

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:42.339
wealth like magnify them. And those little
things that aren't a big problem in your life

00:13:42.339 --> 00:13:47.249
become huge and that's where we get to enjoy
on the front page of the tabloids and watching

00:13:47.249 --> 00:13:53.830
Charlie Sheen, and then everything else.
And the corollary to that then is that fix

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:58.189
your problems now because the older you get,
the worse they'll become. And I have this

00:13:58.189 --> 00:14:02.060
fear of that because I was talking to a friend
of mine, a producer; if you guys here read

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:05.769
'Rules of the Game', not sure if guys read
it but conversation with this producer in

00:14:05.769 --> 00:14:10.939
the front and to the back like kind of anonymous
producer who is kind of my, a good mentor.

00:14:10.939 --> 00:14:14.570
And I told him I had started this list on
my computer, and the list is: Notes to myself

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:18.829
as an old man. Things I need to watch out
when I get older. Because when you get older,

00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:21.720
that thing that keeps you in check is going
to start to turn off and you're just going

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.589
to, all those sides to yourself that you try
to repress are just going to come out. And

00:14:25.589 --> 00:14:29.220
the notes are things like "don't be paranoid;
everyone's not out to get you; they have better

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:32.930
things to do than worry about an old man."And
so, things like that. And he said, 'you know

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:36.290
what? Instead of writing them down now to
read later, why don't you fix those problems

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:39.279
now then you don't have to worry about them
at all when you are older'. I thought that

00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:44.600
was kind of wise advice.
Next thing, this probably applies here, is

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:49.089
that, the people I've interviewed who have
gotten really successful by working really,

00:14:49.089 --> 00:14:56.209
really, really hard, are pretty unhappy people.
Um, and that people who you know, party all

00:14:56.209 --> 00:15:00.309
the time with tons of girls and drugs and
all that kind of stuff are not only end up

00:15:00.309 --> 00:15:04.920
unhappy but usually end up in jail or dead
or at least in rehab. And the people that

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:09.879
I've interviewed who are sort of like the
happiest, the ones whose lifestyle you might

00:15:09.879 --> 00:15:14.460
say "ok, you've got a good lifestyle" are
the ones who found like balance at some point.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:22.679
So I really believe that the secret to happiness
is balance: Um, and, and devoting some amount

00:15:22.679 --> 00:15:27.570
of your life to work; some amount to you know,
family, love, relationship; some amount to

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:31.550
doing something physical and healthy everyday;
some amount to contemplative time to yourself.

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:35.519
Kind of keep that in balance then you are
OK. If you are going to places in your work,

00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:39.249
and you are doing awesome. Like you are not
doing well if you are out of balance.

00:15:39.249 --> 00:15:44.029
I feel like, I just did a Howard Stern cover
story for Rolling Stone. What was interesting

00:15:44.029 --> 00:15:49.369
was that, the last question I asked him was,
you know, you're on radio two radio stations,

00:15:49.369 --> 00:15:52.439
twenty-four hours a day, you got your own
TV stations, you're on TV twenty-four hours

00:15:52.439 --> 00:15:56.459
a day and no one's bored. You've got a great
wife and happy relationship. You make more

00:15:56.459 --> 00:16:00.889
money than even like the late night talk show
hosts. Why are you still unhappy? You know,

00:16:00.889 --> 00:16:06.699
and that was the answer that there's that
anger and he never worked on it and uh you

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:11.539
know, he's only just now trying to discover
and trying to find balance. So I felt like

00:16:11.539 --> 00:16:16.689
it's a hard thing. It's easy to know; it's
hard to do in our lives. Especially at our

00:16:16.689 --> 00:16:19.290
ages.
And one other corollary that I meant to add

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:25.790
is to the fixing your issues now thing. I
do think that one of the goals, one of the

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:32.259
goals in life is that when you're young, you're
handed from like, say from age 1 to 12 or

00:16:32.259 --> 00:16:36.829
something, you're handed a certain amount
of issues by your parents. You know, even

00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:40.300
if you have good parents that love you, you
still get a certain amount of issues as well

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:45.730
as your kind of social groups. You get a certain
amount of baggage. And I think one of your

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:51.439
goals in life is to try and you know, recover
from that baggage. To vest yourself of it.

00:16:51.439 --> 00:16:54.850
So you can kind of become that clean, great
person you were when you were born and return

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:59.530
to that. Not in a New Age way, but deal with
that baggage and let go of it and be happy

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:05.800
again. That's one of the goals of evolving
through life outside of the family and love

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:10.589
and the thing and as someone once told me,
that when someone's on their death bed, they

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:15.980
never think about "Shit, I didn't finish that
book" or "I didn't finish that project". Or

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:19.750
um, you know "I didn't finish the album I
was making or anything". They always think

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:22.940
about family and love.
And you'll see at the end of the book, it's

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:29.260
kind of thematic things if you guys read it.
The last sections about, about death. People

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:35.071
who are close to dying or thinking death.
And I was really struck and I don't, and I

00:17:35.071 --> 00:17:38.080
never, and I still don't fully understand
it that I was really struck but it. There's

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:43.210
a bluegrass musician named John Hartford.
And he wrote a song called 'Gentle on my Mind'

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:47.070
which was a big hit for Glen Campbell and
was one of the most recorded songs. What was

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:51.170
interesting about interviewing him, was he
had a I think he had leukemia and he knew

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:57.060
he had like a year or two left to live and
that was it. And he had chosen in that time,

00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.150
to get better at playing the fiddle. That
was all he was going to do was sit at home,

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.190
and he would play the fiddle. Other pickers
would come over, he'd record it and play it

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:06.590
back and he'd try to get better at the fiddle.
He's just really happy with that choice. It

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:11.390
was an amazing, beautiful thing that I still
can't understand in my head because of course,

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:16.300
no matter how good you get, you know, at one
point, you're gonna, obviously, be gone, and

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:20.110
none of that's gonna matter. But I just thought
he made his choice, he was happy with his

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:24.510
choice and I still have yet to really, fully
understand the significance of that choice

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:31.290
he made. I found it really fascinating.
Versus, Rick James [laughs] whose last words

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:34.370
to me when I interviewed him were I said "What
are your plans for the New Years?"He said

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:38.880
"I plan to leave that mother-fucking cocaine
alone." And of course he died a couple years

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.160
later of a heart attack with cocaine in his
system. There's a guy who never got to make

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.840
his choice and live it for what he was going
to do with life.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.200
I'll give you a couple of the really quick
ones

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.570
I wrote a piece for the Wall Street Journal
about one of the more surprising things that

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:56.770
I found in this book. Which was that musicians
who believe in God, and that believe that

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:01.500
God like had a plan for them to be famous,
it was God's plan for them to be famous, became

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:05.612
more famous and got to stay there longer.
It doesn't mean then, I don't believe this

00:19:05.612 --> 00:19:11.290
is a religious belief obviously this is delusional
narcissism that you know are chosen out of

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:14.730
everybody by God to be famous. That he even
fucking cares of you have a Billboard number

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:19.740
one or whatever. You know, like, every Super
Bowl, the fucking team who wins, I don't really

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:24.880
watch much sports. But the team who wins and
the MVP every fucking Super Bowl is always

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:29.640
like "this was God's plan." Like God is just
sitting there, fucking watching the game [laughs].

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.330
Like that's going to matter the fate of the
world if that team wins. [audience laughs]

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:37.870
And I suppose in chaos theory, maybe it would,
but anyway.

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:42.950
The point being, that versus musicians that
I interviewed and I think the reason that

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:46.690
it works is this: If you're on a level and
one of the reasons I named the book 'Everyone

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:51.980
Loves You When You're Dead" is that as you're
getting, as you're improving yourself, if

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:56.020
you're sticking your head out, whether you
are rising at the company, whether you are

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:59.011
a guy who read 'The Game' and doing better
with women. Any time you're doing better,

00:19:59.011 --> 00:20:02.870
everybody will start to shit talk you and
take you down because your success makes everybody

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:05.860
else feel worse about themselves.
That's why we love shit talk with celebrities;

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:09.430
we don't shit talk homeless people. You know
like we love shit talking celebrities because

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:12.920
they are up there and we want say "Hey, they're
no better than us. Hey, look at them; they're

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:18.880
fat; they're thin; they're falling apart.
Look at them, they suck". So to anyway, to

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.710
be there to withstand all the things being
thrown at you, if you're like "everybody hates

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:26.350
me but God's on my side, so fuck you all."
You know you can have that strength to go

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:31.320
through it versus people I interviewed like
Jack White who had a lot of insecurity and

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:35.350
doubt about where they were and hey, not everyone's
goal is to be famous and misused. So, you

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:39.890
know, I think it's better to be a great artist
personally. But to people who have a lot of

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:44.650
faith, doubt, and insecurity ended up not
staying there because it's hard. You don't

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:47.680
end up making choices that aren't good for
you because you're worried about whatever

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.660
one else will think.
So really quickly just a couple of the lessons.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:58.581
One is derive your self-esteem from within,
not from others' opinions. And I think that

00:20:58.581 --> 00:21:03.320
almost goes without saying the corollary of
that is that how I meet these people recorded

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:08.690
these seminal albums maybe Brian Wilson and
Pet Sounds. And them and the people are still

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:13.200
haunted by the bad reviews it got even though
these albums maybe changed the course of music.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:19.760
Uh, [pause]
Next one: I'll do this one really quickly.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:26.000
Never say never. because everybody I ever
interviewed who's ever said as they're up

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.410
and coming "I'm never going to move Las Angeles
and start dating a model. I'm not going to

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:36.730
be that cliché," has done it. To the letter.
And often the things that you say, that you

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:42.160
say, never about, I'm not going to do that,
because that's so cliché, are usually often

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:47.300
'cause you're envious of it. Or because, uh,
if you know the main idea of the Shadow? The

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:50.380
shadow is the side of yourself that you don't
like. The shadow is the side of yourself that

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.450
you want to get rid of; that you don't want
to show to other people that you wish wasn't

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:57.320
there, just the secret side that you try not
to show anyone. The reason you don't want

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:01.390
to be on a reality show is because that side's
going to come out. So whenever you meet somebody

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:05.250
and you have an instant dislike to them, you
just meet someone for just no reason you just

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:09.910
instantly dislike them, the reason you have
that emotion, is either envy or you're seeing

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:12.982
your shadow, you're seeing the side of yourself
that you don't like. That you don't want to

00:22:12.982 --> 00:22:16.930
have that you want to cut out in that person
that's why else would you have that extreme

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:22.490
a reaction to them.
Um, the next one, I think is very important.

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:28.030
It's like saying yes to everything, within
reason. Saying yes to new things. I meet so

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:32.220
many people who have sabotaged their own careers
because they say "I'm not going to do that

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.990
because I'm not getting paid for it" or I'm
not going to do it, even though they want

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:38.400
to do it, it's something that they want to
do, you know, or they not getting enough respect,

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.270
I'm leaving this whole thing. Then the person
who takes their place like wins some award

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:46.070
or something. I've seen this happen so many
times and most of the people who got to where

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:51.210
they got to, did it by just you know saying
yes to new things, even if they didn't always

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:54.980
know what they were. Even if they weren't
getting properly compensated when they were

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:59.290
trying to get there and so many people kind
of told them to do things over ego battles.

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:04.900
And one person who I love is Joseph Campbell
the, the professor of mythology. And his two

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.970
great sayings, Do you guys know. Do you guys
know Joseph Campbell? So a few people. He's

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:13.880
great. Great guy he studied all mythologies
and religions of the world and summed them

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:18.250
up so we can look at our culture and see what
our myths are that allow us to keep on functioning.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:23.060
He knows everything about life; he's genius.
But his two great quotes: one is "Follow your

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:29.150
bliss"; here's another great quote "The insecure
way is the secure way" and the meaning of

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:35.880
that it's really important to know especially
at the age we're at is that you know all your

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:41.030
life you're told to make the safe decision.
You know, go get a job, to do something that

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:45.250
pays a lot of money because then you're gonna
be secure. The thing about that is that if

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:50.321
you make those choices either for money or
for security, you know, if you say, if you

00:23:50.321 --> 00:23:54.331
just work at that job for three, four, five,
six years, seven years and you're getting

00:23:54.331 --> 00:23:59.700
that money. All of that money goes away and
you've got nothing. You're screwed. And there

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:05.470
goes seven years and you've got nothing. Versus,
you make the choices that comes from you passion.

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:10.750
The truth is that the money probably won't
come. For the like first six months or year

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:14.600
or maybe after two years you can feed and
clothe yourself. Or maybe you can have a roof

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:18.470
over your head. If you're really good at it
maybe over five years you can finally get

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:23.710
to where other people got in just a little
bit of time. And the fact is, and I know for

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:27.280
myself, when I wanted to write, my parents
literally cut me off financially. I had to

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:32.580
cover the rest of college myself. I was so
broke. I spend my money on culture because

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:36.630
I love movies and books and TVs and stuff.
And movies and books and music. So I could

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:41.690
like spend my last five bucks to see a movie
like a repertory cinema and eat like someone's

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:44.770
left over popcorn that they left on the seat
because I literally had no money. That literally

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:49.120
was the best decision I ever made for my life.
The point being this, if you follow your bliss,

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:53.580
you follow your passion, if you do the thing
that you really, really, care about, and yes,

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.810
half the people who are listening will say
like 'Well I don't know what my passion is."

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:59.460
But there's something that you like that you
enjoy doing so you find out if that's your

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:04.450
passion. But you follow that thing. And you
keep doing it. You can, the money can go.

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:08.080
Maybe you never get to that place where you
make enough money. But the truth is that you

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.670
always have your passion. You can lose the
money but your passion is still there. That's

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:14.160
fulfilled. And you can be happy with what
you've done. Living your life, people can't

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:17.480
take that away.
The truth is that the insecure way, is really

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:22.020
the secure way because that's the most secure
place to be.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:26.850
Last lesson: is that everyone loves you when
you're dead which to me I always think about

00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:29.260
and I think it's true, it feels like a flip
title that "Everyone Loves You When You're

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:36.120
Dead" but it's really sort of a positive message.
In my mind because if you realize that most

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:40.380
of the negative stuff that people say is competition.
And the only reason they love you when you're

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:43.810
dead is because you are no longer competition
to them and then they can say nice things.

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:46.550
Not only are you no longer competition, you
have been appropriately punished for your

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:52.010
success. So if you remember that, it makes
it easier to walk through life know that whatever

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:56.470
shit that I'm dealing with is not really gonna
matter when I'm dead so maybe my optimistic

00:25:56.470 --> 00:26:01.560
message to close this with is you know:
Live each day as if you have a fatal disease.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.300
[chuckle]
Really I think it helps you make your priorities

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.520
set. If you are John Hartford and only have
a couple years left. What you're going to

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:12.511
do and decide to start doing it now.
Uh, so that's it. That's what I thought I

00:26:12.511 --> 00:26:15.820
would talk about today. Let's uh we'll do
a couple of questions. If there are no questions,

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:18.270
I'll read a couple of those emails to kind
of close things off.

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:19.770
[clears throat]
[pause]

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:25.260
Yeah, um, yep.
&gt;&gt;Male #4: We have a microphone over here.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:28.101
&gt;&gt;Neil: You know I was told I could come in
and talk about videos and things like that

00:26:28.101 --> 00:26:30.080
but you guys know more about videos than I
know. You're probably sick of fucking videos.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.100
&gt;&gt;Male #5: We never get sick of videos.
&gt;&gt;Neil: Um is that true?

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:40.770
[audience responds inaudibly]
[audience laughs]

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:49.980
&gt;&gt;Male #5: So I saw a, I saw a blog post from
you, um, couple days ago, copy writer, copy

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.840
editors-
&gt;&gt;Neil: Um, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:56.950
&gt;&gt;Male#5: at the New York Times which was
really funny and uh, I was wondering if you'd

00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:03.160
talk a little bit of the experience of you
as a writer dealing with these big publications

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:07.350
and having to go through these gatekeepers
who really control really word for word what

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:13.130
you're saying. And how you're presenting and
ideas and really change those ideas via versus

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:17.864
say as a like as a blogger or someone or someone
who is on Twitter where you have control of

00:27:17.864 --> 00:27:22.110
your own words. And how's that changed for
you.

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:29.120
&gt;&gt;Neil: And I think and I think it's a good,
it's a good thought that one advantage in

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:37.080
this sort of blog you know make your own video
world is that advantages is that hey, there

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:40.550
is no, I mean there is some decency stuff,
but really you get your idea out there as

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:46.890
you want it unfiltered. So I think the good
side of say of just being a blogger is that

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:49.690
you get to communicate your ideas exactly
as you want them, the length you want, what

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:54.290
you want, put the paragraph breaks where you
want. The bad news of that is you don't get

00:27:54.290 --> 00:28:01.090
the advantage of good mentors. I can guarantee
it, if I was in that world, I would not being

00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:05.620
on my seventh fucking New York Times best
seller which is insane. Like which I can't

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:12.600
even fathom that I even have that in my life.
But I did have good editors who were not just

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.730
say friends who were giving advice but who
were saying "I can't publish this because

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:20.190
this is going to reflect badly on our publication
of our name if I don't fix this stuff and

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:24.330
tell you the rules by which I'm fixing this.
If I didn't have good editors who let's just

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:29.590
say changed stuff, censored stuff, organized
stuff, there's no way I could have written

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:34.610
like a book that would be readable from front
to back. There's no fucking way. So I feel

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:40.710
like having good mentors whose reputation
is at stake by what you're doing whether it's

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:45.710
your a film maker and someone's invested twenty
million dollars or something or you're a writer

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:50.210
and someone's going to put it in their magazine.
It's so essential to becoming a writer.

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:55.100
And I agree some of that is lost but especially
now as far as journalism goes, it's probably

00:28:55.100 --> 00:29:00.950
like the worst place ever which is that you
just need to be first with a piece of news.

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:04.330
That's all; it doesn't even has to be news.
If you've got the fucking scoop that Justin

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:09.250
Bieber got a haircut a half an hour before
some other thing, and you get like one thousand

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:12.660
other sources pick that up and link in and
you get a lot of comments then you fucking

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:17.110
succeeded and your editors are happy. Versus
having a unique voice in writing. So I really

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:22.930
think we're in this kind of scary place. I
really know that this new book what's a lot

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:27.761
of the publicity and I've watched it happen,
mining out these little tidbits that some

00:29:27.761 --> 00:29:31.870
celebrity said to these sites and watching
sort of take wings all over the Internet.

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:36.440
And it's been fascinating. It's been fascinating
to watch like kind of how it works and talking

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:42.220
to these journalist is a horrible place because
uh, this is giant popularity contest going

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:47.060
online and who knows art or culture knows
that the best stuff is not popular in the

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:50.790
moment because it's new. And if you are writer
and you are writing something from passion,

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:55.120
that is not going to get as many links as
that Justin Bieber got a haircut or Charlie

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:59.990
Sheen made up a new word thing where, you
know, where ah, we're gonna get all the incoming

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:03.131
links. And now they can track it now and they
say "No you're not getting enough clicks so

00:30:03.131 --> 00:30:08.660
you're gone," even though you're the best
writer there. I think we're in sort of interesting

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:12.860
moments but I think it's going to shake out.
And what's going to ultimately happen when

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:16.880
everyone's writing about the same fucking
people that we're all sick of already. Wasn't

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.140
it amazing to watch, and I'm going on a long
answer, but wasn't it amazing to watch that

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:25.340
Charlie Sheen, like, sincerely was saying
warlock and winning and tiger blood and then

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:29.191
within a week, he's already being parodied
it in a video. Like that's how fast our culture

00:30:29.191 --> 00:30:37.421
is moving now. That the sincere catch phrases
become parodied and jokes within a week. It

00:30:37.421 --> 00:30:42.170
was amazing to watch the speed at which that
happened. So I think, obviously you guys are

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:46.111
part of it, we're really in an interesting
moment, transitional moment in our culture.

00:30:46.111 --> 00:30:47.111
Yeah

00:30:47.111 --> 00:30:51.100
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Hey Neil. Thanks for coming. I
was really curious about the thing you were

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.450
talking about at the very beginning about
the mask falling and building rapport with

00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:58.900
some of these people that you've talked to.
Not just celebrities, but building rapport

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:03.809
with anybody like your friend or just anybody
you meet for the first time. And kind of also

00:31:03.809 --> 00:31:07.230
the, I know you could riff on this for a long
time. I am also interested in this concept

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:13.130
of like balance with rapport. Like Wayne Elise
talks about-about using 'I statements' and

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:17.890
relating to the other person. And trying to
throw in bits of yourself as your trying to

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:22.340
talk with somebody else. Sort of like how
do you balance that and what are your thoughts

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:24.260
on the rapport building stuff.

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:27.230
&gt;&gt;Neil: Rapport building, I think rapport
building is really important. And this book

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:30.970
to me is really a lot about rapport building
which is building that connection with people.

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:33.761
Um, and do you mean it in terms whether maybe
it's an interview? Because I have certain

00:31:33.761 --> 00:31:38.030
techniques I use in an interview versus maybe
a one-on-one situation or kind of both?

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:42.920
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Yeah, both, like yeah, like what
do you do to like get somebody to open up

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.580
and get to see the real them?

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:49.170
&gt;&gt;Neil: Yeah, cool. Yeah, I think, I think
the number one things that apply over all,

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:53.370
whether it's uh, in a, especially in interviews,
especially when in situations when meeting

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:56.890
people are being non judgmental is one of
the most important qualities you can have

00:31:56.890 --> 00:32:01.690
as a person. People who are judgmental make
people closed off because they just say things

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:07.370
to get them. People say things just to get
them to approve of you. So also being curious

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:11.130
coming from a natural place of curiosity,
to me, whether it's with "The Game" stuff

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:14.780
and guys who are running around trying to
start these conversations with people. If

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:18.490
you didn't come from a natural place of curiosity
or really care about what you were asking

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:21.750
about or what the person had to say, it would
go flat. It was the same with the interviews

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:25.880
and same with connecting with someone. Like
I find and I find that curiosity is the most

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:28.790
important tool you can have. Like I'll be
at a dinner party, it's boring. I'll just

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:33.890
think "what's interesting about that person
there" and I'll share. Then I'll pick it out.

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:38.700
You know, for example if they are a Like they
are a radio host or something. I'll just think,

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:43.790
I'm curious why, you know, a lot of radio
hosts I find, do you ever just not want to

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:47.230
go in every morning and you have to do it?
And what if like you find out your wife cheated

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:51.421
on you, how do you go in-in the morning when
you when you wish or something heavy going

00:32:51.421 --> 00:32:55.361
on and you got to be morning zoo man? And
also if you do that like you know guys who

00:32:55.361 --> 00:32:57.630
are morning zoo men, I'm just kind of riffing
on this but you know, this is where I'll start

00:32:57.630 --> 00:33:02.620
going. Is that I won't ask anything with an
agenda, you know. If you as soon as you want

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:05.810
to get something from someone, they are just
kind of like going to back off. Even if I

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:09.830
have an agenda, I'll always let them, them
raise it first. So anyway, I think we get

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:13.601
the point about curiosity, a natural curiosity
is the best way to connect with someone and

00:33:13.601 --> 00:33:16.810
start that conversation. As well as being
nonjudgmental so they're open explaining it.

00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:20.580
Combine that with deep listening. When you're
really listening for what they're saying,

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:24.300
and if they falter you know if they falter,
you know what's going on. And I love listening

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.500
and listening for cues. Like if you're in
a restaurant and you say and she says the

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:32.150
specials, and you say "How's the special?"And
she goes, 'uh', then you already know it sucks.

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:36.110
If she pauses before she tells you it's good,
you already know it sucks. [laughs]

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:40.060
So deep listening is important so like when
someone's about to pause, you're like 'what's

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:44.880
the truth behind that?' So deep listening
is the other thing and soon they forget who

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.950
you are and what your status is and what's
going on. They're sort of like, into this

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:49.140
conversation.

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:52.300
Um, and the other thing I was going to say
is when there's an elephant in the room and

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:55.920
the elephant room is if I'm interviewing someone
who has a big scandal or if you're talking

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.240
to someone and it's about your raise, or you
want a raise or you want something from them

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:02.740
because they are a higher status person, let
them bring up the elephant in the room. You

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:06.090
can lead them toward it. Once they bring it
up, then you're just asking the follow up

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:10.060
questions so I always allow, if somebody's
got a huge scandal, I'll bring it up from

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:13.410
that. Either I'll wait for them to bring it
up or if they're not bringing it up, um, I'll

00:34:13.410 --> 00:34:18.561
try to ask questions from their point of view.
For example, if I'm interviewing somebody

00:34:18.561 --> 00:34:23.030
and they just, uh, whatever the scandal is,
instead of just saying 'well, tell me about

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:25.740
the scandal' or what the public wants to know.
I don't care about what the public wants to

00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:29.850
know. I care about what they are going through
and what are they thinking about this. If

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:33.560
you are trying to find out who they are dating,
for example, and you just say "Who are you

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:38.491
dating?" They'll just say "I can't tell you,
it's private."Uh, if but instead, you know,

00:34:38.491 --> 00:34:40.740
because they're not thinking 'who am I dating'
because they know who they are dating, but

00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:44.560
if you ask 'Are you sick of everyone asking
you who you're fucking dating?' they're like

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:48.690
"Yeah" and they'll start talking about it
and now that door is open. So just finding,

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:53.561
I guess the other the skill is besides those
would be like, uh, empathy, which is, which

00:34:53.561 --> 00:34:57.470
I'm trying to think, like they're thinking.
I'm trying to ask questions from their point

00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:58.770
of view not from what other people want to
know.

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:04.920
So there's a few things. If you want one good
sneaky thing, it's called trance words and

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:09.630
I'll just share that. It's a cool idea. This
is something that can apply to people. People

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:15.310
have like certain words that they load with
meaning, right? If somebody says, uh, I was

00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:19.460
doing an interview with Tom Cruise, and he
was like, I think the word was extraordinary

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:22.980
and he was like "Man, it was just extraordinary"
and he like loads that with meaning. But I

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:26.030
talk like fucking talking about passion or
something; maybe passion is my trance word.

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:30.120
Certain words mean something to him. When
he said extraordinary, you can't say "Wouldn't

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:33.321
it be great?" you have to say "wouldn't it
be extraordinary" if we went and did that.

00:35:33.321 --> 00:35:37.670
Wouldn't it be fucking extraordinary?
[laughter]Like yeah man, it'd be great. Which

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:42.400
I did. I did that with, I also knew the word
peace and extraordinary were important to

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:46.390
him. So I said "wouldn't be extraordinary
if you show me around Scientology Center?"

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:50.440
[laughs] And he did. [laughs]
So, you have to listen for those words; you

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:54.570
don't even have to know what the meaning is
but they invest extra emotional meaning. And

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:59.540
if you want to be a really N-L-P-E about it,
these things are fun, right, those little

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:02.650
things about the personality. If you really
want to be all N-L-P about it, like it'd be

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:06.020
fucking extraordinary. Watch what gesture
he does and you do the same gesture. Wouldn't'

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:11.070
it be fucking extraordinary to do that? [laughs]
I'll tell you one more really fun one since

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:13.900
we're talking; this is one of my favorite
ones. And I think his is an important rapport

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.880
thing. Is when we were doing "The Game", it
always comes down to "The Game" because it

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:20.200
is fucking interesting, but when we were doing
the game, we studied from everything to do

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:24.951
good. We read books on sexuality and marketing
and everything and some tips we got were from

00:36:24.951 --> 00:36:30.350
like a book on selling houses. And here are
two tips that kind of go with rapport and

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:34.661
also for getting your agenda from a book on
selling house. Two great tips. One is that

00:36:34.661 --> 00:36:37.619
you don't let somebody say no. So if you're
showing someone around a house and if you

00:36:37.619 --> 00:36:41.880
are a guy going for a phone number and your
trying to get a job and you're on the fence,

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:46.930
For your showing them around the house and
you feel the No is coming, here's the bedroom,

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:49.980
do you feel like you guys are interested and
you feel like they're backing off. You don't

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:53.550
back them into no response. There's a principle
called commitment and consistency. As soon

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:56.660
as someone says no, they're gonna stick with
that no even if they didn't mean it at the

00:36:56.660 --> 00:37:00.070
time. So you're like, you know what? You guys
haven't seen the kitchen. Check out the flooring

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:03.770
in the kitchen. You take them somewhere, you
move them around, take them somewhere else.

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:07.751
You then see how they feel about it and if
you're getting that no, you move them around

00:37:07.751 --> 00:37:11.010
somewhere else. Show them another positive
feature and then you see how it's going. Once

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:13.780
they say that first No, they are stuck in
that no.

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:17.930
Second thing and this is fucking awesome.
Let's just say, you moved them into the kitchen

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:22.050
and they've seen all the great features and
now they want the house. And they say, "We

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:25.370
want the house." You say 'great' and I'll
prepare an offer. What do you guys want to

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:30.950
offer? They say whatever it is, probably in
this economy somewhere around two hundred

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:35.790
thousand dollars. They say "Great. Pleasure,
I'll call you tomorrow," and you leave. They

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:40.180
are going to get buyers' remorse. The mistake
is you are, you got along, you had this nice

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:44.420
friendship; they trusted you. And as soon
as you got the deal made, you were gone. So

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:48.580
the other thing I learned from selling houses,
once you close the deal, you know you stick

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:52.160
it around a little bit so they know it wasn't
just about closing the deal. So this is true

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:56.050
when you are out getting a girls phone number.
If you got the phone number, say "Awesome,

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:58.960
I'll call you tomorrow for plans," and then
you left. She's more likely to flake than

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:01.990
if you waited and said "Oh, the other thing
I forgot to tell you is," and you told another

00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:05.530
funny story, and then you left then she'll
know it wasn't just about closing the deal,

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:09.250
or getting the phone number. It was about
making a connection with someone. So fun question.

00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:11.690
Let's do a couple more because I know my answers
are going way too long. [chuckles]

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:16.490
&gt;&gt;Female #2: So I so, I recently read Patty
Smith's book "Just Kid"

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:17.490
&gt;&gt;Neil: "Just Kids," yeah.

00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:28.820
&gt;&gt;Female #2: And something I thought was really
interesting was the benefit of the passage

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:37.560
of time. So when she was talking about like
hanging out with this woman who seemed like

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.820
kind of interesting, and that it turns out
later it was Janis Joplin and what that really

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:40.820
meant. But that her life at the time was these
series of moments, and like trying to deal

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:41.820
with shit, and later she could reflect back
on the other layers of meaning. I think that's

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:45.650
interesting for your example, for Pet Sounds
too.

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:50.940
&gt;&gt;Neil: Yeah.
&gt;&gt;Female #2: When you are talking about this

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:52.020
sort of anthology that you're building in
this folder and then later you're like, 'Oh

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:53.760
this is totally shit,' on the flip side like
have you had any of those moments where the

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:54.770
benefit of time where you were like 'Oh that
was actually like a turning point,'

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:55.770
&gt;&gt;Neil: Oh, for sure.
&gt;&gt;Female #2: I would just like to hear some

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:57.220
of these sorts of things.
&gt;&gt;Neil: For me like with the anthology was

00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:00.270
looking through it and realizing that there
were specific questions that I was asking

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:04.330
artists at certain points of my life because
I was trying to figure out the answer for

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:08.980
myself. I saw these things almost like therapy
for me because I never went through therapy.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:12.540
So I would be asked like, for example, I can
really see my own growth through the book

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:16.570
which I never expected. From my first interview
with Led Zeppelin, I was really young with

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:19.880
an opportunity to interview Robert Plant and
Jimmy Page. They were like titans of rock

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:23.960
and I was really young and nervous. And to
me there was important as great musicians

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:26.800
as they were as like guys who had sex a lot.
Because probably at that point, I had slept

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:30.710
with like two girls or something. And so I
remember I just kept asking them questions

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:33.750
like about at one point Jimmy Page says to
us "Do you have any questions for us that

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:40.070
don't involve sex?" [laughs]. So at that point
I was just a guy who and then and later my

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:45.820
questions start to turn like to work, you
know. If you had your choice between um, uh,

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:49.150
what's more important what's more important
in the world, the work you've done or your

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:52.570
children? What's more important? Cause I was
trying to figure out because I work so hard

00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:56.220
but I was not taking care of family. And I
started asking questions about intimacy; about

00:39:56.220 --> 00:40:00.153
work avoidance; being, you know, working so
hard being a way to avoiding intimacy. So

00:40:00.153 --> 00:40:04.119
I can see through those questions that I read
it exactly where I was on like, my journey

00:40:04.119 --> 00:40:07.400
in life and even my current like Howard Stern
issue of Rolling Stone issue and the things

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:11.750
that I'm dealing with, you know, now. I see
in those in those interviews to me even though

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:16.220
I'm just I'm an anonymous guy asking questions
like tells me so much about myself and where

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:18.250
and who I was. It was fascinating. It's a
cool question.

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:21.310
I gotta read "Just Kids." Everyone says it's
really good Patty Smith book. You guys should

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:24.220
have her come in and speak. [laughs] And she's
in the book and she says something great in

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:29.260
the book because she disappeared for a bunch
of years to be a mother and she got a lot

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:32.119
of shit for it. She said being a mother is
really the most noble thing you could do.

00:40:32.119 --> 00:40:36.900
It's hard, often undignified work, but I'm
as proud of that as I am any of my albums

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:40.280
and stuff 'cause the public just thinks if
you're not feeding us new albums, you're obviously

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.811
wasting your life. And her answer to that
was just awesome.

00:40:42.811 --> 00:40:47.070
Cool are there any more questions? I'll read
you guys two emails to go and then we'll let

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:53.204
you guys take off. Unless you have to get
back to work, you probably do. Fuck it. [laughs]

00:40:53.204 --> 00:40:54.960
I'll just read it to you now, I'll read you
a sample and we'll end on this. These are

00:40:54.960 --> 00:41:01.970
the kind of emails I get in my in box.
"Um, Dear Neil, How do I remove semen stains

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:05.340
from clothing?" [laughs]
[audience laughs loudly]

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:08.310
I don't know why they ask me.
"I ask because I had an unfortunate misfire

00:41:08.310 --> 00:41:13.130
the other night [chuckles] and I don't want
to throw these clothes away. I tried the washing

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:17.950
machine with regular detergent but it's not
working. PS: I did a search. I couldn't find

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:22.090
anything helpful except using seltzer but
I don't know what seltzer is. Can you help?"

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:24.710
[audience laughs loudly]
It's so sad, right?

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:29.280
I actually answered that. I told him about
this stuff called Zout; it really works. [laughs]

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:35.180
"Dear Neil, What do you think about psychiatric
drugs and jerking off? I have taken Prozac,

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:41.020
Paxil, Celexa, Seroquel, Zyprexa, Geodon and
some other shit. Celexa couldn't make me come

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:45.480
although I finally did jack me off for like
twenty minutes straight. What a workout. No

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:48.570
wonder my right arms are massively bigger
than my left ones." [laughs]

00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:54.619
Like how many arms does this guy have?
"Do you know, does you know the best medication

00:41:54.619 --> 00:41:59.520
to take for jacking off?"
Um, let's see which one. I'll read you like

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:04.931
two more.
Um, OK, there was an idea in "The Game" called

00:42:04.931 --> 00:42:08.600
'peacocking' which was dressing to stand out
from everybody else in some way. And this

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.500
guy writes,
"Dear Neil, I've got an idea for peacocking.

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:17.180
Dressing up like a monk. No one's ever tried
it before so it's definitely going to get

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:22.230
me laid." [laughs]
Maybe he's going for altar boys, right?

00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:27.760
And this is the most heart-breaking one. Uh,
he writes "This is my long term plan for success.

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:32.369
Step one, zero to five years increased general
social skills and confidence with interacting

00:42:32.369 --> 00:42:36.530
with other people. Also, in this time, I hope
to lose my remaining body fat then increase

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:39.190
my muscle by fifty pounds". That's zero to
five years.

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:43.730
"Step two, five to seven years, during this
period I hope to muster the confidence to

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:47.980
approach a woman. I think my body and previous
social skills will aid in this." [laughs]

00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:51.650
Makes you feel good, makes you realize, when
I guy comes up to you and you're a woman listening

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:56.830
like a guy a guy comes up to you, you really
hold his entire self-esteem in your hands.

00:42:56.830 --> 00:43:01.690
"Step three, seven to ten years. At this point,
I will have no fear of approaching women so

00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:05.320
I can start to build my skills up. I will
practice at least one hundred ten minus x

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:11.020
hours a week with x being the number of hours
I'm working." So clearly an engineering student.

00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:15.600
"Step four, ten to fifteen years. In this
time period my skills will be getting pretty

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:21.020
good. So within these five years, I hope to
kiss a girl." [laughs] I k now, it gets worse.
