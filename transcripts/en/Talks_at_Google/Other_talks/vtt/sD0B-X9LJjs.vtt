00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
&gt;&gt; Hi, everyone. Welcome to today’s Authors
at Google event. After the talk, we’re going

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.509
to have a Q and A session, and I’d like
to remind everyone to please use the microphone

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:14.349
in the middle of the room, if you have questions.
It’s my pleasure to introduce Christopher

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:20.779
Hitchens. Mr. Hitchens was born in England,
and educated at Oxford. In 1981, he migrated

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.190
to the US, and recently, became a US citizen.
He’s the author of a number of notable books

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.070
including “Why Orwell Matters” and “Letters
to a Young Contrarian.” As one of our most

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.880
notable public intellectuals, he has been
a columnist at “Vanity Fair”, “The Atlantic,”

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.150
“The Nation,” “Slate” and “Free
Inquiry,” and taught at the New School,

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.969
UC Berkeley, and the University of Pittsburgh.
In his new book, “God Is Not Great,” he

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:51.989
lines up the case against religion which he
spent a lifetime developing with anger, humor

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.050
and a formidable style of argument that defines
all of Mr. Hitchens’s work. About the book,

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.359
Michael Kinsley wrote in the New York Times,
“Hitchens has outfoxed the Hitchens watchers

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.770
by writing a serious and deeply-thought book,
totally consistent with his beliefs of the

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.140
lifetime. And God should be flattered; unlike
most of those clamoring for his attention,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.630
Hitchens treats him like an adult. Ever contrarian,
and always eloquent, he’s here today to

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.110
discuss the book, take your questions, and
take on anyone who dares to challenge him

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.450
to a debate. He’ll be signing books afterwards.
And, with that, please join me in welcoming

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:37.231
Christopher Hitchens to Google.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Thank you, darling. Sweet. Well,

00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:43.830
thank you so much for that suspiciously grudging
introduction. And thank you very much, ladies

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.710
and gentlemen, for coming. I understand we’ve
only got the balance of an hour together so,

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:57.860
I’ll try and break the rule of a lifetime
and be terse. I think I’ll put it like this.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:06.140
It’s true that publishers sometimes want
to put a catchy or suggestive or challenging

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.709
title, subtitle on a book. And so, when we
hit upon or they hit upon, well, how religion

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.230
poisons and why religion poisons everything,
I knew what would happen, people would come

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.430
up to me, they'd say, you mean absolutely
everything, you mean the whole thing? They’d

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.459
take me literally. I thought, well, all right.
One of the things you have to do in life as

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:33.090
an author is live up to your damn subtitle.
So, today, I’d defend the subtitle because

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.950
I think the title probably, when it came to
me in the shower, I realized, it pretty much

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.709
does speak for itself. Unlike that sign outside
Little Rock airport, huge--we had a black

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:52.469
sign that you see from the airport that says,
just "Jesus," a word I have used myself, and

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:56.340
a name I know but putting it like that seems
to say both too much and too little, you know

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:04.569
what I mean? Well, here’s how religion has
this effect, in my opinion: It is derived

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.939
from the childhood of our species, from the
bawling, fearful period of infancy. It comes

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:15.710
from the time when we did not know that we
lived on an orb. We thought we lived on a

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:24.221
disc. And we did not know that we went around
the sun or that the sky was not a dome, when

00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:29.439
we didn’t know that there was a germ theory
to explain disease, and innumerable theories

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:35.709
for the explanation of things like famine.
It comes from a time when we had no good answers,

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.110
but because we are pattern-seeking animals,
a good thing about us, and because we will

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:47.840
prefer even a conspiracy theory or junk theory
to no theory at all, a bad thing about us.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.359
This is and was our first attempt of philosophy,
just as in some ways, it was our first attempt

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:57.810
at science, and it was all founded on and
remains founded on a complete misapprehension

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.340
about the origins, first of the universe,
and, second, about human nature. We now know

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.819
a great deal about the origins of the universe,
and a great deal about our own nature. I just

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.230
had my DNA sequenced by National Geographic.
You should all by the way get this done. It’s

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.030
incredibly important to find out how racism
and creationism would be abolished by this

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.830
extraordinary scientific breakthrough, how
you can find out your kinship with all your

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.380
fellow creatures originating in Africa; but
also, your kinship with other forms of life

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.830
including not just animal but plant, and you
get an idea of how you are part of nature,

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:41.060
and how that’s wonderful enough. And we
know from Stephen Hawking and from any others,

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.320
Steven Weinberg and many other great physicists,
an enormous amount now about what Professor

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.260
Weinberg's brilliant book calls The First
Three Minutes, the concept of the Big Bang.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:58.630
And we can be assured as we could probably
need be that neither this enormous explosion

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.810
that set the universe in motion, which is
still moving away from us in a great rate

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:09.870
nor this amazingly complex billion dollar--billion
year period of evolution--we can be pretty

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.850
certain it was not designed so that you and
I could be meeting in this room. We are not

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.500
the objects of either of these plans. These
plans don’t know we’re here. I’m sorry

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.900
to say, wouldn’t know or care if we stopped
being here. We have to face this alone with

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.350
the equipment, intellectual and moral, that
we’ve been given, or that we've acquired

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.330
or that is innate to us. And here’s another
way in which religion poisons matters. It

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:42.620
begins by saying, well, why don't we lie to
ourselves instead, why don’t we pretend

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.530
that we’re not going to die, or that an
exception to be made at least in our own case

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:55.940
if we make the right propitiations or the
right moves. Why do we not pretend that the

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:03.190
things like modern diseases which we can sequence
now, sequence the genes of, like AIDS, are

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:08.530
the punishment for wickedness and fornication?
Why don't we keep fooling ourselves that there

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.780
is a divine superintendent of all this because
it would abolish the feeling of loneliness

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.460
and possibly even irrelevance that we might
otherwise--in other words, why don’t we

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.270
surrender to wish thinking? That poisons everything,
in my opinion. Right away, it attacks the

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:28.930
very basic integrity that we need to conduct
the scrupulous inquiries, investigations,

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:34.400
experiments, interrogations of evidence that
we need to survive, and to prosper and to

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.990
grow. And it's no coincidence, no accident
that almost every scientific advance has been

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.430
made in the teeth of religious opposition
of one form or another that says we shouldn’t

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.870
be tampering with God’s design. I suppose
the most recent and most dangerous one of

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:53.500
these is the attempt to limit stem cell research.
But everyone could probably think of all other

00:06:53.500 --> 00:07:00.110
forms of scientific research and inquiry,
especially medical that had led to religious

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:05.620
persecution, in reprisal. Thirdly, it’s
an attack, I think, on what’s also very

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:10.390
important to us, our innate morality. If there’s
one point that I get made more than another

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:16.310
to me when I go and debate religious people,
it's this: They say, where would your morals

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:23.540
come from if there was no God? It’s actually--it’s
a question that’s posed in Dostoyevsky's

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.660
wonderful novel, The Brothers Karamazov, one
of the brothers says--Snelyakov, actually,

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:35.420
the wicked one, says it. If God is dead, isn’t
everything permitted, isn’t everything permissible?

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:39.060
Where would our ethics be if there was no
superintending duty? This, again, seems to

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:45.310
me a very profound insult to us in our very
deepest nature and character. It is not the

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:51.860
case, I submit to you, that we do not set
about butchering and raping and thieving from

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:57.300
each other right now only because we’re
afraid of a divine punishment or because we’re

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:02.450
looking for a divine reward. It's an extraordinarily
base and insulting thing to say to people.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:07.780
On my mother’s side, some of my ancestry
is Jewish. I don’t happen to believe the

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:12.410
story of Moses and Egypt or the exile or the
wandering and the Sinai. And in fact, now

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:17.010
even Israeli archaeology has shown that there
isn’t a word of truth to that story or really

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:22.330
any of the others; but take it to be true.
Am I expected to believe my mother’s ancestors

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.990
got all the way to Mount Sinai, quite a trek,
under the impression until they got there

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:33.099
that rape, murder, perjury, and theft were
okay, only to be told when they got to the

00:08:33.099 --> 00:08:38.729
foot of Mount Sinai, bad news, none of these
things are kosher at all. They’re all forbidden.

00:08:38.729 --> 00:08:45.170
I don’t think so. I think, I think we can--actually,
I have a better explanation ever since--superior

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:50.410
as well as better--that no one would have
been able to get as far as Mount Sinai or

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:55.720
any other mountain or in any other direction
unless they had known that human solidarity

00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:02.499
demands that we look upon each other as brothers
and sisters, and that we forbid activities

00:09:02.499 --> 00:09:08.860
such as murder, rape, perjury, and theft.
This is innate in us. If those activities

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:13.750
are not innate, the sociopaths who don't understand
the needs of anyone but themselves and the

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:19.199
psychopaths who positively take pleasure in
breaking these rules, well, all we can say

00:09:19.199 --> 00:09:24.980
is, according to one theory, they are also
made in the image of God which makes the image

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:29.509
of God question rather problematic, does it
not or that they can be explained by a further

00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:33.699
and better research and have to be restrained
and disciplined meanwhile, but in no sense

00:09:33.699 --> 00:09:42.410
here is religion a help where it came to help
most which is to our morality, to our ethics.

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:48.050
Finally, I would say--not finally because
I’m finished here, I’m not quite done.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:55.009
Don't relax. Everyone has got to drink, something
to eat, but on the poison question, I think

00:09:55.009 --> 00:10:01.949
there’s the real temptation of something
very poisonous to human society and human

00:10:01.949 --> 00:10:09.370
relations which is the fear of freedom, the
wish to be slaves, the wish to be told what

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:15.610
to do. Now, just as we all like to think and
we live under written documents and proclamations

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:21.809
that encourage us to think that it is our
birth right and our most precious need to

00:10:21.809 --> 00:10:27.960
be free, to be liberated, to be untrammeled.
So we also knew that unfortunately the innate

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:33.230
in people is the servile, is the wish to be
told what to do, is the adoration for strong

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:41.220
and brutal and cruel leaders, that this other
baser element of the human makeup has to be

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:47.019
accounted for and it gives us a great deal
of trouble around the world as we speak. Religion,

00:10:47.019 --> 00:10:53.540
in my view, is a reification, a distillation
of this wish to be a serf, to be a slave.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:11:01.759
Ask yourself if you really wish it was true
that there was a celestial dictatorship that

00:11:01.759 --> 00:11:06.480
watched over you from the moment you were
born, actually the moment you were conceived,

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:12.300
all through life, night and day, knew your
thoughts, waking and sleeping, could in fact

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:17.829
convict you of thought crime, the absolute--the
absolute definition of a dictatorship, can

00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:21.930
convict you for what you think or what you
privately want, what you’re talking about

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:27.990
to yourself, that admonishes you like this
under permanent surveillance, control and

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:31.749
supervision and doesn’t even let go of you
when you’re dead because that’s when the

00:11:31.749 --> 00:11:39.519
real fun begins. Now, my question is this--my
question is this, who wishes that that were

00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:45.370
true? Who wants to live the life of a serf
in a celestial North Korea? I’ve been to

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:50.619
North Korea. I’m one of the very few writers
who has. I’m indeed the only writer who’s

00:11:50.619 --> 00:11:55.720
been to all three axis of evil countries,
Iran, Iraq and North Korea. And I can tell

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.740
you North Korea is the most religious state
I’ve ever been to. I used to wonder when

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:03.769
I was a kid, what would it be like praising
God and thanking him all day and all night?

00:12:03.769 --> 00:12:08.589
Well, now I know because North Korea is a
completely worshipful state. It's set up only

00:12:08.589 --> 00:12:13.540
to do that, for adoration and it’s only
one short of a trinity. They have a father

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:18.290
and the son, as you know, the Dear Leader
and the Great Leader. The father is still

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:24.180
the president of the country. He’s been
dead for 15 years, but Kim Jong-il, the little

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:30.180
one, is only the head of the party and the
Army. His father is still the president, head

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:36.949
of the state. So you have in North Korea what
you might call a necrocracy or what I also--I

00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:43.459
called them mausolocracy, thanatocracy. One--just
one short of a trinity; father, son, maybe

00:12:43.459 --> 00:12:49.079
no holy ghost, but they do say that when the
birth of the younger one took place, the birds

00:12:49.079 --> 00:12:56.069
of Korea sang in Korean to mark the occasion.
This I’ve checked. It did not happen. Take

00:12:56.069 --> 00:13:01.779
my word for it. It didn't occur and I suppose
I should add they don’t threaten to follow

00:13:01.779 --> 00:13:07.230
you after you're dead. You can leave North
Korea. You can get out of their hell and their

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:13.829
paradise by dying. To the Christian and Muslim
one, you cannot. This is the wish to be a

00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:20.790
slave. And in my point of view, it’s poisonous
of human relations. Now, I’ve really babbled

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:27.129
for nearly twenty minutes. I’ll be quick.
It is argued, well, some religious people

00:13:27.129 --> 00:13:33.220
have done great things and have been motivated
to do so by their faith; the most cited case

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:37.839
in point I have found is that of Dr. Martin
Luther King, who I know I don’t need to

00:13:37.839 --> 00:13:44.829
explain to you about. Two quick things on
that: First, he was it’s true a minister.

00:13:44.829 --> 00:13:49.750
He did preach the Book of Exodus, the exile
of an enslaved and oppressed people as his

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:53.699
metaphor. But if he really meant it, he would
have said that the oppressed people, as the

00:13:53.699 --> 00:13:59.139
Book of Exodus finds them doing, were entitled
to kill anyone who stood on their way and

00:13:59.139 --> 00:14:05.259
take their land and their property, enslave
their women or kill their children, and commit

00:14:05.259 --> 00:14:13.410
genocide, rape, ethnic cleansing and forcible
theft of land. That’s what Exodus described

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:17.869
as happening--the full destruction of the
tribes. It's very fortunate that Dr. King

00:14:17.869 --> 00:14:22.850
only the meant the Bible at the most to be
used as a metaphor and after all he was using

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:27.161
the only book that he could be sure his audience
has ever already read. That’s the first

00:14:27.161 --> 00:14:32.680
thing. The second is, during his lifetime,
he was attacked all the time for having too

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:37.910
many secular and leftist non-believing friends,
the people like famous black secularists like

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:44.350
Bayard Rustin, A. Philip Randolph. These are
the men that did organize the march on Washington;

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:48.279
which leads me to my third observation which
is this: It’s a challenge I made now in

00:14:48.279 --> 00:14:56.209
debates with rabbis, with priests of all Christian
stripes, with imams. Once--I know this sounds

00:14:56.209 --> 00:15:01.119
like an opening of a joke about some bar,
but once also with a Buddhist nun in Miami.

00:15:01.119 --> 00:15:06.369
I asked them all. Here is my--here is my challenge.
You have to name me an ethical statement that

00:15:06.369 --> 00:15:14.000
was made or a moral action that was performed
by a religious person in the name of faith

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.689
that could not have been made as an action
or uttered as a statement by non--a person

00:15:18.689 --> 00:15:25.480
not of faith, a person of no faith. You have
to do that. Not so far and I’ve dealt at

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.429
quite a high level with the religious, no
takers. No one has been able to find me that.

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:34.649
That being the case, we're entitled to say,
I think, that religious faith serve as the

00:15:34.649 --> 00:15:40.459
requirements whereas if I was to ask anyone
in this room, think of a wicked thing said

00:15:40.459 --> 00:15:45.569
or an evil thing done by a person of faith
in the name of faith, no one would have a

00:15:45.569 --> 00:15:50.940
second of hesitation in thinking of one, would
they? It's interesting to realize how true

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:56.050
that is and how much true it's getting. Does
anyone ever listen to Dennis Prager’s Show?

00:15:56.050 --> 00:16:05.249
He’s a slightly loopy Christian broadcaster,
religious broadcaster, I should say. He’s

00:16:05.249 --> 00:16:09.559
more Jewish than Christian--Judaic-Christian
broadcaster who quite often rather generously

00:16:09.559 --> 00:16:12.819
has me on the show. And he asked me a question
the other day; he had a challenge of his own.

00:16:12.819 --> 00:16:17.120
He said, “You are to imagine that you’re
in a town late at night where you have never

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.329
been before, and you have no friends and it’s
getting dark. And through the darkness, you

00:16:21.329 --> 00:16:28.009
see coming towards you a group of men, let’s
say ten. Do you feel better or worse if you

00:16:28.009 --> 00:16:36.300
know that they’re just coming from a prayer
meeting?” This is Mr. Prager’s question

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:40.199
to me. I said, “Well, Mr. Prager, without
leaving you, from just without quitting the

00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:49.420
letter B, I can tell you I’ve had that experience
in Belfast, in Beirut, in Baghdad, in Bombay,

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:54.249
in Bosnia, and in Bethlehem. And if you see
anyone coming from a religious gathering,

00:16:54.249 --> 00:17:02.069
in any of those places, you know exactly how
fast you need to run. And no one has to explain

00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:05.949
to you why and I haven’t had to waste any
time telling you, have I, ladies and gentlemen?

00:17:05.949 --> 00:17:09.309
So I submit to you that it is those who are
people of faith who have the explaining to

00:17:09.309 --> 00:17:14.470
do, who have the justifying to do if this
is indeed the case. If they can't account

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:20.769
for anything about the origin of our cosmos
or our species, if they say that without them,

00:17:20.769 --> 00:17:26.510
we’d be without morals and make us seem
as if we are merely animals without faith,

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:32.450
if further, everybody can name an instance
where religion has made people actually behave

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:38.340
worse to one another and act as a retardant
upon the advances of knowledge and science

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:43.770
and information, I submit that the case to
be made is theirs rather than mine. We have

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:49.240
a better tradition. We’re not just arid
secularists and materialists, we on the atheist

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:56.880
side. We can point, through the Hubble telescope,
the fantastic, awe-inspiring majestic pictures

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:02.100
that are being taken now of the outer limits
of our universe, and who’s going to turn

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:08.510
away from those pictures and start gaping
again at the burning bush? We have smaller

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:13.130
microscopes that can examine for us the miracles
of the interior of the double helix and the

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:18.049
sheer beauty of that. The natural world is
wonderful enough, more wonderful than anything

00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:25.080
conjured by the fools who believe in astrology
or the supernatural. And we have a better

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:33.269
tradition politically against the popes and
the imams and the witch doctors and the divine

00:18:33.269 --> 00:18:39.540
right of kings and the whole long tradition
of civic repression combined with religion

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:44.809
that's known as theocracy. We have created
in the United States, the only country in

00:18:44.809 --> 00:18:52.110
the history of the world, written on founding
documents testable, organized, works in progress

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:57.041
based on the theory of human liberation and
the only constitution in the history of world

00:18:57.041 --> 00:19:03.740
that says that there shall be a separation
between the church and the state. God is never

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:09.420
mentioned in the United States Constitution
except in order to limit religion and keep

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:15.799
it out of politics and put it under legal
control. This achievement was described by

00:19:15.799 --> 00:19:21.260
President Jefferson whose biographer, I am
in a small way, to the Baptists of Danbury,

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:25.420
Connecticut in a letter after they reasoned
him for fear of persecution. By the way, who

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:30.850
do you think Baptists of Danbury, Connecticut
were afraid of being persecuted by? Anyone

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:32.190
knows?
MALE: The Methodists?

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:37.630
HITCHENS: No, the Congregationalists of Danbury,
Connecticut. People forget what it used to

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:42.990
be like, see how the Christians loved each
other, how they tried to repeat the European

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:48.000
passion of one religious sect repressing and
torturing another one. And as you probably

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
know, the president wrote back and saud, “No,
you may be assured that there will ever be

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.019
in this country a wall of separation between
the church and the state.” So I have a new

00:19:57.019 --> 00:20:01.309
slogan and I’m taking it on tour and I invite
you to join me in it and it goes like this,

00:20:01.309 --> 00:20:17.620
“Mr. Jefferson, build up that wall.” Okay,
thank you very much for coming.

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:23.090
And I’m all yours. And that was 25 minutes;
I hope that’s fair. And I’ll point out

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:26.860
the questions if you like because I don't
think anyone thinks that I’ve planted my

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:33.390
immediate family in this hole, but, Carol,
stay out of it. Bring it on.

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:42.870
&gt;&gt; 
Thank you for coming to Google.

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:48.309
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: It’s my honor.
&gt;&gt; So you make it sound really, really simple.

00:20:48.309 --> 00:20:52.890
I mean you have explanations for everything.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Yeah.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:58.980
&gt;&gt; And I agree with a lot of your arguments
and, you know, I lived in, like, a socialist

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:04.559
country. I mean, I come from Croatia so I,
you know, I empathize with a little bit of

00:21:04.559 --> 00:21:10.060
when you say like the axis of evil and especially
North Korea being a perfect theocracy, I can

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:16.330
relate to that. But I don't understand why
do you say that these people really want to

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:22.340
be enslaved, if you could explain this to
me. I mean, I think there’s really a system,

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:29.850
you know, like set up by a minority which
is really a brutal system and I don't understand

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:33.880
about the part, like, you know, like this
is something that these people want so...

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:38.030
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Did you say you were Croatian?
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:43.309
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Yeah. Well, then you--then I
would be upset if you thought I meant that

00:21:43.309 --> 00:21:47.711
these man-made regimes were there because
people wanted them to be, no. That’s not

00:21:47.711 --> 00:21:50.950
what I meant at all about North Korea. Particularly,
these have been riveted onto...

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:56.139
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: ...people. I mean, North Korea

00:21:56.139 --> 00:22:02.000
is a hermetic place unfortunately in that
it has ocean on either side of it; the Demilitarized

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.299
Zone which is several miles wide on the south
and Russia and China on the north. So, you

00:22:07.299 --> 00:22:11.630
have a place where you can horribly conduct
an experiment on human beings, essentially.

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:15.960
You can isolate them totally. The North Korean
State was set up in the same year that Orwell

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:22.880
published 1984. And you almost think that
somebody gave Kim Il-sung a copy of 1984 in

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:28.320
Korean and said, “Do you think we could
make this fly?” And he said, “Well, I

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:32.870
can’t be sure. We sure can give it the old
college try.” Because that’s how it feels

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:36.000
there. I went there, I thought, I've had his
experience--I’ll just digress for a second.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.139
I’ve had this experience twice in my life.
Journalists hate cliché. I know it doesn’t

00:22:40.139 --> 00:22:44.280
always seem like that when you read the papers,
but we try and avoid them. I went to Prague

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.950
once under the old days of the communist regime.
I thought whatever happens to me here, I’m

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:51.919
not going to mention Franz Kafka in my essay.
I’m going to be the first journalist not

00:22:51.919 --> 00:22:57.429
to do it. I went to a meeting of the opposition
underground, somebody betrayed us because

00:22:57.429 --> 00:23:03.460
the secret police came in and, suddenly, wham
like just broke down the door, dogs, torches,

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:07.830
rubber truncheons. They slammed me against
the wall, you’re under arrest. Well, I demand

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:11.919
to see the British ambassador. Blah, blah,
you’re under arrest. What’s the charge?

00:23:11.919 --> 00:23:17.340
We don't have to tell you that. I thought,
fuck, I’ve got to mention Kafka after all.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:24.080
They make you do it. Well, I--that’s actually
what a cliché is. That’s--communism is

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:27.750
a cliché in itself. The same in North Korea;
I thought I don’t want to mention Orwell;

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:30.950
I don't want to mention Orwell; have not have
to mention. There’s no--there’s no other

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:37.840
stand of comparison. No, what I meant about
the fear of freedom was this: Many, many people

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:45.899
don't of course want to live under a hellish
starvation regime of gulag type, like that.

00:23:45.899 --> 00:23:50.639
But they, they quite like being told what
to do. They don't want to be told that life

00:23:50.639 --> 00:23:53.780
doesn’t--the world doesn’t owe them a
living and that they’re on their own and

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:58.370
they--they quite like it and repeatedly vote
for parties and, sometimes, leaders who promise

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:02.880
to provide everything as long as they'll give
up just a little bit of freedom, just a little

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:08.669
bit. In the tradeoff, you’ll get more security
and more welfare. It’s a temptation. In

00:24:08.669 --> 00:24:15.090
some cases, it takes an extreme form, and
I'm very impressed by how often when I debate

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:19.450
with the religious people, they will tell
me that they’ve--they gravitate towards

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:26.460
faith because they want someone to, if you
like, to look after them. The whole idea of

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:36.170
a heavenly father, for example, is built up
on this. The--the old joke says some say God

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:43.620
is dead, some say God is dad, you figure.
Then there are people who--well, Islam for

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:49.509
example, the word means, the word Islam means
surrender, prostration. You give everything

00:24:49.509 --> 00:24:55.720
to God. Everything is in his hands. This is
implicit in the Qur'an. That’s what I mean.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:59.690
But I think what’s innate in most people
is the feeling that they quite like someone

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:03.779
to take care of them all of the time so it
can be hard to argue with them that there

00:25:03.779 --> 00:25:07.980
is no such person.
&gt;&gt; I understand better now but...

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:11.250
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Okay.
&gt;&gt; You see, I--just to follow up a little

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:19.090
bit. So is there a possibility there to say
that then some people are more freedom-loving

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:24.289
than others and is this some sort of, you
know, like--I wouldn’t call it racism but,

00:25:24.289 --> 00:25:29.269
you know, like, differentiating people by
their love towards freedom and all that?

00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:34.960
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: No, I’m certain that the same
feelings are innate in all people. And one

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:39.169
day, there will be a North Korean edition
of 1984, and it will be a huge bestseller

00:25:39.169 --> 00:25:40.169
there.
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:25:40.169 --> 00:25:44.110
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: I am as sure of that as I can
be of anything. Though, at the moment, it’s

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:49.610
hard to imagine there’s anyone in North
Korea who's even allowed to consider the concept

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:54.499
of political liberty. It will come because
it is innate. I have no doubt about that.

00:25:54.499 --> 00:25:58.250
&gt;&gt; To follow up to on this fear of freedom
and this is an innate idea, sorry to beat

00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:03.240
that horse, but what do you--what do you think
would possibly replace this? I also think

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:06.700
that there are some--I mean it’s obviously
much easier to say my life is out of my control

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:10.149
and these events are out of my control so,
you know, I’m going to thank God for the

00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:14.740
good things and, you know, hate the devil
for the bad things, whatever. So, like, you

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:20.159
know, from Plato to Nietsche to Socrates--or
Descartes have said it’s difficult to choose

00:26:20.159 --> 00:26:24.169
the life where you're actually deciding and
making choices for yourself and taking responsibility

00:26:24.169 --> 00:26:29.510
and appreciating the fact that the world doesn’t
care about your existence and then doing what

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:33.340
you need to do with that, and it is difficult.
How do we, you know, well--how could we possibly

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:37.450
imagine a world where everybody buys into
that idea and how do we--where would we go

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:41.840
like, where would that structure that some
people feel they can’t do without, where

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:45.509
would they get that from? I guess what would--what
would religion be replaced by so to fulfill

00:26:45.509 --> 00:26:49.830
this natural need?
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Yeah. Well, I would say that

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:56.500
emancipating ourselves from religion and from
the combined sort of solipsism and masochism,

00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:03.190
this is what I was trying to say to the comrade
here a moment ago. Religion says to you, remember,

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:08.460
the monotheistic ones, you're a miserable
sinner, your sin is original, you can't escape

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:13.930
it, you’re born as a wretch, you’re made
out of dust or according to the Qur'an, a

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:19.710
clot of blood, you’re a worm, you’re nothing,
you know, but a piece of gunk basically. But--and

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:25.309
you got to work really hard to get away from
the terrible punishment that awaits you for

00:27:25.309 --> 00:27:32.440
that. So total abnegation, but there’s also
good news. The universe is designed with you

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:38.350
in mind, and God has a plan for you personally.
So just when the person thinks they can't

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:42.340
take anymore abuse--it’s like being inducted
into a cult. Just where the person thinks

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:47.200
they can't take anymore humiliation, they're
told, oh, but father loves you and he wants

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:51.659
you to join our group. That’s not good for
people. You’d be better off without it.

00:27:51.659 --> 00:27:55.620
So would everyone you know, so it’s not
a matter of what we would put in its place,

00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:00.400
we wouldn’t. We’d be emancipated from
that kind of sadomasochism. That’s a good

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:07.669
thing to start off with. Second, we have the
wonders and beauty of science to study. We

00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:12.760
have instead of ancient texts that are full
of lies and myths, we have increasingly a

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:19.879
wonderful world literature that’s available
to anybody who can read even a little--most

00:28:19.879 --> 00:28:23.570
recently, I would cite you, because yesterday
was the birthday of India, happy birthday

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:28.080
by the way to all Indians here. And Pakistanis,
though if you insist, I think the partition

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:35.159
was a huge mistake. There’s a--and religious
partition is the worst kind, and it’s going

00:28:35.159 --> 00:28:38.779
to lead one day to a thermonuclear war so--I
didn’t have time to go into that but maybe

00:28:38.779 --> 00:28:45.759
someone will ask me. There's incredible literature
in English written by Indians. It’s sort

00:28:45.759 --> 00:28:52.200
of a sub-branch--but I shouldn’t even say
sub; I mean a branch--a new branch of English

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:56.370
writing by Indians in English. It's becoming
a great part of world literature. There’s

00:28:56.370 --> 00:29:00.850
all this extraordinary excitement. And people
say no, no, no, you should--as Thomas Aquinas

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:05.320
said, a man of one book, you know, you should
be reading a bible, you don't really need

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:10.549
anything else, they’re destroying libraries
in the Muslim world that could have any books

00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:17.269
that contradict the Qur'an, this is no way
to live. But having said all that, and said

00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:22.289
what the--and the consolations of philosophy
too which aren’t that hard to study are

00:29:22.289 --> 00:29:27.490
very rewarding. And ethical and moral dilemmas
that you get out of the study of literature,

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:34.799
George Eliot, Dostoyevsky, people of that
kind, James Joyce. Still, it’s only a necessary

00:29:34.799 --> 00:29:39.860
condition, not a sufficient one. There are
no guarantees and an atheist can be a nihilist,

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:44.220
or a sadist, or a Stalinist, or a fascist,
it’d be unlikely the last one but that’s

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:50.679
possible. Okay. But we--there are no guarantees
and in part that it’s the recognition of

00:29:50.679 --> 00:29:58.210
that, that’s the beginning of wisdom as
well as I think the beginning of liberty.

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:02.789
&gt;&gt; One short and one longer one, I just want
to be sure, I assume that you have read the

00:30:02.789 --> 00:30:06.960
"Captain Stormfield's Journey To Heaven" by
Mark Twain.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:11.709
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Sorry. Yes, I've read a lot of
Mr. Clemens on religion.

00:30:11.709 --> 00:30:18.159
&gt;&gt; Yes. That seemed a sort of a definitive
work on the hierarchy structure of a more

00:30:18.159 --> 00:30:19.820
standard religion.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Yes. By the way, you can't read

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:24.659
too much Twain, ladies and gentlemen, on the
subject. But now all of his stuff is available.

00:30:24.659 --> 00:30:29.149
There are websites on Mark Twain and religion.
It used to be really hard to get his writings

00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:34.950
on religion even 10 years ago. Sorry.
&gt;&gt; And my longer question which hopefully

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:40.429
won't choke you up. Actually, I have several
friends who are very well-educated, in some

00:30:40.429 --> 00:30:47.110
cases in the sciences, who became religious
late in life. They have been atheist or agnostic,

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:52.190
and then just decided they were feeling something
and became religious. Do you have anything

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:54.840
to say on that sort of grounds or why that
might be occurring?

00:30:54.840 --> 00:31:01.829
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Yes. I suppose I could speculate,
but that’s all I would be doing.

00:31:01.829 --> 00:31:07.070
&gt;&gt; Of course.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: I think for some people, the

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:12.669
Hubble View, say, does have the opposite effect
from the one it has on me. It makes people

00:31:12.669 --> 00:31:21.029
feel, well, then, whoever designed this must
be even more amazing than I thought. And that’s--there

00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:27.590
are attempts made by creationists now to say
that. Instead of saying, "No, Darwin was wrong.

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:33.110
God made all this stuff." They now say, "Well,
okay, there was evolution, but God did that,

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:40.270
too." So as you may know arguments that explain
everything, explain nothing. That’s a definite

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:48.399
principle I think of underlying full cognition.
If they can bend their argument so it can

00:31:48.399 --> 00:31:53.039
comprehend everything, comprise everything
then it isn't an argument. But I think that

00:31:53.039 --> 00:32:00.410
we are certainly made in such a way to be
worshipfully inclined, shall we say. That

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:05.879
tendency is certainly within us. And when
people think that there's something awe inspiring,

00:32:05.879 --> 00:32:12.029
what they feel is awe. And then what they
feel is well, maybe there's some majesty I

00:32:12.029 --> 00:32:17.639
should be acknowledging here, though that
isn't at all a logical step. By the way, do

00:32:17.639 --> 00:32:21.000
you know about "awe?"
&gt;&gt; In what sense?

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.509
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: John Wayne played the Roman centurion
in one of the films about the crucifixion?

00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:28.660
&gt;&gt; I don’t...
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: And there's a certain point the

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:32.090
rain has to come down hard, and there's thunder
and lightning and the veil of the temple splits

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:37.470
and so on. And John Wayne standing as a centurion
is supposed to say, "Truly, this was the son

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:43.230
of God." So he does this. I forget who the
director was--I think it’s Houston. And

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:50.481
cue rain, thunder and lightning, so Wayne
stands there stoically, and utters, "Truly,

00:32:50.481 --> 00:32:55.389
this was the son of God." And the director's,
"John, that was great. That was terrific.

00:32:55.389 --> 00:33:03.279
I just wonder if we could have it with a little
more awe." So they cued again the rain, thunder,

00:33:03.279 --> 00:33:07.941
the veil of the temple splits into Wayne,
earthquakes, you know. It's all happening

00:33:07.941 --> 00:33:17.269
and Wayne says, "Aw, truly, this was the son
of God."

00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:21.429
&gt;&gt; So this is a kind of a follow-up on Tom's
question. I have a buddy who styles himself

00:33:21.429 --> 00:33:26.909
as a kind of an allegorical pagan. And he's
had a lot of angry criticisms of religion,

00:33:26.909 --> 00:33:31.620
many of which echo yours. But at the same
time he feels in himself a kind of a biological

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:36.610
need to be part of a circle of believers in
a community which he feels helps his rather

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:40.210
fragile emotional demeanor. He goes through,
you know, depression and things like that,

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:45.000
and he finds that belief. So what he'd done
is try to find what he feels as the least

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.539
obnoxious religion he could find and then
not take it too seriously. What would you

00:33:48.539 --> 00:33:55.460
say to such a person?
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Well, that used to be called

00:33:55.460 --> 00:34:04.139
the Church of England--or, the Unitarians,
about whom Bertrand Russell said, "The great

00:34:04.139 --> 00:34:11.000
thing about them is they believe in one god
maximum." Peter DeVries is very good on this.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.370
He says people used to be a pagan and polytheist
and believe in multiple gods, and then they

00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:20.640
started believing in one god and they're going
nearer the true figure all the time. This

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:28.639
is progress.
&gt;&gt; On an article, I believe it was that I

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:33.540
read, you seemed reluctant to endorse if not
critical of Richard Dawkins's attempt to sort

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:36.429
of organize the atheists under the title of
Brights.

00:34:36.429 --> 00:34:41.169
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Yes.
&gt;&gt; And I believe that your comment was that

00:34:41.169 --> 00:34:48.250
we infidels need no such machinery of reinforcement.
My question is, if like-minded people do not

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:55.560
organize, especially if those whose ideals
we oppose are more organized, how can we attempt

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:59.670
to--kind of steer our society the way that
we would like it to go?

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:03.720
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Well, I was to have said this
to the previous question. I mean, I’m in

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:10.950
some ways the wrong person to ask these questions.
I’m no longer a joiner up of groups. I don’t

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:16.039
feel the belonging need anymore. I used to
when I was younger and more left than I am

00:35:16.039 --> 00:35:20.451
now feel that the need to be involved in an
organized way. Now I don’t, and I think

00:35:20.451 --> 00:35:25.140
I probably have more influence as an individual
than I ever did as a cogwheel in a so-called

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:30.940
party. A point for anyone to ponder actually
who was asked have they ever considered registering

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:34.260
independent, for example. People may fight
harder for your vote if you don’t give it

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:41.791
away in advance. Separate question, and it’s
very important to me that I don’t belong

00:35:41.791 --> 00:35:46.470
to a church. People who believe as I believe
don’t need to get together all the time

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:53.650
and remind ourselves what we believe, reinforce
it, ram it home in case we forget the incredible

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:58.040
propositions that, you know, we're singing
and all those kind of things. You just recognize

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:02.599
a fellow free-thinker when you meet one. That
should be enough. And in any country or any

00:36:02.599 --> 00:36:12.950
language as well. There will be in Washington
in October the big gathering where Richard

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:18.500
Dawkins and Daniel Dennett and Sam Harris,
[INDISTINCT] and myself and many others are

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:23.569
going to be--Victor Stinger. Because there
has been an extraordinary vogue of successful

00:36:23.569 --> 00:36:27.880
books on this subject now, and I think there's
a change in the Zeitgeist going on about religion.

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:33.410
And let me just say this, if that Zeitgeist
has been brought about, the change has been

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:39.140
brought about in that Zeitgeist, it hasn’t
been by any organization. It's by a group

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:45.849
of like-minded people writing their hearts
out and refusing to be intimidated by religious

00:36:45.849 --> 00:36:50.770
bullying. Or, to allow religious nonsense
to be taught in the schools, for example,

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:57.900
in place of science. Or to allow euphemisms
to be spread about the behavior of the parties

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:03.290
of god in Iraq or elsewhere. That’s what
created it, not an organization but what you

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:08.880
might call an intellectual tendency. I think
that’s fine. I think it's encouraging.

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:12.330
&gt;&gt; Hi. A few of the things that you said don’t
really seem consistent with our experience

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:17.059
in the United States. Two things in particular:
one is that you said, you know, once people,

00:37:17.059 --> 00:37:20.770
you know, have Hubble telescopes and microscopes,
the burning bush is not as interesting. And

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:24.609
the other thing you said is that, you know,
religion kind of fits into, you know, innate

00:37:24.609 --> 00:37:28.800
human nature for, you know, being told what
to do or not having as much freedom. Well,

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:32.980
in the United States, we have the most advanced,
wealthy, most powerful nation in probably

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:37.680
the history of the world, and you have probably
the most freedom-loving, you know, almost

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:42.530
inventive--not inventing but really espousing
the philosophy of freedom and individuality

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:46.890
and trying to, you know, propagate that throughout
the world. Yet, you also have the most religious

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:51.400
nation. Well, it's true. I mean, you can argue
with the methods but I mean, there's no question

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:56.470
that like we are trying to promote democracy.
And yet you have, yeah, the most religious

00:37:56.470 --> 00:38:02.200
nation. You have like people going to church
is probably an all-time high. Religious people

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:06.339
affect who are leaders are, you know, to a
great degree. So how do you explain like that

00:38:06.339 --> 00:38:08.270
contradiction?
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Well, I don’t think it’s

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:12.970
a contradiction because religious, the section
of the constitution means you can have religious

00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:19.790
pluralism. Now for example where I come from,
originally, you can tell I was born in England.

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:24.380
The head of the church is the head of the
state and the head of the armed forces. It's

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:30.900
an official church and you have to pay for
it and whether you want to or not. And on

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:37.920
the moment that her majesty, the Queen, expires,
the head of the Church of England will become

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:47.329
a bat-eared half-Muslim with no taste in,
for women as far as I can see, the lugubrious

00:38:47.329 --> 00:38:57.109
Prince Charles, who goes to classes on Islam
and talks to plants and is a loon. That’s

00:38:57.109 --> 00:39:02.560
what you get for founding a church on the
family values of Henry VIII. In the United

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:05.400
States, you can't have any of that. That would
be unconstitutional. You can belong to any

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:11.820
church you want, the government has nothing
to do with that. And people I think take a

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:17.400
Toquevillian view, if you like, of the church.
They go, many of them, to church for social

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:22.920
reasons. Some of them for ethnic ones, some
of them for charitable, some of them for community

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:28.069
reasons as you might say. If you ask someone
now--I've been doing this a lot recently.

00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:32.770
I have debated at every stop of my book tour.
Okay, so said you are a Baptist minister,

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:37.550
yes. Well, do you believe in John Calvin's
teaching on predestination and hell fire?

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:43.510
Why do you want to know? Well, because you
said you were a Baptist. Yeah, but I mean

00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:47.010
I’m a Southern Baptist, you know that kind.
Well, come one. They don’t love the question.

00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:53.410
They--or ask the Catholics if they really
believe what their church teaches or what

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:58.569
the Pope tells them. Of course they don’t
for the most part. The fastest growing group

00:39:58.569 --> 00:40:02.670
of people in the country has been measured
as being those of who have no belief or who

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:08.121
are atheists. By far the fastest growing,
it’s doubled in the last ten years. People

00:40:08.121 --> 00:40:11.200
are evidently lying to the opinion polls,
that there are not enough churches in the

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:15.460
country; there are plenty of them. They’re
not enough to take all the people who say

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:19.881
that they go to them, just couldn’t be done,
couldn’t fit them in. I don’t think that

00:40:19.881 --> 00:40:22.410
people who have doubts about religion are
going to tell them to opinion pollsters who

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:26.890
call them up at dinner time. They will say,
yes, I am a Methodist or whatever it is, they’re

00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:34.160
not going say I sometimes wonder if John Wesley
was really the man. Not when the multiple

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:39.611
choice boxes are being gone through. So, but
unfortunately, I mean, there are people who

00:40:39.611 --> 00:40:47.180
think that that’s the way to go politically.
The president for example thinks that to say

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:53.180
someone is person of faith is axiomatically
to confer a compliment on them. And if you

00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:59.190
remember, he did it to Vladimir Putin, KGB
goon and hood, and increasingly evidently

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:03.240
a very dangerous man to have in charge in
Russia. President meets and says right away,

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:06.110
“Right away, well, I could tell by looking
into his eyes and seeing he was wearing his

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:12.160
grandmother’s crucifix, that he was just
the chap for me.” Now, in a strong field,

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:20.770
I think that’s the stupidest thing the president
has yet said. And he must, I think, occasionally

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:25.730
regret it. And I got, tried to get a research
to this one to find out just, I just need

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:30.900
to know something, has Vladimir Putin ever
worn his grandmother’s crucifix since? Had

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:36.200
he ever been seen wearing it before? Or did
he just think this should be enough for the

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:46.290
president of the United States? Because if
so, it would show that religion was not just

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:50.690
metaphysically incorrect, but as I have I
believe said, a danger and a poison to all

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:56.020
of us. If our republic can be—and its president
can be pushed over, like that, like someone

00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:58.780
offering garlic to a vampire, then we really
are in trouble.

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:03.970
&gt;&gt; Just a follow-up, though, it just sounds
like you would have almost no religion in

00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:08.059
the U.S. if you—if it’s true that you
were saying, that once you became an advanced

00:42:08.059 --> 00:42:11.491
scientific society, you know, you’d lose
interest in religion which is not the case.

00:42:11.491 --> 00:42:16.569
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: All right. I’d say a bit more,
I mean, take the case of the so-called “intelligent

00:42:16.569 --> 00:42:20.579
design school” they want at least equal
time, they used to want to ban evolution,

00:42:20.579 --> 00:42:25.569
now they want equal time in schools. So, they
brought with their Discovery Institute friends

00:42:25.569 --> 00:42:38.930
from Washington, moves on school boards and
courts in Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas and the

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:45.940
most conservative County of Pennsylvania around
the town of Dover. And they have been humiliated

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:51.410
in each case. And this is in Kansas, in Texas,
in Oklahoma and in the most reactionary part

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:55.950
of Pennsylvania. Thrown off the school board
by the electorate and thrown out of court

00:42:55.950 --> 00:43:02.160
as flat out unconstitutional by the judges,
in all cases, Reagan Republican appointees.

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:05.190
And I don’t know what they’re going to
do next, these rednecks, I don’t know what

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:10.150
they’re going to do. But, I know why it
doesn’t work, and why it’s not going to

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:15.240
work, because there may be many parents in
Kansas who say, “Well, I personally think

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:18.990
that God made the rocks and so on and only
made them 6,000 years ago.” But they don’t

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:23.750
want their children taught that in school.
They don’t want to come from a state where

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:28.079
they get laughed at when they say where they’re
from. Oh you’re from Kansas, that’s the

00:43:28.079 --> 00:43:32.140
place where… they don’t like that. It’s
the same, it was the same with the confederate

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:35.761
flag issue, quite apart from the racism. A
lot of people who didn’t want to come from

00:43:35.761 --> 00:43:39.780
a state that had a confederate battle flag
on its [INDISTINCT]. Among other things people

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:43.180
won’t have their conventions in your state
and you’ll suffer for that too. You’ll

00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:47.200
get laughed at when you travel, they don’t
want this. And nor should they have to put

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:51.849
up with it because of a handful of crackpots.
So, no, I don’t say there aren’t a lot

00:43:51.849 --> 00:43:56.450
of devout people in this country and I don’t
say that science just negates religion. But

00:43:56.450 --> 00:44:02.760
I say that the influence of religion as opposed
to scientific rationalism is hugely overestimated,

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:09.099
yeah. Shouldn’t—shouldn’t impress people
to the point where they feel it must - can’t

00:44:09.099 --> 00:44:17.510
be opposed.
&gt;&gt; Thank you for coming. I think you already

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:24.579
answered one of my questions regarding organizing
a larger effort. So separate from that I want

00:44:24.579 --> 00:44:29.970
to get just some comments and thoughts based
upon idea of if there is going to be an independent

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:36.520
movement whether at the Atheist or Anti-theist
movement whether you’re part of it or not,

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:42.400
if you have any suggestions for the average
person not may not have say a publishing company

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:46.670
or a production company, but does have the
Internet, you know, does have their own thoughts...

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:48.420
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Right.
&gt;&gt; And keyboard in front of them, what they

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:54.210
can do to either give resources to other people
or to actually express their thoughts in ways

00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:58.100
that you find to actually be, you know, exceptional.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Yes.

00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:00.329
&gt;&gt; Furter some sort of movement, if there
may be one.

00:45:00.329 --> 00:45:06.160
&gt;. HITCHEN: Yeah, my friend, Rich Dawkins
actually at the end of his book, The God Delusion,

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:12.369
does have a list which you can look up, and
his is an excellent book, I should say, of

00:45:12.369 --> 00:45:18.100
websites where so to say, help is available.
Well, there’s one for example, there is

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:22.280
a very important one of called, “Leaving
Islam,” is about people want to get out

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:27.010
and are afraid or are being intimidated, ways
of actually doing it and finding contact with

00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:31.121
people who feel the same way. Very serious
because there are quite a lot of our fellow

00:45:31.121 --> 00:45:34.329
citizens now who don’t feel that they do
have religious freedom because they are imprisoned

00:45:34.329 --> 00:45:38.619
in a religion that can kill them for even
considering changing their minds about it,

00:45:38.619 --> 00:45:43.640
this is no small matter. But I tell you what
I would do, I would become a subscriber to

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:49.290
a magazine called Free Inquiry which is published
out of Amherst, New York, it’s every month

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:55.720
I think, a very, very good rationalist and
skeptical magazine which has itself a lot

00:45:55.720 --> 00:46:01.520
of local activities that you can look up.
And then, there’s another magazine called

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:06.730
Skeptical Inquiry, published from nearer here,
maybe more appeal to people of a scientific

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:11.380
or technical bent which does things likes
they expose frauds that are on TV claiming

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:19.640
to be able to put you in touch with your relatives,
or divine water or all these kinds of nutbags

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:25.260
that are often featured on primetime shows.
And puts you also in touch with the work the

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:35.569
great magicians, Penn and Teller and James
Randy, who again show that miracles are easy.

00:46:35.569 --> 00:46:40.589
And they can also show the fraudulence of
anyone who tries to exploit them, a world

00:46:40.589 --> 00:46:46.380
of wonder awaits you. And these magazines
will also show you and point out to the areas

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:52.799
where resistance is needed, say to the continued
attempt to teach nonsense in American schools,

00:46:52.799 --> 00:46:58.140
“Yes, children that concludes the biology
period, and now get ready for your creation

00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:04.839
studies hour and after the astronomy class
we will have the astrology class for equal

00:47:04.839 --> 00:47:11.240
time, and then the chemistry alchemy period.”
It’s enough to make a cat laugh, isn’t

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:15.940
it? There are people think this is what should
be done to stultify American children. So,

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:22.199
you can meet up with other people could think
that that’s a bad idea.

00:47:22.199 --> 00:47:27.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah, two things, an observation and a
concern, my first observation is that I think

00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:31.299
you share something in common with Jesus in
that both of you have seems to be attacking

00:47:31.299 --> 00:47:36.599
aspects of religion, but often in his case,
he attacked specific religious leaders whereas

00:47:36.599 --> 00:47:46.210
you attack religion itself. And, I was…
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: No, our resemblances are often

00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:49.650
pointed out.
&gt;&gt; I’m sad to hear, I thought for sure I’d

00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:57.340
be the first. And secondly, the bit of concern,
if we start going more and more toward Atheism,

00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:01.200
you mentioned some of the horrible things
that happened in the name of religion, but

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:07.599
I look at one of the greatest genocides or
at least mass murders ever, was by the Soviet

00:48:07.599 --> 00:48:14.560
Union under Lenin and Stalin when in the name
of among another things Atheism, they killed

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:21.309
an enormously large number of their own people.
And what do you think would prevent that from

00:48:21.309 --> 00:48:26.270
happening if indeed you were successful?
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: I have a chapter on this in my

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:29.079
book because it is a very frequently asked
question, I think it’s also a very serious

00:48:29.079 --> 00:48:36.200
one, I have to condense the chapter if I may,
but here’s the situation. Until 1917, the

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:41.450
year of the Russian Revolution, millions of
Russians, millions and millions of them had

00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:46.369
for hundreds and hundreds of years been told
that the head of the state, the Czar, was

00:48:46.369 --> 00:48:51.099
also the head of the church and was a little
more than human, he was the little father

00:48:51.099 --> 00:48:55.109
of the people. He wasn’t quite divine. He
was more like a saint than human. And he owned

00:48:55.109 --> 00:49:00.670
everything in the country and everything was
due to him. That’s how a gigantic layer

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:09.460
Russian society was inculcated with servile,
fatalistic ideas. If you are Josef Stalin,

00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:14.059
you shouldn’t be in the dictatorship business
in the first place if you can’t realize

00:49:14.059 --> 00:49:18.789
this is a huge opportunity for you, you’ve
inherited a population that’s servile and

00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:25.740
credulous and superstitious. Well, what does
Stalin do? He sets up an inquisition. He has

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:31.619
heresy hunts, trials of heretics, the Moscow
trials. He proclaims miracles, Lysenko’s

00:49:31.619 --> 00:49:36.770
agriculture that was supposed to produce three
harvests a year or whatever it was, the pseudo-biology

00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:42.150
that would feed everyone in a week. He says
all thanks are due at all times to the leader

00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:45.819
and you must praise him at all times for his
goodness and kindness. And incidentally, he

00:49:45.819 --> 00:49:51.000
always kept the Russian Orthodox Church on
his side, it split. It split the church and

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.420
some of them moved to New York and set up
a rival. But the Russian Orthodox Church remained

00:49:55.420 --> 00:50:01.030
part of the regime, he was not so stupid as
not to know he had to do that, just as Hitler

00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:06.790
and Mussolini made an even more aggressive
deal with the Roman Catholic Church and with

00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:11.160
some of the Protestants. And remember the
other great axis of evil person of that time,

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:18.450
the Emperor of Japan, was not just a religious
person but actually a god. So Fascism, Communism

00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:24.329
and Stalinism and Nazism are nothing like
as secular as some people think, and much

00:50:24.329 --> 00:50:30.650
more religious than most people know. But
here's what a fair test would be: find a society

00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:40.020
that's adopted the teachings of Spinoza, Voltaire,
Galileo, Einstein, Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:46.190
and gone down the pits as result of doing
that into famine and war and dictatorship

00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:51.333
and torture and repression. That would be
a fair test. That's the test I'd like to--that's

00:50:51.333 --> 00:50:57.390
the experiment I'd like to run. I don’t
think that's going to end up with a gulag.

00:50:57.390 --> 00:51:02.869
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you for coming.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Thank you for having me.

00:51:02.869 --> 00:51:08.430
&gt;&gt; More ladies asking questions would be awesome
and please, I implore you to be really hilarious

00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:10.980
so we can prove Mr. Hitchens is wrong about
why women cannot be funny.

00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:18.730
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: I was wondering what you would--what
you've done with your chicks here I must say.

00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:25.069
&gt;&gt; We are a technology company. So, I'm not
religious but just to play a little devil's

00:51:25.069 --> 00:51:30.680
advocate, what do you say to studies that
show that people who consistently go to church,

00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:35.140
who pray, who believe in God have, like, lower
blood pressure and live longer lives, et cetera?

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:41.559
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Well, I’d say it wouldn't--wouldn't
prove much. I mean, the--if it hard to prove--I'm

00:51:41.559 --> 00:51:48.280
not sure I would be able to trust the methodology
but suppose it was true, the same could be

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:59.000
said of being a Moonie for example. I mean,
it's said--it is said that Louis Farrakhan's

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:06.251
racist crackpot Nation of Islam and its sectarian
gang gets young men of drugs, for all I know

00:52:06.251 --> 00:52:11.930
it does, it may but that doesn’t recommend
it to me. Nor does it prove a thing about

00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:17.660
its theology, if you see what I mean. Whereas
I can absolutely tell you that of the suicide

00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:26.640
bombing population 100% are faith based. And
I don’t think that that in itself disproves

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:32.510
faith but I think it should make you skeptical
of that kind of random sampling.

00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:36.330
&gt;&gt; Sure. There seemed to be...
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Of the genital mutilation community

00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:40.569
the same can be said.
&gt;&gt; I've a lot of progressive religious friends

00:52:40.569 --> 00:52:43.750
who--I used to be pretty condescending towards
religion but I feel like I've learned a lot

00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:47.609
from them and learned about their religious
practice and what it means to them and as

00:52:47.609 --> 00:52:50.670
you stated earlier a lot of religious people
don’t really believe all the tenets of what

00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:56.390
their faith says anyway. So, I feel like those
friends of mine are looking for community

00:52:56.390 --> 00:53:02.620
and looking for a feeling of oneness with
other people and with the universe and ultimately

00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:07.170
on a scientific level that bears out anyway
because on like a quantum level everything

00:53:07.170 --> 00:53:12.690
is one and is the same. So, I feel like churches
at least in this country provide the sense

00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:18.059
of community that I don’t think exists any
other way in our culture. I don’t feel like

00:53:18.059 --> 00:53:22.160
I had that growing up and I feel like my friends
that went to churchm they can go back to their

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:27.210
church now and there are all of these adults
that aside from their parents that were there

00:53:27.210 --> 00:53:30.420
to nurture them as they were growing up and
then ask how they're doing and I never had

00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:34.040
that. So, I'm jealous of that in a sense.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: It takes a lot to make me cry

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:44.569
but you...See me afterwards, I mean, the way
it just--look actually it’s what I said

00:53:44.569 --> 00:53:49.430
about if there's any who read, who read de
Toqueville, in Democracy in America should--that's

00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:54.760
what he said about--about communitarianism
and religion. It's very--it's the reason why

00:53:54.760 --> 00:54:00.740
America is so religious but it's a different
form of religion. Ask yourself a related question,

00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:05.640
it's amazing to me how many Americans change
religion when they get married. You hear it

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:09.900
all the time, you've heard it. I used to be
Seventh Day Adventist but my wife was Congregationalist,

00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:13.751
now I go to the Congregationalists. It doesn’t
matter the Seventh Day Adventist used to say,

00:54:13.751 --> 00:54:18.799
if you don’t stay with us you're going straight
to hell. Change very easily. Go to another

00:54:18.799 --> 00:54:24.680
church instead. Wouldn't consider perhaps
not going to one but it shows the--the depth

00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:32.630
of the strength of religious allegiance. I
also think that, well, it's notorious about,

00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:39.700
say, Polish Catholics in Chicago or Greek
Orthodox or many Jews, the church has been

00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:46.440
a means of transmitting and preserving an
ethnic tradition as well. The solidarity in

00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:51.310
the face of often quiet bleak kinds of life,
and now there's even a phenomenon known as

00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:58.559
Churchianity. It’s expressed by the megachurches,
the people who live half transient lives don’t

00:54:58.559 --> 00:55:02.619
have very stable employment or residence who
are often moving around the country. On a

00:55:02.619 --> 00:55:07.450
Sunday they want to know where they can go
take the old jalopy and be among friends,

00:55:07.450 --> 00:55:13.400
and these characters are waiting for them
believe you me to remove what few savings

00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:20.369
they do have left from them. Because that's
another indissoluble fact about American religion

00:55:20.369 --> 00:55:24.741
just as community and blood pressure may be
involved. It has to be mentioned in the same

00:55:24.741 --> 00:55:31.859
breath as open fraud to an absolutely astonishing
extent. I mean, the shake down community,

00:55:31.859 --> 00:55:39.210
the genital mutilation community, the suicide
bombing community, the child abuse I would

00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:44.299
prefer to say child rape communities, all
these are communities of faith, believe you

00:55:44.299 --> 00:55:49.299
me.
&gt;&gt; Oh, it's my turn?

00:55:49.299 --> 00:55:53.540
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: What's up?
&gt;&gt; Try to diverge a little from the immediate

00:55:53.540 --> 00:56:02.430
subjects. You expressed your regrets for this
perverse impulse in the human spirit which

00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:09.289
seems to desire to be dominated, to prostrate
itself before the mysterious altar of power.

00:56:09.289 --> 00:56:14.289
It occurs to me that the current government
of this nation has in a calculated fashion,

00:56:14.289 --> 00:56:19.779
exploited this perverse desire and exploited
the language which seems to inspire it or

00:56:19.779 --> 00:56:25.960
appeal to it. Now, I'm strongly opposed to
a particular policy of this government which

00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:34.420
is the indefinite detention of so-called terrorist
suspects in Cuba and in particular I dislike

00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:39.970
the way the government tries to justify this
policy by using these very discourses of power

00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:47.610
and secrecy which come of a particular religious
stamp. So I would like to ask and--not to

00:56:47.610 --> 00:56:52.180
be impertinent how you can square what you've
said today with other comments you've made

00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:57.760
apparently in support of this very policy.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: There's no danger of you being

00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:04.700
impertinent so don’t worry about that. I've
just returned from Guantanamo, when I say

00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:07.630
just I was there last month. It took me a
long time to get down and haven't yet written

00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:14.160
anything about it so you won't know my views
as I'm not sure that I know them in full myself,

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:20.569
but about your question, I know what my views
are about indefinite detention in principle.

00:57:20.569 --> 00:57:29.920
I didn't see or must have missed any allusion
that all made to religion, in the decision

00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:37.380
to declare them enemy combatants. You're suggesting
there was a religious justification for the

00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:41.680
detention policy?
&gt;&gt; Not a religious justification per se but

00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:48.210
in my opinion the Bush administration in its
public deliveries often uses a language of

00:57:48.210 --> 00:57:54.579
power very much akin to that used by religious
tyrants and demagogues down the centuries

00:57:54.579 --> 00:57:59.390
and this language comes up particularly strongly
when justifying controversial actions such

00:57:59.390 --> 00:58:02.119
as Guantanamo Bay.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Well, again I think we have a

00:58:02.119 --> 00:58:06.540
disagreement, I mean the language they seem
to use to me is the language of the secular

00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:11.859
language of emergency powers and special circumstances
requiring extraordinary measures and that’s

00:58:11.859 --> 00:58:16.849
a very old argument especially in the United
States, it goes back to President Lincoln’s

00:58:16.849 --> 00:58:21.839
attempt to suspend habeas corpus in the Civil
War. It reminds me of that and not of any

00:58:21.839 --> 00:58:27.550
argument about or with theocracy.
&gt;&gt; Emergency powers and extraordinary rendition

00:58:27.550 --> 00:58:40.430
and other times like this to me rather smack
of secrecy jargon at the same time used by

00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:45.490
preachers.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Or by secular despots. I just

00:58:45.490 --> 00:58:49.380
don’t think you’re quite carrying your
point about the theological. If by all means

00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:55.240
if you want to discuss the question of civil
liberties, let’s do so, but it’s a departure

00:58:55.240 --> 00:59:01.619
from the rubric. The Bush administration is
not conducting a holy war in this respect.

00:59:01.619 --> 00:59:07.140
It is confronting a holy war, however. One
thing you can’t miss about the inhabitants

00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:13.050
of Guantanamo is how faith based they are,
and that’s part of the reason why we are

00:59:13.050 --> 00:59:18.170
presented with this problem. The difference
seems to me to be the following, if you treat

00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:23.990
them as criminals, as some argue, then you
can’t say really that you are fighting a

00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:28.190
war, then it’s only a law and order question.
If you say you’re fighting a war, then in

00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:32.559
what sense are these not enemy soldiers? If
they are enemy soldiers, how can you try them

00:59:32.559 --> 00:59:37.380
as criminals? Why are you holding people as
criminals and building a military tribunal,

00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:42.050
I visited the room where they’re going to
have them tried, where they will be able to

00:59:42.050 --> 00:59:46.240
say, “Well, thanks for having me here and
admitting that I am a soldier, when the whole

00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:51.320
point is that the Geneva Convention says that
they’re not. So that’s bad enough to begin

00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:57.020
with and it’s a territory no government
has yet had to step onto. But in addition,

00:59:57.020 --> 01:00:01.930
we’re apparently not allowed to do any of
those things, nor are we allowed extraordinary

01:00:01.930 --> 01:00:05.500
rendition nor can we have return them to their
countries of origin in case they get maltreated

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:10.119
there by their own governments. Well, this
leaves the—apparently only two alternatives.

01:00:10.119 --> 01:00:17.109
One is not to take any prisoners. And the
other is to let everybody go and say we’ve

01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:21.770
got no right to hold you. And neither of these
seems to be very attractive. This is as far

01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:26.680
as I’ve got now with my reasoning.
&gt;&gt; But do you not dislike the way that’s

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:32.550
all of these actions might not be unconstitutional.
They’re not justified in constitutional

01:00:32.550 --> 01:00:35.780
terms but in language such as extraordinary
rendition, emergency powers.

01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:38.950
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Yeah, I do dislike that very
much, yes. I mean, no one’s ever been able

01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:43.150
to point out to me that Lincoln’s suspension
of habeas corpus helped to defeat the confederacy

01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:47.579
for example. And I certainly don’t think
that the president has the right under the

01:00:47.579 --> 01:00:51.540
constitution to suspend habeas corpus. Only
the Congress can do that. It doesn’t mean

01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:55.480
it can’t be suspended. The Congress has
to do it, the president cannot. I'm rather

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:59.600
a stickler for that kind of thing. Call me
old fashioned if you will.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:03.179
&gt;&gt; Well, I feel I’ve taken up a little too
much time now.

01:01:03.179 --> 01:01:04.700
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: A very welcome question, believe
me.

01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:10.960
&gt;&gt; I would posit that the Bush administration
has restrained itself or needs to be restrained

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:15.420
from using genuine religious language in the
way it’s approached that so called war and

01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:19.619
terror and I believe the word crusade was
used earlier in the campaign by President

01:01:19.619 --> 01:01:23.980
Bush, it’s not been used since. And we remember
that the original name of the campaign was

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:31.180
infinite justice. Another rejected piece of
unfortunate language, obviously picked out

01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:37.420
by some careful PR person.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: [INDISTINCT]

01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:42.140
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you very much for coming. I was
just having a question about something that

01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:46.280
many people have probably find to be a less
serious issue but I'm curious about your thoughts

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:52.089
on art, music and creativity and how those
fit in with your other ideas, those were three

01:01:52.089 --> 01:01:56.460
things that formed communities that maybe
we argued on faith, you know. The greatest

01:01:56.460 --> 01:02:00.340
composers throughout history always dedicating
their work to God and things of that nature

01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:06.029
and I'm just curious how you view these things
and beauty of these things to be similar to

01:02:06.029 --> 01:02:09.859
the beauty that you suggested you can find
in nature or how you think that they might

01:02:09.859 --> 01:02:15.019
be more suited, more fitting in with religion.
I'm just curious if you think that any would

01:02:15.019 --> 01:02:17.830
be devalued in this new system or any—with
your ideas.

01:02:17.830 --> 01:02:26.410
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Yeah, we don’t know, of the
extraordinary buildings, the great Gothic

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:32.810
Cathedrals for example or the, even the Great
Mosques of Andalusia. We don’t know if the

01:02:32.810 --> 01:02:37.920
architects who built them that they were themselves
convinced that it was for the greater glory

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:42.089
of God. We just know that at the time you
couldn't get a job as an architect if you

01:02:42.089 --> 01:02:46.559
didn't affirm that. And certainly we know
what would have happened to you if you said,

01:02:46.559 --> 01:02:51.000
“What God?” That would not just be the
end of your career as an architect, so we

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.650
don’t know that about... We don’t know
the same about, even the devotional painters,

01:02:55.650 --> 01:03:04.109
we don’t know if they were believers, or
the composers. Of the devotional poets, and

01:03:04.109 --> 01:03:08.049
I'm on stronger ground here as a literary
critic, I know a bit more about it. People

01:03:08.049 --> 01:03:12.359
like John Donne or George Herbert, it would
be very, very hard to fake writing that if

01:03:12.359 --> 01:03:16.460
you weren’t a believer. It would be extremely
hard, where would you get your inspiration

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:20.869
from? And my feeling is that it’s real devotional
poetry and I personally couldn't be without

01:03:20.869 --> 01:03:30.579
it. We’d be much poorer. To stay with the
literature if you don’t mind. The King James

01:03:30.579 --> 01:03:34.869
version of the bible, the King James translation,
referred to in the New York Times recently

01:03:34.869 --> 01:03:41.230
as the St. James translation, is itself a
great work of literature and one couldn't

01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:45.260
be without it, if you don’t understand the
beauty of that liturgy, there’s a lot of

01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:50.519
Shakespeare and of Milton and Blake you wouldn’t
get, you wouldn’t know what was going on.

01:03:50.519 --> 01:03:58.010
So it’s part of literacy to know it. I once
wrote a book about the Parthenon, very important

01:03:58.010 --> 01:04:03.839
building for western civilization, great deal
to be learned from it and from, by its beauty

01:04:03.839 --> 01:04:10.589
and by its symmetry and by its extraordinary
architecture and sculpture. But I no longer

01:04:10.589 --> 01:04:16.809
care about the culture of Pallas Athena and
I don’t care about the mystical ceremonies,

01:04:16.809 --> 01:04:21.160
some of them involving animal sacrifice and
possibly human, that were conducted on the

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:25.890
road from Eleusis. And I don’t have to care
about Athenian imperialism and what it did

01:04:25.890 --> 01:04:30.890
to the Greek colonies in the rest of the Mediterranean.
I can just appreciate the building and some—and

01:04:30.890 --> 01:04:35.059
know about the philosophical context and the
plays of Sophocles and all the other things

01:04:35.059 --> 01:04:38.990
that were going on at the same time without
any reference to their gods. So I propose

01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:44.490
that what culture largely means to us now
is how to deal with civilizational art and

01:04:44.490 --> 01:04:52.240
great creativity in a post-supernatural era.
In other words, how to keep all of that that’s

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:57.789
of value without having to care about the
culture of Pallas Athena for example or to

01:04:57.789 --> 01:05:03.559
be forced to bear in mind that say, St. Peter’s
in Rome, actually not I think that impressive

01:05:03.559 --> 01:05:08.369
a building, was built by special set of indulgences,
I mean that’s how the money for it was raised.

01:05:08.369 --> 01:05:13.430
We can consider that independently now. We
can value this building without knowing that.

01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:15.451
Though I always find it’s somewhat hard
to forget.

01:05:15.451 --> 01:05:22.119
&gt;&gt; Right. Okay. I was just curious, I mean
I wanted to seek more towards how all these

01:05:22.119 --> 01:05:27.780
things in art and music and creativity are
often relayed between individuals as being

01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:33.259
spiritual or something along that nature whether
or not the actual topic.

01:05:33.259 --> 01:05:40.799
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: I wanted to say a bit more of
this when I was speaking first. I think that

01:05:40.799 --> 01:05:46.589
the human need for the transcendent, for the
spiritual is undeniable but that’s not the

01:05:46.589 --> 01:05:51.529
supernatural. It’s very important to understand.
The feeling that people get out of landscape

01:05:51.529 --> 01:05:58.849
and music, or landscape and music in combination.
The feeling of war and love at the same time

01:05:58.849 --> 01:06:06.040
has had extraordinary consequences for many
people, or one or other on their own. These

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:09.230
are the things we can’t do without but there’s
no reason to attribute them to the supernatural.

01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:12.449
You’re not glimpsing anything but nature
from that.

01:06:12.449 --> 01:06:17.860
&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Hi. So it turns out if you follow the money

01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:22.460
trail back for a lot of these things, this
whole creationism, teaching creationism idea,

01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:27.839
you’ll eventually find political organizations
that are trying to energize a base, right,

01:06:27.839 --> 01:06:28.839
these bases...
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Yes.

01:06:28.839 --> 01:06:32.079
&gt;&gt; What they’d like to do is to get these
people to feel like they’re being attacked.

01:06:32.079 --> 01:06:36.630
And in lot of the discussions we have in your
presentation, there’s a fine line between

01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:42.390
attacking people versus attacking ideas, right?
What do you do to kind of ensure that you’re

01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:46.599
not going after people and not making people
feel like you’re telling them that they’re

01:06:46.599 --> 01:06:49.800
idiots for example? All right. How do you
make that separation?

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:58.119
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Well, I think my answer’s been
anticipated perhaps.

01:06:58.119 --> 01:07:00.630
&gt;&gt; All right.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: If someone tells me that I’ve

01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:03.119
hurt their feelings I’m still waiting to
hear what your point is.

01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:06.530
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: I'm very depressed that in this

01:07:06.530 --> 01:07:13.319
country you can be told that’s offensive
as if those two words constitute an argument

01:07:13.319 --> 01:07:16.789
or comment, not to me they don’t, and I'm
not running for anything. So, I didn't have

01:07:16.789 --> 01:07:22.040
to pretend to like people when I don’t.
&gt;&gt; Right. Thanks.

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:30.839
&gt;&gt; Hello. Oh, thank you so much for speaking.
I think we’re going to have a book signing

01:07:30.839 --> 01:07:36.280
right outside over here. So, if everyone got
their copy of the book, thank you very much

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.270
for coming.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: How very nice of you.
