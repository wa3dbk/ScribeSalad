[Music plays]

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.139
&gt;&gt;Rick Kleffel: Ladies and gentlemen, can
you please turn on your cell phones in case

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.370
you get a better offer.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.219
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Rick Kleffel: Where you've come from is

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.480
gone.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.230
Where you think you're going to never existed
and where you are is no good unless you can

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.830
get away.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.580
Where is there a place for you to be?

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.780
Nowhere.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.920
But if you've got a good search engine you
do not need to be redeemed.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:39.059
Ladies and gentlemen, with us today we have
a man who works with the quantum level of

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.649
human communication.

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.649
We're standing in a tower that showcases the
enormous engines that we can bring to bear

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:53.819
to send atoms, molecules, electrons around
the world to bring two people together.

00:00:53.819 --> 00:01:01.059
This is the man who works at the absolute
lowest level of human communication words.

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:06.290
His newest book is "This is How You Lose Her"
and he will give you a great instruction guide

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.340
to do just that.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.820
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Rick Kleffel: His first book was the acclaimed

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.100
short story collection, "Drown" his Pulitzer
Prize winning novel was "The Brief, Wondrous

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.890
Life of Oscar Wao."

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.600
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Junot
Diaz.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.600
[Applause]

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.560
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Thank you.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:38.719
I guess by way of like prefatory comments
thank you all for coming out.

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.630
We all know you all are busy.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.450
I mean, gee whiz.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.310
So, I appreciate you coming here in your spare
time.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.560
I also wanted to thank Rick.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.170
I'm actually a big old time fan of Rick's.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.299
I have been following the Agony Columns since,
you know, a really long time.

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:05.580
I always enjoy when you're behind on reviews
and you're like, "I'm gonna dig up some old

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.560
review just to warm you dudes up."

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.869
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: So it's a real pleasure to be

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:11.869
here.

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:16.670
It's a real pleasure and I thank all the people
who made this possible, again, you know, you

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.780
guys certainly understand that artists come,
they just appear but almost always it's a

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.280
bunch of people on the sideline doing the
stuff outside of their job description and

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.030
outside of their pay rate to bring people
like me around and I really appreciate and

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.110
wanna acknowledge that sort of invisible work
that makes these events possible.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.730
And, again, thank you guys.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.790
So, how do you wanna do this, Rick?

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:41.790
What are you thinking?

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.530
&gt;&gt;Rick Kleffel: I'm thinking you could read
the first chapter of the last story.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.140
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Okay, just a little brief reading,
I think, nothing-

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.010
&gt;&gt;Rick Kleffel: It's three pages, should take
a couple minutes.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.020
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Yeah.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.440
I don't know if you guys-

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.580
&gt;&gt;Rick Kleffel: Utter brilliance.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.790
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: That's highly doubtful but thank
you.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.490
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Highly doubtful.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.290
&gt;&gt;Rick Kleffel: There's a voice here that
you will never forget.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.290
Reading him is like-

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.180
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Damn you, Rick!

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.180
[Laughter]

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.980
&gt;&gt;Rick Kleffel: No, but remember the first
time you heard Aretha Franklin?

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.240
That voice coming out-
[Laughter]

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.590
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Come on, Rick.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.590
[Laughter]

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.620
&gt;&gt;Rick Kleffel: This is the literary equivalent
of that.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.620
[Laughter]

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.640
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: This is weed smoking, the consequences.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.120
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Young people, stay away from

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.120
it.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.320
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: For real this is what happens.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.320
Come on, Rick.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.320
Cut it out.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.620
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: This is like a banal second

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.710
person voice.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.910
This is actually intentionally attempting
to get away from anything that would be remotely

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.140
considered attractive, you know?

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.510
So, I'm just gonna read it, second person,
it's a story called "The Cheater's Guide to

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.070
Love."

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.790
For those of you that are interested in narrative
you know the second person, as a form, sucks.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.650
It's like kind of repellent.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.720
Most of your experience with the second person
was as a young person.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.220
The second person command form and totally
made you, hate, like, adults.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.260
So, here we go.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.290
"Year Zero.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.010
Your girl catches you cheating.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.040
Well actually, she's your fiancée.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.840
But hey, in a bit it so won't matter.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.260
She could have caught you with one sucia she
could've caught you with two but as you're

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.600
a totally [batched Guido] who didn't ever
empty his email trashcan, she caught you with

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.600
50.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:37.790
Sure, over a 6 year period but still, 50 fucking
girls, God damn.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.170
Maybe if you'd been engaged to a super open
minded blanquita you could have survived it."

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.060
[Laughter]
"But you're not engaged to a super open minded

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.880
blanquita, your girl is a badass [unintelligible]
who doesn't believe in open anything.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.180
In fact, the one thing she warned you about
that she swore she would never forgive was

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.180
cheating.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.760
'I'll put a machete in you' she promised."

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.400
[Laughter]
"And of course you swore you wouldn't do it,

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.870
you swore you wouldn't do it, you swore you
wouldn't and you did.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.730
She'll stick around for a few months because
you dated for a long, long time, because you

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:22.560
went through much together; her father's death,
your tenure madness, her bar exam and because

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.370
love, real love, is not so easily shed.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.750
Over a tortured six month period you will
fly to the DR, to Mexico, to New Zealand.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.080
You will walk the beach where they filmed
'The Piano,' something she'd always wanted

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.810
to do and now, in penitent desperation, you
give it to her.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.610
She is immensely sad on that beach and walks
up and down the shining sand alone, bare feet

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:52.050
in the freezing water and when you try to
hug her she says 'don't.'

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.700
She stares at the rocks jutting out of the
water, the wind taking her hair straight back.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.870
On the ride back to the hotel up those wild
steeps, you pick up a pair of hitchhikers;

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:08.580
a couple so mixed it's ridiculous and so giddy
with love that you almost throw them out the

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.580
car."

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.080
[Laughter]
"She says nothing.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.169
Later in the hotel she will cry.

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:19.550
You try every trick in the book to keep her,
you write letters, you drive her to work,

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:25.360
you quote Neruda, you compose a mass email
disowning all your sucias , you block their

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.830
emails, you change your phone numbers, you
stop drinking , you stop smoking, you claim

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:34.730
you're a sex addict and start attending meetings,
you blame your father, you blame your mother,

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.060
you blame the patriarchy, you blame Santo
Domingo, you find a therapist, you cancel

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.250
your Facebook, you give her the passwords
to all of your email accounts"

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.950
[Laughter]
"you start taking salsa classes like you always

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.120
swore you would so the two of you could dance
together, you claim that you were sick, you

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:55.730
claim that you were weak, it was the book,
it was the pressure and every hour like clockwork

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.900
you say that you're so, so sorry.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:06.250
You try it all but one day she will simply
sit up in bed and say, 'No more' and yeah,

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.960
and you will have to move from the Harlem
apartment the two of you have shared.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:16.650
You consider not going, you consider a squat
protest, in fact, you say you won't go but

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.760
in the end you do.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.500
For awhile you haunt the city like a two bit
ball player waiting for a call up.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.550
You phone her every day and leave messages
which she doesn't answer.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.840
You write her long sensitive letters which
she returns unopened.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.990
You even show up at her apartment at odd hours
and at her job downtown until finally her

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:40.480
little sister calls you, the one who was always
on your side, and she makes it plain.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:47.010
'If you try to contact my sister again she's
going to put a restraining order on you.'

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:55.100
For some Negros that wouldn't mean shit but
you ain’t that kind of a Negro.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:08:00.880
You stop; you move back to Boston, you never
see her again."

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:06.229
That's all, thank you.

00:08:06.229 --> 00:08:07.560
[Applause]

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:12.710
&gt;&gt;Rick Kleffel: They're a foreign species
aren't they?

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:13.710
They look like-

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:14.710
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Dudes.

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:16.830
&gt;&gt;Rick Kleffel: They have the same DNA as
us but they're a completely different species.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.430
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Oh, I thought you meant men.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.590
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Men, even those of us who are

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:29.960
men know that we are like an alien unto ourselves
which is sort of an outcome of our encourage

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.460
not to have much internal scrutiny.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.460
Yeah.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:37.229
&gt;&gt;Rick Kleffel: You know, one of the things
that I just reread the "Brief Wondrous Life

00:08:37.229 --> 00:08:38.229
of Oscar Wao"

00:08:38.229 --> 00:08:39.229
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Rick.

00:08:39.229 --> 00:08:40.229
[Laughter]

00:08:40.229 --> 00:08:41.229
&gt;&gt;Rick Kleffel: I had to.

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:42.229
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Come on man.

00:08:42.229 --> 00:08:45.230
&gt;&gt;Rick Kleffel: It was so much fun and one
of the things that really knocked me out about

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:53.240
that book was the way you use, you engage
in what any science fiction reader would called

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.240
world building.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.279
For those of us who have never been to the
Dominican Republic or don't know anything

00:08:58.279 --> 00:09:06.459
about that and immigrant experience and you
use, you create that world by using, in part,

00:09:06.459 --> 00:09:09.499
the language of fans of world building fiction.

00:09:09.499 --> 00:09:10.499
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Sure.

00:09:10.499 --> 00:09:14.499
&gt;&gt;Rick Kleffel: And I think that was such
an interesting decision to do that.

00:09:14.499 --> 00:09:21.309
Tell us a little bit just about creating that
kind of character and the, your fascination

00:09:21.309 --> 00:09:22.420
with that kind of literature.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.100
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: No, it's a really great observation,
Rick.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:30.350
I mean, one of the things I teach at MIT is
I teach a class for, of world building for

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:35.180
various narrative media so I have kids that,
like, wanna do comic books, I got kids that

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.330
are working on computer games, kids who are
working on film, kids who are doing pen and

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.379
paper stuff doing, like, fiction.

00:09:40.379 --> 00:09:43.889
So, you know, each of these kinds of mediums
have their different affordances but world

00:09:43.889 --> 00:09:47.029
buildings a sort of essential component of
this stuff.

00:09:47.029 --> 00:09:53.589
What interested me very deeply was that all
of us go about worlds where we kind of take

00:09:53.589 --> 00:10:00.670
them for granted, that old sort of super brainy
word that, our doxa, like what we, our common

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:03.420
place, the thing that we don’t even think
about.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:07.339
But if you're gonna do any kind of art and
tell any kind of story you have to produce

00:10:07.339 --> 00:10:11.170
the world where your characters and your conflicts
are set.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:16.199
Even if it's the real world, you have to produce
it, you have to create it, you have to world

00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:17.199
build.

00:10:17.199 --> 00:10:21.529
Most of us don't notice world building in
what we would call straight fiction, like

00:10:21.529 --> 00:10:26.649
what we would call literary fiction or mainstream
fiction but, of course, it's occurring.

00:10:26.649 --> 00:10:31.110
So what interested me really deeply was I
grew up reading a ton of science fiction,

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:38.259
a ton of fantasy, a ton of horror, genres
where world building is what is used to heighten

00:10:38.259 --> 00:10:40.679
and contextualize the conflict, right?

00:10:40.679 --> 00:10:46.529
We know that for horror most explicitly that
horror tends to use all these gothic cues

00:10:46.529 --> 00:10:50.170
and all this kind of gothic settings so that
we know that there's gonna be some horrible

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:54.070
thing that's gonna happen and all sorts of
terrible kind of dangers and monsters are

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:59.790
much more possible because the world sort
of, you know, leads us into a very unsteady

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:05.730
terrain where monstrosity seems not to be
an exception but almost an inevitability.

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:11.420
And what happens with me is I become obsessed
with reading all these books and I notice

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:19.339
that there is almost no difference between
Jane Eyre rendering her world, yeah, a world

00:11:19.339 --> 00:11:23.610
that she knew completely, we're talking about
the narrative presence, she knew completely

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:28.850
well but still she went out of her way to
make sure she explained the world for readers.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:34.850
Yeah, versus a Tolkien who is in some ways
the raison d'être, you know, he's like the

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:38.190
most important of our concept as traditional
world builders where he goes out of his way

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:46.029
to explain middle earth and I realized that
any story worth reading requires, or worth

00:11:46.029 --> 00:11:53.269
engaging in or worth playing with, requires
the world to be communicated efficiently and

00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:55.429
in many ways, as beautifully as possible.

00:11:55.429 --> 00:12:00.399
So the Dominican Republic, something I know
incredibly well and Central New Jersey, another

00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:02.019
place I know incredibly well,
[Laughter]

00:12:02.019 --> 00:12:03.749
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: I mean, anybody, Jersey?

00:12:03.749 --> 00:12:04.749
&gt;&gt;audience members: Yeah!

00:12:04.749 --> 00:12:05.749
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Yes?

00:12:05.749 --> 00:12:07.059
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Where in Jersey?

00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:08.059
&gt;&gt;audience member: Montgomery

00:12:08.059 --> 00:12:09.399
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Oh yeah, man.

00:12:09.399 --> 00:12:11.259
I delivered pool tables there.

00:12:11.259 --> 00:12:15.800
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: That's cool, that's cool, man.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.290
Anyone from Santo Doming at all?

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.290
&gt;&gt;male: Here.

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:19.290
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Yes!

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.309
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: We're always, there's always

00:12:20.309 --> 00:12:21.309
one of us.

00:12:21.309 --> 00:12:23.619
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: [unintelligible Spanish], man.

00:12:23.619 --> 00:12:29.850
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: So I realized that the part

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:37.110
of what I knew so well I had to render it,
you know, I had to create it and, again, the

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:43.259
cues of good world building, for me, I just
felt it was like a natural to just use fantasy,

00:12:43.259 --> 00:12:49.040
science fiction, horror, as a way to show
how there is almost no difference and, in

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.639
fact, they're drawing on the same grammars.

00:12:50.639 --> 00:12:57.499
&gt;&gt;Rick Kleffel: It's, it really makes the
world so vivid for us and one of the things,

00:12:57.499 --> 00:13:04.459
too, that I see in all of your fiction and
all your stories there's a really unique sense

00:13:04.459 --> 00:13:12.302
of the voice in story, anything you tell us
is crafted in prose and in voice that is so

00:13:12.302 --> 00:13:18.680
compelling we are just grabbed from the first
sentence and held riveted till whatever the

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.699
hell you're saying ends and it doesn't even
matter.

00:13:21.699 --> 00:13:27.040
And if I were to describe "The Brief Wondrous
Life of Oscar Wao" to myself I could describe

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:32.550
it in a way I'd say, "I'd never read a book
like that" but then when I sit down and read

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.540
it I am instantly linked.

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:43.379
I'd like you to just talk a little bit about
discovering that voice and, you know, creating

00:13:43.379 --> 00:13:45.890
the Yunior of the Rings Trilogy.

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:47.579
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Yeah, no, thank you.

00:13:47.579 --> 00:13:55.760
You know part of this, Rick, comes from sort
of a strategy that you need as a story teller,

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.350
I mean, especially guys if you're trying to
do any kind of ideological work which anyone

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:03.649
who's telling stories is even they're not
doing it consciously, you know, part of telling

00:14:03.649 --> 00:14:08.749
a story is that you're in some ways pitching
an ethos, you know, it's just the nature,

00:14:08.749 --> 00:14:10.160
it comes out of it.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:16.329
But, for me, I tend to be really interested
in topics that people have huge resistances

00:14:16.329 --> 00:14:17.709
to talking about.

00:14:17.709 --> 00:14:23.110
So I'm really interested in, sort of, the
long term consequences of rape, you know,

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:29.149
I'm interested in what it means to live in
the shadow of a dictatorship.

00:14:29.149 --> 00:14:38.049
I'm interested in stuff like how race and
racism and self hatred organize a sexual economy.

00:14:38.049 --> 00:14:42.480
I mean, we like to think that we just fall
in love but people fall in love in pretty

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:46.279
predictable terms along the racial economy.

00:14:46.279 --> 00:14:50.560
So I'm interested in all this stuff but people
don't ever wanna talk about this shit.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:55.569
I mean, my MIT students, I'll be like, "Is
there any race issues at MIT?" and they're

00:14:55.569 --> 00:14:56.610
like, "None!"

00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:57.610
[Laughter]

00:14:57.610 --> 00:14:58.690
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Right?

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:01.290
They're like, "None!" and I'm like, "Really?

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:02.290
Huh?"

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:06.399
I was like, "There seems to be a lot of Asian
girls with white dudes."

00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:10.760
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: And suddenly it's like the thing

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:15.160
that you weren't supposed to say, you weren't
supposed to talk about this stuff and suddenly

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.820
they're just, their brains are gripped by
this silence.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.550
And I think that we have a lot of resistance
to talk about things that we observe everyday

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:29.430
and, so, I think part of the work that occurs
with Yunior's voice isn't simply because you're

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:35.170
like looking for a nice voice so that people
will read the book, I need something heavy

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:42.049
duty to misdirect the reader so that they
will read a book about the consequences of

00:15:42.049 --> 00:15:46.829
rape, the consequences of how we seem to fall
in love in ways that Adolf Hitler would be

00:15:46.829 --> 00:15:54.579
pleased and that also on top of that, that
like a lot of us are haunted, deeply haunted

00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:59.889
by all sorts of both family, personal and
often national histories which we don't even

00:15:59.889 --> 00:16:05.740
recognize and a lot of stuff people ain't,
you bring this shit up, I talk to my students

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:09.410
about it and that's the thing in class my
students can't wait to get off.

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:14.310
They're just like, "Yo, don't talk to me about
how everybody I date is lighter skinned than

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:15.310
me.

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:18.170
I wanna do it; I don't wanna talk about it."

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:21.389
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: "Don't talk about how I, we

00:16:21.389 --> 00:16:23.930
all exoticize Asian women in a certain way.

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:26.990
We just wanna do it but don't bring it up."

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:29.660
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: And I think part of what happens

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:33.009
when you create these sort of books where
you're trying to wrestle with these issues

00:16:33.009 --> 00:16:36.369
is that you need this sort of, what we call,
ledger domain, you need this kind of sleight

00:16:36.369 --> 00:16:40.859
of hand so that people are lured into the
conversation without them even knowing they're

00:16:40.859 --> 00:16:41.859
in there.

00:16:41.859 --> 00:16:47.040
And that's the plan, it never works, I'm not
kidding, it never works.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.809
It's a gesture towards a strategy.

00:16:49.809 --> 00:16:54.429
&gt;&gt;Rick Kleffel: You know, it strikes me that
in a sense that you're a horror fiction writer

00:16:54.429 --> 00:16:58.209
because you're writing about the things that
we're scared to even know.

00:16:58.209 --> 00:17:00.190
It's very crafty in that sense.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:01.290
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: No question.

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:05.480
And how often, I mean first it's a nice comparison,
I'm like-

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:09.100
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: But how accurate it is I don't

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:10.100
know.

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:13.709
But sort of that's kind of a, a kind of punning
into meaning.

00:17:13.709 --> 00:17:17.819
Part of what we all do as artists, I mean,
the reason, guys we're in the middle of an

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:26.639
election campaign, you all notice that neither
of our possible oppressors-in-chief

00:17:26.639 --> 00:17:29.380
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: that neither of them have mentioned

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:32.770
an artist?

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:34.429
You can go through a whole campaign- say?

00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:36.450
&gt;&gt;audience member: [inaudible]
[Laughter]

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:37.970
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Yeah.

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:38.980
Right, right.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:42.590
If that was Clint Eastwood that was as close
as we come to discussing art.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:43.590
[Laughter]

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:45.710
&gt;&gt;Rick Kleffel: And we're back in the horror
genre.

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:46.710
[Laughter]

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:47.710
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Yeah I know!

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:49.790
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: That was like, I don't know

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:52.890
about you but I literally had one of those
weird moments where I was watching that and

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:56.500
I was like, "Did I start smoking crack and
never tell myself?"

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.830
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Cause you're like, "What the

00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:59.830
hell?"

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:00.830
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: So-

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.620
&gt;&gt;Rick Kleffel: It was a media drum moment.

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.899
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: My God.

00:18:04.899 --> 00:18:05.899
My God.

00:18:05.899 --> 00:18:06.899
My God.

00:18:06.899 --> 00:18:10.740
But, so, you know, part of the reason this
is always happening is because in our culture,

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:18.840
the thing with artists is that artists are
just fundamentally attracted to the things

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.050
that no one is trying to deal with.

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:23.850
I mean, that's what art's nature is.

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:28.600
It immediately goes for a silence, you know,
immediately goes for an absence.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:33.059
So it's not a bad thing to do it just means
you have to have a certain constitution for

00:18:33.059 --> 00:18:38.919
it, you know, and it's, you know, like you
said, it's a bit of a horror story for both

00:18:38.919 --> 00:18:44.010
the artist and for the people because it's
not as if the average artist gets any pleasure

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:47.360
at bringing stuff up that other people resist.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:54.799
I mean, for real, rare is the artist who goes
to bed thinking, "Aha, I have been transgressive.

00:18:54.799 --> 00:18:55.799
I feel great."

00:18:55.799 --> 00:18:58.720
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Usually it costs, you know,

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.370
it's not just self validation, it usually
costs an artist just as much to break these

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:05.850
kind of force fields but I think those of
us who are drawn to be an artist, we know

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:10.730
this is important, we know that we're in service
of a larger cause, so, you do it.

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:19.580
&gt;&gt;Rick Kleffel: When you're sitting down to,
your stories have so much insight and it's

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:27.389
a really interesting insight into the way
that men and women talk to one another because

00:19:27.389 --> 00:19:32.289
it's influenced by absence.

00:19:32.289 --> 00:19:38.140
What we see is somebody who is abs-, you give
us somebody who is absolutely clueless in

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:45.920
many ways as to what his, what effects his
actions are going to have.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:50.360
And, after awhile, at first you're just going,
"Oh, this is pretty funny" and then after

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.490
awhile you're just thinking, "Oh, wait.

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:53.490
Oh wait."

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:55.519
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Yeah, no, it's true.

00:19:55.519 --> 00:19:59.429
I mean, I think that privilege requires an
operational cluelessness.

00:19:59.429 --> 00:20:02.279
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: You know, I think it's no accident

00:20:02.279 --> 00:20:08.080
that Yunior is completely blithely unaware
of what his masculinity in his relationships

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.389
to women does.

00:20:09.389 --> 00:20:16.259
You know, I mean, I think it's, in fact, in
many ways is part of his legacy.

00:20:16.259 --> 00:20:24.730
I think, again, it's one of those things where
Yunior's cluelessness is what always, the

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:32.570
consequences of operating in a world where
you have privilege is you quickly begin to

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:39.139
realize that the energy it takes for you not
to notice what you're doing begins to slowly

00:20:39.139 --> 00:20:40.380
eat at you.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:45.289
You know, and I think that, you know, it takes,
I'm telling you it takes a lot of effort to

00:20:45.289 --> 00:20:52.919
sit around and pretend that you're not harming
anyone, to pretend that you're not predatory.

00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:58.559
I mean, no one likes to think of ourselves
as predatory but the nature of privilege is

00:20:58.559 --> 00:21:04.240
that you're predatory and I think that if
you have any kind of a soul or any kind of

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:09.730
compassionate soul it creates all this kind
of contradictions in you, it begins to eat

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:10.730
at you.

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:14.550
And I always think like, "God, when I grow
up" when I was growing up most of what I was

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:20.560
learning as a young man in a super masculine
culture, I came from a military parent, my

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:24.350
little brother is a combat veteran, marine
combat veteran, my sister was married into

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:28.769
the army, my two nephews served in Iraq.

00:21:28.769 --> 00:21:31.480
My family was like seriously military family.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:36.360
What I noticed is a lot of this shit that
we were learning as boys, as men, was how

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.500
to manage our masculinity.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:47.230
Like what we would do to take the bite off
of that slowly devouring recognition and it

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:49.690
wears you out.

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:55.529
&gt;&gt;Rick Kleffel: I'd like to invite the audience
to ask some questions.

00:21:55.529 --> 00:21:57.950
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Rick Kleffel: before you and I spend the

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:00.070
next three hours up here dweeby nerding.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.070
[Laughter]

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:02.570
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Well we're gonna fuckin' do
the worm on you guys.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:03.570
[Laughter]

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:05.659
&gt;&gt;Rick Kleffel: There's a gentleman in a green
shirt right there.

00:22:05.659 --> 00:22:07.950
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: That's you, sir.

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:09.779
&gt;&gt;male #1: Oh, hi.

00:22:09.779 --> 00:22:13.320
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Oh, that's what you were doing.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.590
You're so good, bro.

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:18.990
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: They got you-

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:22.389
&gt;&gt;Rick Kleffel: Oh, here we go.

00:22:22.389 --> 00:22:27.880
&gt;&gt;male #1: So I am a Boricua from Newark New
Jersey, Boricua Puerto Rican for anybody who

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:28.880
doesn't-

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.880
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Where North New Jersey?

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.880
&gt;&gt;male #1: Newark New Jersey.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.880
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Oh, Newark.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:32.880
&gt;&gt;male #1: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:33.880
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: I spend a lot of time in Newark.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.470
&gt;&gt;male #1: Yeah, my parents went to Rutgers
where you were an undergrad, I just graduated

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:41.330
from Cornell where you got your Master's of
Fine Arts; I read your Wikipedia page, of

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:42.330
course.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:43.330
[Laughter]

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:44.330
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Damn you.

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:48.531
&gt;&gt;male #1: Yeah and I just wanted to know
how much, you know, I'm a big fan of your

00:22:48.531 --> 00:22:49.531
writing.

00:22:49.531 --> 00:22:52.880
Last time when I was an intern at the Hispanic
Googler's Network, I started a book group

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:56.970
and the book we read was "The Brief Wondrous
Life of Oscar Wao" and I was wondering how

00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:02.380
much of your, how much of your writing is
giving insight to those that don't know what

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:05.220
it's like to grow up as an urban Latino youth?

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:12.679
And how much of it is, you know, writing for
the Latino population and being that, being

00:23:12.679 --> 00:23:17.820
that, you know, that author that everyone
knows as standing up as an example and a model

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:20.390
for other aspiring Latino writers?

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:24.120
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Yeah, that's a wonderful question.

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:31.380
You know, I think part of what, what one begins
to understand when one, especially a reader,

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:39.419
is that most of us are not exposed to a culture
where our experiences are narrativized.

00:23:39.419 --> 00:23:45.200
Where, in other words, we're mysteries unto
ourselves especially if you come from a background

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.500
like say an immigrant background or a Latino
background.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:51.929
Often enough we don't really have any language
to explain who the hell we are.

00:23:51.929 --> 00:23:55.910
We don't have like 200 narratives that explain
how we get here.

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:56.910
You know what I mean?

00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:02.630
And I think that often I am not writing so
that, for example, other people understand

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:08.570
what this experience is, I'm writing so that
I understand what this experience is.

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:14.120
And in that way it sort of opens up by being
incredibly particular, you know, creating

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:20.419
a space of deliberation for someone like me,
it opens up that universal, sort of, door

00:24:20.419 --> 00:24:25.250
where anyone who's interested in this experience
can sort of connect to it.

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:29.690
I mean, again, I remember when I first read
a book by someone of African descent.

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:35.190
I mean, we live in a country where you can
actually say this, I remember my first book

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:36.559
about the African Diaspora.

00:24:36.559 --> 00:24:39.289
I'm from the African Diaspora.

00:24:39.289 --> 00:24:43.559
It wasn't until I read this book that I suddenly
began to see and understand myself in a totally

00:24:43.559 --> 00:24:49.380
different way because many of us, again, we
live in a culture where we are in a culture

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:50.440
and we are ghosts.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:55.620
There is nothing in that culture that helps
us understand ourselves.

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:59.269
There's nothing on TV, there's nothing in
books, there's nothing in the larger sort

00:24:59.269 --> 00:25:02.860
of universe that gives us any insight into
our own experience.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:07.799
So I guess that's my approach, my approach
is that usually I'm writing to kind of explain

00:25:07.799 --> 00:25:14.899
this experience to myself through my characters
but that guarantees that anyone who's interested

00:25:14.899 --> 00:25:20.130
and who enjoys it will also join me on the
same exploration.

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:25.509
As far as the last part of it, you know, again
it's you're an artist and you know that you're

00:25:25.509 --> 00:25:30.830
coming out of a community, I'm coming out
of a Dominican, African Diasporic, Caribbean,

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:37.240
military, Jersey and a million other spaces
background, you know, nerd, whatever.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:50.250
I guess, I'm aware that as a writer, as an
artist my presence is really just what I would

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:53.160
call a marker of absence.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:58.380
The fact that I'm a Dominican writer just
speaks to how many thousands of Dominican

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:01.260
writers we don't have and need.

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:06.379
The fact that I'm like a Caribbean writer
explains, for me, it's more I'm standing in

00:26:06.379 --> 00:26:08.980
for how many more stories we need.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:14.769
I don't think I represent anyone but I think
I a marker of a great unhappy absence.

00:26:14.769 --> 00:26:18.509
So, there's other hands, yeah.

00:26:18.509 --> 00:26:20.620
&gt;&gt;female #1: I don't think this is working.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:21.809
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: It is.

00:26:21.809 --> 00:26:28.500
&gt;&gt;female #1: Okay, so you mentioned, you said
that you think of privilege as predatory and

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:33.409
that it eats away and you're using masculinity
as an example, do you see, do you apply that

00:26:33.409 --> 00:26:38.659
to something like white privilege as opp-,
which I never thought of as eating away at

00:26:38.659 --> 00:26:43.560
anyone since they're kind of unaware of it
and do you feel qualified to write about it.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:48.100
Obviously masculinity is something you write
about and maybe feel qualified as a man but

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:52.789
writing about that in terms of race issues
as opposed to gender issues where you're not

00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:59.730
white, I don’t know, I just wonder how you,
is that an analogy that you can also apply

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:01.539
to white privilege?

00:27:01.539 --> 00:27:03.240
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Without any question.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:09.220
I mean, I feel like we often, again, the training
we get in this country is that we rarely get

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:11.169
a starter course on white supremacy.

00:27:11.169 --> 00:27:14.770
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: But I think it's very important

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:18.600
for us to have a starter course on white supremacy
because we tend to think that-

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.299
&gt;&gt;Rick Kleffel: It's American history 101.

00:27:20.299 --> 00:27:21.299
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Yeah.

00:27:21.299 --> 00:27:22.840
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: But we also tend to think that

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:26.590
white supremacy is a discussion of white people.

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:31.490
White supremacy doesn't, if you think, guys
if you really think that white people are

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:35.149
running white supremacy, that's crazy.

00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:36.809
They can't do the work to run it.

00:27:36.809 --> 00:27:42.379
I think that the nature is that white supremacy
is in every single person in the system.

00:27:42.379 --> 00:27:47.650
So that someone like me in the Dominican Republic,
all I have to do is take you into one of our

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:55.899
pharmacies and show you all the skin lightening
creams, show you all the horrors that people

00:27:55.899 --> 00:28:00.710
inflict on their skin to try to match a white
ideal.

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:05.950
You don't even need white people to practice
white supremacy; in fact, it works best when

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:08.990
there's actually not a large collective of
white folks around.

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:14.509
I mean, I think that white supremacy is a
force, it's sort of a gravitational force,

00:28:14.509 --> 00:28:20.280
in almost all the cul- not in almost, in all
the cultures of what we call the new world.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:26.899
And I certainly am very much interested in
this I mean my characters are aware even within

00:28:26.899 --> 00:28:33.929
their group of how lightness as a privilege
and darkness is something to be avoided or

00:28:33.929 --> 00:28:38.720
at least to be thought of in certainly particularly
deformed ways like, you know, a certain kind

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:43.559
of darkness in males becomes hyper sexualized
and darkness in females becomes a desirable

00:28:43.559 --> 00:28:44.559
mulata.

00:28:44.559 --> 00:28:51.200
But, again, I think that this is something
that eats at all of us because think about

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:59.309
how white supremacy has divided folks from
a real sense of communion with each other.

00:28:59.309 --> 00:29:01.860
You know, and how it has just damaged communities.

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:07.269
I mean, I don't know if you've seen the figures
of how many billions of dollars worldwide

00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:12.129
are being spent by people trying to burn their
skin pale.

00:29:12.129 --> 00:29:17.279
So I guess for me it's the same thing, it's
a, any kind of privilege is a predator that

00:29:17.279 --> 00:29:21.309
eats at us, you know, but I always say to
my students, I'm like, "You can take every

00:29:21.309 --> 00:29:27.679
single damn white person on the earth, put
them on a spaceship, send them out and we

00:29:27.679 --> 00:29:30.630
will keep white supremacy running fully well.

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:36.710
Yeah, in China, try to be a black person trying
to teach English in China.

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:38.910
You can't get a job.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:39.910
You can't get a job.

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:42.919
I had a student went to China tried to teach
English and they're like; "We only want white

00:29:42.919 --> 00:29:44.990
people."

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:48.529
So I think that this is something that is
important and as an artist I'm just drawn

00:29:48.529 --> 00:29:50.049
to it.

00:29:50.049 --> 00:29:57.179
&gt;&gt;male #2: Hi, so I was reading the new bio
of Dave Foster Wallace recently and there

00:29:57.179 --> 00:30:01.789
was a lot of talk about various author's thoughts
on the contemporary state of literature and

00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:07.419
like really consciously writing with an ethos
like [unintelligible name] and Franzen saying

00:30:07.419 --> 00:30:12.070
we have to return to literature's roots and
paraphrasing, it's unlikely that anyone with

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:14.600
a computer at their job is writing good fiction.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:20.379
And since you're at Google and you teach at
MIT, I'm wondering if you have like maybe

00:30:20.379 --> 00:30:24.970
thoughts on that particular statement but
generally on like the role of fiction in an

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:27.090
increasingly like Twitterized world.

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:32.019
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Sure, yeah, do I have any, like,
stupendously unhelpful generalizations

00:30:32.019 --> 00:30:35.990
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: It's really what it is because,

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:41.490
well no because really what it is, it's so
strange to hear authors talk about the state

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:42.760
of American fiction.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:48.870
Guys, I read a book, this is what I do for
a living, I read a book every two or three

00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:53.529
days, you know what I'm saying, like I'm a
herb like that.

00:30:53.529 --> 00:31:00.090
But I have probably read .00001 percent of
American literature.

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:04.869
For me to draw any conclusions on my reading
about what's going on in American literature,

00:31:04.869 --> 00:31:09.710
Franzen has shown no awareness, I totally
respect the guy, but he's shown no awareness

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:15.730
of what women writers are up to, I've never
heard him ever mention a writer of color,

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:16.970
ever.

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:19.919
I mean, he doesn't seem to have any awareness
of what the other America's writing.

00:31:19.919 --> 00:31:25.869
I'm not sure that we understand well what's
happening in any artistic pursuit.

00:31:25.869 --> 00:31:27.879
Now, are there certain tendencies?

00:31:27.879 --> 00:31:35.539
Certainly, but I wonder if our descriptions
of our art don't reveal mostly our ignorance

00:31:35.539 --> 00:31:37.260
of what's going on on the ground.

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:43.590
And, again, I'm not so sure, I mean, certainly
we're being dispersed and atomized and our

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:48.409
attention is being multiply divided by this
kind of world which is asking us to constantly

00:31:48.409 --> 00:31:54.179
consult a machine every three seconds to kind
of feel normal but we've been under weirder

00:31:54.179 --> 00:31:58.210
conditions before and we've produced enormous
art.

00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:02.080
You know, I think that the challenges are
real.

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:09.249
Living in this pace that we live now is a
real challenge not to be dismissed but I guess

00:32:09.249 --> 00:32:15.570
I have an enormous faith because I come from
a community that has come out of worse situations

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:22.080
than this and has produced most of the culture
that we call American and is quite beautiful.

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:27.260
So I guess in my mind I think that we're not
as bad as people make us look.

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:34.890
And our resistances to these kind of forces
is certainly valiant but the reality of the

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:40.080
forces raised against us cannot be under,
you know, undervalued.

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:47.279
And I don't know, I just, I guess I'm a utopian,
I really believe that writing inside of a

00:32:47.279 --> 00:32:50.429
problem often generates answers.

00:32:50.429 --> 00:32:54.641
And that from sitting up top and saying that
we need to return to, what literature are

00:32:54.641 --> 00:32:55.641
we going to return to?

00:32:55.641 --> 00:32:58.500
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: I'm like; Franzen is the whitest

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.210
white, white, white, white, white.

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:02.759
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: He wants to return to what,

00:33:02.759 --> 00:33:05.769
the 70's when it was white, white, white,
white, white, white?

00:33:05.769 --> 00:33:08.889
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: I mean, I don't know, I don't

00:33:08.889 --> 00:33:13.399
know what utopian past there is where things
are better.

00:33:13.399 --> 00:33:19.090
We're jacked up, we're human, we take both
our hands intuitively, put them around our

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:23.119
own necks and try to choke ourselves to death,
we just do it naturally.

00:33:23.119 --> 00:33:25.760
And the nature of us is also to try to fight
that.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:31.470
So, I don't know, I mean, no disrespect to
my fellow writers but the reality is it's

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:36.889
tough but you young people are always up to
the challenge, you surprise us.

00:33:36.889 --> 00:33:37.889
Madam?

00:33:37.889 --> 00:33:41.679
Oh, no you had a mic, sir please and then
we'll pass it over.

00:33:41.679 --> 00:33:42.679
&gt;&gt;male #3: Sure.

00:33:42.679 --> 00:33:43.880
No problem, is this on?

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:44.880
Alright.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.610
Well I think the answer to your question is
Ralph Waldo Emerson, right?

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:50.390
That's where we wanna go.

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:51.390
[Laughter]

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:53.179
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Enough said.

00:33:53.179 --> 00:33:54.179
[Laughter]

00:33:54.179 --> 00:33:59.950
&gt;&gt;male #3: but actually we, you know, here,
I'm a sort of digital humanist and so we have

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:04.340
a few things going on here that are kind of
interesting which I'd be happy to talk about

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:08.700
maybe later or something at Ngram Viewer where
we're actually able to look over like millions

00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:13.380
of books and kind of get, at least from a
linguistic level, and idea of what might be

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:16.020
going on currently which is kind of interesting.

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:20.830
But I have a more important question to ask
you which is we were talking about privilege

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:23.340
and you said you teach at MIT, that's correct?

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:28.890
So, and I was wondering cause you mentioned
earlier that neither of the presidential candidates

00:34:28.890 --> 00:34:35.450
have really mentioned art, artists, humanities,
what you think from your position of privilege

00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:41.040
of being at MIT cause it's not exactly like
a regular liberal arts school funding wise,

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:47.450
what you think that people can do to promote
the arts and humanities?

00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:51.960
What is there, I mean other than just speaking
out because, obviously, you know, the way

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:57.010
we're going and we're at Google right which
the stem fields get all the funding, right,

00:34:57.010 --> 00:35:01.030
so what do you think is possible for us to
do?

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:02.030
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Yeah.

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:03.030
&gt;&gt;male #3: To support art.

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:05.260
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: No, I think it's a wonderful
question and I think, you know, what's funny

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:10.520
about MIT is that MIT for me is just emblematic
of the larger culture.

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:15.830
Meaning MIT just makes more explicit stuff
that's being said all across America and usually

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:21.960
all across America they're saying art is frivolous
or it's utterly irrelevant.

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.790
And MIT just sort of makes that sense more
explicit.

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:27.990
They're like, "We're too busy doing this other
stuff so we don't need this."

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:30.980
You know, but it's the same kind of general
argument.

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:40.650
I think in the end we're always stuck in a
situation where the promotion of art is a

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:42.690
grass roots movement.

00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:47.210
When I hear Republicans talking about a faith
based initiative, to believe in arts and to

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:51.430
believe that communities deserve art is literally
a faith based initiative.

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:55.910
Because in the sort of economy we live now
where everything has to show black, everything

00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:59.330
has to be like well what's the economic outcome
of it?

00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:02.790
Art doesn't correspond to this at all, at
all.

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:07.360
So our logic of this sort of way that the
world works and sort of leaves art out of

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:13.050
it but, again, there's a billion strategies
most of us are pursuing it, you know, people

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:17.940
form book groups, yeah, people go see movies
occasionally.

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:23.090
You know, people like TV shows and have conversations
about them.

00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:30.150
The real thing, for me, when I'm at MIT is
that my goal at a place like that, yeah, for

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:34.720
me MIT is like when I immigrated to the United
States I immediately entered the top notch

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.420
privilege in the world.

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:41.930
So going to MIT was paled to my immigration
to the US.

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:43.760
You know, that was real privilege.

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:51.040
MIT, eh, but what I felt that my absolute
role at a place like MIT is to champion the

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:58.680
centrality and fundamental importance to art
in a place where it's really you against everybody.

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:03.160
But there also is so many allies; you'd be
amazed how many people, given the chance to

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.480
support art, will.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:11.640
And it's, it's a fight we have to do and before
it used to be like, you know, we have to have

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:15.650
our civil rights, we have to have our civic
engagement but certainly we've come to a place

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:23.890
now where our sort of social ecology has made
art very, very threatened and we all have

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:26.760
to push and there's a billion strategies.

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:33.790
You know, me, I go into the students and model
my excitement, my enthusiasm and that's not

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:39.780
a small thing because if you convince an MIT
student that art is essential to their well

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:44.380
being and to their practice you've flipped
a person who otherwise never would have been

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:47.420
flipped and you just gotta do it that way.

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:53.070
Other people do it other ways, you have these
meetings here but the battle is long but our

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:56.470
love for the arts is more powerful.

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:58.320
I mean, that's the thing.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:02.600
We all love a certain kind of art and that's
the thing that keeps us going despite the

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.430
desert of our social moment.

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:10.600
&gt;&gt;Rick Keffel: We're a narrative species and
that's why stories are so important to us.

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:14.780
We, if I ask any one of you people here who
you are, you're going to tell me a story.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:15.780
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Yeah.

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:18.410
&gt;&gt;Rick Keffel: So we all need to know about
that.

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:19.410
Last question.

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:21.860
&gt;&gt;female #2: Okay, so my question is actually
about genre fiction.

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:25.540
You mentioned that you read a lot of science
fiction and fantasy when you were growing

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:31.530
up and I also did and one of the things that
I noticed was that the future was very white.

00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:34.750
In reading, especially science fiction, certainly
reading fantasy was just a little different

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:38.130
because of that incredible nostalgia for a
certain type of whiteness.

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:42.750
So I'm wondering if you're still reading in
that genre and how you feel about the feel

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:47.760
today and also since you used so many tropes
of the kind of genre fiction if you've thought

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.280
about expanding your writing into that arena?

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:55.540
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: Yeah, I wrote and published
a science fiction story like a couple months

00:38:55.540 --> 00:39:00.840
ago called "Monstro" which appeared in the
New Yorker, it's kind of an alien virus giant

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.720
monster invasion story.

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:09.660
Look, I, the genre is shifting very, very
swiftly.

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:14.440
You have all sorts of new practitioners, you
know, M.K. Jameson, you've got all these interesting

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:19.750
people of color writing, sort of giving us,
giving the future I think a much more realistic

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:25.720
view but what's interesting about even the
whitest white science fiction or fantasy future

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:34.310
is that it's extraordinary how some of the
preoccupations that don't appear in realistic

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:37.790
fiction take over genre fiction.

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:41.930
For example, I come from a country haunted
by an American backed dictatorship.

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:47.390
The average American is not aware of how much
we love to fund dictatorships and the sort

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:48.710
of immense impact that has.

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:51.970
The average American, if you guys are not
in the military you don't, or don't have a

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:58.290
military family, you have no idea what the
American military looks like at a global level.

00:39:58.290 --> 00:40:01.660
Those of us who are in military families,
we're like, we have a totally different sense

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:03.160
of a map.

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:05.220
Realistic fiction doesn't do a good job of
that.

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:11.130
But you read science fiction and fantasy and
there's stuff in there about genocide, about

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:16.360
slavery, about the breeding of human beings
which if you're of African descent in this

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:21.240
hemisphere that's your legacy, you were bred
into existence.

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:24.620
Usually raped but it was a breeding project
of form.

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:29.012
And there were questions of power, of how
a dictator, of one person with an immense

00:40:29.012 --> 00:40:34.650
amount of power, so while the future often,
not more than often, is predominantly white,

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:39.870
a lot of the issues that people are wrestling
with are sort of the taboos that realistic

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:42.410
literature doesn't like to address.

00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:47.740
So the one can recuperate even from the whitest
narrative, some interesting things but what

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:55.270
really I'm excited about is how many young,
brown colored nerds are out there beginning

00:40:55.270 --> 00:41:00.651
to totally transform the field and there's
a bunch of young people that are coming out

00:41:00.651 --> 00:41:02.910
and that I'm like really, really excited about.

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:07.220
Again, I don't know if I'll ever be able to
really write a full science fiction book because

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:10.210
it actually, its way hard, man.

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:13.590
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: But I wouldn't mind doing it,

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:17.740
you know, you'll always have, if you have
a young love, if you like love tennis there's

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:21.830
always a part of you that wants to like, "I
wanna win a competition" or "I wanna play

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:23.350
somebody" You know?

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:24.580
So there's some of that.

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:27.120
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Junot Diaz: But I keep reading it, I keep

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.120
reading it.

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:31.880
I mean I love these Filipino brothers who,
these 'Pino brothers who write this comic

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.230
book, the Luna brothers, I don't know if you
know them.

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:37.860
Really fantastic young brothers, they're 'Pino
and they write an under image comic.

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:42.260
They've written some wonderful books, "Girls"
"The Sword" and, again, I think its happening

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:43.810
but we have to look for it.

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:48.080
&gt;&gt;Rick Kleffel: Ladies and gentlemen, I'd
like to thank you for your time and for coming

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.100
here and joining us today.

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:53.700
Please welcome and say thank you to our guest.

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:54.839
[Applause]
