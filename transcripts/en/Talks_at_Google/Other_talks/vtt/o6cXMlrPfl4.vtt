[Indistinct pre-chatter]

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:11.170
Josh: Good evening! Good evening, ladies and
gentlemen, welcome to Google. This is the

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:18.070
second in our series of artist lectures at
Digital Arts Google. Thank you very much for

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:24.970
coming. This evening we're very pleased to
welcome Scott Draves, and Luke DuBois, both

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.820
of whom have pieces exhibited out in the lobby.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.870
I hope you got a chance to see them before
the talk, if you didn't, then in any case,

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:40.640
they'll be there after the talk as well.
Digital Art at Google is a new venture for

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:50.460
Google. Google's general mission is to organize
all the world's information and make it universally

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.129
accessible. Art is one way to organize information,
and therefore we feel that computational art

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.550
is a tool that Google should understand, and
eventually, should be using and helping people

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.550
to use, to present information to the world.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:12.750
I'm not going to talk anymore, both because
you didn't come here to hear me, and because

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.160
I have a terrible cold.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.920
Scott Draves has been doing computational
art for about 20 years. He's been displayed

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:28.630
at festivals and museums around the world.
A lot of his work are examples of massively

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:39.510
distributed computational art, including the
piece out in the lobby right here, and I won't

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:47.160
take up any of your time.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.160
Scott.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.160
SCOTT: Thanks, Josh.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.160
[applause]

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.660
So I'm just gonna switch over to my laptop
for a little presentation here, and what I'm

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:02.260
gonna do is tell you not just about this piece
of art, but about a couple of pieces, a couple

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.349
different things that I've done over the past
20 years, and to sort of give you an idea

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:19.330
of where this came from, and maybe hint at
where it's going. So, it all started back

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:26.250
in the seventies, when I first encountered
computers as a, as a child, and it was, it

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:33.220
was love at first sight, I was fascinated,
and started programming, started teaching

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.350
myself the programming, and started doing
computer graphics, started drawing pictures

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:47.850
by writing programs. And that developed through
college. I went to Brown University and was

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.670
in the so-called "Graphics Group" with Andy
Van Dam, and that was a really rich period

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.700
in history, Scott Snibbe, who's in the audience
somewhere? Where'd he go? There he is, in

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.760
the corner, was there, Brian Knep was there,
two other artists doing, programming computers

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.940
to do interesting art these days. That was
also a time when I really got into open-source

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:21.280
software. In particular I learned the emacs
editor, written by Richard Stallman himself,

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:29.590
and really got enamored of this philosophy
of sharing code and collaboratively in a distributed

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:39.291
fashion, sort of improving intellectual products.
And so then I went to Carnegie Mellon University

00:03:39.291 --> 00:03:47.440
to study Computer Science with people like
Andy Witkin and Peter Lee, and I was studying

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.630
programming languages, and something called
Meta-Programming, which are programs that

00:03:52.630 --> 00:04:01.441
write programs, or things like compilers,
and semantics, which are sort of the meanings

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:06.850
of languages, or the meaning of statements,
and artificial intelligence. And it was during

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:14.520
those years, from '90 to '97 I had a lot of,
a lot of rope. My advisors were very, were

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.549
very generous and supportive of my, of my
research and also my, my artistic pursuits,

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:28.930
and that was really when the ball got rolling.
And in, in particular, there was -- I had

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:39.190
an internship in Tokyo in 1991. That was where
I had access to a silicon graphics supercomputer

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.300
all, all to myself, for the whole summer,
and so for a long time I had been working

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.520
on these graphical algorithms, and I was always
constrained or limited by what I could do

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:58.419
with my, my regular PC that I had at home,
and suddenly with this supercomputer I was,

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.760
I was sort of freed from the constraints of
time. It was sort of like a window into the

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:11.840
future and I was able to really try to -- I
was free to find the, the real beauty inside

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.840
these equations, and inside the math.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:29.530
So, the first thing - oops. I was talking
too loud. (Pause) So the first project that

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:35.650
sort of came out of this process that I'm
gonna show you is called "Fuse", and I wrote

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:44.521
it out, in, in Japan, on that trip, and it's
quite different from work I have I have here

00:05:44.521 --> 00:05:49.040
in this show, because it's based on input,
input images, so it's not abstract. You actually

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:56.100
give it a photograph or, of a painting or
of a, of a scene, and what it does is, constructs

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:05.130
a mosaic out of that image, and it's a mosaic
where the tiles overlap. And what the algorithm

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:13.210
does is, is it does a search, and it searches
for the best tiles that, that sort of fit

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.639
together on the overlapped portion. So it's
a little bit like a puzzle, where the computer

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:27.720
solves the puzzle, and it's possible to have
a target image. And so, an example of what

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:33.770
this algorithm produced is here -- unfortunately
these projectors are really dark, I don't

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.919
know, you can barely see it on them. Can you,
can you turn the lights down? Does that help?

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:46.060
You can also, maybe you can see a little better
on the LCD screens. Behind you. Well maybe

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:51.560
if I just turn, does turning the brightness
up on this screen make any difference? I don't

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:59.750
think so. But basically this is, I took a
photograph of my face, and of, of my sort

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:07.050
of friend and coworker's face, and I fed those
two images into this algorithm, and it produced

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.840
this as the output.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:17.080
And you can see fragments of faces, but it's
all sort of scrambled, so locally it makes

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:25.660
sense, locally it looks like a flesh, but
globally [coughs], it doesn't make any sense.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:31.630
So here's another example, where I took several
pictures of my hand, in various configurations

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:44.699
and fed it into this algorithm, and it synthesized
this sort of "fleshopod" landscape, and those

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:53.110
are -- It's also possible, like I said, to
give this algorithm a target image. And so

00:07:53.110 --> 00:08:03.160
in this case, I gave it the same picture of,
of my head, my portrait of me as the target,

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:11.710
and I gave it just my [coughs] excuse me,
just my eye as the, as the input image. And

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:14.910
then so it, it made a picture of, of my whole
head out of just my eye. So this is the result.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:15.910
It's kind of creepy.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:25.490
And so again, these are images from the, from
the early early nineties and sorry, I'm really

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:32.169
dying, can - Josh, can you get me a glass
or bottle of water? I should have had said

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:33.169
that –

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:41.839
And so this - [sighs] was algorithm was published
as free software, open-source, on the web,

00:08:41.839 --> 00:08:48.629
a few years after I wrote it, after the web
started to, after I made a webpage. And then

00:08:48.629 --> 00:08:54.189
it, it was put as a plugin into the GIMP software,
which is the open-source Photoshop clone,

00:08:54.189 --> 00:09:03.709
and so it shipped onto millions of desktops
all over the world. And the technique actually

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:09.670
was then picked up by the sort of traditional
computer graphics research community.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:18.029
Thank you. And so this is now known as patch-based
texture synthesis, and there are hundreds

00:09:18.029 --> 00:09:26.160
of research papers and people working on it,
improving this and doing different things

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:35.420
with it. And you can go to draves.org/Fuse
to see a whole gallery of images.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:45.290
One thing that I actually did a lot of when
I first made this, was I used internet pornography

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:54.930
as the input images, so a little bit like
Mark Napier's Pamela Anderson. I took images

00:09:54.930 --> 00:10:00.929
of Internet women and sort of scrambled them,
and created abstract art out of them. I'm

00:10:00.929 --> 00:10:07.199
not gonna, I'm not gonna show those here,
but you can, you can find them on the, on

00:10:07.199 --> 00:10:13.269
the website.
So, that was, so here's another project I

00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:19.560
did, so that was "Fuse". This is "Flame".
"Flame" is an open-source visual language,

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:28.850
and it-- I put the date on it as sort of 1991,
but it's pretty hazy, that was, 'cause it

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:34.769
was based on a long series of experiments.
It had, it had several antecedents, and then,

00:10:34.769 --> 00:10:40.660
it's been under development since then, so
there, it doesn't really have an end date.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:48.959
But it's, the Flame algorithm produces images
that are organic and fluid. It's the basis

00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:55.420
for the electric sheep and the basis for the
artwork I have in the show here. It really

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.589
 -- what's really different about it, compared
to, you know -- there's a number of open-source

00:10:58.589 --> 00:11:04.689
graphics tool-kits that are available these
days. What's really different about the Flame

00:11:04.689 --> 00:11:09.929
 - and they're based on the metaphor of the
pen and the object, just like computer graphics

00:11:09.929 --> 00:11:17.309
has been since its inception, because it was
 -- computer graphics was based on, on drafting,

00:11:17.309 --> 00:11:22.290
engineering design, you know, which was, which
was done, with, with those objects, and so,

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:27.009
just like - with most new media, the first
thing they do is imitate the old media. Like

00:11:27.009 --> 00:11:34.149
when movie cameras appeared, the first thing
they did was point them at a, at a play, and

00:11:34.149 --> 00:11:35.309
then run the theatre, and just record it.

00:11:35.309 --> 00:11:40.019
But the Flame algorithm is really, operates
by a completely different principle. It's

00:11:40.019 --> 00:11:44.920
based on solving an equation with thousands
of parameters and millions of variables. It

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:55.649
takes a long time. And I've actually just
completed a documentary about it. So, this

00:11:55.649 --> 00:11:58.940
is just, it's a three-minute little video,
that I'm gonna play.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:11:59.940
[pause]

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:00.940
[Scraping sounds]

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:18.220
[Sounds of the volume being turned up]

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:34.679
FEMALE NARRATOR: In 1993, when the World Wide
Web was new, Scott Draves released the Flame

00:12:34.679 --> 00:12:39.339
algorithm as open-source. This was, quite
possibly, the earliest application of the

00:12:39.339 --> 00:12:45.010
GPL to Art. Since then, his code has been
copied, expanded, and is still thriving. Every

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:49.480
day, people all over the world create Flames,
with no intervention or permission from Draves.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.930
As an example, Flames have been used recently
in works by former Prix Ars Electronica prize

00:12:53.930 --> 00:13:01.480
winners. "Loka", a music video by Glenn Marshall,
released in 2008; "Strange Culture", a movie

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:07.129
about Steve Kurtz by Lynn Hershman Leeson,
released in 2007. In fact, one of the very

00:13:07.129 --> 00:13:12.439
earliest Flames, Flame Number 149, by Scott
Draves, won a Prix Ars Honorary Mention in

00:13:12.439 --> 00:13:18.949
1993. Now Flames are used by commercial artists
in Films, Books, TV and Advertising, as well

00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:20.459
as by thousands of hobbyists.

00:13:20.459 --> 00:13:27.730
Flame is not an end-user application. It is
an Algorithm and API, but a departure from

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:33.670
the usual Graphics APIs, which are based on
the metaphors of the pen geometry in 3D. Flame

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:37.720
images are formed by solving a recursive equation
with thousands of parameters and millions

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:43.670
of variables. The results are distinctive,
recognizable, and extremely diverse.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:49.019
How do designers make Flame images? At first,
they used Flame plugins, made by other programmers,

00:13:49.019 --> 00:13:54.100
for Photoshop and Adobe Aftereffects. Flame
is on millions of desktops world-wide, having

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:58.739
shipped standard with LINUX for years in the
GIMP. Eventually, more powerful standalone

00:13:58.739 --> 00:14:05.559
apps appeared, including Apotheosis in 2004,
Oxidizer for Mac in 2006, Cosmic for LINUX

00:14:05.559 --> 00:14:13.459
in 2008, Apple 3D in 2009 and the cross-platform
Frost in 2009. Following Flame's open-source

00:14:13.459 --> 00:14:17.709
GPL licensing, these applications are all
also GPL.

00:14:17.709 --> 00:14:24.059
The Electric Sheep is another important design
source. It's an easy-to-use open-source screensaver

00:14:24.059 --> 00:14:28.720
that animates Flame designs and creates new
Flames using a popularity-driven genetic algorithm.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:34.660
All are creative-commons licensed, for remix
and re-use. Designs frequently appear in do-it-yourself

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:35.660
music videos, and VJ performance.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:36.660
[piano music]

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:42.100
Making the decision to open-source one's art
is a philosophical statement in support of

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:47.649
creating a better society, one with more creativity,
that is more participatory, less prepackaged

00:14:47.649 --> 00:14:52.049
and broadcast; an artist who makes open-sourced
artwork [piano cuts out] actively relinquishes

00:14:52.049 --> 00:14:56.980
control, realizing that other may use it [soft
techno beats begin] for questionable ends.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:01.990
But the artistic rewards Draves has received
by sharing the code has been tremendous. It

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.369
has been vastly expanded by contributions
from all over the world, and totally rewritten

00:15:05.369 --> 00:15:06.369
in 2009.

00:15:06.369 --> 00:15:07.369
[Beats end]

00:15:07.369 --> 00:15:10.799
Flames have become their own genre, currently
ranking seventh in Google under the search

00:15:10.799 --> 00:15:15.839
term "Flames". Scott Draves has spawned an
immense, loosely-joined world-wide community

00:15:15.839 --> 00:15:19.749
of designers, programmers, and passionate
fans. [sweeping instrumental music eases in]

00:15:19.749 --> 00:15:24.639
The open-sourcing of the Flame algorithm and
how our culture has responded to it show how

00:15:24.639 --> 00:15:33.299
the free flow of information allows an artist
to exceed their own boundaries.

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:38.759
[music crescendos]

00:15:38.759 --> 00:15:41.489
[pause]

00:15:41.489 --> 00:16:03.019
SCOTT: So...[pause] So the Flame Algorithm
is the, the basis for the Electric Sheep and

00:16:03.019 --> 00:16:11.209
the basis for Generation 243, which is the,
the piece of artwork here in the shop. But

00:16:11.209 --> 00:16:18.149
 - and it's really, the Flame algorithm, it
takes hours to render even one single frame

00:16:18.149 --> 00:16:23.759
of, of video, and video, it plays back, when
you see it animated at thirty frames per second,

00:16:23.759 --> 00:16:31.379
so on a regualr computer, it's a day of work,
per second. And so, this kind of artwork is

00:16:31.379 --> 00:16:37.519
only possible with thousands of computers,
essentially the collective power of the Internet,

00:16:37.519 --> 00:16:47.359
all, all working together. And the, the process
 -- what I'm really interested in is, with

00:16:47.359 --> 00:16:53.220
something with open-source art, is not so
much making these specific images, but really

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:56.709
allowing other people to make their own images,
and enabling [member in the audience coughs]

00:16:56.709 --> 00:17:00.769
other people to make their own art, which
is kind of the, the participatory, it's the

00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:07.630
ultimate form of, of interaction. But I've
also done sort of more traditional interactive

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:18.970
art, and interactive art is, is really become
popular in the past, say, five years. But

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:31.630
it was [pause] the - The Bomb was an interactive
software artwork that I did in the mid-nineties

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:39.790
and it was an interactive visual musical instrument,
and what that, what I mean by that is, it

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:44.500
was something that you could play like a musical
instrument, like you would play the piano

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:49.530
or the drums or the trumpet, but instead of
making sound, it made, it made visuals. And

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:56.370
it used the, the keyboard, the mouse, and
audio input, and then it did generative video

00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:03.730
out, out, output. And it was based on a whole
bunch of techniques from complex systems theory,

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:11.332
in particular cellular automata and reaction
diffusion, computed in real-time. And it actually

00:18:11.332 --> 00:18:16.951
included versions of the Fuse algorithm and
the Flame algorithm, real-time versions of,

00:18:16.951 --> 00:18:17.951
of those as well.

00:18:17.951 --> 00:18:27.240
So it was just kind of a, it was a big toolbox
or a - which is like, which I used for VJ

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:33.890
performance. So you wanna take this to a show,
and it was taking audio input from the, from

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:39.040
the, from the DJ, or from the band, and then
I was using the Keyboard and the mouse to

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:46.120
sort, to riff off that and to create a video
show, which was projected behind the, behind

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:55.550
the band or behind the, the DJ. So, and that's
what got me into, into live performance, I

00:18:55.550 --> 00:19:00.920
think, back in the mid-nineties. So -- and
actually, later on, this, because this was

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:07.600
open-source, again I was able to sort of,
things happened to it that I wasn't able to

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:17.540
do myself. So in this case David Zicarelli,
who does the Max/MSP program, actually took

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:27.440
Bomb and ported it into Max/MSP so that it
was a module, inside of that interactive designing

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:33.820
environment, which has turned out to be really
popular and I guess Luke is actually involved

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:39.680
in, in developing that system now. So, so
anyways people were able to, other people

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:45.760
were able to perform with this and to create
their own music and so -- unfortunately this

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:50.340
software is really old and actually I've,
I've let it lapse. It doesn't, it doesn't

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:55.710
run on modern computers any more, but I have
a clip which I'll, which I'll play for you.

00:19:55.710 --> 00:20:01.640
And so this is a music video. It's sort of
like a, a canned VJ performance, and one that

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.550
I created using, yeah that Max/MSP System.

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:05.550
[pause]

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:19.940
So remember this is, so this was, and this
was done on a really, I think 486 laptop,

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:28.150
so it's really old PC that you would, you'd,
you could barely even boot up today. But it

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:35.130
was computed in real time; it recomputes every
pixel on every frame. So I'm just gonna, I'm

00:20:35.130 --> 00:21:04.940
gonna skip through a little bit here just
to give you an idea [Strong brass note] of

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:05.940
what this program can do. [symphonic sounds].

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:06.940
You can barely see it at all. These projectors
are just too dark, I'm sorry. [music continues...

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:07.940
cuts out abruptly] What it's, what it's doing
right now is, it's running a reaction diffusion

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:14.010
in real-time, and reaction-diffusion is the
algorithm that animals use to create their

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:18.050
spots, essentially, like leopard spots and
tiger stripes and stuff like that. So that

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:26.290
what you're sort of seeing is like an animal
texture, an animal skin which is reconfiguring

00:21:26.290 --> 00:22:16.950
itself in, in real time. [music comes back
on. more flowing, dissonant] [fading][builds]

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:48.120
[violent cymbal crash] [swift percussive line][jarring
sounds][piano crashing]

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:55.650
Ok, so that's just, that's just a taste of
that one. So, and then I got, I got tired,

00:22:55.650 --> 00:23:04.810
so that when I was doing, when the, when the,
when Bomb runs, it has to generate the graphics

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:10.650
in real-time, which means thirty times per
second. You only get thirty, like thirty milliseconds

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:16.760
to create your, your, your image, which is
a big constraint. And so I got, I got sort

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:21.950
of tired of that and I wanted to do something
which was really high-quality, so I went back

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:27.080
to the Flame algorithm, and this was, oh,
I was living in the San Francisco, and the,

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:32.940
you know the Dotcom explosion was happening,
this was 1999, and so I did the Internet-distributed

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:36.581
version of the Flame algorithm, which was
the Electric Sheep.

00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:39.860
[pause]

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:50.370
Ugh. So, in the Electric Sleep the screensavers
form a distributed supercomputer. So when

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:56.590
you're not using your computer, it goes to
work creating art, and the, the audience votes,

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:59.860
everybody who's watching that screensaver
can vote on whether or not they like what

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:04.760
they see and that runs a genetic algorithm
so the, the artwork is evolving, like with

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:12.230
Darwinian evolution, so it's this artificial
intelligence which is trying to satisfy human

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:19.550
desire, and there's also crowd-source in the
genetic designers, so that people are uploading

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:28.900
completed designs into it, and the human design
team collaborates and competes with this AI.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:34.860
And so this project has been running online
for about ten years now, and so it's one of

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:42.030
the first, sort of crowd-source or collaborative
Internet artworks and it's still, still going

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:52.730
strong, still gaining speed. Right now we
have about 350,000 users monthly uniques.

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:59.940
And here, I'll, I'll show you, you can see
what it looks, like, 'cause it's my screensaver.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:06.250
And, it's, it looks, it's in the same basic
style as Generation 243, but there's a couple

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:14.720
of differences. One is that this is really
unedited, so there's, because it's on the

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.970
Internet and it's responding to the voting
public, you know, that means, it, also it's

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:25.790
like, just like democracy. It appeals to the
lowest common denominator [laughter].

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:28.770
And so I call it the Las Vegas problem, which
is that things that are like bright and flashy

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:36.730
get a lot of votes and reproduce, and then,
so you end up with a lot of, a lot of stuff

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:42.110
like that, which is not what I think is really
truly beautiful. So the other problem with

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:48.610
it is, while it's great to have 350,000 people
sort of helping you create your art, it really,

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:55.450
it, it, it sucks to have that many people
downloading videos from your website. Your

00:25:55.450 --> 00:26:01.400
server, the server bills are really out-of-control.
So, I wanted to - plus, it's low-resolution.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:08.650
I wanted to increase the quality. So essentially,
in order to solve these problems, I started

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:14.490
to create limited-edition artworks, instead
of stuff that was just software artwork that's

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:19.650
free online. And that's where the Dreams in
High Fidelity series came from, and that's

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:25.450
where Generation 243 came from, the piece
here. And so that was sort of going from the

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:35.780
Internet sort of to the, to the museum and
to the gallery. And the difference, the sort

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:43.420
of, the things that differentiate it is for
one, one thing, in order to make Generation

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:48.610
243, what I do is I go through the thousands
of things that the screensaver does, and it's

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:53.510
it's, it has hundreds of thousands of sheep
have been produced, and I pick out a few of

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:59.310
them that satisfy my aesthetic, that I think
are truly beautiful, and edit them and assemble

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:06.220
them, redo them in high definition, in high
quality, and high bandwidth, sort of beyond

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:12.530
the quality that you can do video over the
Internet, and then turn it into a limited

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:18.150
edition piece of art, so, something which
is collectible, and, and maintainable, and

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:25.140
has a permanence. So, the one we have here
was commissioned by Carnegie Mellon University,

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:30.550
and sits in the lobby of their new Computer
Science building, so... and there's, and there's

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:38.130
more, more on the way. But I think I'm out
of time. Maybe we have time for just a question

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:40.630
or two?

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:53.130
JOSH: Thank you, Scott. [Applause] Does anyone
have any questions?

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:58.130
[unmic'd question from audience]

00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:15.430
SCOTT: You mean how much do I play with pre-existing
algorithms in general? Or how much is that

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:18.520
piece, or is that stuff based on pre-existing
ones.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.630
[unmic'd indistinct followup]

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:31.180
SCOTT: Well the stuff that I have done are,
they're inspired by natural algorithms, for

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:38.490
example the reaction-diffusion stuff and in
general my art, it tends to cross the line

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:43.750
from digital into organic, and sort of take
things from, that have natural beauty and,

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:53.440
and recreate their essence in software form.
But that's done, it's never done by literally

00:28:53.440 --> 00:29:01.240
copying or reproducing the algorithms from
nature. It's, which tends to be really hard.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:10.110
So instead what I do is I, I find something
that, that, that has the same effect or captures

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:17.730
the essence of, say, leopard spots, even though
the actual equation or the actual algorithm

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:25.080
is, is not derived from studying a leopard,
for example. It's, it's just, but it does

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.240
have the same, the same overall properties.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:36.880
AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: One of the things that,
that's interesting to me about this business

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:47.470
of getting from the Vegas effect and then
you know, sort of going back -

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:49.220
SCOTT: Yeah.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:58.420
AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: From the point of a view
of a mathematician or a programmer, the elegant

00:29:58.420 --> 00:29:59.981
solution is the simplest piece of code that'll
get you the most complicated phenomena and

00:29:59.981 --> 00:30:01.080
at the point at which you're, you're pulling
back from the experience of what's on the

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.080
screen, do you start to bump into that ambition?

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:06.309
SCOTT: Well, I, I still have the ambition
of producing as much variety, as much quality

00:30:06.309 --> 00:30:10.760
as I can with as little code as I can. And
that's definitely sort of part of, part of

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:20.550
my aesthetic is synergy, or getting out more
than you put in. But yeah, definitely, just

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:28.910
maximizing complexity, you end up with randomness,
essentially. And so I found that, you, you

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:35.550
have, definitely have to turn it back, and
that's done you know, just manually, by my,

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:41.590
by my own hand. I haven't found an algorithm
which can encapsulate what I think is beautiful,

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:47.680
and I'm not really -- I'm kind of curious
about it, but I'm not really, that's not really

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:52.000
my mission, so I mean, I, I enjoy making those
decisions, I'm not motivated to automate that

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:58.179
aspect of the art, of the process.

00:30:58.179 --> 00:31:09.950
MIC'D AUDIENCE MEMBER 2: If you were disappointed
in the Vegas, what were you, what were you

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:11.140
hoping might come out of such a collective
endeavour?

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:12.370
SCOTT: Well, I, I wasn't disappointed, I mean
it's just a fact of life, it's like, you can't

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:19.910
get angry at gravity. So - but, but it does
produce a lot of great stuff, and the things

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:24.600
that, and it does produce things that I think
are truly beautiful. The, the, what - they're

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:31.150
not necessarily, are, are usually not the
ones that were the, the winners of the popularity

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:38.730
contest? But they are part of the ecosystem,
which is run by the popularity contest. And

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:42.350
so - and I think that's not too different
from our world.

00:31:42.350 --> 00:32:04.820
MIC'D AUDIENCE MEMBER 2: If I may, if you
look up the definition of beauty in the dictionary,

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:05.820
which I had to do a few months ago, you'll
find it says, "That which reveals to the mind."

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:06.820
SCOTT: Hmm.

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:07.820
MIC'D AUDIENCE MEMBER 2: What is missing in
that definition? I mean you use the word...

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:08.820
SCOTT: Well, I mean, it's more than just the
mind, I mean, to me, beauty has a visual aspect

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:14.240
to it? Or a, or a sort of an aesthetic aspect,
which is from some separate from, [loud audience

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.540
cough] from, from practical [loud cough again]
practical or utilitarian purpose, so there's

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:27.241
a lot of things that appeal to me for practical
reasons that I don't necessarily think are

00:32:27.241 --> 00:32:28.241
beautiful.

00:32:28.241 --> 00:32:29.241
JOSH: Let's move on.

00:32:29.241 --> 00:32:30.241
SCOTT: Ok. We have...

00:32:30.241 --> 00:32:32.160
JOSH: Scott will be, will be around when the,
when we're done with our session's second

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:41.470
presentation. So, feel free to approach him
with questions. Thank you very much.

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:43.950
[Loud audience applause]

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:54.200
JOSH: Our second speaker this evening is Luke
DuBois. Luke is a composer, a musician, a

00:32:54.200 --> 00:33:02.010
performer, artist, multi-instrumentalist,
all-around nice guy. He is also a fairly serious

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:05.380
computer scientist in his own right, and he
is represented in our -

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:09.101
LUKE: I would dispute that.

00:33:09.101 --> 00:33:10.570
[audience laughter]

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:12.040
JOSH: Hacker?

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:17.910
LUKE: No, no, no. Definitely not a hacker.

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:19.380
JOSH: OK.

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:22.660
LUKE: More like a comic hacker.

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:28.850
JOSH: Those are the best ones. He's represented
in the, in our exhibit, by his work [audience

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:32.850
member coughs] "Hindsight Is Always 20/20",
which is a fascinating visualization of presidential

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:42.460
inaugural speeches, that let's you, that captures
a moment of history in a very interesting

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:45.030
way. And... thank you.

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:51.960
LUKE: Alright. Thanks, Josh. So, I'm gonna
give you the whirlwind tour of my life, in

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:58.270
30 minutes, including some older work and
a couple things that I'm working on now that

00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:04.330
I haven't quite figured out what they're gonna
look like or what they're gonna be. But, and

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:09.030
I'm gonna focus on, like Josh said, I do,
I do a lot of things, and I'm gonna focus

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:16.809
on, mostly on, I guess you, what you would
call my visual art, stuff that I do that has

00:34:16.809 --> 00:34:24.230
some sort of visual output. It's meant for
viewing outside of the context of performance.

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:33.240
But to give you a little bit of background.
I started out as a, well, as a musician, and

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:40.149
actually, before I even started out as a musician,
I started out as an engineer, at Columbia

00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:42.019
University. And I basically flunked out of
engineering school because I was too busy

00:34:42.019 --> 00:34:48.849
being a musician. And I was working at a place
called the Computer Music Center up at Columbia,

00:34:48.849 --> 00:34:55.569
where I was restoring and performing music
on all these old analog synthesizers from

00:34:55.569 --> 00:34:58.269
the '60s and '70s. They looked like phone
switchboards. And I put a band together in

00:34:58.269 --> 00:35:01.770
the nineties called the Freight Elevator Quartet.
This is us at the kitchen in 1999, and there

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:11.270
were four of us, we had a cellist, and a didjeridu
player and a guy with a bunch of drum machines,

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:15.549
and I used to play these old synthesizers.
And as you can see, if you sort of focus on

00:35:15.549 --> 00:35:21.069
this bit of the image, and ignore everything
else, we're really boring to watch. This is

00:35:21.069 --> 00:35:26.780
the conclusion that we drew, after, after
much consideration. And that was because,

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:34.200
well there was, for a few reasons, but I,
I would argue a big chunk of, of what made

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:41.700
us not that interesting to watch was that
we were engrossed in a lot of fairly obtuse

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:48.170
technology onstage that didn't really have
a lot of, I guess, sort of, what people who're

00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:52.220
smarter than me call "performative agency".
That's just a fancy way of saying, when I

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:59.070
do something onstage, you can't tell what
I'm doing, and how it affects whatever you're

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:00.070
experiencing.

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:05.170
And so, so the, the, the easiest way to do
this is to compare for example the cellist

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:11.950
and myself. That's me with a laptop computer.
You know, when a cellist plays a note, you

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:14.960
kind of know what's happening. Alright. You
can kind of expect there's a, there's a physical

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:20.840
motion with an acoustic effect, whereas me,
I could, I could be checking my email. [audience

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:25.470
giggles] I wasn't I don't think, but, but
I've done that before, absolutely, [more audience

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:29.800
response] checked my email onstage, and, and
you know, anybody who performs onstage with

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:34.170
a laptop and they say they've never done that,
they're lying! [Audience laughs] Right? So

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:39.680
that's just the way it is. And that's okay.
But, but a lot of what this early stuff I

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:43.740
was doing was, was trying to grapple with
a couple problems. One was the idea of having

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:49.250
a computer onstage. And it's not that a computer
is technology. So this is actually an important

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:56.200
sort of thread in some of the ideas that I
have spinning around in my head at all times.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:01.489
It's not that this is the first use of technology
onstage. Music is technology, unless you are

00:37:01.489 --> 00:37:07.720
singing unamplified in a forest, and the music
you're singing is something you made up in

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:12.380
your head that morning, you're using technology,
right? If you're singing something that was

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:16.390
ever notated, you're using literacy. If you're
singing in a space, you're using architecture.

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:21.960
If you're playing an instrument, that's technology.
If it's amplified, that's definitely technology.

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:26.900
Right, if it's amplified, and produced on
a record that someone plays later, that's

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:32.079
definitely technology, right? So this is just
one more step in the equation, and to say

00:37:32.079 --> 00:37:36.720
that this is substantively different is actually
to a certain degree a moral panic. Right,

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:42.950
it's sort of, actually, it's not, right? And
when we talk about information art, which

00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:50.000
 -- I'll show you a few things while I'm showing
things on the computer -- that's another kind

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.980
of thing that is interesting that I did, information
art, sort of might have a startpoint sometime

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:58.300
in the 1970s, when I would argue that, you
know, we've had information art for millions

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:04.910
and millions of years -- we just call it music.
Music is the sonification of data, for all

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:11.130
intents and purposes. It's a bunch of constructions,
being laid out in time, and effected or evoked

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:12.130
in a performance.

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:16.069
So, so I was trying to figure out how to make
this look more fun [laughs] --back to the

00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:23.289
point. And I started performing and writing
a lot of music that involved imagery. And

00:38:23.289 --> 00:38:25.420
so this is an early example [strumming audio
starts] This is a piece from 2003. This is

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:27.030
a piece for guitar, it should be obvious at
this point that I do not have quite the sophisticated

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:28.599
visual sensibility of Scott. This is called
Turtle Graphics, I don't know if you guys

00:38:28.599 --> 00:38:30.920
remember this. This is for a guitarist, guy
named Dominic Frasca, and the different notes

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:39.869
on the computer, the different notes that
he plays are, are telling the computer to

00:38:39.869 --> 00:38:50.369
do different drawing actions, drop forward,
turn left, turn right, and if he plays it

00:38:50.369 --> 00:38:55.109
perfectly... [silence] he gets a plant. [Audience
response] [music resumes] And if he screws

00:38:55.109 --> 00:39:03.650
up, he gets a different plant. It's called
a mutation. It's how we got here. It's not

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:17.789
a big deal. And so you can hear there's a
sort of a riff that... a very riff – [hums

00:39:17.789 --> 00:39:19.420
along with guitar music]. There's a melody.
That melody is the graphical primitive of

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:20.420
this plant. OK, see, instructions say, it's
drawing a little branch and going back and

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:29.920
forth over the original path, happens like
8,000 times. [music ends] And the whole idea

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:37.579
of this was that I was trying to deal with
the issue of sort of, music and modern music,

00:39:37.579 --> 00:39:42.950
and in particularly modern music that has
an algorithmic basis to it, which is increasingly

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:47.779
common, where instead of sitting at the piano
and writing things that sound beautiful, you

00:39:47.779 --> 00:39:52.970
actually can see part of the compositional
process doing algorithmic piece of math. Right,

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:58.730
and how do you make that transparent to the
audience? How do you make the system at play

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:01.460
actually make sense to someone who's listening
to it, so it doesn't just sound like noise?

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:10.819
Well one idea is to use systems that have
a linguistic apparatus to it, which is what

00:40:10.819 --> 00:40:13.410
these algorithms -- they're called Lindenmayer
systems – sort of do. They can be broken

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:18.269
down into hierarchies, the structure, which
is how language works, and is how we listen

00:40:18.269 --> 00:40:22.960
to music. And so I started thinking about
that, and I started thinking about that is

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:33.890
a useful and kind of fun way to grapple with
making sense of information, which is to transcode

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:42.700
it, stick it in a medium you don't usually
experience it. Just to give you a couple [audience

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:48.950
coughs] quickie examples from the repetoire,
this is another performance algorithm that

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:51.510
I use once in a while. And of course, it's
not working. Hello? Oh, there it is! Oh, it

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:55.859
is working. This is a, these guys are listening
to me, right? Bleh! [audience titters] Right?

00:40:55.859 --> 00:41:01.549
They're they're, listening to me, and they're
visualizing my voice. And this is something

00:41:01.549 --> 00:41:05.849
that I traditionally would do with a, in a
performance situation, with a friend of mine,

00:41:05.849 --> 00:41:12.160
a guy named Todd Reynolds, who's a really
amazing incredible violinist. And the conceit

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:15.890
of it is, you have these four birds flocking
around, and what they're trying desperately

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:24.799
to do is detect my rhythm, and stand there
in canon based on the rhythms of my - I'm

00:41:24.799 --> 00:41:27.515
just talking to you, so it's not quite working.
But it gives you an idea of - the idea that

00:41:27.515 --> 00:41:32.369
you can, you can visualize a sound, in a,
in a, in an interesting and kind of kinetic

00:41:32.369 --> 00:41:37.400
way. You can also go the other way. And so
this is... just to to give you this little

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:44.470
example of this, I'm gonna... while I was
working on all this music, I helped to write

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:48.829
a totally wacky programming language called
Jitter, which is what this is. I'm gonna talk

00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:54.519
into my computer for a second.
"My dog has fleas! Testing 1, 2, 3..." Ok,

00:41:54.519 --> 00:41:58.710
let's see what that looks like that. Mmmm
that should...

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:02.549
"Testing 1, 2, 3" There you go! So this is
a, this is a sonic match -

00:42:02.549 --> 00:42:07.200
"My dog has fleas! Testing 1, 2, 3..."
Can you all see that? This is like a pretty

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:13.020
standard way to turn a sound into a picture?
Right? The red line's time, and the left to

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:17.660
right is the frequencies, and the height is
sort of how loud a frequency is at that point

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:20.759
in time? That make sense to you guys? Alright.
It's a pretty normal way to -

00:42:20.759 --> 00:42:24.940
"My dog has fleas! Testing 1, 2, 3..."
So the dirty little secret here though is,

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:28.640
the sound you're hearing -
"My dog has fleas! Testing 1, 2, 3..."

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:32.309
is being scanned off the image. It didn't
actually record my sound, it just turned it

00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:35.940
into a picture. And now it's playing back
the picture. And so you can do these things

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:39.390
that you're not supposed to be able to do
with sound. For example, there is absolutely

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:49.289
no reason why the red line has to move.
"My dog ha-" [words turn to ambient sound]

00:42:49.289 --> 00:43:01.640
[indistinct words, and then the words slowly
resume out of the ambient sound]or to make

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:22.609
it run kinda slow - or backwards [the words
begin to play in reverse] or make it run really

00:43:22.609 --> 00:43:30.359
fast [the audio becomes a high looping rhythm],
right? But like really, really fast. [high

00:43:30.359 --> 00:43:33.530
rhythm simply becomes an even high tone].
Turn it into an oscillator.

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:44.749
You can do that, or you can say, you know
what? It's a picture. What the hell, I just

00:43:44.749 --> 00:43:54.849
blur it.
And then... [tone acquires a lower, wavelike

00:43:54.849 --> 00:44:12.690
pattern] then when you turn that back to normal
speed - [echo-y, wandering pitch to his original

00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:28.269
words] You blur pictures all the time. Why
don't you blur sound? That's what you get.

00:44:28.269 --> 00:44:39.869
So I started thinking that was pretty cool.
The idea that one of the neat tricks about

00:44:39.869 --> 00:44:46.069
turning a sound into an image, is that you
could essentially divorce it from time. And

00:44:46.069 --> 00:45:05.089
so I started thinking to myself, well what
kind of things would, would I wanna do with

00:45:05.089 --> 00:45:25.910
that,
the idea that the red line can move at any

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:55.690
speed, and also that you can blur things.
You can basically create sort of, almost sort

00:45:55.690 --> 00:46:10.489
of long-exposure photographs of sound, and,
and I got into this whole riff on this technique

00:46:10.489 --> 00:46:21.830
which I started calling Time-Lapse Phonography.
And I started thinking of like, things to

00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:29.630
put through it, so here's all the billboard
#1 songs. Sped up to 1 sec for every week

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:39.250
they're at #1. And so you got um [resonant
jarring sounds] and in [low, frequent hum]

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:46.690
37 minutes the entire history of the pop chart
done as a sequence of drums. [Rhythm and frequency

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:55.260
rises and falls] Right? And some of these
drums are interesting, right? Like, there're

00:46:55.260 --> 00:47:03.349
some things about the drums are interesting,
right, so that like all of 1978's in the key

00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:09.700
of F. And... [low hum] Beegees songs... Alright
[sound ends] and if you listen to the, and

00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:17.229
if you listen to this stuff, right, you have,
you discover pretty quickly that you have

00:47:17.229 --> 00:47:23.890
part of this memorized, right? If you grew
up listening to pop music, [music rises from

00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:30.979
inaudible again] you see it sort of going
by and you're like, "Oh my God, I remember

00:47:30.979 --> 00:47:38.270
that song," or "Oh I hated that song" or,
"I lost my virginity right there," or you

00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:42.289
know you have the whole thing like in your
brain, right? And I started thinking about

00:47:42.289 --> 00:47:43.650
it as, as, as a aspect of our culture, and
me... I'm kind of obsessed with lists. The

00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:53.239
idea of top lists, or #1 lists, so I started
making a bunch of pieces around it. So, along

00:47:53.239 --> 00:47:59.809
with Billboard I did this. This is every Academy
Award Best Picture sped up to one minute.

00:47:59.809 --> 00:48:07.180
Right, so this is 76 movies in 76 minutes.
This is "Wings". Let me find you something

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:11.450
you all might recognize. That was "Gone With
the Wind". That was "Casablanca". "Casablanca".

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:15.759
Right? "Casablanca". The entire movie's in
there. It's an average, ok. It's skipping

00:48:15.759 --> 00:48:22.849
through the film alright, [sound swells] so
it's a weighted average. Musical [sound ends]

00:48:22.849 --> 00:48:32.369
quite beautiful, actually. Let's see if I
can find a good music --, like "West Side

00:48:32.369 --> 00:48:46.819
Story" or something. Aw, you guys get the
idea, but um - I'm too late now. Gotta go

00:48:46.819 --> 00:48:50.229
back a little. Yeah.

00:48:50.229 --> 00:48:56.880
So the entire [ sound rises and swells.] There
we go. So you've got entire films in a minute...

00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:04.869
no matter how long. You have to write them
down [sound swells].[abrupt ending]

00:49:04.869 --> 00:49:12.400
I made a piece, where I took all the Playboy
Playmates of the Month, and centered their

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:22.940
eyes. So this is fifty years of Playboy in
fifty seconds, alright so this is time-lapse

00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:26.300
pornography [audience laughs]. Right.

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:37.569
And so I started thinking to myself, well
you know what, like, we got these lists, and

00:49:37.569 --> 00:49:46.339
they're important to us, but we don't necessarily
think about like how they got to be those

00:49:46.339 --> 00:49:54.020
lists, right? You know, it's, it's, it's,
it's a little bit like trying to actually

00:49:54.020 --> 00:50:07.630
debug how a search engine might work. Like
how did, how did #1 songs become #1 songs?

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:20.829
But to have a #1 song you need a collusion
of several major multinational corporations,

00:50:20.829 --> 00:50:36.599
right? To get a, to get a, Academy Award Best
Picture, the people who vote for the Academy

00:50:36.599 --> 00:50:42.499
Awards are the people who are themselves eligible
to win at the Academy Awards, right? We did

00:50:42.499 --> 00:50:54.839
not vote for "West Side Story", right? It's
a peer review. That's why they thank the Academy,

00:50:54.839 --> 00:51:05.819
right? And don't even get me started on Playboy.
But you get the idea, [audience chuckles]

00:51:05.819 --> 00:51:21.309
right? We did not select these things, right?
We live in a democratic society in which the

00:51:21.309 --> 00:51:25.900
most valuable cultural objects in our society
were not democractically selected. Alright,

00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:32.829
so maybe that's kind of interesting.
So, I started thinking about that, and I started

00:51:32.829 --> 00:51:39.950
thinking about other kinds of data sets that
you could subject to that kind of analysis.

00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:58.119
And I'll, and I'll show you just briefly,
the piece that's on the wall, around the corner,

00:51:58.119 --> 00:52:14.210
I was, I was commissioned by the, the Democratic
National Convention to make a piece in 2008,

00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:39.989
and, and I made a piece called "Hindsight
Is 20/20". And, and I knew, I knew I was gonna

00:52:39.989 --> 00:52:49.710
make a thing about presidential something,
presidential speeches, presidential rhetoric,

00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:57.349
something like that. And I, I started out,
thinking I was gonna do something kinda like

00:52:57.349 --> 00:53:03.099
a billboard pop chart, like, hundred most
common phrases or something like that, you

00:53:03.099 --> 00:53:09.030
know, so like, you know, George Washington,
you know, the state of the union is sound

00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:15.819
or whatever. And then I saw James Carville
on CNN, and he was on some rant. He was talking

00:53:15.819 --> 00:53:23.220
about vision, and he's saying, "Well the - " he
was talking about the Bush adminisitration,

00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:31.380
this was back in like 2006 – he's saying,
"Well the problem is they don't have vision..."

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:36.400
And I started thinking to myself, you know,
how do you judge your leaders? You judge your

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:41.039
leaders based on their vision. So how do you
test their vision? You make eye-charts. So

00:53:41.039 --> 00:53:51.009
I started to make a bunch of eye-charts, one
for every President of the United Statess.

00:53:51.009 --> 00:53:58.349
These are the words that their State of the
Union addresses most common / least common

00:53:58.349 --> 00:54:03.499
words. So George Washington, his most common
word is "gentlemen". George Bush is "Terror".

00:54:03.499 --> 00:54:09.170
Some of these you can guess, right? Ronald
Reagan is "deficits". Richard Nixon interestingly

00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:15.029
is "Truly". Some of these you can probably
figure out. Like Abraham Lincoln is "Emancipation",

00:54:15.029 --> 00:54:20.109
right, something like, FDR, FDR is "Democratic",
right, Herbert Hoover is "Unemployment", and

00:54:20.109 --> 00:54:24.760
Calvin Coolidge: this is how you get veterans,
and this is the last time New Orleans exploded,

00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:28.900
right?
And so what do you do with this? Well, what

00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:34.789
you do is you make yourself 43 two-scale massive
light boxes that actually work as eye-charts.

00:54:34.789 --> 00:54:43.779
If you stand 20 feet back and you can read
between those lines you have 20/20 vision.

00:54:43.779 --> 00:54:49.479
You install them outside the Pepsi Center
in Denver, Colorado, during the Democratic

00:54:49.479 --> 00:54:56.359
National Convention. Lots of people walk by,
it's very fun. And you, and you also make

00:54:56.359 --> 00:55:03.049
some prints. These're prints that, you know,
we made that, were shown at the Weisman Art

00:55:03.049 --> 00:55:06.160
Museum in Minneapolis during the Republican
Convention.

00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:10.829
And they then sort of trail around, and I
thought this was actually kind of interesting.

00:55:10.829 --> 00:55:16.269
This is the National Constitution Center in
Philadelphia. This was where this was during

00:55:16.269 --> 00:55:21.779
the actual election in 2008. And what's, what's
interesting about them is, you get this really

00:55:21.779 --> 00:55:26.219
interesting insight into Presidential rhetoric
of any given time period. And the idea behind

00:55:26.219 --> 00:55:33.359
the piece was that the State of the Union
address is a piece of political theater. It's

00:55:33.359 --> 00:55:38.039
a Constitutionally-mandated piece of political
theater. It's actually required by law, right?

00:55:38.039 --> 00:55:43.789
A President has to come, do his homework.
And what it is is it's about a sovereignty

00:55:43.789 --> 00:55:47.059
relationship It's about how Congress is sovereign
over President. The President has to report

00:55:47.059 --> 00:55:50.089
to Congress, not the other way around. The
King cannot dissolve Parliament -- Parliament

00:55:50.089 --> 00:55:52.999
can impeach the King. Right? So that's an
important power relationship that's embodied

00:55:52.999 --> 00:56:00.900
in this, actually in this event and at the
time I was working on this, we were living

00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:09.190
in what will arguably in hindsight, we felt
was an Imperial Presidency. So I wanted to

00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:13.869
do a big piece on how Nancy Pelosi was really
George Bush's boss, [deep sniff] and how we

00:56:13.869 --> 00:56:18.440
had forgotten about that.
At the same time, so let me just show you

00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:24.700
a few other little bits and pieces, at the
same time I was wrapping up, at the same time

00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:51.069
I was doing pre-production on Hindsight, I
was wrapping up a film project that was a

00:56:51.069 --> 00:56:55.989
collaboration with my dear friend [sound rises]
Lian Amaris Sifuentes, who's a performance

00:56:55.989 --> 00:57:00.539
artist, and it's, it's a kooky collaboration,
it's a three-day-long performance, scripted,

00:57:00.539 --> 00:57:04.849
directed, and executed by Lian but then I
film? Sort of document it, panoptically, like

00:57:04.849 --> 00:57:09.440
on a, in as ridiculously obsessed way as humanly
possible. Got all these hard drives, and then

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:15.039
I, and then I took the film and accelerated
it. So it's a 72-hour performance, set on

00:57:15.039 --> 00:57:24.250
a, on a, on a traffic island off the coast
of Union Square, as we set up a boudoir, and

00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:32.740
she spends three whole days out there getting
ready for a night out on the town, doing all

00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:48.359
the things that one would do in such a situation.
And then I speed the whole thing up to 60-speed

00:57:48.359 --> 00:57:56.920
so in experiencing the film, you get a very
different sense of the performance. So it's

00:57:56.920 --> 00:58:00.729
not a documented performance, it's sort of
more of a reaction piece to the performance,

00:58:00.729 --> 00:58:06.519
where it's sort of, in a weird way, it looks
like she's moving normally and everything

00:58:06.519 --> 00:58:14.270
else is flying by. And they scored it to a
violin concerto, in seven movements, that

00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:21.529
are all about different types and stages of
obsessive love, time and relationships, and,

00:58:21.529 --> 00:58:28.390
and it's funny, like I don't really think
about what I do is, is, is information art,

00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:35.339
per se, but this is, this is maybe a different
spin on it. So instead of looking at lists

00:58:35.339 --> 00:58:40.829
of things and doing a bunch of math, you can
also be a lot more lyrical with it and just

00:58:40.829 --> 00:58:49.759
say, "I wanna do a thing on the subject of
how you look at someone, when you love them,

00:58:49.759 --> 00:58:55.239
and how that works, and what there's, what
that shop list might be, and what those different

00:58:55.239 --> 00:59:06.369
phases are." And then you can just sort of
construct something out of it. So a couple

00:59:06.369 --> 00:59:16.680
things that I've got kicking around on my
computer these days. Let me just show you

00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:27.890
one last thing. I'm workin' on kind of a monster
of a piece. It's also about love, sort of.

00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:38.200
I decided to make my own census, the census
year, it's 2008. I decided to make my own

00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:45.900
census, so what I do is I joined 21 different
online dating sites [audience reacts with

00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:54.989
amusement] as a straight man, a gay man, a
straight woman, and a gay woman, and downloaded

00:59:54.989 --> 01:00:04.630
everybody, so I downloaded 16.7 million Americans
to a hard drive. And sorted them by congressional

01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:16.650
district. [audience laughs] So
I can tell you how many people in your district

01:00:16.650 --> 01:00:23.119
are shy, and how many people are looking for
someone who's fun. Here, I'll, I'll show you

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:29.170
[loud audience laughter] So, for example...
there ya go! Here we go, here's some math.

01:00:29.170 --> 01:00:36.039
Here are all the people, here are all the
shy people in the United States. If you're

01:00:36.039 --> 01:00:42.269
purple, it means you're more shy; if you're
green, that means you're less shy. So red

01:00:42.269 --> 01:00:50.109
is shy women, blue is shy men, ok? Here are
all the lonely people. White means a lonelier

01:00:50.109 --> 01:01:00.780
district, right? Here's where people say they're
sexy. [audience laughs] You know, so sexy

01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:15.089
really only shows up a few places. It's actually,
it's actually pretty interesting. It sort

01:01:15.089 --> 01:01:33.650
of shows up
on the coast. Oh and here's where people say

01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:39.069
they're funny, men versus women. So if you're,
if you're-- the white areas are the least

01:01:39.069 --> 01:01:45.400
funny parts of America. [audience laughs]
God. Right there, the least funny part of

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:50.819
America. Right there.
So I'm preparing a whole bunch of maps, and

01:01:50.819 --> 01:01:59.469
I'm preparing a census document, that I think
actually is vital to our national security,

01:01:59.469 --> 01:02:13.839
because what it, what it, what it allows you
to do is it allows you to prepare maps and

01:02:13.839 --> 01:02:19.319
other documents. So this is sort of thing
of -- here are all the single people in New

01:02:19.319 --> 01:02:26.279
York, with their eyes centered. But it, it
allows you to prepare a pretty substantive

01:02:26.279 --> 01:02:37.019
case for critiquing or debunking the censuses
that exist now as a snapshot of, of, of us,

01:02:37.019 --> 01:02:47.269
as Americans, right? Saying that what we should
really be paying attention to is media and

01:02:47.269 --> 01:02:52.970
household income, and how many of us are in
manufacturing sector jobs, and how many of

01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:57.910
us are in service industry jobs, and how many
of us have changed jobs. So, so we do this,

01:02:57.910 --> 01:03:02.480
and we make these chloraprep maps so it's
kind of white to black maps about that stuff.

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:13.559
And you know, they have meetings on it, they,
and then, policy is actually affected on this.

01:03:13.559 --> 01:03:20.660
So what if instead of that, what if instead
of that we did, we did red state, blue state

01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:29.539
maps, based on type A, type B personality,
right? Or, what would happen if, if I told

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:41.140
you that, rather than median household income,
we just sort of looked instead at, you know,

01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:48.659
how many people are lonely at night? And where
those people are, right? Or if we looked at

01:03:48.659 --> 01:03:54.380
 -- just to make it a little bit more funny,
like I joined, I joined 21 sites, I joined

01:03:54.380 --> 01:04:20.380
a lot of alternative-lifestyle sites, so I
can tell you for a fact that men in the Eastern

01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:34.519
half of Long Island are way more interested
in being spanked than men in the Western half

01:04:34.519 --> 01:04:42.479
of Long Island. [Audience laughs] Alright?
And I think, I think Congress needs to know

01:04:42.479 --> 01:04:50.970
this information, I think this is important,
this is important stuff. So, so this is, you

01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:57.490
know, so this is my, this is my current, this
is my current - it's, if you haven't figured

01:04:57.490 --> 01:05:01.359
out yet that I have obsessive-compulsive disorder,
you weren't paying attention. But like, but

01:05:01.359 --> 01:05:02.359
that, but that's sort of the idea, is to,
is to make this body of work around that.

01:05:02.359 --> 01:05:06.150
And it's called "A More Perfect Union", and
I'll be showing it sometime in January.

01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:11.619
We good? Is that about right? Did I come in
around time?

01:05:11.619 --> 01:05:12.619
JOSH: Yeah!

01:05:12.619 --> 01:05:13.619
LUKE: Alright.

01:05:13.619 --> 01:05:14.619
JOSH: Yeah.

01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:16.779
LUKE: Alright, thanks.
[audience applauds]

01:05:16.779 --> 01:05:24.750
JOSH: If nobody has any questions after that,
I'll be disappointed with you[audience chuckles].

01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:28.339
LUKE: Ask me a question, anybody.

01:05:28.339 --> 01:05:29.339
[pause]

01:05:29.339 --> 01:05:38.489
AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: How long did it take to
do all those compilations?

01:05:38.489 --> 01:05:40.910
LUKE: What, like, which compilations?

01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:46.259
AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: Oh, like, for instance,
the... the movie one.

01:05:46.259 --> 01:05:51.229
LUKE: Oh, jeeze, that took a long time. I
was actually really lucky, because I did that

01:05:51.229 --> 01:05:58.069
piece like right before all the video rental
stores closed? Right, like when they were

01:05:58.069 --> 01:06:05.440
still like three kims? And they were still
like the movie place on the upper West side

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:13.090
and stuff. So it's, so I was really lucky
because I didn't, I didn't have to, you know,

01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:19.829
actually let, I could, I could, I could run
around town and go into movie stores and be

01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:25.319
like, "Do you have Grand Hotel?" And they
would be like, "Sure." And like, I was able

01:06:25.319 --> 01:06:31.829
to acquire all the, all the movies, and then
I had a render farm, a lab of computers at

01:06:31.829 --> 01:07:04.930
work where I was able to crunch them so that
took about four months. Four or five months.

01:07:04.930 --> 01:07:08.789
Yeah. Took about 16 hours a movie, so, but
that was a while ago. Now it would, wouldn't

01:07:08.789 --> 01:07:22.119
take that long. Yeah. Some of the things that
I do. The Census I've been working on for

01:07:22.119 --> 01:07:27.239
about two years, so it's, you know, takes
a while, to crunch all that stuff. Sir.

01:07:27.239 --> 01:07:30.499
AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: Just curious, it, you
seem to have to work between the lines...

01:07:30.499 --> 01:07:31.499
LUKE: Yeah.

01:07:31.499 --> 01:07:34.640
AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: Lining up the eyes, that
seems very very difficult -

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:41.799
LUKE: Yeah, yeah. It's a drag, [audience laughs]
I mean you can automate some of that, right?

01:07:41.799 --> 01:07:44.079
AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: Well, that's my question.

01:07:44.079 --> 01:07:47.680
LUKE: Yeah, you can automate some of that.
Your, your head is, most people's head, within

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:53.430
ten percent is, is five by seven in the units
of width to your eye. So, so, if you can find

01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:58.279
a face, you can center on. It's like you can
train things to do that. Problem is in online

01:07:58.279 --> 01:08:01.930
dating profiles, people get a little arty
with their photographs, and so, yeah, so it's

01:08:01.930 --> 01:08:08.539
like, so it's like, a little bit harder. It's
much easier to do like, oh my God, what's

01:08:08.539 --> 01:08:14.960
his name, Jason Salavon, digital artist in
Chicago, has a lot of pieces with things like

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:20.980
graduation photographs, where he does that,
right. That's much easier to do because there's

01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:21.980
like this sort of guarenteed neutral background,
right. So that's, that's a sort of automatable

01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:24.315
thing, maybe? It's, it's, it's a little bit
harder to do with this, so I've been spending

01:08:24.315 --> 01:08:25.315
a lot of time clicking on them.

01:08:25.315 --> 01:08:29.530
I'm working on a computer vision piece right
now that is all about trying to automate things

01:08:29.530 --> 01:08:32.111
which is -- I've been making a bunch of pop
icons. So, what I did is, I, I trained the

01:08:32.111 --> 01:08:33.480
computer with a thousand paparazzi photos
of Britney Spears, and then just run all her

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:36.100
music videos through it, and it can lock her
eyes. So this is, this is an automated process,

01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:37.100
this is, finding her eyes. But that's not,
that's, that's not like super-duper easy to

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:38.100
do. Yeah, so. What else?

01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:39.540
AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: Now all the Presidential
Speeches? How long did it take you to figure

01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:40.540
all that?

01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:44.320
LUKE: That wasn't, that didn't, that, that
wasn't so bad, because all that – all those

01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:48.080
speeches are a matter of public record, so
it's, you just have to find them and there's

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:52.720
a, there's a wonderful place at UC Santa Barbara
called the American Presidency Project, it's

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:55.260
part of the Pop Political Science department,
where they've been taking every, basically

01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:56.260
the entire paper trail of the American Presidency,
every speech, every bill they signed, every

01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:57.260
judge they appointed, every whatever, and
sticking into a huge database for researchers,

01:08:57.260 --> 01:09:02.580
and they've been doing it for about ten years.
And so they have a pretty definitive set of

01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:11.820
tools and access points if you're doing research
on the Presidency, where they have a whole

01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:14.560
like, it's, it's called a MySQL database,
they have one of those things where you can

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:19.280
just get 'Time' on the thing, and look for
stuff and do word searches. That's how I made

01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.870
these, was I, I basically unitlaterally announced
myself as their first Artist in Residence,

01:09:21.870 --> 01:09:25.360
without them knowing what the heck that meant,
[audience chuckles] and just sorta, just sorta

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:26.360
invited myself to use their database, and
they were like, and they were like: "Sure.

01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:27.360
That's fine." So that's, that's where that
came from, is, is -- so that wasn't super-bad.

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:28.569
The, the biggest part of that was coming up
with the look and coming up with the algorithm

01:09:28.569 --> 01:09:33.330
by which I was trying to get at the right
words, 'cause actually all the words in the

01:09:33.330 --> 01:09:39.410
eye charts are unique, so not only is it like
the top 66 words for every President. But

01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:40.410
it's also, if, if the President has that word
in their chart, that means it's not in any

01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:41.410
of the other charts, it cancels, right, so
George Washington is "Gentlemen", that means

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:42.410
not only did he say gentlemen the most, that
means he also said "Gentlemen" more than any

01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:43.410
other President, right? So George Bush is
"Terror", that means not only did he say "terror",

01:09:43.410 --> 01:09:44.410
"terror" the most, hermetically in his own
speeches, but he used that word more than

01:09:44.410 --> 01:09:45.410
anyone else. So it's gone from their charts.
So up comes the rest. And then -- so you end

01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:46.410
up with these very, very specific historical
references to different times to different

01:09:46.410 --> 01:09:47.410
things. Yeah? It's like a tag club from hell.
Um, yeah, yeah. What else? John?

01:09:47.410 --> 01:09:48.410
John: So, Luke, has your personal sense of
time gotten elastic somehow over the years?

01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:49.410
You know, you're -

01:09:49.410 --> 01:09:50.410
LUKE: Ah, jeeze, that, you know in hind, well,
yeah, I mean dude, given what I used to do

01:09:50.410 --> 01:09:51.410
to my body in high school, I don't think this
matters but it's like, I don't know, maybe,

01:09:51.410 --> 01:09:52.410
I definitely have started taking the long
view of how we deal with technology in our

01:09:52.410 --> 01:09:53.410
culture, and how we deal with information
in our culture. Like I think one interesting

01:09:53.410 --> 01:09:54.410
little thing, I had this huge writer's block
moment a couple weeks ago. I was trying to

01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:55.410
make a blog entry, for the Guggenheim, for
that YouTube Play thing they're doing, that,

01:09:55.410 --> 01:09:56.410
that video art by mail that they're doing
with, with [indistinct] Guggenheim and Youtube

01:09:56.410 --> 01:09:57.410
asked me to be a blogger for it, and I was
trying to come up with some introductory post.

01:09:57.410 --> 01:09:58.410
And I was having one of these like crisis
of like Online Publishing Video Art. And I,

01:09:58.410 --> 01:09:59.410
and I sort of came up with the idea that,
 -- or, or, just it was, I started thinking,

01:09:59.410 --> 01:10:00.410
I started thinking like, ok, so computer programming,
right? Like a thousand years from now, everybody's

01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:01.410
gonna program computers. It's just gonna be
life, that's just the way it is. It's gonna

01:10:01.410 --> 01:10:02.410
be normal, right? Doesn't mean it's gonna
be easy, it's gonna be normal. Right? A thousand

01:10:02.410 --> 01:10:03.410
years from now, everybody is going to publish
their work online, right? Right, so it's,

01:10:03.410 --> 01:10:04.410
so it's, it's the, it's the Warhol deconstruction,
instead of everyone being famous for 15 minutes,

01:10:04.410 --> 01:10:05.410
everybody's going to be famous for 15 people.
Right? That's just the way it's gonna be.

01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:06.410
Right? And so looking at, looking at this
particular slice of time and our world and,

01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:07.410
and sort of doing things like bemoaning the
collapse of the record industry -- so the

01:10:07.410 --> 01:10:08.410
record industry will just be a historical
fifty-year blip in the radar, the idea that

01:10:08.410 --> 01:10:09.410
people should make money off their records,
in the grand scheme of human civilization

01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:10.410
is gonna seem so like, random and pointless,
right? Once we're a thousand years out or

01:10:10.410 --> 01:10:11.410
what have you. So I have started kind of rustling
up some ideas about that, but my own experience

01:10:11.410 --> 01:10:12.410
of time is that I never have enough of it,
and that's been true, that's been true for

01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:13.410
a very long time. Yeah. What else, folks?

01:10:13.410 --> 01:10:14.410
AUDIENCE MEMBER #7: So is that why you speak
so fast? [audience laughs]

01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:15.410
LUKE: Know, I think, I think really fast because
I - I'm always, well, yeah, actually, that

01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:16.410
might be why I speak fast. I also, I also
have this terrible accent, I'm from Hoboken,

01:10:16.410 --> 01:10:17.410
New Jersey, so I don't have a, I don't have
a very good, I don't have a particularly palatable

01:10:17.410 --> 01:10:18.410
accent. So I guess if I rush through things
that's the best way to, to get it over with.

01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:19.410
[Audience laughs] Yeah. See, you can, can
listen to somebody who, who, who has a better

01:10:19.410 --> 01:10:20.410
command of spoken English. But yeah, it might
be why. What else, guys? Sir. Kurt! Oh my

01:10:20.410 --> 01:10:21.410
God, how - how are you?

01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:22.410
KURT: Do you think it's like to, [indistinct
questioning] but isn't it possible that there

01:10:22.410 --> 01:10:23.410
are actually these active listeners [indistinct
ending]

01:10:23.410 --> 01:10:24.410
LUKE: Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. I had a meeting
with somebody a couple weeks ago who seemed

01:10:24.410 --> 01:10:25.410
extremely interested in the fact that I made
some wacky algorithm to sift all that stuff

01:10:25.410 --> 01:10:26.410
and yeah. Yeah, absolutely, I mean, there,
there's a whole body of sort of computational

01:10:26.410 --> 01:10:27.410
research right now in everything targeted
advertising to whatnot. It's, it's about making,

01:10:27.410 --> 01:10:28.410
trying to make sense of things like that,
online dating, profiles and whatever. I mean,

01:10:28.410 --> 01:10:29.410
my piece is, isn't really so much about it.
My piece is more like the census, like the

01:10:29.410 --> 01:10:30.410
actual formal US Census that we do, and what's
wrong with it, and how we can like sort of

01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:31.410
play around with it, than about the fact that
I'm quite, quite honestly -- I'm, I'm violating

01:10:31.410 --> 01:10:32.410
the privacy of 20% of the adult population
of the United States [audience giggles] by

01:10:32.410 --> 01:10:33.410
downloading and, and, and crunching this data,
right? I've just, I've committed 16.7 million

01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:34.410
counts of, of wire fraud, right? You're not
allowed to download online dating profiles,

01:10:34.410 --> 01:10:35.410
right, and use them for anything, other than
entertainment, right? So, but everybody does

01:10:35.410 --> 01:10:36.410
it. I'm sure there's someone at Nielsen right
now who's doing it. I'm sure there's probably

01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:37.410
someone in your company who does it. [audience
laughs] There's people all over the place

01:10:37.410 --> 01:10:38.410
who do it. It's just out there, right? So
the thing is just to, to make something interesting

01:10:38.410 --> 01:10:39.410
out of it, and try to make some, make some
sense out of just coming up with something

01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:40.410
that is thought-provoking? I don't - I don't,
I try to, I try to, if, if possible, to under-editorialize,

01:10:40.410 --> 01:10:41.410
in what I do. So like the eye charts, they,
they're not, that wasn't a partisan piece.

01:10:41.410 --> 01:10:42.410
That was just the way the map turned out,
right, and so I showed it at both the Democratic

01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:43.410
and the Republican National Convention, and
I spoke to a lot of people on sort of both

01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:44.410
sides of the political line in, during that
election cycle, and you know when you show

01:10:44.410 --> 01:10:45.410
them George Bush's eye chart, it begins with
"terror", someone on the political left in

01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:46.410
this country will see that as, as as a sort
of self-evident damnation of that administration

01:10:46.410 --> 01:10:47.410
whereas people on the, on the right of the
political spectrum will be like, "Yeah, damn

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:48.410
right, 'course it's terror." Right? So, so
it's not like, it's not like I have to point

01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:49.410
that out to you, or anything like that. It
just is. And you know people can draw their

01:10:49.410 --> 01:10:50.410
own conclusions, I think. So I don't know.
What else?

01:10:50.410 --> 01:10:51.410
JOSH: Is there a last question?

01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:52.410
AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Sort of go back to the
privacy slash legal aspects of your work collection,

01:10:52.410 --> 01:10:53.410
like your map one?

01:10:53.410 --> 01:10:54.410
LUKE: Uh-huh. Yeah.

01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:55.410
AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: So I think it's, it's
fine to have like aggregates of all this stuff

01:10:55.410 --> 01:10:56.410
like how many shy people there are, and whatever-

01:10:56.410 --> 01:10:57.410
LUKE: Oh sure -

01:10:57.410 --> 01:10:58.410
AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: But you're sitting on
a database of like, 18 million people, and

01:10:58.410 --> 01:10:59.410
 - how legal is that?

01:10:59.410 --> 01:11:00.410
LUKE: Yeah, I mean, that's, that's, that's
the thing. This, a map, a map of shyness,

01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:01.410
is not, is not illegal,

01:11:01.410 --> 01:11:02.410
AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Right, but aggregates
are fine, but -

01:11:02.410 --> 01:11:03.410
LUKE: Absolutely.

01:11:03.410 --> 01:11:04.410
AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: But you're in possession
of -

01:11:04.410 --> 01:11:05.410
LUKE: Right, it's the fact that I own a hard
drive.

01:11:05.410 --> 01:11:06.410
AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Yes. [audience laughs]

01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:07.410
LUKE: That's maybe a problem. That's maybe
problematic. Yeah, absolutely, yeah I should

01:11:07.410 --> 01:11:08.410
clarify that. Yeah this is, this is no big
deal. Once you get to -- from Point A to Point

01:11:08.410 --> 01:11:09.410
Z, the final piece, right, won't be that way.
The problem is that, I've got all this stuff.

01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:10.410
But I'll throw out all the stuff; I mean I
did, I did this map, and I haven't honestly

01:11:10.410 --> 01:11:11.410
even read most of the profiles. That would
take a while. [audience laughs] Although I

01:11:11.410 --> 01:11:12.410
did do this sanity check where I went through
to try to get rid of duplicates, and I found

01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:13.410
one person who was also on all of them, [audience
laughs] right? I found another, I found, I

01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:14.410
found another, yeah, I found another faker,
like Helena Bonham Carter in "Fight Club".

01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:15.410
So I, so I, so I wrote to her, and I was like,
"J'accuse!" And, and she turned out to be

01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:16.410
a pop singer, a singer/songwriter in Oakland,
California, who's doing a whole album where

01:11:16.410 --> 01:11:17.410
the lyrics are from online dating sites, right?
So I asked her out, right, [audience laughs

01:11:17.410 --> 01:11:18.410
loudly] I was like, "Oh, we should go like,
we should go out on a date." So, so I flew,

01:11:18.410 --> 01:11:19.410
I flew to Berkeley, actually on Election Day
Weekend - this is like, a total wacky whatever,

01:11:19.410 --> 01:11:20.410
it's like two years ago - on Election Day
Weekend, and we went for coffee in Berkeley,

01:11:20.410 --> 01:11:21.410
and hung out, and we made up this whole - we
didn't hit it off. But we made up this whole

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:22.410
like awesome, like lie we're gonna tell to
all our friends that we had this whirlwind

01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:23.410
romance that we never, we never - you know.
We never actually bothered lying to everybody

01:11:23.410 --> 01:11:24.410
about it. But it was, it was, but, she was
also on all of them.

01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:25.410
JOSH: You actually met through an online dating
service.

01:11:25.410 --> 01:11:26.410
LUKE: And we met through, we met through 16
out of the 21 online dating services [audience

01:11:26.410 --> 01:11:27.410
laughs] Simultaneously. Yeah, yeah. So it
was, so it's pretty good. Mm. But yeah, so

01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:28.410
you know.

01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:29.410
JOSH: This is a massively inefficient way
to meet girls.

01:11:29.410 --> 01:11:30.410
LUKE: Yeah, I would argue that this is an
incredibly inefficient way to meet girls,

01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:31.410
but yeah. Although, that's, that's one of
things that I always think is interesting

01:11:31.410 --> 01:11:32.410
about online dating, right, is that it's,
it's this totally bizarre act of self-identity,

01:11:32.410 --> 01:11:33.410
where you simultaneously have to put your
good, best foot forward. So you have to lie,

01:11:33.410 --> 01:11:34.410
and at the same time, you have to say who
you wanna be with, which means you have to

01:11:34.410 --> 01:11:35.410
be as incredibly truthful as possible to get
what you want, right? So, so it's a split-personality

01:11:35.410 --> 01:11:36.410
exercise, right? So it's a, it's a, it's an
interesting, it's an interesting prose assignment

01:11:36.410 --> 01:11:37.410
to have to go through, writing an online dating
profile. I did not bother to write any. I,

01:11:37.410 --> 01:11:38.410
I just wrote some snarky little thing, but
 - the, the actual ones I've read are actually,

01:11:38.410 --> 01:11:39.410
they're really interesting how people have
to construct these narratives of who they

01:11:39.410 --> 01:11:40.410
are and who they want and how that works,
and so that's what I'm trying to like tear

01:11:40.410 --> 01:11:41.410
apart, and get, get to in a sense, so it'd
be kind of fun.

01:11:41.410 --> 01:11:42.410
JOSH: Thank you very much. [loud audience
applause]

01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:43.410
LUKE: Thanks man! Thanks. Alrighty. [applause
softens]

01:11:43.410 --> 01:11:44.410
JOSH: We have a little bit of time left. [sounds
of audience rising, chatting] Please feel

01:11:44.410 --> 01:11:45.410
free to have a look at the exhibits, chat
with the artists. Thank you very much for

01:11:45.410 --> 01:11:45.411
coming.
