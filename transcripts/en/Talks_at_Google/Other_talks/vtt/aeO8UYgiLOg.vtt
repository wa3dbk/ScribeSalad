00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.879
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Hi everyone, I'm Winnie
Lam. Thank you so much for coming. It's my

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:13.150
pleasure to welcome Dr. Iain Douglas-Hamilton
to Google for a talk today. So Iain has started

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.289
saving the elephants probably before most
of us were born, looking at the room, certainly

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.890
before I was born and before my parents were
married. He has been saving the elephants

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:32.050
and working with local African people on conservation
efforts. He got his PhD in zoology from the

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.040
University of Oxford in England and has received
many international awards recognizing him

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.370
as a leading authority on African elephants.
Now, let me tell you a couple of interesting

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.720
things about Iain. So, he's a pilot in addition
to being a conservationist, he flies his plane

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:57.700
around a lot to track elephants. In addition
to flying his plane he's also crashed his

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.000
plane a number of times.
[Laughter]

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.650
&gt;&gt;Presenter: And this is one of the times
when he's crashed his plane. Luckily, for

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.720
the many times, actually not that many, for
the few times that he's crashed his plane,

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.431
he's managed to walk away from it safe and
sound and he's with us, so lucky for us and

00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:21.610
lucky for him. Another interesting thing about
Iain is that he's Scottish and he likes to

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:28.439
wear his kilt on special occasions. I'll show
you a picture here. He was receiving an award

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.820
and he was wearing his Scottish kilt. And
depending on your opinion, it might be fortunate

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.840
or unfortunate for us that he's not wearing
a kilt today.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.720
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Anyways, without further ado,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.689
please help me give a very warm welcome to
Dr. Iain Douglas-Hamilton.

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.530
[Applause]

00:01:48.530 --> 00:02:00.901
&gt;&gt;Iain: Okay, it's amazing to be here at Google.
When I first came across Google Earth, it

00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:07.290
just captured my imagination in a way that,
I didn't believe such a thing that I might

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:14.010
have dreamed about, had actually been created.
And since then we've had a wonderful relationship

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:22.349
with Google Earth outreach. I want to thank
very much, Charlie Knowles, who is my host

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:30.969
on many occasions while I conservation network
which is an amazing outfit that helps introduce

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:37.989
conservation entrepreneurs to very large donors.
Without taking anything on the way, they empower

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:47.019
us to carry on our work in Africa. Also, I'd
like to acknowledge George Wittemyer, where

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:56.079
are you George? Oh, there he is, George Wittemyer
and Jake Wall. George is our scientific chairman

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.831
of our advisory board of “Save the Elephants"
and Jake is our Programmer and our Database

00:03:00.831 --> 00:03:07.849
Manager who looks after all our moving elephants
which, as you will hear, appear on Google

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:18.499
Earth. My theme today is elephants in peril
because we're actually having an unprecedented

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:26.269
surge at the moment in illegal killing of
elephants for ivory. We've come out of a twenty

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:33.159
year lull period where we had a total ivory
trade ban. But now, once again, there's a

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:42.989
rapidly increasing demand that is fueling
illegal killing and seizures of illegal ivory

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:52.120
reached an all time high in 2011. So did another
measure of illegal killing which is part of

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.680
the CITES Treaty which, in turn, is part of
UNEP that looks after endangered species.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:06.389
In some ways history's repeating itself and
I wanna take a minute just to go back to how

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:16.109
I got started which was a long time ago in
1965. I went to live in a small park in Tanzania

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:25.770
called Lake Manyara and I was very lucky to
work up a relationship with about 500 relatively

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.870
habituated elephants and to learn to know
them as individuals. By the end of my time

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.270
I was working with 50 families but it was
at that time I really learned to respect elephants.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.759
And, in fact, I don't think anyone knew before
that elephants, truly speaking, are a matriarchy

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:50.680
and I learned the meaning of matriarchy; an
undaunted female intelligence who will go

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.870
all the way out to save her family. That's
just what you're seeing here. This elephant

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.759
is actually charging out in front of her family
while her family escapes, confronting the

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:04.730
danger, which in this case was me.
[Laughter]

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.659
&gt;&gt;Iain: I wasn't much of a danger but
[Laughter]

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:14.750
&gt;&gt;Iain: she didn't know that. And, unfortunately,
because of this behavior, when female elephants

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.759
come out to defend their families, they are
often the first victims. I want to show you

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:25.500
a little piece of natural history before we
get onto other reasons for elephants being

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:34.949
peril. This is a lone female who's defending
her baby against hyena attack, picture taken

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:41.120
this year by someone called James Wells in
Botswana. And the hyenas are closing in on

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:47.080
her baby from all directions and she's out
there defending, kicking with her feet, chasing

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:56.320
them, scuffing up the dirt and at the end
of the day because of her very vigorous defense,

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:03.969
the baby was safe although, unfortunately,
it lost its tail in the process. She's triumphant.

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:09.680
Anyway, I lived, for these 5 first years of
my career, and I'm sorry I'm not telling you

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.180
about it because that's the nice part of things
is living with elephants. And I brought up

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:21.349
my family there, my two little girls, and
at the end of the 60's it was the end of an

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:26.820
era, a golden era for the national parks,
a golden era for the elephants. And I became

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:32.590
in a new problem, involved in a new problem,
this is how history is repeating itself, that

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:41.870
the price of ivory suddenly, inexplicably
soared upwards in 1969, '70, '71. Now, in

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:51.259
retrospect, we know that it was caused by
a surge in prosperity in Japan where ordinary

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:59.169
people could all of a sudden afford to buy
ivory and it led to an ivory rush. So my next

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:06.779
phase is I went out on a trip across Africa,
funded by the New York Zoological Society,

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:10.690
to go and find out how many elephants there
were in Africa. And it took me to every corner

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:16.590
of Africa, went in an airplane and to cut
a long story short, the ivory trade was out

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:23.189
of control, the elephants were decreasing
fast and we came across scenes like this.

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:31.939
Of whole families shot down with empty cartridge
cases and one worst case scenario, this particular

00:07:31.939 --> 00:07:40.139
herd were 150 survivors out of a population
that had been 8 thousand, five years earlier,

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:45.879
just South of the Nile, so these things did
happen, they can happen. And it was in East

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:52.990
Africa we saw the worst wipe-outs and recorded
them. Masses of ivory were leaving the continent.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:08:00.309
It took a very long time to get concerted
international action. So something like, something

00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:07.620
the order of 700 thousand elephants went out
in 10 years represented by about 700 tons

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:17.689
of ivory a year. Then, in 1989, Kenya the
country which I live in now, took the lead

00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:23.340
and they took the ivory stockpile and they
sent the whole thing up in smoke as a statement

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:30.309
to the world that they were no longer gonna
deal in ivory under the carpet. And this actually

00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:35.930
didn't, twenty years of cease fire, we were
great beneficiaries of this. I was able to

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:42.490
go back to what I really love which is studying
elephant behavior, training up local people

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:48.440
to do it and engaging scientists, young scientists
from abroad like George Wittemyer, to come

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:56.889
out and make it a life's work as well. And
in Samburu, where we have our current research

00:08:56.889 --> 00:09:05.029
station, it's the most fabulous place you
can imagine. It's a place where, until recently,

00:09:05.029 --> 00:09:09.950
elephants could live out their lives without
being dominated by one emotion, which is fear

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:19.740
of man. And so they behave naturally and it's
there that our prime technology was a very

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:25.190
primitive one which was to learn to recognize
elephants as individuals, to record all the

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:31.650
births and deaths and departures. We got to
know, again, about 500 elephants and we have

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:40.199
been monitoring them for 15 years now, in
detail. However, the system did not work well

00:09:40.199 --> 00:09:46.540
to tell us how far the elephants went out
of the protected area and how they took their

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:55.901
decisions to move. And for this we turned
to radio tracking using GPS technology. Each

00:09:55.901 --> 00:10:06.160
of these collars is a different type of ones
that we've been deploying and they gather

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.430
the information on a chip and then send it
out either by satellite or GSM telephone.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:21.160
Here's an elephant coming to inspect the collars.
And the system, it now operates, we either

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:26.630
download by a satellite or by a telephone
and it goes into a database which was designed

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:32.699
by Jake Wall sitting in the back there. I'm
not going to go into all the details but the

00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:40.680
main feature is that it's recording the movements
of hundreds of elephants simultaneously, it

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:50.730
goes into a database which for the moment
is on a server in a local cell telephone company,

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:58.470
we're gonna move it onto the Cloud quite soon
and it can then relate, it can send out text

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:08.550
messages to mobile telephones or to hand held
devices or to the internet. And what Jake

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:15.430
has been developing for us is a series of
algorithms to detect changes in elephant behavior.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:21.050
This is very exciting and particularly in
relation to the current poaching surge that

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:27.980
is going on. So I wanted to give you a little
example of an elephant in peril. This is an

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:33.089
elephant called Mountain Bull and he lives
under this beautiful mount in Mount Kenya

00:11:33.089 --> 00:11:40.570
which is 17 thousand feet high, right on the
equator in the middle of Kenya. He has lots

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:47.140
of difficult choices he has to make that involve
taking risks driven by the imperative to pass

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:55.570
on his genes, he has to go and find females.
And sometimes because he needs to eat good

00:11:55.570 --> 00:12:02.100
food and grow strong so that he can compete
with other males for females, he has to take

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:08.069
risks. And unfortunately this sometimes causes
a clash with people. So the little film excerpt

00:12:08.069 --> 00:12:18.990
I'm going to show, it's with my daughter who
once made films for the BBC and it is the

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:24.620
story of following in the tracks of Mountain
Bull as he goes up this special corridor,

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.200
up onto the heights of Mount Kenya.
[Birds chirping]

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.200
[Music plays]

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:35.480
&gt;&gt;female #1 on video: 50 miles south of the
reserve, Saba is hot on the trail of Mountain

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.480
Bull.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.480
&gt;&gt;Saba: Fresh tracks.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.660
&gt;&gt;male on video: Fresh tracks, yeah.
[Music plays]

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:45.319
&gt;&gt;female #1 on video: The data shows she's
just days behind.

00:12:45.319 --> 00:12:48.009
&gt;&gt;male on video: [inaudible]

00:12:48.009 --> 00:12:52.110
&gt;&gt;Saba: We can go straight through the wheat
fields

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:55.450
&gt;&gt;male on video: Yeah

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:56.450
&gt;&gt;Saba: and around the base of that hill in
the distance.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:57.450
&gt;&gt;male on video: Yeah

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.810
&gt;&gt;Saba: And then he runs the gauntlets through
the shambles. So we're dead on course.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:02.009
&gt;&gt;male on video: Yeah, we're on track.

00:13:02.009 --> 00:13:03.889
&gt;&gt;Saba: Right through the wheat.
[Laughs]

00:13:03.889 --> 00:13:10.300
&gt;&gt;female #1 on video: Saba's found Mountain
Bull is eating crops and damaging fences,

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:15.470
that isn't going to go down well with the
farmers.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:16.630
[Music plays]

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:23.120
&gt;&gt;female #1 on video: Back at camp, Saba's
returned. She's telling Iain what she found

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.120
out about Mountain Bull.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.350
&gt;&gt;Saba: This is very interesting seeing where
he went, straight through the wheat fields

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:28.350
like we thought.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:33.280
&gt;&gt;female #1 on video: Saba's seen firsthand
what Mountain Bull is up against. The wheat

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:40.630
farming is on a vast scale so Saba thinks
the farmers are prepared to put up with a

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:41.630
few elephants.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:42.630
&gt;&gt;Saba: Where I started getting a a bit of
concern from him is where he's coming to the

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:46.540
village because as the human population grows
there and people will encroach more and more

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:48.660
into that area and they won't be quite so
tolerant of Mountain Bull.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.220
&gt;&gt;Iain: So we've got to find a solution.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:56.879
&gt;&gt;female #1 on video: There's a valley that
runs into the forest avoiding the villages.

00:13:56.879 --> 00:14:03.709
If Mountain Bull and the others could be diverted
here using a fence it could solve the problem.

00:14:03.709 --> 00:14:10.500
&gt;&gt;Iain: Then you'd be into the sanctuary of
the local forest.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.170
&gt;&gt;Saba: Without bothering the local community.
It seems like a very neat solution.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:15.081
&gt;&gt;female #1 on video: Using the collars data
and with collaboration from local farmers,

00:14:15.081 --> 00:14:23.214
the conflict could be stopped. Mountain Bull
has proven to be clever and adaptable and

00:14:23.214 --> 00:14:25.540
the team will keep tracking him to check he's
safe.

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.940
[Music plays]

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:36.450
&gt;&gt;Iain: So the corridor is created up the
side of the mountain and it had to pass under

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:43.019
a main road which is the road here, and we
were wondering how long it would take the

00:14:43.019 --> 00:14:48.629
elephants to learn how to use this corridor
and to stop using that destructive route.

00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:55.860
Well, the curious thing is, the first day
that that corridor was opened, these young

00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:02.190
elephants came through, they came under that
tunnel and actually the very first elephant

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:07.720
to come through was one that carried one of
our collars on it. We're very excited about

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:21.589
that. And Google Earth helped us to create
that instantaneous tracking system. This shows

00:15:21.589 --> 00:15:28.370
the corridor with the background of the mountain.
And the blue line is where the corridor was

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:35.830
put and it's got a fence on either side. Now,
the green animal there is an elephant called

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:41.699
Tony which was the first elephant that came
through. But the red line is the migration

00:15:41.699 --> 00:15:46.829
route of Mountain Bull, who you've already
seen. And he wasn't gonna change quite so

00:15:46.829 --> 00:15:54.500
quickly. Now that the younger bulls were using
the corridor, the question was would Mountain

00:15:54.500 --> 00:16:01.819
Bull ever learn? So we went on tracking him
and this little movie shows his movements

00:16:01.819 --> 00:16:09.740
as he comes towards the corridor. Now, he
broke in half way and came down the corridor

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:14.600
and then he actually couldn't get out because
he found himself surrounded by a whole lot

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:21.399
of fences. And he has to get under that main
road. He has to get under that underpass.

00:16:21.399 --> 00:16:28.670
It takes him quite awhile to find a way. He's
trying one route and there he's through.

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:32.629
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Iain: So he went through and he went rushing

00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:36.550
down to some farms to look for some ladies
[Laughter]

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:42.290
&gt;&gt;Iain: And he couldn't find them and then
he goes back. He hits a fence which thwarts

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:50.120
him and then eventually he goes back again
and he's on his old route and he breaks in

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:56.140
to the corridor and he exits it from the top.
So there's an amazing piece of data, I couldn't

00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:00.400
believe it. He'd used the whole corridor but
in a very unorthodox way.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.750
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Iain: Anyway, I was gonna show you some

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:09.530
live tracking because the beauty of the system
that we've now got is that we can actually

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:15.270
look from here or California or China or wherever
the hell you like and you can see what's happening

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:23.150
to the elephants in real time. So it is amazing.
We open up our Google Earth and automatically

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:29.131
these files spring out at us. We got, we're
tracking about 60 animals across Africa. This

00:17:29.131 --> 00:17:35.800
is all stuff that Jake has written and it's
a tiny little file that it's so easy to send

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:43.350
to someone on email and it points into our
database and also Jake's managed to figure

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:50.670
out how to make everybody's Google Earth automatically
update with the latest status. You not only

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:58.520
get the latest position of each elephant coming
up but if we put a collar on a new elephant,

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:06.350
it'll pop up in your Google Earth. The beauty
of the system is that without any GIS training,

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:12.450
I can give it to anyone in Africa and we're
sharing it now far and wide, we're sharing

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:17.790
our data with people who can actually help
to save the elephants. We're doing it in all

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:27.890
sorts of different ways and we're using it
to detect if an animal starts moving too slowly.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:33.570
There's an algorithm that immediately says,
"This animal is going below its average speed."

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:40.940
Now, it then pops up and we get an email report
every day with all the elephants on it and

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:46.720
we have automatic alarms against each elephant
and we see whether the collar has failed to

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:53.970
report and if so, for how many hours or days,
we see if the elephant is moving too slowly

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:59.290
and several times when that has happened,
we've alerted a team that's gone out and sure

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:04.440
enough, the elephant is wounded. And then
we get a veterinarian to come and dart the

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:10.120
animal, put it down, give it drugs, clean
out the wound, put it back on its feet. But

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:17.670
our most serious alarm of all is the immobility
alarm. So if the animal stops moving all together

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:26.660
we get a warning and then we send out a patrol
and either the collar has fallen off the elephant

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:32.050
or the elephant has been killed. At the moment
we're trying to hone this down. This is very

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:39.930
much a system under development. We're experimenting
with accelerometers now and we've actually

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:47.330
deployed our first accelerometers at Disney
in Florida. And a Disney scientist then came

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:52.850
out to us and we've been working in the field.
We had an accelerometer on two elephants and

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:58.020
we got a 48 hour cycle. So we were able to
look at what signal we're getting when the

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:05.850
animal lies down and we want to actually get
it so sophisticated that we can tell the difference

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:11.510
between lying down and being dead. Because
elephants do lie down, they lie down on their

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:18.410
side, they go to sleep and they do it probably
twice a night, but if an elephant doesn't

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:25.410
move for 3 hours that's very worrying. So
our automated alarm is graduated, if you get

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:31.601
to a grade 3, that means no movements in 3
hours, that's bad. If it's a 4 or a 5, you

00:20:31.601 --> 00:20:38.670
get extremely worried and you send out a patrol.
So these are the various ways we can help

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:46.190
them. And I just wanna show you the areas
where we work in Africa. We're working on

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:55.060
elephants in the desert out in Mali to the
far west near Timbuktu, we're looking at elephants

00:20:55.060 --> 00:21:02.370
in the bushveld in South Africa and we're
looking at elephants In Kenya. And we've been

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:08.540
looking at elephants in the Central African
Forest but they've now, that was doing it

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:14.810
with Wildlife Conservation Society and they've
now stopped working. But what is interesting

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:20.810
is that in all these regions the elephants
cross boundaries. So normally, in Africa,

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:26.130
you have to go through huge rigmarole to get
permission to dart an elephant and launch

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:33.180
a tracking operation. So we're actually operating
some illegal tracking operations in a number

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:40.750
of countries because the elephants just walked
across the boundary and they don't know the

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:44.710
difference. Just to show you quickly, this
is the Kruger National Park which is one of

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:50.400
Africa's great parks. And on the left we've
got females in two separate populations, on

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:57.210
the right we've got males. And the colors
were put in three different areas to the north

00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:05.730
in this grey blue, to the east in this light
blue and to the west. And we call this the

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:11.610
Trans-boundary elephant project because our
objective is to see how much elephants cross

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:18.140
boundaries, whether they go out of a national
park into a private place or if they go across

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:25.350
a border. So these elephants, the blue ones,
go right deep into Mozambique, they also go

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:33.600
north up into Zimbabwe, very interesting and
very important for their future that we safe

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:41.590
guard these migration routes and the corridors
that connect them. So to the west we have

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:48.890
elephants in the extreme desert country around
Timbuktu. And they live right at the very

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:55.070
edge of existence. Their problem is mainly
to do with finding enough water and finding

00:22:55.070 --> 00:23:01.900
enough to eat, it's an extremely harsh environment
and they have the longest migration in the

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:09.270
whole of Africa. They have to get from one
oasis to another. I'm afraid the next maps

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:15.300
not gonna work but they do have a critical
place that they need to go through once a

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:21.100
year, it's called the gates of the elephants,
in French, les portes des éléphants and

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:29.020
it's a nick point where there's a range of
high hills and we have really highlighted,

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:35.830
through our radio tracking, how vital this
corridor is for them. Here you can see the

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:43.580
gate in the background and that little square
zooms into an elephant herd that's making

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:52.450
this lonely migration through that vast area.
Jake is writing his thesis currently and this

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:58.530
is the map that he's made of the movements
of the elephants. They happen to be the longest

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:05.180
migrating elephants in the whole of Africa.
We found out that they go roughly a distance,

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:12.640
cumulative distance of about 4 thousand kilometers
in a year. But what he's found here and it's

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:19.040
very interesting is that blue, those are the
movements of males where only males go and

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:28.480
red is where only the females go and green
is where they share in common. So it really

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:34.540
highlights some interesting biological problems
there, to try to understand why the males

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:45.640
and the females have slightly different ranges.
Well, the main problem, as I said, that we're

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:55.950
dealing with now is not, at the moment, the
alienation of land by human beings expanding

00:24:55.950 --> 00:25:01.460
into elephant range, that is a problem but
our major short term problem is the problem

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:08.470
of elephant poaching for ivory. I'm sorry
to show you this picture, it's horrible, but

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:15.020
this is the result of a wounded elephant that
has come back into the reserve having gone

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:24.280
outside, been shot at for its ivory, she's
a matriarch convulsing in agony and we're

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:32.420
seeing more and more of these horrible sights
of animals not just dead but also badly wounded

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:39.020
for the first time in our central reserve.
I'm not gonna show you the rest of it; they

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:46.730
had to put it out of his misery. But I want
to show you another example here is an elephant

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:54.290
called Khadija who's a matriarch. She's the
only one left of her family, all the other

00:25:54.290 --> 00:26:00.500
matriarchs are dead and we found her like
this shortly after we had a visit, actually,

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:07.380
from some Chinese guests that we'd been showing
around. And you can see in her shoulder there's

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:12.090
three holes there and she had more bullet
holes elsewhere.

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:19.540
[Coughing in audience]
&gt;&gt;Iain: So we decided that the only thing

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:27.250
we could do for her because she was so badly
wounded was to actually immobilize her and

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:34.270
put her down with a drug and then to treat
her wounds. And here you see her down and

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:39.530
she's been treated but now the problem was
to get her back on her feet. And our team

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:45.650
struggled and struggled and they could not
get her up because she was lying on her bad

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:53.400
leg. So eventually they had to pull her over,
using the car, onto her other side and then

00:26:53.400 --> 00:27:01.130
she was able to get back and struggled back
onto her feet. And all through this operation

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:06.400
the little orphans who were the survivors
of the other dead mothers were watching this

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:13.800
process. Well, we tracked this all on our
Google Earth cause we put a collar on her

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:20.960
just to see what was happening. This was the
height of the poaching last year and for 18

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:30.580
days we tracked her going down to the river
and back from the 24th of June to the 13th

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:38.320
of July. And then, sadly, our informers rang
us up and told us they'd heard gun shots.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:45.370
The next day we went out and we found Khadija
dead. Now it's all very depressing but I'm

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:51.490
showing you this, not because it's exceptional
but because it's become quite common place

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:59.130
to a population that was formally in a really
safe haven. This is my team with some of the

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:04.770
Kenya Wildlife service rangers. They're looking
at the collar they recovered and the poachers

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:08.780
tried to put it out of action by shooting
it with a bullet, so you can see it's all

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:14.270
cracked. Actually, it didn't stop it from
working, it's quite tough. But they buried

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:25.190
it under sand and still it went on working.
Now, I was warned not to show you any graphs

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:27.590
but I'm gonna show you a graph.
[Laughter]

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:33.490
&gt;&gt;Iain: This is a graph, again, it's rather
depressing, what its showing is the wounding

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:42.010
rate in our population from 1998 up to 2011
with the first part of this year, too. And

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:49.620
the light colors there are wounds caused by
traditional forms of human predation, through

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:58.840
spears and arrows but the dark is gunshots.
So you see there a whole trend of what's happening.

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:05.640
If you look at the population itself using
this individual ID system, and this is George

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:12.340
Wittemyer's work, you see here the line at
the top, that's the total size of the population.

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:23.670
So it went from 450 up to about 610 peaking
in the year 2008 before coming down. And here

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:29.640
underneath you've actually got the dark color
is births and the light color is deaths. So

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:39.221
the first part of that, the first decade,
I'm sorry, births exceeded deaths and the

00:29:39.221 --> 00:29:45.660
population went up. Then, in 2008 we had a
terrible drought accompanied by elevated levels

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:54.390
of poaching and the elevated levels of poaching
continued. Now we think that what we're seeing

00:29:54.390 --> 00:30:01.010
there in our special study site which is one
of the best places for doing this, it's a

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:09.360
microcosm what's happening in Africa and if
you look at the overall population, in 1970

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:15.250
in our area numbers plummeted in that first
round of elephant poaching. Then the elephants

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:22.860
recovered now they are possibly beginning
in another period of plummeting. So we think

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:29.740
this is being replicated further around. And
these are some other populations where the

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:39.100
illegal level of killing has gone up as well.
To get back to the continental scale, this

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:44.470
map of Africa is on a new website that we're
putting together actually funded by the Tides

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:52.660
Foundation through Google Outreach. And the
circles there represent the size of various

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:58.890
elephant populations. So you can see the biggest
by far is found in Botswana and Zimbabwe down

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:06.010
here and then again in Tanzania and all the
other populations are relatively small in

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:14.250
Africa. If you look at this program called
MIKE, Monitoring Illegal Killing of Elephants,

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:23.280
we have these 30 odd sites across Africa and,
I think its 40 sites actually, and here I've

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:30.480
color coordinated them according to the severity
of the poaching. Red is really bad, green

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:37.020
is good. So green means they illegally kill
a small proportion and red means they're very

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:43.360
high. So if 80 percent of the dead elephants
you find are illegally killed you get a deep

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:50.380
red and the yellow is in between. So that
was a period which was 2002 to 2005. Now,

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:56.900
if you look at the situation today you've
got far more reds and the only places which

00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:04.130
are free are three populations in Southern
Africa, a couple in the center and that one

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:13.560
in the far west in Mali. That was last year,
this year there's been a series of massacres

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:19.230
of which one of the worst was this massacre
that took place in Cameroon where it was thought

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:27.600
something like between 300 and 500 elephants
were shot. And these are some pictures that

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:34.490
came in from the bush. Sometimes, of course,
we find that it's one of our collared elephants

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:45.960
that gets killed. Well I, I just want to end
on the solutions for the future. One of the

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:54.480
solutions is obviously to lure demand in the
consuming countries, particularly in China.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:33:01.090
But another solution is to get local people
on the site in Africa. And we've geared our

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:08.080
whole program to that where we have an outreach
program and people who want to adopt the conservation

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:15.600
option get all sorts of benefits whether from
eco tourism or from improved security in their

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:22.220
area. What you're looking at here is some
volunteers, the people who help us with our

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:29.750
research program to gather information on
poaching. And in Africa a lot of this begins

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:36.200
under a tree where people get together and
they talk. And actually it's a lengthy process

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:45.580
to get everybody on site but we've found that
we've been encouraged by this one thing that

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:51.610
is improving which is an increased level of
local support. And I think in our area if

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:57.900
we can combine that with increased anti poaching
measures, that's why I'm here raising funds

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:04.940
to try to get the wherewithal to combat the
poachers, we can probably beat the poachers

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:17.950
at their game. Symbols are also important
and recently Kenya burnt some ivory that was

00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:29.210
an illegal confiscation and made a statement
that they're not going to participate. So

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:37.100
everybody now agrees that its demand that
is driving the trade. On the eco tourism site,

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:43.029
we can give benefits to local people, this
man who's called Bernard, he's a chief guide

00:34:43.029 --> 00:34:49.040
at my wife's ecotourism camp which is called
Elephant Watch and if you want some brochures

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:57.509
on that we've got them available here. But
if livelihoods can be given from the elephant

00:34:57.509 --> 00:35:05.560
to people that is gonna be one of the keys
to survival. Many of these local people now

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:12.660
are getting new livelihood, the whole expertise
and they're becoming the future guardians

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:23.029
and elephant experts for the future. Finally,
if we're gonna beat this poaching, we need

00:35:23.029 --> 00:35:32.400
all individuals, concerned individuals, NGOs
and governments to join together and to settle

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:41.730
any differences, to tackle what is really
a very urgent problem. If the logic is accepted

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:50.279
that we should lower demand for ivory then
it follows that any proposals that come up

00:35:50.279 --> 00:35:55.140
from time to time under CITES to trade in
ivory should be looked at in the light of

00:35:55.140 --> 00:36:03.000
whether or not they're going to encourage
demand or decrease demand. I think technology

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.779
can help save the elephants and other species
and that Google Earth is fantastic tool that

00:36:09.779 --> 00:36:17.329
we're using and other people are using in
the conservation field. I just want to now

00:36:17.329 --> 00:36:24.990
ask all conservation bodies, all concerned
individuals, all NGOs and all governments

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:38.140
to help with the elephants, to prohibit any
more trade in ivory and to try to get the

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:46.420
means together to allow us to coexist with
this magnificent creature. It's a race to

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:53.339
get new Chinese thinking before it's too late.
It's a race that's got to be won and I want

00:36:53.339 --> 00:37:01.640
to leave you with that thought. My last slide
is one that makes me feel happy, it's a huge

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:09.319
bull elephant, he's called Morambo he lived
in Tsavo, he lived out his natural life span

00:37:09.319 --> 00:37:16.420
and it's an incredible tribute to the protection
that he received in a difficult time and to

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:22.849
his own wily ways of keeping out of sight
of the poachers. So finally, I just welcome

00:37:22.849 --> 00:37:28.819
you if you come to Kenya come and visit us,
come see the elephants and I can very much

00:37:28.819 --> 00:37:35.430
recommend my wife's camp unashamedly.
[Laughter]

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:38.020
[Applause]

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:48.415
&gt;&gt; child #1: Why do we need ivory so bad?

00:37:48.415 --> 00:37:49.415
&gt;&gt;male #1: Why do we need ivory so bad?

00:37:49.415 --> 00:37:54.380
&gt;&gt;Iain: We don't really need ivory, it's a
lovely substance and people make pretty ornaments

00:37:54.380 --> 00:38:00.250
out of it but it's not something we need at
all and certainly not if it's killing the

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:06.720
elephant. If people were only taking the ivory
from elephants that die naturally, it wouldn't

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:12.079
matter, but they don't. See, every time you
get a little bit of trade then the poachers

00:38:12.079 --> 00:38:15.910
come and they kill the elephant to make money,
they do it just for money.

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:19.759
&gt;&gt;female #2: So you seem to have real time
tracking data for the elephants, how do you

00:38:19.759 --> 00:38:23.359
make sure this doesn't get into the wrong
hands, like the poachers?

00:38:23.359 --> 00:38:26.180
&gt;&gt;Iain: We don't share it with them.
[Laughter]

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:32.410
&gt;&gt;Iain: We hope we don't share it with them.
We have a public website now which has got,

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:34.180
how long is the delay Jake?

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:36.099
&gt;&gt;Jake: Not telling.
[Laughter]

00:38:36.099 --> 00:38:38.500
&gt;&gt;Iain: Not telling, okay.
[Laughter]

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:45.269
&gt;&gt;Iain: There you go, you see? Pretty secure.
But we also, we share the real time data with

00:38:45.269 --> 00:38:51.640
people who can really make a difference so
our colleagues who are either involved in

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:56.630
conservation right out there in the field,
we now share that a lot. We share it with

00:38:56.630 --> 00:39:02.440
people who can be trusted not to pass it on.
But you're absolutely right, poachers are

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:07.980
now sophisticated enough to get a computer,
to log on and to find out where the elephants

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:11.910
are. Some of you have been aware right from
the beginning.

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:12.910
&gt;&gt;female #2: In Rwanda there was the crisis
with the mountain gorilla and the way that

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:19.540
they tackled that problem, same thing poaching,
they were dying almost to extinction and they

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:26.799
took the poachers with political will and
a lot of conservation energy, they made them

00:39:26.799 --> 00:39:33.059
the people who take tourists to see mountain
gorillas so you kind of turn the incentive

00:39:33.059 --> 00:39:41.930
instead of to track the mountain gorillas
to kill them you track them to take people

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:49.019
to them and make the money worthwhile, more
worthwhile then if they poached. So is that

00:39:49.019 --> 00:39:50.320
something that's being explored?

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:55.960
&gt;&gt;Iain: Yeah I think that you said one thing
you put the finger right on it. The only way

00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:01.079
you're going to save the elephants is having
the political will to do it. And that will

00:40:01.079 --> 00:40:07.050
has got to be everywhere from China to an
elephant range state but the interesting thing

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:12.940
is we went China two years ago and we were
hosted by the China Wildlife Conservation

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:18.760
Association. They took us to the wild Chinese
elephants, I didn't know there were any wild

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:24.900
elephants but there are and they really look
after them so well, as well as they look after

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:31.750
their pandas. So that appreciation was there
and I just don't think that people in China

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:39.180
are dimly aware of what their buying does
in Africa and it's a matter of raising awareness.

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:46.499
So we've got a campaign going on there too
that we're joining other NGOs. But in Africa,

00:40:46.499 --> 00:40:52.319
some kind of benefit must come to people to
enjoy elephants and it can be much more than

00:40:52.319 --> 00:41:00.720
just purely financial gain, it can also be,
you know, Africa is developing so fast and

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:06.509
the educated class is growing so fast and
they feel very interested about their heritage,

00:41:06.509 --> 00:41:12.269
again, they don't see it enough. So I have
to be an optimist and to believe that these

00:41:12.269 --> 00:41:15.539
forces are going to win out over the destructive
ones.

00:41:15.539 --> 00:41:21.519
&gt;&gt;male #2: Have you, since you have these
marvelous tracking collars that send out telemetry

00:41:21.519 --> 00:41:26.589
and you were looking at adding the accelerometers,
have you looked at any technology to add the

00:41:26.589 --> 00:41:30.890
ability to collect vital signs from the elephants
and send that out as well?

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:37.460
&gt;&gt;Iain: I wish but we're working on it. I
mean, really, it's cutting edge stuff. And

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:43.249
the difficulty is that somehow you probably
need to get a probe from the collar in subcutaneously

00:41:43.249 --> 00:41:47.749
into the elephant or somewhere. I did do some
of that works years ago, we actually measured

00:41:47.749 --> 00:41:56.000
the temperature of the blood vessels and this
was back in 1969. We put a thermistor into

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.470
a vein and a thermistor into an artery and
got a 10 degree centigrade drop between the

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:06.940
blood coming into the ear and the blood coming
out when an elephant was walking up hill.

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:12.950
I would love to have heartbeat, respiration,
all sorts of parameters and other people do

00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:18.490
it with other animals and it's probably just
a matter of time before we can do it with

00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:25.440
elephants. We're working with Disney, actually,
on this and we started looking at elephants

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:34.400
reactions to bees because I had a very bright
member of our staff, Lucy King, who was working

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:40.940
out that maybe you could protect crops by
using bees, to make a beehive barrier cause

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:46.150
the elephants are afraid of the bees. So she
tested what they're afraid of and played bee

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:52.190
sounds to the elephants and videoed their
reaction. And the amazing thing was that they

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:59.109
pretty promptly ran away from the sound of
angry bees buzzing. And then she recorded

00:42:59.109 --> 00:43:07.829
with our colleague from Disney, Joe Soltis
the rumbles that the elephants made when they

00:43:07.829 --> 00:43:14.170
were running away from the bees. First, they
run 30 meters silently and then they'd start

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:20.579
talking to each other. Now that rumble, when
that was replayed to elephants against the

00:43:20.579 --> 00:43:26.201
normal rumble, the elephants ran away from
that rumble. It turned out to be an alarm

00:43:26.201 --> 00:43:33.440
rumble and they looked at the sound spectrogram
of the rumble and they found there was a little

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:40.119
second reforment which they suspected might
be the alarm component. So they manipulated

00:43:40.119 --> 00:43:45.210
that on a computer, removed the formant, replayed
the rumble again and the elephants didn't

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:52.099
run away. So they did some really nice work
and now this accelerometry stuff, I think,

00:43:52.099 --> 00:43:58.260
is gonna be a new era and we would love to
look at other things to actually monitor at

00:43:58.260 --> 00:43:59.369
the same time.

00:43:59.369 --> 00:44:04.020
&gt;&gt;male #4: Is the production of artificial
ivory for curtailing the demand for real ivory?

00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:10.799
&gt;&gt;Iain: Not so far but I wouldn't rule it
out. The thing about ivory it's got an internal

00:44:10.799 --> 00:44:15.880
structure. There's a very interesting thing
called schreger lines that give it it's quality

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:23.780
and it's beauty and it polishes very beautiful
and however you carve it you've got this internal

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:30.509
structure. Nobody's been able to replicate
that in a synthetic type of ivory but if you

00:44:30.509 --> 00:44:38.260
could make good enough expensive synthetic
ivory, why not? Actually when plastic first

00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:42.940
came out in the 30's there was a collapse
in the ivory market.

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:48.279
&gt;&gt;female #3: Hello Doctor. So my question
was about the Asian elephants. Are we doing

00:44:48.279 --> 00:44:53.099
anything for them or is the situation not
so bad in Asia?

00:44:53.099 --> 00:44:59.809
&gt;&gt;Iain: It's bad in a different way. The Asian
elephants are principally running out of space,

00:44:59.809 --> 00:45:06.650
particularly in India. But it's very interesting
that the culture in the Indian subcontinent

00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:12.390
is much more elephant-friendly and therefore
the elephants have been tolerated despite

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:21.640
exceedingly high human density. Nevertheless,
there has been a great reduction in the tuskers

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:27.140
and in the Asian elephants only the males
have tusks. So the male populations have been

00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:32.920
hugely distorted. Practically all the old
ones have been killed. Even in places which

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:38.520
are not supposed to be places that poach,
but there is some poaching going on. So it's

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:42.869
a different situation. Say the elephants would
love to be involved, but we're a pretty tiny

00:45:42.869 --> 00:45:49.400
NGO and at the moment we're pretty swamped
with Africa. What we do is one thing we do

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:55.400
is we operate a news service that covers both
continents. We scan all the news that's on

00:45:55.400 --> 00:46:01.450
the web, we replicate it and we send people
emails of that news. We share a lot of stuff

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:07.349
that way and I have very good friends who
study Asian elephants and we make common cause

00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:12.589
when we go to the big CITES meetings where
people debate whether or not there should

00:46:12.589 --> 00:46:18.269
be a limited ivory trade. And the Indians
and our part of Africa were dead against that

00:46:18.269 --> 00:46:19.269
idea.

00:46:19.269 --> 00:46:21.799
&gt;&gt;Charlie: Okay, well thank you all for being
here. My name is Charlie Knowles; I'm the

00:46:21.799 --> 00:46:26.540
founder and president of the Wildlife Conservation
Network. We're based here in Los Altos, and

00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:32.270
we're very fortunate to have Winnie Lam here
in Google who got us here and promoted Iain's

00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:34.589
talks. Thank you.
[Applause]

00:46:34.589 --> 00:46:40.770
&gt;&gt;Charlie: And we'd love to have you more
involved in any way that you wanna be involved.

00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:49.299
So we have a Google docs sign up where you
can send us an email to info at wildnet, w-i-l-d-n-e-t

00:46:49.299 --> 00:46:56.390
dot org. We have some literature on WCN, we
support 20 organizations working in 30 countries

00:46:56.390 --> 00:47:02.190
around the world and there's also information
on "Save the Elephants." And mostly I wanna

00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:08.359
thank Iain and his team for the heroic work
you're doing to save elephants for all of

00:47:08.359 --> 00:47:11.250
us and for our children and grandchildren,
so, thank you Iain.

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:11.369
[Applause]
