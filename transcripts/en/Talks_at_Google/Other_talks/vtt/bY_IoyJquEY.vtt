&gt;&gt;Julie Wiskirchen: Greetings, everybody.
I'm Julie Wiskirchen from the Authors team

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.250
at Google Santa Monica. And today I'm very
excited to welcome Mark Frauenfelder.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.950
Mark is the cofounder of the most popular
blog in the world, boingboing.net, with more

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.240
than five million unique visitors a month.
He's also the editor-in-chief of Make Magazine,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.350
the leading public publication of the do-it-yourself
movement. He was formerly an editor at Wired,

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.310
has appeared on the Martha Stewart Show and
The Colbert Report, and has written for the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.120
New York Times Magazine, Popular Science,
The Hollywood Reporter, CNN, and Business

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.699
2.0.

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.539
And today, Mark's gonna be talking to us about
his book, Made by Hands: Searching for Meaning

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.960
in a Throwaway World. So please join me in
welcoming Mark Frauenfelder.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.520
[applause]

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:51.190
&gt;&gt;Mark Frauenfelder: Hey, everybody. Thanks
a lot for having me.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:01:00.329
I just received in the mail a box of the latest
issue of Make Magazine, hot off the presses.

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:11.149
And so, I think I have about ten copies, so
feel free to take one after the talk. And

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:14.590
I'm sorry I don't have enough for everybody,
but that's all that they sent me.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:22.299
It's a pretty cool issue. We have a big, special
section on the Arduino, which is an easy to

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:28.280
use microcontroller that you can incorporate
it into projects to give them all sorts of

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.350
cool functionality.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:36.329
And then, another thing that you're free to
grab is a little card that gives you information

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:43.670
about Maker Faires, an event that we hold
in San Matteo, New York, and Detroit every

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.830
year. We have about, like at the San Matteo
one, 85,000 people come. It's kind of like

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.479
an engineering fair. People who create things
in their basements and garages and backyards

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.939
and come show it off and give workshops and
things like that. It's really a lot of fun.

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:02.829
So, I'll set these out when I'm done.

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:08.690
I have a lot of material to go over, so I'm
gonna go through these slides pretty quickly.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.100
I think I have about 45 minutes and about
15 minutes for questions. Is that right?

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:21.150
So, I wrote a book called Made by Hand; everybody
has a copy about it. It was kind of my -- the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.781
reason I did it was because I was the editor-in-chief
of Make Magazine and I was into do it yourself,

00:02:26.781 --> 00:02:34.310
but more do it yourself media. I started Boing
Boing as a zine in 1988 and I was into producing

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.960
music and then self-publishing books and things
like that.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.420
But I never really used my hands to make physical
things that much, even though I was surrounded

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.700
by engineers growing up and stuff. But I became
so inspired by going to Maker Faire and seeing

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.450
what these makers were doing, that I decided
to get involved in it and see what the experience

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.820
of becoming a maker was like and how it might
change my life.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:04.240
And so, I decided what I wanted to really
focus on was what's known as modern homesteading,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.911
or urban homesteading. And it's the idea of
producing your own food and making the things

00:03:10.911 --> 00:03:16.910
that use every day. In a way -- it's a way
to start simply and it's a way to get a lot

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.890
of bang for the buck, because if you make
things that you use every day, you get a bigger

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.231
return on your investment as opposed to making
a really cool robot or something, which I

00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:28.110
think is a really fun pursuit.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:36.290
But the impact it has on your daily life might
not be as big as actually carving your own

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.391
cooking utensils out of wood, because you
would use those every day. So, I set out with

00:03:41.391 --> 00:03:45.830
a couple of goals -- to improve my family's
home life by taking an active role in the

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.310
things that feed, clothe, educate, maintain,
and entertain us, and to gain a deeper connection

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.900
and sense of engagement with the things and
systems that keep us alive and happy.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.720
And so, I decided to start out by doing some
research. And I wanted to visit people who

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.260
were already practicing the urban homesteading
lifestyle.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.970
Erik and Kelly were the first people I visited.
They live in Silver Lake and they have a small

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:15.600
house and a small yard. Yet they are able
to produce quite a few of the calories that

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.840
they consume every day. They wrote a book
that I highly recommend called "The Urban

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.101
Homestead". It's a great book that really
helps you get started in learning how to do

00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:29.250
things like gardening and beekeeping, and
raising chickens, preserving food. They also

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.650
have a really great blog called "Home Grown
Evolution", where they continue to explore

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.360
urban homesteading.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:46.350
So I visited -- they have things like raised
bed gardens scattered around their backyard.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.150
Those raised beds are watered using embedded
drip systems that are programmable, so that

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.490
the water is delivered underneath the mulch
in the raised bed gardens, so you don't need

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.180
to water as much. You don't have to worry
about evaporation and you can also -- you

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.811
don't have to be there every single day to
water. If you need to go out of town for a

00:05:05.811 --> 00:05:12.510
while, your system is taken care of. So, there's
the drip system underneath the mulch. They

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:18.030
also made these self-watering containers out
of plastic bins. That's what they look like

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.730
inside and you just fill water into a reservoir
below and then the water wicks up through

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:32.260
the soil and then keeps the stuff – keeps
your vegetable soil wet, or moist enough.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.210
And that really helps because here, in the
Mediterranean climate we have in Southern

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.420
California, if you have potted plants, you
have to water them once a day in the summer,

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.300
if not more than once a day.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.840
They also built this little thing called a
Rocket Stove that lets them use the twigs

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.000
that just fall around their yard to cook things.
So, they'll cook breakfast using this little

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.350
Rocket Stove. It's a cool thing because you
don't have to harvest big pieces of wood to

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:06.020
use it; you can just use twigs and it's very
efficient and remarkably doesn't make much

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.310
smoke or anything and it gets hot really fast.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:16.520
They experimented with solar cooking and they've
tried several designs. You can go see all

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:22.419
the different kinds of designs at solarcooking.org.
In one of the issues of Make Magazine, this

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:28.430
guy did a great project for us using a solar
cooker like this. It's mounted on a turn table

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:35.520
that has a solar cell and a motor. And so
what happens is when the sun hits the solar

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:42.210
panel, the motor slowly turns until the solar
cooker casts a shadow over the solar cell,

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:48.051
so then it stops. And then when the solar
cooker is out of the path again, it's not

00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:53.110
getting a lot of sunlight, the sun hits the
solar panel again and it rotates so it's always

00:06:53.110 --> 00:07:01.050
facing the sun. It's a really great, stupid
feedback system, but behaves in a smart way.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.500
I love that kind of thing.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:09.740
Here's a food dehydrator they made so that
cooler air travels up that inclined plane

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.250
there, and it gets warmer and warmer and moves
faster and faster and then goes into this

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:19.780
little house thing, where there's a lot of
screens laid out horizontally and then you

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:26.020
can put your sliced fruit or vegetables or
whatever it is you want to dry. It's just

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:33.710
a constant stream of warm air going up there
and drying your food quickly. It can be like,

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:39.730
after a day. Then you have nice, dried food;
it's a great way to preserve food, as opposed

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:45.970
to canning, which is a scary thing to do because
you have to worry about botulism and things

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:48.740
like that, if the acidity content isn't high.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:54.639
They've also made good use of the parkways
to grow vegetables. They call this their illegal

00:07:54.639 --> 00:08:00.110
parkway garden. And they grow squash there,
even though you're not really supposed to

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:06.260
use parkways for that. They went ahead and
did it and they've had no trouble doing that

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.260
so far.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:13.010
So these different people, I tried to learn
from them and take tips that I could use for

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:20.780
myself. So, here are their principles of successful
urban farming. Grow only useful things, vegetables,

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:25.620
herbs that could be used for medicine, things
like that. Really pay attention to your region

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:31.430
and where you live. Don't try to grow things
that won't grow well here. Build your soil.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:39.709
That means compost, vermiculture, using worms,
composting. Water deeply and less frequently.

00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:42.419
That embedded drip system helps with that.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:47.860
Work makes work. That's an idea. Don't try
to fight your environment; try to work with

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:54.750
it. If you're constantly doing things that
try to make things happen, it just creates

00:08:54.750 --> 00:09:01.910
more work around that to get what you need
done. An example, let your chickens run around

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:06.420
and they'll eat the bugs and they'll fertilize
the area for you at the same time.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:11.420
Failure is part of the game. That was something
that was really important to me in the book,

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:17.329
that I write about a lot, is not to get discouraged.
You see things like, Home and Garden TV have

00:09:17.329 --> 00:09:22.509
all these people who do things perfectly,
Martha Stewart, it's discouraging to see that

00:09:22.509 --> 00:09:27.149
because you can never measure up to that,
and they can't measure up it either. They

00:09:27.149 --> 00:09:32.439
have millions of failures until they show
you what really works and so, in a way, it's

00:09:32.439 --> 00:09:36.259
encouraging to learn from other people's mistakes
and to learn from your own mistakes and to

00:09:36.259 --> 00:09:40.519
share your mistakes. You learn a lot from
making mistakes, actually.

00:09:40.519 --> 00:09:44.759
And pay attention and keep notes, which is
what I tried to do when I met these folks.

00:09:44.759 --> 00:09:50.130
The energy garden. Julian and Celine live
in – well they live in London now, but when

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:54.790
they were living in Sebastopol, they're the
founders of The Post Carbon Institute. It

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:59.139
was this organization that was founded on
the idea that we're gonna run out of liquid

00:09:59.139 --> 00:10:04.899
fuels in the coming decades and so, we need
to figure out ways to relocalize everything

00:10:04.899 --> 00:10:10.410
so that we aren't dependent on this free,
cheap -- our very cheap energy that we've

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:14.389
had that has propelled us through the Industrial
Revolution.

00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:21.069
So they created, basically, a big, experimental
garden in their house, and I think their house

00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:28.680
is about a third of an acre of land. So they
had self-watering containers that would distribute

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:35.850
water to different pots around the place;
it was kind of an interesting system.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:42.680
This is just a look at what their backyard
looks like. They grew a huge variety of different

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:53.300
things; lots of different beans and seeds
and legumes, maize, grains they grew. They

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:59.269
wanted to try their own wheat, root vegetables,
and they got an incredible amount of produce

00:10:59.269 --> 00:11:04.190
for just a small piece of property and here,
there are chickens that are running around.

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:10.970
They put everything into an equation to see
how much return they would get in terms of

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:15.879
how many calories they would get out of something;
the ratio of how many calories they would

00:11:15.879 --> 00:11:25.920
get out over how many calories they had to
put in. So, chickens, you give them 50 calories

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:33.410
a day of food that people really can't eat,
but they would produce – oh no – you give

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:38.129
them 100 calories – they'll produce 50 calories
of useful energy. So, that's a pretty good

00:11:38.129 --> 00:11:39.790
efficiency, 50 percent efficient.

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:46.449
Just a couple of looks. They actually had
so much produce that they started this thing

00:11:46.449 --> 00:11:50.910
called the You Pick System, where they would
take the -- let people come to their property

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:55.389
and just pick whatever they wanted from the
neighborhood and then the people would weigh

00:11:55.389 --> 00:12:02.730
it, or pay by the bunch and just put money
in the little box on the front porch. It was

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:08.910
a way to connect the community together and
sell their excess produce because they had

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:11.239
more than they needed.

00:12:11.239 --> 00:12:17.629
They experimented a lot with tools because
their idea is in the post carbon world,we're

00:12:17.629 --> 00:12:24.000
going to have to go back to using animal power,
or human power, or solar power -- different

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.440
ways of non-liquid fuel energy. And so they
were experimenting with things, like making

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:36.319
cider presses. You can see they have these
drywall screws and a piece of -- this round

00:12:36.319 --> 00:12:39.189
piece of wood and you just turn it and it'll
tear the apples up.

00:12:39.189 --> 00:12:44.110
They experimented with this kind of helical
windmill. You can see Julian looks discouraged.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:50.920
They learned -- one thing they learned was
it's really hard to go back to these kinds

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:59.170
of methods of producing food and growing crops
by using hand tools.

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:04.759
We've become so dependent on liquid fuel.
It's like this wonderful precious resource,

00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:10.360
and we haven't always lived like that. It's
just been a very tiny period of time where

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:15.149
people have been able to have this free ride,
and so, they think the time is now to try

00:13:15.149 --> 00:13:20.230
to come up with ways that really work.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:24.110
There's a concern of being injured using these
tools. Julian said it's really easy to throw

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:29.990
out your back tilling soil and things like
that with these scary looking tools they've

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.990
come up with.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:37.259
Another problem that they have to deal with,
and that we deal with here, too, is gophers.

00:13:37.259 --> 00:13:42.240
That spike there, that scary looking spike,
battery-powered, you put it in the ground

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:49.420
and it emits a shrill buzz every couple of
minutes, but the problem with that was it

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:54.339
wasn't waterproof and so it would stop working
after a couple of weeks. And the gophers got

00:13:54.339 --> 00:14:00.519
into the melons and the plastic bag that Julian
had, holding up there, had instructions for

00:14:00.519 --> 00:14:05.999
the embedded drip system and the gophers actually
got in there because they wanted to – I

00:14:05.999 --> 00:14:10.290
guess they wanted to taste the user manual
or something.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:15.170
And so they thought, "What about making our
own liquid fuel? Maybe that would be something

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:20.801
we could do by squeezing canola seeds." So,
they had this hand press to try to do it,

00:14:20.801 --> 00:14:27.100
but you just can't, it's really hard to extract.
Here's what canola seeds look like. They're

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:35.670
really tiny and really hard. And so, people
think that these kind of biofuels are an easy

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:41.661
solution. They're really incredibly difficult
and might not be a way to do it if you're

00:14:41.661 --> 00:14:44.850
looking for a local life solution.

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:52.660
One thing they did have pretty good luck with
was pressing sorghum and extracting sugar

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:58.980
from sorghum and then converting that into
ethanol. So, they did an experiment. They

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:10.709
had about 250 pounds of sorghum. They ended
up getting ten gallons of juice and so, basically,

00:15:10.709 --> 00:15:21.989
from their equations, one acre of sorghum
equals 20 gallons of pure ethanol, which means

00:15:21.989 --> 00:15:29.329
fuel is really precious. We've been getting
it so cheaply now, an acre for 20 gallons

00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:36.249
of alcohol that's not even as – not nearly
as much energy as gasoline. They tried making

00:15:36.249 --> 00:15:39.170
stills for energy.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:42.879
So, what I learned from them is try lots of
little things. Experiment a lot before you

00:15:42.879 --> 00:15:49.660
find out what works for you. One gallon of
gasoline equals five weeks of hard human labor.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:54.579
You shouldn't hate liquid fuel. You should
treat it as something precious. Life in a

00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:58.579
post carbon-world isn't going to be easy.
And gophers suck.

00:15:58.579 --> 00:16:01.489
[laughter]

00:16:01.489 --> 00:16:09.250
So the third group that I visited was back
here in LA, Eric and Julia. They run a blog

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:17.359
called Ramshackle Solid, and they take their
Ramshackle Solid philosophy to heart, where

00:16:17.359 --> 00:16:22.309
they live in LA. It's on the border between
Pasadena and LA. Their blog is excellent.

00:16:22.309 --> 00:16:28.970
These are all the subjects of the different
things that they explore. This is just a look

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:34.290
at some of their property. Eric got a mulcher
at a garage sale, so he's just basically been

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:38.480
grinding up everything into mulch all over
the place. They have this little tent they

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:43.329
built that they practically live in year round.
They take all their meals there, and you can

00:16:43.329 --> 00:16:48.879
lift up the sides, depending on the weather
conditions; a little place to hang out.

00:16:48.879 --> 00:16:57.410
These are bean poles made out of rebar. This
is a shack that -- I shared pictures of this

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:01.809
shack from West Virginia that an architect
designed. I shared these with Eric and he

00:17:01.809 --> 00:17:06.409
said, "This would be great for me to build
a little shack on my property." So, he took

00:17:06.409 --> 00:17:12.399
a look at this and built something similar
to it on his property. And this is what it

00:17:12.399 --> 00:17:17.899
looks like inside; it's really nice. And so,
I thought this was interesting, his justification

00:17:17.899 --> 00:17:18.899
for making it.

00:17:18.899 --> 00:17:19.899
[reads]

00:17:19.899 --> 00:17:22.730
"At first we thought about renting a studio,
but at a cost of at least 500 dollars a month

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:27.569
here in LA, that didn't make sense. We were
able to build this shack style studio for

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:32.110
about half the annual cost of renting, plus
about ten full days of labor spread over two

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:34.850
months for me and a friend."

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:40.070
It's a great place to hang out. And they really
like to reuse things, so here's his desk.

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:45.711
It's just a piece of wood that he found and
just nailed it to the wall. They like to do

00:17:45.711 --> 00:17:53.159
things like, as much as possible, with the
materials they can find at hand, make things

00:17:53.159 --> 00:17:54.159
that they need.

00:17:54.159 --> 00:17:58.850
So this is what he calls a "compostable child
safety lock". And I guess the idea is to tie

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:04.190
it up so it's too complicated for the kid
to figure out how to open it. But it's so

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:09.659
much more delightful to see that than something
like that, that you would buy in a store.

00:18:09.659 --> 00:18:14.039
So, what I learned from them. Keep it simple.
Small victories add up. If you're not having

00:18:14.039 --> 00:18:20.309
fun, you're doing it wrong. That was -- it
was a great antidote to go visit Eric and

00:18:20.309 --> 00:18:27.269
Julia, after Celine and Julian, who are really
nice people, but their kind of negative peak

00:18:27.269 --> 00:18:34.350
oil viewpoint was a bummer and these guys
had a really good, happy attitude about it.

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:38.909
So back in my -- after doing this research
for a while, I went back to my house. This

00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:44.600
was when we lived in Tarzana. And I thought,
"I will kill my lawn and cover it with mulch

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:53.240
and then use it as an orchard and a garden."
So, I took a one day-class on lawn-killing

00:18:53.240 --> 00:19:00.460
from the Theodore Payne foundation and ordered
some mulch. And that's what 15 cubic yards

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:07.870
of mulch looks like. And after -- here it
was in front of our house and I left it there

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:13.179
for a couple of days and people started pilfering
from it, so I had to bring it into the house.

00:19:13.179 --> 00:19:18.200
So that's what the lawn looked like before.
And first, sprinkled the grass with gypsum

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:24.110
to accelerate the process. And then you take
 -- what you also do is you soak the lawn

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:28.889
really well, because what you wanna do is
smother the lawn and have all the seeds germinate,

00:19:28.889 --> 00:19:34.210
the weeds and the grass seeds and everything.
And then, and then pour vinegar on it to help

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:38.789
kill everything and then cover it all up with
cardboard. And so that those seeds that do

00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:43.340
end up germinating and weren't killed by the
vinegar will germinate, but they won't get

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:44.950
any sunlight and they'll die.

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:50.162
So we covered, we had been saving cardboard
boxes and newspapers for a long time and we

00:19:50.162 --> 00:19:54.950
just covered everything up and then spread
a layer of mulch on top of it. And then, that

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:58.409
was the finished result.

00:19:58.409 --> 00:20:04.779
So then, the next step is growing food. And
so, I started with these little seed starters

00:20:04.779 --> 00:20:10.330
and an example of me not knowing what I'm
doing, I put them under fluorescent lights,

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:17.740
but there wasn't enough light and so the plants
were starved for sun, for light. And so, they

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:22.740
grew these really long, spindly stems to try
to get as close to the light as possible.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.510
And the effect is that it's like a garden
hose, it gets kinked; the things just fall

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:32.539
over and die and you have these light-starved
plants that tried their best to reach the

00:20:32.539 --> 00:20:36.120
source of illumination, but just couldn't
make it.

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.929
One thing that I have not done, but I would
love to try out, is this guy Mikey Sklar,

00:20:39.929 --> 00:20:45.200
who's a Make contributor and he lives in Truth
or Consequences, New Mexico, and is a great

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:51.960
experimenter, has these little LED seed starters
that are very low voltage, consume low power,

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:59.139
and they're mostly red with a little bit of
blue. And what he found is that it's more

00:20:59.139 --> 00:21:06.179
efficient if you feed your plants just a certain
spectrum of light. And here's an example of

00:21:06.179 --> 00:21:11.570
some plants that he's grown using his one-Watt
LED seed starter, and you can see they're

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:17.370
a lot more robust than the ones that I had.
Nevertheless, we took the ones that didn't

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:21.039
die and here's my daughter, and we planted
them in the garden.

00:21:21.039 --> 00:21:26.549
And radishes -- I actually just planted those
directly from seed in the garden, but we started

00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:31.929
getting a decent amount of produce and it
was really fun. Every week, we would take

00:21:31.929 --> 00:21:39.320
a picture of what we harvested. And then we
decided a way to keep it, because you'd get

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:44.179
a whole bunch in the summer and you can't
eat it all, so you wanna stretch it as far

00:21:44.179 --> 00:21:51.049
into the fall and winter as you can. So, we
tried drying the food.

00:21:51.049 --> 00:21:56.080
This is a little side trip that I wanted to
tell you about. In 2003, my family and I moved

00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:03.029
to an island in the South Pacific called Rarotonga.
And our plan was to stay there for a year

00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:10.190
and we were only there for five months. But
I won't get into that. We had coconuts that

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:15.670
were growing in our yard and it was -- they
would fall out of the tree and hit the ground

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:22.331
and I wanted to get the coconut juice and
the pulp out of it and I wasn't really sure

00:22:22.331 --> 00:22:28.110
what to do. So, I was trying rocks or bashing
with a hammer or something, and the -- our

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:36.679
landlady said, "Well, you need a coconut scraping
bench to do that, to extract the meat out

00:22:36.679 --> 00:22:41.001
of the coconut." And I said, "Well how do
you get one?" She said, "Well, you have to

00:22:41.001 --> 00:22:46.919
go to the junkyard and get a leaf spring from
a car, and then you can take it to this guy

00:22:46.919 --> 00:22:52.120
who will forge it and serrate the ends and
you can take that to a carpenter, and he will

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:57.639
build it into a little, mount it onto a bench,
or you can just borrow mine." And I said,

00:22:57.639 --> 00:23:02.950
"All right, well I'll borrow yours -- that
sounds like a good deal." So, I also learned

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:07.350
how to husk the outer shell of the coconut
and crack it with a machete and everything.

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:11.730
And so we started like processing all these
coconuts and it was really a lot of fun to

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:17.440
do that every day. And we started making coconut
pancakes, coconut scones, coconut creme for

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:25.850
the fish we bought and that, in a way, got
me really interested in this kind of lifestyle

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:31.919
of just slowing down and appreciating having
a more active role in your food was during

00:23:31.919 --> 00:23:32.919
this coconut stuff.

00:23:32.919 --> 00:23:42.000
And so when we came back, we wanted to do
that a little bit more in Los Angeles. And

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:49.960
so, I started really getting into drying tomatoes
and peppers and figs. And this was a way that

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:56.011
I learned to dry persimmons. It's a Japanese
way. You cut the stems so it's like a little

00:23:56.011 --> 00:24:00.759
T-shape, and tie a string and then just hang
them from a tree and when they dry, they're

00:24:00.759 --> 00:24:07.110
really good. We had this, this fig tree in
Tarzana, I mean a persimmon tree, and the

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:11.870
persimmons, I couldn't stand them because
when they're hard, they just have a horrible

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:18.629
alum, your mouth puckers; they're inedible.
Or, you can let them get soft, like a custard,

00:24:18.629 --> 00:24:22.289
but it's kind of goopy. And so what you do,
is you just wait until they're bright red

00:24:22.289 --> 00:24:27.710
and then peel the skin off and let them dry,
and then it's really great. Somehow, some

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:31.020
transformation occurs and they're very sweet;
it's like candy.

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:40.150
I also started making sauerkraut. And it's
ridiculously simple. The recipe isn't really

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:46.580
even a recipe; the only ingredients are cabbage
and salt, nothing else. You just chop the

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:54.460
cabbage up, sprinkle salt into it, and then
you put it into a crock and cover it up and

00:24:54.460 --> 00:25:00.299
weigh it down because it's an anaerobic process;
you want the cabbage to be under the surface

00:25:00.299 --> 00:25:07.009
of the liquid to do its thing. And then you
get this great tasting, fermented, probiotic

00:25:07.009 --> 00:25:13.740
sauerkraut that costs a fraction of what you
would pay for raw sauerkraut at Whole Foods.

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:17.970
It's ridiculously cheap and very simple to
make. In fact, I started using this thing

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:24.250
called a Pickelmeister that uses a little
air trap to keep mold from getting into it

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:29.289
and it's even easier and quicker with this
thing. And if you buy cabbage, like at a farmers

00:25:29.289 --> 00:25:37.559
market for a dollar a head or so, you can
make cabbage for 50 cents for a quart, or

00:25:37.559 --> 00:25:41.870
less, as opposed to seven dollars a quart
at Whole Foods. And the amount of effort you

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:44.500
put into it is almost nothing.

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:50.549
And the same with yogurt. I started making
yogurt and once you start making it, you never

00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:54.039
wanna go back to getting the store bought
stuff. You just take a little bit of yogurt

00:25:54.039 --> 00:25:58.759
from your last batch and put it into the new
batch you're making and it's automatic. The

00:25:58.759 --> 00:26:05.461
only ingredient with yogurt is milk; you don't
need anything else. We started raising chickens,

00:26:05.461 --> 00:26:10.539
too, which was really a lot of fun. It was
one of the highlights of this whole experience

00:26:10.539 --> 00:26:17.230
for me. I actually ordered chickens, mail
order, from a place called mypetchicken.com.

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:18.290
[laughter]

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:23.850
And they sent us, they sent us six, little
Plymouth Barred Rock chicks. And then this

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:30.070
was an old, weird shed that was in my backyard
that we have been using to store junk, and

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:34.909
I thought this -- before we lived there, it
was a rabbit hutch. The previous owner had

00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:38.840
used it for rabbits, I think, or a couple
of previous owners ago. It had fallen into

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.940
pretty bad disrepair. That's what it looked
like inside.

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:48.090
So, I went to work at it and bought materials
and the roof was falling apart and somebody

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:53.470
had put this piece of wood to try to patch
it together. So, I just slowly attacked it

00:26:53.470 --> 00:27:02.519
and used part of a torn down fence to replace
the wire that was below the chicken wire,

00:27:02.519 --> 00:27:06.651
and just slowly got to it. And finally, had
this pretty nice looking place for the chickens

00:27:06.651 --> 00:27:07.651
to live.

00:27:07.651 --> 00:27:13.120
And here, by the time I was done, the chickens
had been living in a big box. They were ready

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:17.889
to move in. And my kids couldn't tell the
difference between the chickens. They looked

00:27:17.889 --> 00:27:23.799
pretty identical, so we had these little colored
tie straps and so we put them around the chickens'

00:27:23.799 --> 00:27:28.220
feet so we could tell the difference between
which chicken was which, and it really helped.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:33.450
Then you could – I'd start identifying the
personality differences between the chickens.

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:38.620
And then we had this little color-coded guide
that we tacked to the inside of the coop to

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:43.999
tell which chicken was which. So, here are
the benefits of keeping chickens. They're

00:27:43.999 --> 00:27:46.399
great fertilizer.

00:27:46.399 --> 00:27:53.230
This is-- can you guys see that OK? It looks
kind of dark. The chickens live in a coop

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:59.179
over wire, and so they poop onto burlap bags
that my friend Terry lays underneath the coop.

00:27:59.179 --> 00:28:04.970
And when they get really filled with chicken
manure, she takes those and wraps the burlap

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:10.580
bag around the citrus trees that are growing
in pots on her deck. And then you just water

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:15.710
them and the poop just goes into the soil
in the pot, and it's a great way to fertilize

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:22.210
the citrus trees. They love it. And the chickens
are great at getting rid of pests.

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:26.720
We let our chickens just run around in our
house in Tarzana because it was all fenced

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:31.380
off. They took care of -- we had tons of black
widows. One day, I found nine black widows

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:37.499
on our property and my wife, when she found
out about that, she called some guy to come

00:28:37.499 --> 00:28:43.559
every couple of months to spray, and here's
this guy spraying when we have kids running

00:28:43.559 --> 00:28:46.340
around. And so, when we got the chickens,
we cancelled the spray and thought, "Well,

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:50.070
we'll just have to live with the black widows,
but I don't want the chickens eating grass

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:54.820
that has been sprayed with bug killer." But
the chickens actually ate all the black widows

00:28:54.820 --> 00:29:01.620
and all the bugs. I never saw bugs anymore.
It was great. And they're really good at recycling

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:07.350
outputs. So, if we had, I think this is pieces
of pancake or waffle, any kind of food you

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:13.679
could throw out there and they would just
devour it. Once, we had like--this is kind

00:29:13.679 --> 00:29:17.289
of gross--but once, we had a big turkey leg
and nobody wanted it anymore, so I threw it

00:29:17.289 --> 00:29:22.870
into the thing and I came back two hours later
and it was such a clean looking bone. It was

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:26.440
like a cartoon bone or something. I mean,
they just completely picked at, they're very

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.409
efficient at it. They love projects like that.

00:29:28.409 --> 00:29:30.499
[laughter]

00:29:30.499 --> 00:29:35.830
And then the eggs are the obvious benefit
that you don't think about. And it was funny,

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:42.480
our neighbor kids, when the eggs first started
coming out, my kids, my friends, my kids'

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:48.210
friends would come over and say, "Wow, these
are eggs. I mean, what do you do with them?"

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:52.590
And we're like, "Well, we eat them." "You
can eat these eggs?" Because they just were

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:56.629
completely surprised. And they're great entertainment.
They were just really kind of clownish and

00:29:56.629 --> 00:30:02.720
funny, yet dignified at the same time. I really
liked them. Here's a little video of the first

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:11.370
couple of eggs that a chicken lays, sometimes
they don't have a shell. They just have that.

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:16.260
I just shot a video because it was so weird.
It was really freaky, those first few eggs

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:19.639
that they lay. Like the first pancake in a
batch is bad, I guess.

00:30:19.639 --> 00:30:21.299
[laughter]

00:30:21.299 --> 00:30:27.940
So, another thing I wanted to do was make
my own music and by doing that, not just like

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:34.149
play music, but to actually make the instruments,
too. And so, this was a piece of an old kitchen

00:30:34.149 --> 00:30:42.870
table that I took and I bought some hardware
and I decided to start up by using match sticks

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:43.870
for frets.

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:53.909
At first, I was gonna use a Tinker Toy to
hold the pick up. And I tuned this little

00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:59.380
thing like a hammer dulcimer and it had a
pretty good sound. And then I wanted to move

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:04.409
on to making a genuine cigar box guitar. These
have been around for over a hundred years

00:31:04.409 --> 00:31:09.269
and Helen Wolfe got started on one and Jimi
Hendrix got started on a cigar box guitar.

00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:13.830
And I bought fret wire. I was always afraid
frets would be so hard to install, but they're

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:18.230
really easy actually because of the -- see,
there's the cross section of the fret. You

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:25.330
just tap them in into the little slots that
you cut. File them down, I used a pencil for

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:34.119
the bridge, and that's a cabinet hinge to
hold the strings. And they're really fun to

00:31:34.119 --> 00:31:39.080
make. I make a lot of them and I give them
away as gifts. I can make a simple one now

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:48.771
in a few hours. [Pause] And this is a little
cigar box ukulele that I made, and a slide

00:31:48.771 --> 00:31:50.830
out of a bottle. That's got a nice sound.

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:58.990
And I started making amplifiers for them,
too, using an LM 386 chip. It's a little off-amp

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:03.470
chip that costs about a dollar and then you
just put a couple of capacitors and a resistor

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:08.620
on it and you have a pretty good sounding
amp. Here, at Maker Faire, I found a guy who

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:14.590
made a cigar box violin. This guy, this was
like, he said he tore a piece off of a bar

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:18.730
in San Francisco and made some kind of a weird
instrument out of it with his own pick up

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:27.749
that he designed and wound. Here's a one-string
instrument, unnamable instrument. There's

00:32:27.749 --> 00:32:33.029
a great place online called Cigar Box Nation,
where all the cigar box guitar-making aficionados

00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:37.119
go to share the different designs and plans
they have for cigars, cigar boxes.

00:32:37.119 --> 00:32:38.119
[clang clang clang]

00:32:38.119 --> 00:32:40.789
Here's an example of a one-string.

00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:43.830
[guitar music]

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:49.909
[guitar music and singing]

00:32:49.909 --> 00:33:00.549
"I'm a sidewinder baby
Lookin for you"

00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:03.259
OK, here's two strings.

00:33:03.259 --> 00:33:12.990
"Hey, it's Shane. Here's the new Chugger two-string
cigar box guitar. Each one signed and dated.

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:16.419
Here we go."

00:33:16.419 --> 00:33:19.860
[plays rock music]

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:24.429
[plays fast guitar music]

00:33:24.429 --> 00:33:27.539
All right. And here's three strings.

00:33:27.539 --> 00:33:32.179
[slow guitar music plays]

00:33:32.179 --> 00:33:50.760
"Good morning judge, what might be my fine?
Good morning judge, what might be my fine?

00:33:50.760 --> 00:34:00.049
Good morning judge, what might be my fine?"

00:34:00.049 --> 00:34:10.610
All right. So, you get the idea that simple
instruments, a diddley bow, like that one-string

00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:15.090
instrument, you can make in probably 15 minutes.

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:19.841
And that two-string Chugger, you can, there's
no frets on it or anything, you can make it

00:34:19.841 --> 00:34:25.610
in 45 minutes, but they have a cool sound.
It's a unique sound and so, that's been one

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:28.310
of my favorite things is making instruments
like that.

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:37.070
Another thing I wanted to do was add a temperature
control to my espresso maker. This is a Rancilio

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:42.210
SILVIA espresso maker; they cost about 500
to 600 dollars. They're really great espresso

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:47.960
machines. The weak – the Achilles heel of
them is that they use the bi-metallic thermostat

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:54.801
that's just an on/off thermostat and so, you
can have a temperature swing of like, 40 degrees

00:34:54.801 --> 00:35:01.750
Fahrenheit when you make – when you pull
a shot of espresso and that's completely unacceptable.

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:05.980
You really should lock it down a lot tighter
than that and so, people have come up with

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:10.000
these things called temperature surfing, where
they wait 'til the light goes off, they pour

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.180
some water, they listen for the hiss to stop,
that means it stopped boiling. You continue

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:18.400
to let the water pour off for a while, then
you pack -- put the coffee on. But the other

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:25.140
way is that you can use a PID temperature
controller on it-- proportional integral derivative

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:31.800
temperature controller, that does a lot -- is
a much more sophisticated way of controlling

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:40.030
it. And people are actually now selling kits
that you can attach and they come with a relay

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:41.260
to turn the boiler off and on.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:50.170
So, I took my espresso maker apart, took the
connectors off the bi-metallic thermostat

00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:57.511
and that's what it looks like now. That unit
there, on the left, is the temperature controller

00:35:57.511 --> 00:36:01.830
and you can use little push buttons to set
the exact temperature you want the water to

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:07.050
be. And that's actually the outside of the
boiler; the water temperature is lower than

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:12.440
that. That would not be good coffee like that.
And so anyway, it's much better coffee. I've

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:16.950
locked that down; the temperature variation
is like, under one degree now as opposed to

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:18.210
40 degrees.

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:22.290
And then another thing I wanted to do was
make a bottomless portafilter. So this is

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:26.740
 -- the reason you want to do that is you
can like, see the coffee coming out better

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:33.170
and you can judge if you've done everything
right like -- use the right kind of grind,

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:41.180
pack the coffee properly, and so I just dremmeled
it to the bits and polished it off and that's

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:47.380
what it looks like now. And here's what it
looks like using bottomless portafilter. You

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:50.930
can see lots of pictures like this at espressoporn.blogspot.com.

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:54.130
[laughter]

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:59.980
And so, how am I doing for time? Do I have
a few more minutes? OK, OK. I'll go really

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:00.980
quickly.

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:06.510
Backwards beekeeping. There's a club here
in Los Angeles that does a natural beekeeping

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:11.500
method where there's no chemicals whatsoever
and they follow this beekeeper from Santa

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:16.650
Cruz, who was an interesting fellow. "I have
established mystic contact with the spiritual

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:22.990
core of apiculture, and now anything is possible."
This is a little light fixture that was about

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:28.860
this big and all of our lights up on our second
floor of my house were dark. And so I unscrewed

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:34.260
one and it was filled with dead bees, every
single one of them. And so, the bee club,

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:42.010
the leader of the bee club and I, got the
bees out and put them into my hive. So, they

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:46.801
were taken out. That's what we typically do,
is we rescue bees. People call and say, "I

00:37:46.801 --> 00:37:52.400
have a bee invasion." And we'll take those
bees and give them to people who want to put

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:56.160
them into hives. People decorate their hives.

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.250
[Pause]

00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:05.970
I'll skip that video. This is the only place
in Los Angeles that remains that you can buy

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:11.230
honey bee supplies, Los Angeles Honey Company.
There used to be tons because the valley was

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:15.840
in lots of orchards and stuff, but all of
LA—it's so weird-- there's just one bee

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:21.400
place. And those are some of my frames that
are loaded with honey that I harvested this

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:26.340
summer. That's what the honeycomb looks like.
You crush it up. This is one way of doing

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:33.530
it. Some people do a centrifugal extraction,
but we just crushed it up and then built a

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:37.641
filtering system out of these plastic buckets
and then the honey drips out, and then you

00:38:37.641 --> 00:38:43.080
get this really great honey that's very tasty.
And you also get wax, too. And I make things,

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:46.450
lip balm or candles.

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:52.310
Whittling, I've really got in to making -- this
branch that fell off of a tree, I started

00:38:52.310 --> 00:39:00.850
making spoons and different implements out
of it; carved, carved them.

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:01.850
OK, I'm almost at the end.

00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:06.260
So kids are -- if you have kids, this kind
of life, kids love it. They have so much fun

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:14.130
making things. My daughter did some embroidery.
So we had lots of projects, even collecting

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:19.590
sea glasses, making a DIY activity. Making
their own bread.

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:26.720
So this is what I learned at the end. Homesteading
happiness in three steps. Make more of your

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:34.780
own stuff. I made a pillow there. They're
just examples of things that we made around

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:39.820
the house. Make your living- and work-spaces
as personal as possible. These are the people

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:44.070
that I visited while I wrote the book and
just asked to take pictures of their, their

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:45.070
workspaces.

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:50.780
[Pause]

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:55.580
That guy's a magician, a magic prop maker
in LA.

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:58.260
[Pause]

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:01.120
And then, follow Bruce Sterling's guide to
better living. Bruce Sterling is a science

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:05.910
fiction writer and a futurist. And here's
Bruce Sterling's guide. Divide your current

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:12.200
possessions into four major categories: beautiful
things, emotionally important things, tools,

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:17.880
devices, and appliances that efficiently perform
a useful function, everything else. Enjoy

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:24.570
using the things in one through three. Get
rid of everything in category number four.

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:26.531
And that's it. Thanks a lot.

00:40:26.531 --> 00:40:27.730
[applause]

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:34.400
Do we have any time for questions?

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.650
&gt;&gt;Julie Wiskirchen: Yeah, we've got time for
questions. We'll just wait for the microphone

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:46.200
to come to you. Raise your hand.

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.770
[Pause]

00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:55.590
&gt;&gt;Male audience #1: It seems like doing all
of these things, that it looks like a lot

00:40:55.590 --> 00:41:03.110
of fun, but it would be like, a lot of time
and I imagine, it sounds like your job, writing

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:06.041
and things like that is a big -- it gives
you an opportunity to explore this.

00:41:06.041 --> 00:41:13.250
How feasible do you think doing this sort
of thing is for people who work a normal 40

00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:20.470
to 50, 60 hour work week? And then to be able
to come home and do these things, and I liked

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:25.790
how you said a lot of it was for fun. How
consuming of a hobby is it? Or would it be?

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:29.550
&gt;&gt;Mark Frauenfelder: It would be very time
consuming and there are times when I'm really

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:36.970
busy, too, where I don't have time to really
get into something, but really everybody has

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:42.550
15 minutes a day. And you could probably carve
out even more if you are really dedicated.

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:50.260
So, making sauerkraut, you could do the whole
thing and get it all ready to store away for

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:53.700
a month to do its fermentation thing; it might
take you a half an hour.

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:56.660
Making yogurt doesn't take long.

00:41:56.660 --> 00:42:02.060
Sometimes, when I have a conference call,
a lot of times I will just put on the phones

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:07.120
to do the call and just whittle a spoon while
I'm on the call because it's kind of like

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:11.050
knitting, where you can have a conversation
and it doesn't interfere with your knitting

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:12.410
or with your conversation.

00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:16.950
And for a lot of people, I think, especially
people like me who are probably slightly ADDish,

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:21.230
having something to do with my hands while
I talk helps me concentrate actually.

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:26.540
So I think even gardening, there are people
who have this 15 minute a day rule, where

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:31.660
they only garden for 15 minutes, but they
always garden at least 15 minutes, every single

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:35.350
day. And then, they don't have to do anything
more than that. And it's a good way to just

00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:40.300
get out and do that and it takes -- that 15
minutes is pretty valuable and memorable compared

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:44.160
to the flow of your work throughout the rest
of the day.

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.080
Pretty beneficial, I think.

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:51.910
&gt;&gt;Male audience #2: And the correlation to
that, what about space? Because it seems like

00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:57.770
some of these projects that you've talked
about require a lot of space and some of us

00:42:57.770 --> 00:42:59.250
live in apartments, or condos –

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:00.250
&gt;&gt;Mark Frauenfelder: Yeah.

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:01.250
&gt;&gt;Male audience #2: that don't have yards.

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:02.250
&gt;&gt;Mark Frauenfelder: Yeah.

00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:04.590
&gt;&gt;Male audience #2: What advice could you
provide for there?

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:10.270
&gt;&gt;Mark Frauenfelder: Just being creative and
making do. There are members of the bee club

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:15.380
who don't have – don't – that live in
apartments and so--

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:17.940
[laughter]

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:22.200
they come up with ways to do it. Putting it
on the roof of their apartment, if the landlord

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:28.890
says it's OK. Some people in Brooklyn keep
bees on their balcony. So there are ways to

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:29.890
do it.

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:35.280
Or if you wanna garden, you could do an herb
garden on your windowsill. And there are lots

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:40.900
of different work, if you have tools and things,
you can have just a tiny desk and have a small

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:47.500
workspace for smaller projects. It just depends.

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:51.470
That's again kind of "don't fight your environment"
thing. Don't try to do things that don't work

00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:57.251
with what your environment and your situation,
or else what is the point in doing it?

00:43:57.251 --> 00:44:03.010
&gt;&gt;Male audience #3: Can you tell us about
some of your most interesting failures?

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:12.130
&gt;&gt;Mark Frauenfelder: Let's see. Well, the
chickens ended up being a failure. I don't

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:19.060
know how interesting it was, but the problem
was that when we lived in Tarzana, the chickens

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:22.920
had a great time. It was fenced off. We didn't
 – never had to worry about predators or

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:30.440
anything, but when we moved to Studio City,
it was fenced off, but we were up in the hills

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:37.530
and the predator situation is really bad.
And coyotes and I write about this in the

00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:43.731
book, coyotes and bobcats and raccoons and
skunks just started picking off the chickens

00:44:43.731 --> 00:44:45.110
one by one.

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:49.720
And I kept on trying to do different things,
better enclosures, this, that, but they were

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:56.050
just -- if you build a fence and cover it
up, they will dig under. The predators, the

00:44:56.050 --> 00:45:01.690
chickens are like Big Macs on two legs running
around and they're just very tempting. And

00:45:01.690 --> 00:45:08.820
so, that was a failure for sure.

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:13.220
And let's see. Other things like, one thing
once when I was making a cigar box guitar,

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:17.180
I accidentally cut a fret in the wrong spot
and I thought, "I'm gonna have to throw away

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:22.030
this whole neck that I've made." But instead,
I just ground up -- I had some sawdust and

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:28.850
glue and filled in the cut, the misplaced
slot, and it still looked bad. So then, I

00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:31.890
thought, "Well, I'll just paint the whole
thing a color." And I painted it light green

00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:36.540
and it ended up being like a cool thing and
now, I typically paint all my necks a color,

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:41.490
as my thing. That's my thing is to have colored
necks. And if I hadn't have failed in that

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:44.500
way, I probably never would have painted the
necks that way.

00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:50.190
So sometimes they lead to places you wouldn't
have taken yourself intentionally, in a good

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:51.190
way.

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:55.460
&gt;&gt;Male audience #3: So, that dovetails in
with the other question I have, which is when

00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:59.740
you're building a cigar box guitar, how the
hell do you brace the neck on there? Do you

00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:05.070
not just rip the box apart when you put the
tension on from the strings?

00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:11.630
&gt;&gt;Mark Frauenfelder: Oh, yeah. What I do is
I just open the lid of the cigar, so here's

00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:20.020
the box and here's the lid. I open the lid
and then I just lay the stick on it and then

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:24.731
close it and then, let's see. I mean--

00:46:24.731 --> 00:46:26.330
&gt;&gt;Male audience #3: I see the neck goes all
the way through it.

00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:29.660
&gt;&gt;Mark Frauenfelder: Yeah, the neck goes all
the way through. And then I just drill, I

00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:33.430
don't use glue when I put them together; I
use screws. I try to use as little glue as

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:37.210
possible on anything cause then you can take
it apart if it breaks and you don't have to

00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:38.790
wait for the glue to dry.

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:42.260
So yeah, there's not a problem with it, but
I see what you mean. Otherwise you would have

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:46.251
a problem. It goes all the way through. And
it's thinner there, though, because you want

00:46:46.251 --> 00:46:50.340
more resonance. You make it as, it's like
a game. The part that's hidden inside the

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:58.230
box, you want, I think, as thin as possible
cause you don't want to deaden the vibrations.

00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:59.230
[Pause]

00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:06.420
&gt;&gt;Female audience #4: I wanted to know more
about raising chickens. My sister-in-law raises

00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:10.130
chickens and always mentions to me, when we
scrape plates, like, "Oh, you wouldn't have

00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:15.020
to throw this away if you had chickens." But
I wanna know like, time and resources and

00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:17.720
what does it take to have chickens? Besides
no coyotes.

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:20.850
&gt;&gt;Mark Frauenfelder: Yeah, exactly. Well,
if you don't have to worry about predators,

00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:28.540
they actually aren't that hard to deal with.
You just make sure that they're fed and watered

00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:36.840
and have access to sunshine and be able to
get out. But they're very hearty animals and

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:42.570
people in the Midwest can keep them when the
temperatures drop really low, they don't even

00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:50.310
need to turn the heat on in the coop. They're
very robust animals and so, they don't need

00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:56.220
a lot of care. I mean, they're much easier
than I would say a dog. They might be like

00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:59.850
a cat, or less than a cat. They do their own
thing.

00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:04.400
&gt;&gt;Female audience #4: And just a quick follow-up,
did you have some kind of shelter or shed

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:06.230
for them, even down here?

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:11.300
&gt;&gt;Mark Frauenfelder: Yeah, yeah. When we moved
from Tarzana, I built a coop for them that

00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:18.240
was on stilts with a little ramp for them
to go into. And then, when the coyotes started

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:24.080
coming, I built a fence so it would lead into
a little pen that they could walk around in,

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:32.090
but it just didn't feel good having them trapped
like that, having the animals penned in. I

00:48:32.090 --> 00:48:37.270
would really, if you keep chickens, I would
 -- they're gonna be a lot happier and you

00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:42.580
are, too, if you just let them run around
your yard. And when we were in Tarzana, they

00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:45.280
would occasionally get out and go into the
street, but they always know when to come

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:50.590
back. As soon as the sun starts coming down,
like little soldiers, they all would go into

00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:56.860
a little line and go into the coop. It's fun
to watch.

00:48:56.860 --> 00:49:00.640
&gt;&gt;Male audience #5: So, for a lot of these
projects, there's a varying level of time

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:07.520
and space and energy commitment. When you
were talking to the first few groups that

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:12.660
you interviewed, did they give any indication
of when the return really starts to happen?

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:18.770
Like the going from buying the preassembled
thing to buying the tools or the materials,

00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:23.700
or going through the failures and the learning
processes, like when they started really feeling

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:24.700
value?

00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:36.640
&gt;&gt;Mark Frauenfelder: Yeah, I mean, I think
most people felt value in different levels

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:45.590
at different times, but it was pretty immediate.
Making a composter, there's just the fact

00:49:45.590 --> 00:49:49.850
that you made it is good and makes you feel
like you've accomplished something. And then,

00:49:49.850 --> 00:49:55.690
once real compost is being formed and steam's
rising off of it in the early morning, that's

00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:56.960
another level.

00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:01.100
Or with the bees, successfully getting them
out of the attic and into the hive was, was

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:06.580
really satisfying. And then, getting honey
was like an incredible thing. So, there's

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:12.110
different levels of reward throughout the
process, I would say. There's not one big

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:19.320
payoff, which is good in a way, cause it keeps
you going. Those small victories add up, which

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:23.370
was what the Ramshackle Solid people like
to say.

00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:34.030
&gt;&gt;Julie Wiskirchen: Does anyone over VC have
a question? Any more local questions? [Pause]

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:42.580
&gt;&gt;Male audience #6: I wondered with the bees.
You mentioned them. How, how -- did you get

00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:46.910
stung and were they like a pain in the neck,
or were you able to keep them far enough away?

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:49.480
What did you do to worry about that?

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:52.420
&gt;&gt;Mark Frauenfelder: Yeah. That was something
my wife was really concerned about. The bees

00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:58.300
are gonna be stinging us and bothering us
all the time, but luckily, we have a pretty

00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:03.200
good sized piece of property. It's long and
narrow, so we put them way off in the far

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:08.520
end. And they have not really – they bothered
us. Believe it or not, I've only been stung

00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:14.120
once. It was when my mask, the mesh of it
was against my cheek and one stung me on the

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:19.100
cheek. But luckily, I don't -- stings don't
really bother me that much, so I was just

00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:28.530
able to carry on. They don't -- once, I was
working with them and I forgot to smoke them.

00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:34.991
If you have a little smoker and it makes them
drowsy. I forgot to do the smoker and they

00:51:34.991 --> 00:51:40.780
started getting agitated because you're tearing
apart their house, so of course, they're gonna

00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:46.150
get agitated. We'd all get mad, too. And so
then -- but I didn't get stung. They're just

00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:50.321
swarming all over the place, but it wasn't
really that much of a problem. Now that I

00:51:50.321 --> 00:51:54.549
smoke them all the time, they aren't a problem.

00:51:54.549 --> 00:52:00.490
Like, chickens are easy, then bees are incredibly
easy. I go check once every couple of weeks

00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:07.560
to see if the bees are still there. I mean,
the idea is to just to let the bees be bees.

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:11.780
This part of the year is probably where I
do quite a bit compared to other parts, is

00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:17.520
where, because there's not a lot of blossoms
for the bees to get food. So, I put baggies

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:21.960
of sugar water in there, just to supplement
and keep them going. I don't want them to

00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:26.830
abscond from the hive. So, that's like the
most treatment the bees get. And then summer

00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:31.400
is a little active of the harvesting. But
the rest of the year, you just let them do

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:32.400
their thing.

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:35.790
&gt;&gt;Male audience #6: So, do you have a problem
with neighbors with this kind of stuff? Like,

00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:38.320
with bees and chickens and I don't know, drilling
late at night –

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:39.320
&gt;&gt;Mark Frauenfelder: Yeah.

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:40.320
&gt;&gt;Male audience #6: and that kind of stuff?

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:44.591
&gt;&gt;Mark Frauenfelder: Yeah. We made sure not
to get roosters. Roosters would be a problem

00:52:44.591 --> 00:52:51.440
cause roosters, if you've ever been around,
it's a myth that they crow at sunup and sundown.

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:55.830
They crow all day long and all night long,
too. It just never stops.

00:52:55.830 --> 00:52:56.830
&gt;&gt;Male audience #6: And they're aggressive.

00:52:56.830 --> 00:53:01.260
&gt;&gt;Mark Frauenfelder: Yeah, they are. And so,
but no complaints from anybody. I mean, people

00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:06.120
were delighted about the chickens. And the
bees, I've not advertised the fact that I

00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.120
have bees.

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:08.120
[laughter]

00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:14.681
And nobody's said anything because we don't
even notice the bees in our house. So, nobody

00:53:14.681 --> 00:53:23.640
notices them. And so, we only have one neighbor
that's near the bees and they're never there

00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:25.780
so that works out.

00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:26.860
[Pause]

00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:31.200
&gt;&gt;Julie Wiskirchen: Anybody else?

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.290
[Pause]

00:53:32.290 --> 00:53:36.200
OK. Thanks very much Mark.

00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:37.590
&gt;&gt;Mark Frauenfelder: Yeah, thank you, Julie.
Thanks everybody.

00:53:37.590 --> 00:53:37.890
[applause]
