00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.800
Sandy Deason: Well, thank you for being here.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.283
My name is Sandy Deason and I'm part of the
Authors @ Google program and we are very excited

00:00:06.283 --> 00:00:09.090
to have Mark Danner here today.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.690
Just to give you a little history.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:19.349
For the past two decades, Mr. Danner has reported
from Latin America, Haiti, the Balkans, in

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:20.349
the Middle East.

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:26.300
His perceptive award winning dispatches have
not only explored the real consequences of

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.069
American engagement with the world but also
the relationship between political violence

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:32.069
and power.

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:40.500
Now today I got feedback from Googlers that
they wanted the talk to be focused on torture

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.500
and where we are when it comes to extreme
interrogation with the Obama Administration.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.739
So he'll be talking about his book "Stripping
Bare the Body" but also he will focus his

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.640
talk on that issue.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:59.929
Please remember if you have any questions
to go to the mic over there so that when it's

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:05.460
on YouTube, people will hear the questions
and without further ado, here's Mr. Danner.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.460
Thank you very much.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.149
[applause]

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:20.020
Mark Danner: Thanks very much.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.170
Thank you, Sandy.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:30.180
It's a pleasure to be at Google and thank
you to Ann Farmer for inviting me and thank

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.070
you all for coming.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:40.340
I thought I would talk today - as Sandy mentioned,
I've been out talking about my current book

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.780
which is called "Stripping Bare the Body:
Politics Violence War.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.210
This is Ann Farmer's copy. [laughs]

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:58.380
I'm going to say a word -- start by saying
a word about the title and then we'll talk

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.050
a little bit about one aspect of the book
which is about torture and the Bush Administration

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.500
and now the Obama Administration.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.660
And then we'd love to take questions on whatever
subject.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.080
I've written about Haiti, Iraq, the war on
terror, a lot on torture for the last six

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.080
years.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.930
The book is called "Stripping Bare the Body",
as I said, which comes from a quotation from

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.810
a former Haitian president, Leslie Manigat.
He is a very interesting guy -- intellectual,

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:36.490
political exile, supporter of Duvalier, the
Haitian dictator, autocrat.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.850
And he told me in an interview he served as
President for about five months before he

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.510
was overthrown in a military coup, as many
Haitian presidents are.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.490
And he told me in an interview in which we
were talking about my preoccupations, what

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.210
I like to write about, he said, "Political
violence is like stripping bare the social

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.020
body. The better to place the stethoscope
and hear the real life beneath the skin."

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:11.350
According to this view, which I share, if
you really want to understand a society, if

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.620
you want to see what makes it tick, the forces
that are raging beneath the surface, who's

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.950
up, who's down, who has power, who's trying
to get power, what it's real values are, then

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:30.880
look at that society during a time of stress,
a time of violence, a time of revolution,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.830
a coup d'état, civil war.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.360
Look at that society in the months and years
after it's been attacked by terrorists, for

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.620
example.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:46.980
So this book essentially is a kind of compendium
of what Mantigat calls "these moments of nudity",

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.100
in his phrase.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:56.660
It begins with a long section, reporting section,
reporting on the ground from Haiti in which

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.080
it describes the chaos after the fall of Duvalier
and the attempt to build a democracy in Haiti,

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.570
an attempt that is still going on that led
to all sort of dislocations, violence, political

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.280
instability.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.210
That's the section that's really about the
late Cold War.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:18.739
It goes on then to a substantial section reporting
on the Balkan Wars of the early 90's.

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.699
We knew that era at the time is the post Cold
War world -- a very weird name - it's like

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:29.439
calling non-fiction, calling something by
what it's not.

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:36.130
As we look back on it now, even though at
the time, people were talking about the end

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.130
of history.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.130
The Cold War is over.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.330
We've now reached a nirvana of democracy and
capitalism.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.509
But as we look back on that period now, we
must just as well call it "the age of genocide"

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:51.469
because there were two large genocides, one
in the Balkans, one in Rwanda, in which the

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:57.210
West, self described West, basically looked
on and did nothing and watched it on television,

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.450
watched both of them on television.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:05.050
And finally, the last part is about Iraq and
the war on terror and there's a good deal

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:11.509
of reporting from the Iraq War on the ground
from Fallujah, from Baghdad, particularly

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:12.569
later parts of the war.

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:16.569
There's a good deal of reporting about the
US during the war on terror.

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:24.930
And finally, this is what I'd like to talk
to you about today, a lot of writing on torture.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.219
The writing on torture is under the general
category, what I call the "state of exception".

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:32.740
What is the state of exception?

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.930
It's a broad term under which you can group
martial law, state of emergency, state of

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:45.460
siege, and it really indicates that we're
living in a kind of separate time now -- soft

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:51.949
martial law if you will, that was declared
in the days and weeks after the 9/11 attacks

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.229
and that we still have not exited from.

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:59.990
It's not just the war on terror itself but
the sets of laws and changes in the law that

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:09.379
the Bush Administration introduced to essentially
build a different governing consensus on issues

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:12.229
like wire tapping.

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:16.969
Right now, the government can essentially
tap your phone calls and read your emails.

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:24.550
It's a complicated issue of course but they
can do it without court approval and that

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:31.169
was begun under the Bush Administration that
continues under the Obama Administration.

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:35.719
Extraordinary rendition is another aspect
of the state of exception in which people

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:41.860
are picked up off the street in foreign countries,
kidnapped, taken to a series of so called

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:48.069
"black sites", secret prisons around the world,
where they're interrogated and sometimes tortured.

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:55.379
And then just the general issue of torture
itself and harsh interrogation.

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:57.979
Torture is a long story, of course.

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:04.569
It began in the days and weeks after 9/11;
it is with us still.

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:08.419
It's interesting, deeply interesting from
my point of view, because I've been covering

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:12.090
it as a journalist now for six or seven years.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:18.389
I published a book in 2004 called "Torture
and Truth" which essentially, from Google's

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:23.870
point of view, I guess it's kind of a retrograde
book because it consisted of two thirds of

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:29.719
it, about 400 pages, consisted of government
documents, which were published and which

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:33.350
were released in the wake of the Abu Gharaib
scandal.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:37.590
You'll all remember those photographs, which
told in very great detail the story of how

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:43.969
the US, after 9/11, made the decision to torture
detainees or to use extreme interrogation,

00:07:43.969 --> 00:07:49.159
which is the preferred term of the Bush Administration
and the Republican party -- how those decisions

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:56.969
were made, how the program was developed,
how the protocol of how the interrogation

00:07:56.969 --> 00:08:00.289
was done was developed within the CIA and
also the Defense department, how it was approved

00:08:00.289 --> 00:08:04.310
by the Department of Justice, what those legal
documents were.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:11.439
And I published them in that book that declared
that torture was legal and this goes back

00:08:11.439 --> 00:08:12.529
to 2004.

00:08:12.529 --> 00:08:19.219
The first large, large scale piece on torture
was published in the Washington Post in December

00:08:19.219 --> 00:08:26.389
of 2002, followed by - that was about 4,000
to 5,000 words front page, followed a couple

00:08:26.389 --> 00:08:29.879
of months later by a piece equally long in
the New York Times.

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:35.870
So, one of the strange things about the torture
story from the beginning is that there is

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:41.200
the story of what happened, that is how this
protocol was developed, who was interrogated

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.860
in this way, what the CIA did and what the
Department of Defense did, what the Department

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.810
of Justice did, all these things which we
know a lot about.

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:56.120
And there's a parallel narrative and that
parallel narrative is what we knew about it,

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:02.510
and the fact is though as a journalist and
a writer, I fall easily into the kind of rhetoric

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.620
of disclosure.

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.130
When was this disclosed?

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:06.330
When was the revelation?

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.080
When did it happen?

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:14.860
In fact, we have known the better part of
this story for a half dozen years and it's

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:19.860
one of the peculiar things, which I call in
the book "the frozen scandal" -- the notion

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:26.590
that - what I believe certainly to be wrongdoing
is made public.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:31.520
It is generally acknowledged by most people
to have happened and yet it continues.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.260
I grew up and earliest came to political consciousness
in the Watergate period when you had a kind

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.780
of sequence of events that defined a scandal.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:45.060
First, you'd have revelation, usually by the
press but often by a leak in the press.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:51.790
Next, you'd have investigation - societal
investigation by the Congress, by the courts

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:56.130
sometimes but an investigation that would
give you a story of what happened that society

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.200
could agree on.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.510
And finally, you'd have expiation.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:03.660
People would be prosecuted, they'd lose their
jobs, they'd be punished in some way, the

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:10.910
society would return to some kind of what
might be called "a state of grace", I guess.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:18.050
One of the things that seems to me that characterizes
our age, the age of the war on terror, is

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:24.130
that process, that three-fold process, that
three-part process, has been derailed.

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:29.680
We're stuck between revelation and true investigation
and that's where we are with torture.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:35.590
Torture has gone from being an anathema as
it was before the war on terror to being essentially

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:41.270
a policy choice, and also to being a political
football.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:46.710
I brought along yesterday's copy of the New
York Times, hard copy, front page, "Groups

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:50.510
Attack on Justice Department Lawyers, Divides
Conservatives".

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:53.270
Did anybody see this, this piece?

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:57.400
Very interesting piece essentially about the
fact that you have this

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:03.300
Republican political group that has now demanded
the names of what it calls the "terrorist

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:10.260
lawyers" -- the Al-Qaeda Seven is the other
phrase, which are the lawyers supposedly within

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.900
the Obama Justice Department, that have represented
detainees in court.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:19.740
So this has now become a permanent part of
our political system, the argument over torture

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.130
and the argument over terrorism.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:23.620
People compare this to McCarthyism.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:30.960
I would say it's a fairly good comparison
but the fact is that embedded in our political

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:36.520
system now is an argument about terrorism
and torture in which torture has taken on

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.310
a very different role.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:44.280
The Republican party at this point has a fairly
unambiguous position on torture which is that

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.280
they support it.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:51.560
They call it extreme interrogation techniques,
EIT's, but they very much believe that this

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.790
should be used on terrorist suspects.

00:11:53.790 --> 00:12:00.620
They're angry and attacked the Obama Administration
for not having used these techniques on the

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:06.790
so called "Christmas Bomber", the "Underwear
Bomber" as other people call him, and torture

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.580
has become a kind of badge of commitment.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.860
Do you have the determination to protect the
country?

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:17.780
Are you willing to do whatever it takes to
shelter Americans from terrorists?

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:23.120
And if you're not, you're essentially in favor
of coddling terrorists.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.050
It's become a permanent part of our political
discourse.

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:34.200
Let me just tell you a little bit about what
I'm talking about when I talk about torture.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:40.320
I want to read - last Spring, I published
a document "The Red Cross Report" which was

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:45.520
essentially an interview with 14 high value
detainees, HVD's, people who'd been arrested

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:53.350
mostly in Pakistan and Afghanistan - captured
I should say, not arrested and taken to the

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:58.870
black sites I mentioned which were secret
prisons that were established in well, Pakistan,

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:06.010
Afghanistan, Thailand, Morocco, Poland, Lithuania,
Romania, Diego Garcia.

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:09.770
There are probably several others we don't
yet know about but these were places that

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:14.700
were completely secret where these people
were taken off to for interrogation.

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:19.830
I want to read a little bit about what this
kind of interrogation is like and I'm going

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:24.240
to use an excerpt from "The Red Cross Report"
that I published last Spring.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:30.290
It's the account of Abu Zubaydah who was the
first of the so called "big fish", high valued

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:31.290
detainees.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:41.530
He was captured in Pakistan in March 2002
 -- so not even six months after 9/11.

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:48.270
He tried to escape, he was shot three times,
bled very badly, went into a coma.

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:54.360
The CIA and the Pakistanis who grabbed him
thought he was going to die.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:58.370
They secretly shipped over from Baltimore
an American trauma surgeon who stitched him

00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:59.370
up.

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:05.070
He went into a coma and the account I'm going
to read is him basically waking up from this

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.070
coma.

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:12.640
He's the first on who these techniques in
aggregate were tried, one after the other.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:18.180
This is Abu Zubaydah, 33 years old of Saudi
and Palestinian descent.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:23.040
"I woke up, naked, strapped to a bed, in a
very white room.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.080
The room measured approximately 13 feet by
13 feet.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:31.700
The room had 3 solid walls, with a fourth
wall consisting of metal bars separating it

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.520
from a larger room.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.700
I'm not sure how long I remained in the bed.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:40.740
After some time -- I think it was several
days, but can’t remember exactly -- I was

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:46.510
transferred to a chair where I was kept, shackled
by the hands and feet for what I think was

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.690
the next 2 to 3 weeks.

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:52.830
During this time I developed blisters on the
underside of my legs due to the constant sitting.

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:57.310
I was only allowed to get up from the chair
to go the toilet, which consisted of a bucket.

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:00.820
Water for cleaning myself was provided in
a plastic bottle.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:05.440
I was given no solid food during the first
two to three weeks while sitting on the chair.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:11.990
I was only given Ensure", which is a kind
of canned nutrient drink, "and water to drink.

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:19.110
At first the Ensure made me vomit, but this
became less with time."

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:24.280
It should be said here he had no idea where
he was, where exactly this white room was

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.280
located.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.080
"The cell and room were air-conditioned and
were very cold.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.640
Very loud, shouting type music was constantly
playing.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:36.130
It kept repeating about every fifteen minutes
twenty-four hours a day.

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:41.220
Sometimes the music stopped and was replaced
by a loud hissing or crackling noise."

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:46.660
Now what we're seeing here is a series of
so called protocols.

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:49.640
This is the conditioning phase of the interrogation.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:57.330
He's kept naked; the technical name for this
for the interrogators is 'adjustment of clothing

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:59.250
to induce stress'.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:03.920
The room is kept extremely cold, probably
in the low 50's Fahrenheit.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:08.360
All of this is specified in the CIA documents.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:13.020
In fact there's an agent who's detailed basically
to watch him and make sure he doesn't turn

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:16.900
blue because blue indicates hypothermia.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:20.810
Use of noise to induce stress, that's the
constantly playing music.

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:26.810
All of this of course together is supposed
to result in, among other things, sleep deprivation.

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:32.580
The final attribute here is a stress position
and when it comes to Abu Zubaydah, we are

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:37.310
talking about long term sitting so for three
weeks or possibly more he's kept shackled

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:41.530
in precisely the same position, day and night,
constantly.

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:46.600
After Abu Zubaydah, who is the first of these
main guys, they switched to long term standing

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:52.640
in which they shackled prisoners with their
wrists shackled to the ceiling, their feet

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.640
shackled to the floor.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:54.640
And again, they're naked.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.090
They're in a very cold room and they are kept
like this for several weeks.

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:03.760
And if you want to feel what that's like,
put your hands over your head for five minutes

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:14.059
so that's a "stress position", quote end quote,
in the euphemistic language.

00:17:14.059 --> 00:17:20.449
The CIA protocol describes "As the HVD, high
value detainee, is placed in the vertical

00:17:20.449 --> 00:17:23.379
shackling position to begin sleep deprivation.

00:17:23.379 --> 00:17:26.610
Other shackling procedures may be used during
interrogation.

00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:34.220
The detainee is diapered for sanitary purposes",
so he doesn't have to be released to sit on

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:38.499
the bucket or whatever, "although the diaper
is not used at all times" and indeed they

00:17:38.499 --> 00:17:47.280
frequently took this off so they had to urinate
and defecate on one another – on themselves,

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.019
sorry, and then they would throw water on
them.

00:17:51.019 --> 00:17:52.600
[pause]

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.149
Well, just a word about the standing stress
position.

00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:59.009
This is Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who we've
heard a lot about, who was supposed to be

00:17:59.009 --> 00:18:00.980
tried in New York.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.809
Now it is unclear where he is going to be
tried.

00:18:02.809 --> 00:18:08.511
"I was kept for one month in the cell in the
standing position with my hands cuffed and

00:18:08.511 --> 00:18:12.279
shackled above my head and my feet cuffed
and shackled to a point in the floor.

00:18:12.279 --> 00:18:15.840
Of course during this month I fell asleep
on some occasions while still being held in

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.269
this position.

00:18:17.269 --> 00:18:22.020
This resulted in all my weight being applied
to the handcuffs around my wrist resulting

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.830
in open and bleeding wounds.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:28.529
Both my feet became very swollen after one
month of almost continual standing."

00:18:28.529 --> 00:18:33.090
The person who took the testimony remarks
at this point that indeed there is significant

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:38.700
scarring on his wrist and on his ankles. Now,
it's important to remember that long term

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:44.100
standing - it seems like a very simple "Okay,
keep him standing" but one thing about torture

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.480
is very simple techniques are extremely effective.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.240
This was a Soviet technique, which the CIA
studied.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:58.440
The Soviets called it shtoyka, simply shtoyka,
and it has, after a couple of hours, extremely

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.749
dramatic physical effects.

00:19:00.749 --> 00:19:08.720
The CIA report on it from the late 60's, I'll
just read a sentence: "After 18 to 24 hours

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:13.289
of continuous standing, there is an accumulation
of fluid in the tissues of the legs.

00:19:13.289 --> 00:19:17.980
This dependent edema is produced by the extravasation
of fluid from the blood vessels."

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:22.919
In other words, water is coming out, all kinds
of fluids is coming out of the arteries.

00:19:22.919 --> 00:19:27.230
"The ankles and feet of the prisoner swell
to twice their normal circumference.

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:31.149
The edema may rise up to the legs as high
as the middle of the thighs.

00:19:31.149 --> 00:19:35.150
The skin becomes tense and intensely painful.

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:38.879
Large blisters develop which break and exude
watery serum."

00:19:38.879 --> 00:19:48.210
So, for this reason, you had frequently a
doctor coming in while Khalid Sheikh Mohammed

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:54.570
was standing with his hands shackled to the
ceiling, who would use a tape measure on his

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:58.899
legs to see how much they had swollen.

00:19:58.899 --> 00:20:04.650
Okay, let me continue for a minute with Abu
Zubadayah, our first detainee.

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:10.539
This is several weeks later after the first
phase which is called the conditioning phase.

00:20:10.539 --> 00:20:13.629
"Two black wooden boxes were brought into
the room outside my cell."

00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:21.190
Remember, the cell is 3 walls and then there
are bars, okay?

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:25.289
"One of these wooden boxes was tall, slightly
higher than me and narrow, measuring perhaps

00:20:25.289 --> 00:20:28.720
in area of 3 1/2 by 2 1/2 by 6 ½ feet in
height."

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.480
So it's like a standing coffin basically.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:37.409
"The other was shorter, perhaps only 3 1/2
feet in height" -- so a box like this.

00:20:37.409 --> 00:20:41.169
"I was taken out of my cell; one of the interrogators
wrapped a towel around my neck.

00:20:41.169 --> 00:20:46.769
They then used it to swing me around and smash
me repeatedly against the hard walls of the

00:20:46.769 --> 00:20:47.769
room.

00:20:47.769 --> 00:20:49.330
I was also repeatedly slapped in the face.

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:54.499
I was then put into the tall black box for
what I think was about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

00:20:54.499 --> 00:20:57.429
The box was totally black on the inside as
well as the outside.

00:20:57.429 --> 00:21:02.259
They put a cloth or cover over the outside
of the box to cut out all light and restrict

00:21:02.259 --> 00:21:03.669
my air supply.

00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:05.140
It was difficult to breathe.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:09.059
When I was let out of the box, I saw that
one of the walls of the room had been covered

00:21:09.059 --> 00:21:10.730
with plywood sheeting.

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:14.860
From now on it was against this wall that
I was smashed with the towel around my neck.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.869
I think that the plywood was put there to
provide some absorption of the impact of my

00:21:18.869 --> 00:21:19.869
body.

00:21:19.869 --> 00:21:22.899
The interrogators realized that smashing me
against the hard wall would probably quickly

00:21:22.899 --> 00:21:26.600
result in physical injury."

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:31.039
That plywood I've thought a lot about and
one can say a couple of things about it.

00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:37.289
One is that the problem of torture is -- how
do you inflict enough pain while keeping the

00:21:37.289 --> 00:21:41.080
person who's being interrogated healthy enough
to be interrogated?

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:45.220
You don't want to cause permanent or disabling
injury.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:51.210
So when he was walled -- this is called 'walling';
that is towel placed around the neck, smashed

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:52.559
repeatedly against the wall.

00:21:52.559 --> 00:21:56.960
Clearly the interrogators saw that they might
break a bone.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.700
It's important to remember that each of these
procedures, wherever they were happening -- and

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:05.929
it's probably Thailand, we don't know for
sure as he didn't know -- each of these procedures

00:22:05.929 --> 00:22:12.820
were approved specifically by at least the
Deputy Director level of the CIA.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:19.139
So you had constant back and forth by email,
by cable saying. "Can we do this, can we do

00:22:19.139 --> 00:22:20.980
that, can we wall him?"

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:25.399
Though I don't have the documents to prove
it, I have a suspicion that after they tried

00:22:25.399 --> 00:22:29.600
walling the first time, which is something
that the Israelis use to use as well and which

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.429
gradually developed over the course of these
interrogations.

00:22:31.429 --> 00:22:36.290
Eventually the towel was replaced by a leather
collar which actually had handles that the

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:40.240
interrogators could use to smash them.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.350
The first time they used it I have a hunch
that the interrogators thought, "God, we're

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:45.549
going to break this guy's arm or break his
leg."

00:22:45.549 --> 00:22:50.450
They wrote back to headquarters and they were
told to do something to dampen the effect

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:52.330
and they put the plywood up.

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:57.059
The other thing to remember here is that not
only were these things approved specifically

00:22:57.059 --> 00:23:03.100
at the top level of the CIA but the director
at the time, George Tenet -- we are talking

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:08.230
about 2002 here -- would travel sometimes
several times a day to the White House to

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:13.169
brief the Principles Committee on what was
going on in these interrogations.

00:23:13.169 --> 00:23:18.869
And the Principles Committee is Secretary
of State, Secretary of Defense, National Security

00:23:18.869 --> 00:23:23.929
Advisor, Attorney General, Vice President,
and sometimes the President.

00:23:23.929 --> 00:23:28.840
So when we talk about torture and prosecutions
and things like that, investigations, it's

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:36.110
important to remember that this stuff happened
and responsibility was spread fairly widely

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:39.580
at the top levels of the government, I think,
for specific reasons.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:44.690
I think the CIA was quite determined that
at a time when this stuff is exposed and they

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:50.119
knew it would be exposed, that they were not
going to be the ones holding the bag, or to

00:23:50.119 --> 00:23:56.309
use a child's game analogy, they are not going
to be the ones without a chair when the music

00:23:56.309 --> 00:23:57.309
stopped.

00:23:57.309 --> 00:24:02.389
So they made sure not only the Department
of Justice approved these techniques specifically,

00:24:02.389 --> 00:24:08.009
they also made sure that while they were going
on people at the top levels knew about them,

00:24:08.009 --> 00:24:10.940
even when by the way, they didn't want to.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:17.410
John Ashcroft, the Attorney General, is quoted
in one of these meetings saying, "We shouldn't

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:25.279
be talking about this in the White House.
History will not deal kindly with this."

00:24:25.279 --> 00:24:26.279
All right.

00:24:26.279 --> 00:24:32.450
We don't have a lot of time so let me just
read the last section here from what happened.

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:42.009
All right, the box.

00:24:42.009 --> 00:24:44.600
Well, let me skip the rest of the box.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:51.029
The point is he started to bleed from these
wounds.

00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:54.269
Umm, all right.

00:24:54.269 --> 00:24:58.399
I should say for those of you who are interested
in the subject, there's an awful lot of material

00:24:58.399 --> 00:25:07.610
available about these interrogations and it's
been confirmed by other accounts.

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:09.600
Okay, the last from Abu Zubadayah:

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:14.049
"They placed a cloth or cover over the box
to cut out the light and restrict my air supply.

00:25:14.049 --> 00:25:17.120
As it was not high enough to sit upright,
I had to crouch down."

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.799
This is the 3 1/2 foot box.

00:25:18.799 --> 00:25:20.739
"It was very difficult because of my wounds.

00:25:20.739 --> 00:25:25.580
The stress on my legs held in this position
meant my wounds both in the leg and stomach

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:27.139
became very painful.

00:25:27.139 --> 00:25:30.269
I think this occurred about 3 months after
my last operation.

00:25:30.269 --> 00:25:35.130
It was always cold in the room, but when the
cover was placed over the box it made it hot

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:36.130
and sweaty.

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.159
The wound on my legs began to open and started
to bleed.

00:25:38.159 --> 00:25:44.220
I don’t know how long I remained in the
small box, I think I may have slept or maybe

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.220
fainted.

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:48.730
I was then dragged from the small box, unable
to walk properly and put on what looked like

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:52.600
a hospital bed, and strapped down very tightly
with belts."

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.539
There was a belt across his chest, ankles,
wrists.

00:25:55.539 --> 00:25:59.470
"A black cloth was then placed over my face
and the interrogators used a mineral bottle

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:02.909
to pour water on the cloth so that I could
not breathe.

00:26:02.909 --> 00:26:06.889
After a few minutes the cloth was removed
and the bed was rotated into an upright position."

00:26:06.889 --> 00:26:12.822
So this is a sort of a hospital gurney that
can go all the way down and all the way up

00:26:12.822 --> 00:26:13.822
to vertical or horizontal.

00:26:13.822 --> 00:26:15.450
"The pressure of the straps on my wounds was
very painful.

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:16.730
I vomited.

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:20.710
The bed was then again lowered to horizontal
position and the same torture carried out

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:24.690
again with the black cloth over my face and
water poured on from the bottle.

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:28.320
On this occasion my head was in a more backward,
downwards position."

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.220
Remember this is the first time this is being
used.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.350
"And the water was poured on for a longer
time."

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:38.879
So his head is down like this, feet up like
that, strapped, and he's naked of course this

00:26:38.879 --> 00:26:40.019
whole time.

00:26:40.019 --> 00:26:43.409
"I struggled against the straps, trying to
breathe, but it was hopeless.

00:26:43.409 --> 00:26:44.830
I thought I was going to die.

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:47.080
I lost control of my urine.

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.179
Since then I still lose control of my urine
when under stress.

00:26:50.179 --> 00:26:52.019
I was then placed again in the tall box.

00:26:52.019 --> 00:26:57.521
While I was inside the box, loud music was
played again and somebody kept banging repeatedly

00:26:57.521 --> 00:26:59.320
on the box from the outside.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:04.340
I tried to sit down on the floor, but because
of the small space the bucket of urine tipped

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:05.659
over and spilled over me.

00:27:05.659 --> 00:27:06.789
I was then taken out again.

00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:11.679
A towel was wrapped around my neck and I was
smashed into the wall with the plywood covering

00:27:11.679 --> 00:27:14.950
and repeatedly slapped in the face by the
same two interrogators.

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:18.669
I was then made to sit on the floor with a
black hood over my head until the next session

00:27:18.669 --> 00:27:19.669
began.

00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:21.749
The room was always kept very cold.

00:27:21.749 --> 00:27:24.210
This went on for approximately a week.

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:26.730
During this time the whole procedure was repeated
five times.

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:30.859
On each occasion, apart from one, I was suffocated
once or twice."

00:27:30.859 --> 00:27:33.559
He means the waterboarding on the hospital
bed.

00:27:33.559 --> 00:27:36.649
"And was put in the vertical position on the
bed in between.

00:27:36.649 --> 00:27:39.629
On one occasion the suffocation was repeated
three times.

00:27:39.629 --> 00:27:44.299
I vomited each time I was put in the vertical
position between suffocations.

00:27:44.299 --> 00:27:47.750
During that week I was not given any solid
food."

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:52.769
Obviously, they didn't want to lose him when
he vomited which is part of this procedure.

00:27:52.769 --> 00:27:55.379
"I collapsed and lost consciousness on several
occasions.

00:27:55.379 --> 00:27:59.169
Eventually the torture was stopped by the
intervention of a doctor.

00:27:59.169 --> 00:28:03.059
I was told during this period that I was one
of the first to receive these interrogation

00:28:03.059 --> 00:28:04.989
techniques, so no rules applied.

00:28:04.989 --> 00:28:10.379
It felt like they were experimenting and trying
out techniques to be used later on other people."

00:28:10.379 --> 00:28:11.489
That is in fact true.

00:28:11.489 --> 00:28:16.460
We see during the course of the various accounts
of these interrogations how these techniques

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:17.460
evolve.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:24.529
I mentioned the towel which became a leather
collar and then a plastic collar that was

00:28:24.529 --> 00:28:26.299
developed specifically for walling prisoners.

00:28:26.299 --> 00:28:31.950
The waterboarding technique, which we've just
looked at, evolved more and came to involve,

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:39.649
among other things, an oximeter, placed on
the prisoner's finger or thumb so as to constantly

00:28:39.649 --> 00:28:48.590
monitor vital signs so again to not lose the
prisoner, to not have him die under interrogation.

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:51.710
So we can see if you look at these documents
an evolution of what happens.

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:55.429
Now, it should be said he says, "I'm the first.
They were experimenting on me."

00:28:55.429 --> 00:28:59.350
It should be said these are very - what I've
described to you are very old techniques.

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:02.470
They go back centuries, literally.

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:07.490
Waterboarding goes back at least to the Inquisition
and -- depending on how you define it -- probably

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:08.490
farther.

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:09.739
The French used it in Algeria.

00:29:09.739 --> 00:29:11.820
They would generally strap a prisoner.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:18.220
They beat him up as here, naked, strap him
down usually on his back to a bench of some

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:24.989
kind, lift the bench up, and submerge his
head in a bucket of liquid.

00:29:24.989 --> 00:29:28.249
Sometimes dirty water, soapy water, urine
sometimes.

00:29:28.249 --> 00:29:36.100
The point is to have it go back into the lungs
basically and it produces a choking, drowning

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:37.210
sensation.

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:42.639
The press in describing this, the boiler plate
is often "simulated drowning" they call "waterboarding"

00:29:42.639 --> 00:29:44.649
but there's nothing really simulated about
it.

00:29:44.649 --> 00:29:45.730
It's drowning.

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:51.970
You could call it really "interrupted drowning".

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:56.179
Anyway, we see a steady progression of these
techniques.

00:29:56.179 --> 00:30:02.899
A development of them and they were used on
hundreds of people; we don't know how many

00:30:02.899 --> 00:30:05.529
specifically but certainly the numbers in
the hundreds.

00:30:05.529 --> 00:30:06.769
They were used across the government.

00:30:06.769 --> 00:30:12.259
I've been reading from accounts of the CIA,
which are kind of purest, as it were, version

00:30:12.259 --> 00:30:15.980
but the Department of Defense used them in
Guantanamo.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:23.960
Mr. Qahtani, among others, and various other
parts of the government did as well.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:27.159
So, why talk about them now?

00:30:27.159 --> 00:30:33.460
Well, as you know when President Obama took
office, the second full day of his Presidency,

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.789
he signed three executive orders.

00:30:35.789 --> 00:30:40.860
Among other things, they stopped these specific
techniques and limited what the CIA could

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:46.200
do to what is included in the Army field manual.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:52.360
A field manual that was reissued in 2006 specifically
prohibits most of what I've just described

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:57.679
to you although there is a very significant
loophole in that which I don't really have

00:30:57.679 --> 00:31:01.909
time to get into but he did indeed declare
that this would stop.

00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:07.620
He declared also that the government would
do a study on proper interrogation and finally

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:11.869
he declared that Guantanamo would be closed
within a year.

00:31:11.869 --> 00:31:17.690
As we all know, Guantanamo has not been closed
and indeed it's unclear when it might be.

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:22.749
Greg Craig, who was the official - Obama's
White House Counsel, the

00:31:22.749 --> 00:31:28.629
official most closely associated with this
policy, has lost his job, probably due to

00:31:28.629 --> 00:31:29.950
his advocacy of this.

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:37.820
And we've seen during the past year a remarkable
phenomenon which is a push back on the part

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:44.879
of the Republicans in general but especially
the former Vice President in a kind of unprecedented

00:31:44.879 --> 00:31:51.399
 - I just don't
know anything in American history that is

00:31:51.399 --> 00:31:52.399
like it.

00:31:52.399 --> 00:31:58.299
Within ten days of Vice President Cheney leaving
office and Obama assuming the Presidency,

00:31:58.299 --> 00:32:04.320
the former Vice President was out criticizing
the Administration for having renounced torture.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.450
I'm going to read a quote from him.

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:14.740
This is ten days after he left office on - I
think this is on Fox television.

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:18.350
This is Cheney: "When we get people who are
more concerned about reading the rights to

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:23.350
an Al Qaeda terrorist than they are with protecting
the United States against people who are absolutely

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:28.389
committed to do anything they can to kill
Americans, then I worry.

00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:29.400
These are evil people.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.700
We’re not going to win this fight by turning
the other cheek.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:36.710
If it hadn’t been for what we did, with
respect to the enhanced interrogation techniques

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:40.739
for high value detainees, then we would have
been attacked again.

00:32:40.739 --> 00:32:45.110
These policies we put in place, in my opinion,
were absolutely crucial to getting us through

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:50.500
the last seven plus years without a major
casualty attack on the United States."

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:59.539
And he has made these sorts of statements
repeatedly and they have become more and more

00:32:59.539 --> 00:33:07.220
truculent, more and more aggressive, until
you reach the point where he talks about - this

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:13.289
is a couple of months later last Spring where
the terrorists are - he warned of an attack

00:33:13.289 --> 00:33:16.220
where "the terrorists are armed with something
much more dangerous", I'm quoting, "than an

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:21.679
airline ticket and a box cutter - a nuclear
weapon and a biological weapon of some kind.

00:33:21.679 --> 00:33:25.060
That’s the one that would involve the deaths
of perhaps hundreds of thousands of people,

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:28.260
and the one you have to spend a hell of a
lot of time guarding against.

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:31.720
I think there’s a high probability of such
an attempt."

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.090
The Vice President went on, "Whether or not
they can pull it off depends whether or not

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:41.170
we keep in place policies that have allowed
us to defeat all further attempts, since 9/11,

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:44.519
to launch mass casualty attacks against the
United States.

00:33:44.519 --> 00:33:49.179
If you release hardcore Al Qaeda terrorists
who are held in Guantanamo, I think they go

00:33:49.179 --> 00:33:53.279
back into the business of trying to kill more
Americans and mount further mass casualties

00:33:53.279 --> 00:33:54.279
attacks.

00:33:54.279 --> 00:33:59.090
If you turn them loose and they go kill more
Americans, who is responsible for that?",

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:06.359
asked the former Vice President. Who indeed?
These statements have been extremely effective

00:34:06.359 --> 00:34:16.740
I would argue in pushing the Republican party
to see the political gains to be made by using

00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:23.609
that most lucrative of political emotions,
fear, and they have done it extremely well

00:34:23.609 --> 00:34:30.080
so that by now, a year after 9/11, we've seen
major attack on the Administration over the

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.109
so called "Underwear Bomber".

00:34:32.109 --> 00:34:38.190
And we've seen a general development of the
idea of torture as necessary to protect the

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:39.389
United States.

00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:43.730
And in fact it seems to me, if we get back
to "Stripping Bare the Body" here for a minute

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:48.409
and the body we are stripping bare is our
own country and our own values, that one of

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:55.299
the most egregious results of 9/11 has been
the belief on apparently a majority of the

00:34:55.299 --> 00:35:04.589
population that this country cannot be kept
safe if the government follows the law.

00:35:04.589 --> 00:35:11.410
The figures now on torture, among Americans,
on the feelings about torture among Americans,

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:12.920
are quite striking.

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:19.190
The most recent Pew poll, if you look at the
numbers simply of those people in various

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:25.420
countries who will say yes to the question,
"The government should never torture detainees".

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:28.960
That's the question you ask and you say, "Do
you agree with that?"

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:34.480
In Egypt, for example, 53 percent say yes,
the government should never torture detainees.

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:39.869
In Iran, 56 percent say yes, the government
should never torture detainees.

00:35:39.869 --> 00:35:44.000
In Palestinian territories, 66 percent, two
out of three.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.190
Europe roughly, depending on which country,
around 80 percent so four out of five say

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:52.170
the government should never torture detainees.

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:54.259
Americans - does anybody want to guess?

00:35:54.259 --> 00:35:55.259
&gt;&gt; 25.

00:35:55.259 --> 00:35:56.259
Mark Danner: Very good.

00:35:56.259 --> 00:35:57.309
That's precisely right.

00:35:57.309 --> 00:36:04.700
25 percent of Americans say the government
should never torture detainees and I would

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:10.109
argue to you that this does not define a difference
between Americans and all other peoples.

00:36:10.109 --> 00:36:15.201
It basically is a product of the rhetoric
that we have seen coming out first from the

00:36:15.201 --> 00:36:20.559
Bush administration

00:36:20.559 --> 00:36:39.329
[audio cuts off for almost two minutes]

00:36:39.329 --> 00:36:42.010
[applause]

00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:50.049
Mark Danner: Anything?

00:36:50.049 --> 00:37:08.819
I've answered all your questions, eh? [laughs]

00:37:08.819 --> 00:37:19.539
&gt;&gt; Thank you for coming.

00:37:19.539 --> 00:37:34.630
One of the things I'm interested in is how
did the idea of not trying the terrorists

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:38.950
in a civilian court - why is that such an
issue now?

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:44.641
Because I know that under Bush they did try
a lot of terrorists in civilian courts and

00:37:44.641 --> 00:37:47.869
so why is it such an issue now?

00:37:47.869 --> 00:37:52.099
Mark Danner: That's a great question actually.

00:37:52.099 --> 00:37:59.130
After 9/11, the Bush Administration put together
a strategy that was very much based on defining

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:05.369
the war on terror as a war, and in part there
was a political motive for this, a couple

00:38:05.369 --> 00:38:06.369
of political motives.

00:38:06.369 --> 00:38:08.920
One was to separate them from the Clinton
Administration.

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:14.510
They never declared war, they never took this
seriously which in a sense could combat the

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:17.740
notion that the Bush Administration had let
the country be attacked.

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:20.600
They were politically vulnerable, they were
aggressive about it.

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:26.839
Also defining it as a war allowed the President
to increase his power to the utmost degree.

00:38:26.839 --> 00:38:31.250
We're now in a war, we're now in a crisis.

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:36.170
I can wiretap, I can interrogate beyond the
bounds of the law, I can imprison five thousand

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:43.690
immigrants in the US on my own authority so
they have this interest in doing it this way

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:46.780
and the Military Commissions idea was a part
of that.

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:51.870
The problem was the Supreme Court knocked
it down several times.

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:56.799
Congress then reinstated it and went back
and forth but your question was very intelligently

00:38:56.799 --> 00:39:01.430
posed because it is true that during this
whole time the civilian courts continued prosecuting

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:03.720
terrorists, very effectively by the way.

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:08.020
The Military Commissions, because of all these
problems with how they were defined, I think

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:09.961
they at the end of the day prosecuted three.

00:39:09.961 --> 00:39:11.440
I believe that's the right number.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.720
In civilian courts, hundreds.

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.940
Why has it become a big issue now?

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:22.040
Because I think it fits into this general
political motive that I tried to define that

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:27.450
the Republicans have which is to be aggressive
on the war on terror, to say that the Obama

00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:30.850
Administration doesn't take it seriously and
doesn't believe it's a war, and of course

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:34.630
trying terrorists in civilian courts fits
into that perfectly.

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:36.510
Why aren't they using Military Commissions?

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:43.250
Why did they read the Miranda rights to the
so called "Underwear Bomber", right?

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:44.250
How could they do that?

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:48.549
This fits also, it should be observed I think,
into the general Republican rhetoric about

00:39:48.549 --> 00:39:49.569
tough on crime.

00:39:49.569 --> 00:39:55.450
This dove tells very well with the kind of
domestic rhetoric of Miranda rights, coddling

00:39:55.450 --> 00:40:05.359
prisoners, coddling criminals so it fits very
well into Republican terminology and Republican

00:40:05.359 --> 00:40:06.539
politics.

00:40:06.539 --> 00:40:10.280
&gt;&gt; Can you clarify who all is affected by
these policies?

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:15.910
'Cause as you mentioned, when Cheney gets
on TV or one of these extremely anti terrorist

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:21.640
people or whatever get on TV, they say, "If
we can't interrogate the terrorists, the Al

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.270
Qaeda people, then we're gonna lose the war."

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:32.400
But in fact in implementing these policies,
it seems that it certainly doesn't only affect

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.400
the Al Qaeda terrorists.

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.069
If for some reason, I was misidentified as
a terrorist, they could come and pick me up.

00:40:36.069 --> 00:40:42.731
So can you clarify who all is affected and
what percentage of the population could in

00:40:42.731 --> 00:40:44.210
theory be interrogated and so on?

00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:47.349
Mark Danner: Well again, that's a really good
question.

00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:53.050
It should be said, I think first of all, that
there are about 150 or 160 prisoners still

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:54.160
in Guantanamo.

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:58.680
But at one time there were 800 and most of
those people have simply been released.

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.250
Some of them released to foreign governments
and they're in jail.

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:06.660
But most of them were simply released because
certainly the majority of those prisoners

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:08.210
should not have been there.

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:13.900
They were handed over to American forces in
part because the Americans offered a bounty

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:18.799
of a thousand dollars on up for any terrorist
who was captured and handed over to them.

00:41:18.799 --> 00:41:23.890
So hundreds of people were handed over to
them and the Bush Administration knew quite

00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:28.170
early on that most of those people didn't
belong in Guantanamo.

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:32.579
But the political cost of releasing them were
quite high and it was much easier to keep

00:41:32.579 --> 00:41:38.930
them which is a horrible thing but it's documented
and true and I write about this a little bit

00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:40.190
in my book.

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:44.829
They actually developed a so called "mosaic
theory of information" whereby it didn't matter

00:41:44.829 --> 00:41:45.849
if they were terrorists.

00:41:45.849 --> 00:41:50.990
"If we can get enough information from them,
we can put all of this into a mosaic and still

00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:52.109
learn about terrorism."

00:41:52.109 --> 00:42:01.140
I mean this was actually a remarkable thing
whereby basically the idea of having to arrest

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:05.490
only terrorists was kind of defined out of
existence.

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:11.070
So we also have, on the rendition side, which
is something I mentioned earlier.

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:14.950
This kind of snatching people, kidnapping
them, and taking them to black sites.

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:20.520
A number of very highly publicized cases,
the most highly publicized is Maher Arar who

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:26.480
was a Canadian citizen of Syrian descent who
was grabbed on a flight to Europe at Kennedy

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:34.990
Airport, whisked away to Syria where he was
tortured for a year in very horrible ways

00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:36.630
and it was a complete mistake.

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:38.050
It was just a mistake.

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:41.569
They had a different person.

00:42:41.569 --> 00:42:45.880
The Canadian government, to its great credit,
did a full investigation of this -- the report

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:47.609
again you can find very easily.

00:42:47.609 --> 00:42:51.089
It's quite thorough and fascinating.

00:42:51.089 --> 00:42:55.650
The American government, on the other hand,
has never admitted that's a mistake or in

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:57.829
the case of any of these other prisoners.

00:42:57.829 --> 00:43:01.520
So I think you're right and the broader point
that needs to be made here is when you don't

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:07.710
have due process, mistakes get made and are
not corrected.

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:11.410
I mean, mistakes are made all the time but
if you have an adversary process, if you have

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:15.310
courts, if you have lawyers, they can be corrected
because someone is there arguing.

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:20.000
But if you are just throwing someone into
a dungeon, which in effect you are here, there's

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.140
is no adversary process and indeed even when
you find out what's wrong, that this person

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:27.690
shouldn't be there, there's no incentive to
fix it.

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:31.840
In fact, there's a disincentive because it's
embarrassing.

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:36.730
The other thing finally that should be said
is that one of things that happens, and this

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:41.089
happened in Iraq which I saw, you know at
Abu Ghraib for example, they arrested so many

00:43:41.089 --> 00:43:42.089
people.

00:43:42.089 --> 00:43:46.150
They did these sweeps - in the early days
of the insurgency when the US had no good

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:50.150
intelligence on what was going on, they would
just cordon off a neighborhood and smash -- break

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:53.420
down doors, and arrest every young man they
could find.

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:55.990
No evidence, they would just take them.

00:43:55.990 --> 00:44:01.170
These combat units would just take them and
this is again a documented fact.

00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:04.750
They would be sent to Abu Ghraib so Abu Ghraib
at a certain point had 15, 18, 20 thousand

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:09.730
prisoners, 90 percent of whom and that figure
comes from the intelligence agencies, should

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:11.839
not have been there.

00:44:11.839 --> 00:44:15.829
One of the things it did was break down the
intelligence process.

00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:20.470
The interrogators had so many people to interview
and were wasting their time so much and could

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:25.470
not release them because the combat units,
who had a say in who was released, resisted

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:29.089
it and you had a completely dysfunctional
system.

00:44:29.089 --> 00:44:36.270
So in practical terms, it also screwed things
up very well, not just in justice terms.

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:40.520
So, who does it affect?

00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:57.029
I mean, it affected a lot of people it shouldn't
have affected, no question about it.

00:44:57.029 --> 00:44:58.029
Yes?

00:44:58.029 --> 00:44:59.029
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm not sure where to start. I've had
outrage fatigue for eight years.

00:44:59.029 --> 00:45:00.029
Mark Danner: Yeah.

00:45:00.029 --> 00:45:01.029
Well, I know the feeling.

00:45:01.029 --> 00:45:02.029
&gt;&gt; But unfortunately, it hasn't abated and
I'm trying to ask this in a constructive way.

00:45:02.029 --> 00:45:05.180
What do you think we could actually fix that
would make a difference?

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:07.579
And the thing that comes to me is just the
unreality - the turning on reality into policy

00:45:07.579 --> 00:45:16.580
and I don't know any - there's like 'Dirty
Harry' who gets people angry because some

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:22.470
criminal didn't get read his Miranda rights.

00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:32.569
And then there's Glies quoting '24' saying
this is turning into reality.

00:45:32.569 --> 00:45:33.569
And then just general Fox News.

00:45:33.569 --> 00:45:34.569
They're just complete non reality.

00:45:34.569 --> 00:45:36.579
How - would a return to the Fairness Doctrine
help?

00:45:36.579 --> 00:45:37.770
Mark Danner: Now you're depressing me. [laughs]

00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:40.180
Well first of all, thanks for bringing up
'Dirty Harry'.

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:47.960
I often raise 'Dirty Harry' and '24' which
I think is its spawn in a way because these

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:56.000
do put forward a kind of ideology which is
that liberals with their red tape and all

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.869
this law crap, they're going to get you killed.

00:45:58.869 --> 00:46:05.000
And what we need is some tough men to cut
through that and protect the country. And

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:12.630
'Dirty Harry' is in San Francisco of course
and Clint Eastwood is a rogue cop, that is

00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:19.910
his superiors want to punish him and he cuts
through it all and he tortures the serial

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:26.039
killer on the 50 yard line of Kezar Stadium
as I recall; it's still a remarkable movie

00:46:26.039 --> 00:46:28.150
but he's a rogue cop in the system.

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:36.279
The interesting change with '24' is that Kiefer
Sutherland - the character Jack Bauer is employed

00:46:36.279 --> 00:46:38.500
directly by the White House, by the President.

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:47.869
The unit, or whatever it is, is a direct emanation
of the White House itself circumventing all

00:46:47.869 --> 00:46:49.450
the red tape and so on.

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:55.390
And apparently this idea, and this is why
it works politically, when the population

00:46:55.390 --> 00:47:01.299
is fearful and this rhetoric creates fear
first, you create it, they are about do another

00:47:01.299 --> 00:47:05.210
mass casualty attack and then you respond
with the answer which is we have to be tough

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:06.210
as nails.

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:10.991
We have to cut through all this stupid law
stuff and do whatever is necessary and that

00:47:10.991 --> 00:47:16.799
nation of untrammeled power protecting is
apparently a very, for many people, a very

00:47:16.799 --> 00:47:18.730
calming notion.

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:24.599
When you get to your question which is about
what to do about it, as I say, you were starting

00:47:24.599 --> 00:47:27.299
to depress me in talking about the Fairness
Doctrine.

00:47:27.299 --> 00:47:36.589
I think it is true that the deterioration
and the quality of television news in particular

00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:38.770
makes this kind of rhetoric more effective.

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:44.470
You have Fox yelling and yelling about and
you also by the way -- it should be said -- have

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:50.500
CNN and MSNBC in which people are shouting
back and forth at one another about it.

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:57.569
There's much less reporting, much more just
yelling back and forth,so called commentators

00:47:57.569 --> 00:48:01.740
so television has become - political debate
on television has become a kind of blood sport

00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:07.750
and when it becomes that sort of blood sport,
it's much easier to use TV to incite fear.

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:10.789
Television isn't very good at conveying information.

00:48:10.789 --> 00:48:15.820
It's great at provoking emotion which is why
the healthcare debate, who knows what the

00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:16.820
healthcare plan is?

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:20.700
Nobody knows if you talk to people and if
you watch TV, somebody can be a news junkie

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:22.780
but they'll never have it defined because
television isn't good at conveying that sort

00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:24.880
of thing.

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:30.859
Whether the Fairness Doctrine - I think the
return of regulation of television in the

00:48:30.859 --> 00:48:35.290
form of the Fairness Doctrine and other things,
that of course was the entire history from

00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:39.190
the 30's with radio all the way to the Reagan
Administration.

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:41.910
I think that would help certainly so the news
divisions don't have to feel that they have

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:42.910
to make money.

00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:53.160
They used to be loss leaders and they used
to do a much better job but we are way beyond

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:57.679
that I'm afraid, unfortunately.

00:48:57.679 --> 00:48:59.069
&gt;&gt; Thank you for coming and sharing this information
with us.

00:48:59.069 --> 00:49:00.069
Mark Danner: Thank you.

00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:01.329
&gt;&gt; A couple of questions.

00:49:01.329 --> 00:49:09.549
One is you had mentioned the stat about 25
percent of Americans being opposed to torture

00:49:09.549 --> 00:49:12.421
but 75 percent of the US is not Republican.

00:49:12.421 --> 00:49:15.760
So I was wondering if you'd kind of comment
on that.

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:18.420
Like who are those people basically?

00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:22.240
And then why are they okay with it?

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:29.500
The other is that growing up I always had
this perception of the United States as kind

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:32.180
of being the ones who take the high road.

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:34.440
I know that's not entirely true but that was
my perception.

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:39.309
Like it was what set us apart from a lot of
other countries were issues like torture and

00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:40.309
so forth.

00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:43.160
So I was wondering if you had a comment on
children growing up nowadays where you're

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:47.150
sort of inundated with this idea that actually
torture is kind of justified maybe, which

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:50.380
is absolutely foreign to what I grew up with.

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:52.039
Mark Danner: Yeah.

00:49:52.039 --> 00:49:53.270
Well, these are all hard questions.

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:57.250
Those are two extremely good questions.

00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:58.250
You are right.

00:49:58.250 --> 00:50:05.609
75 percent of the country is not Republican
and what is most important here, and you see

00:50:05.609 --> 00:50:11.609
this at the level of Congress as well, that
significant parts of the Democratic party

00:50:11.609 --> 00:50:16.869
are afraid of this issue or to give them more
credit, feel strongly about it, that these

00:50:16.869 --> 00:50:19.109
things should be used on detainees.

00:50:19.109 --> 00:50:20.760
And I think that's reflected on the population.

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:26.859
It should be said by the way that that poll
was government should never torture so "never",

00:50:26.859 --> 00:50:33.980
which you know you can imagine people answering
it in the negative by saying well we need

00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:42.289
to have this as a possible option if the so
called "ticking bomb" scenario happens which

00:50:42.289 --> 00:50:47.510
"24" is of course based on which we have so
far as I know never encountered but which

00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:51.180
as a rhetorical device is extremely useful
to say what if there's a nuke?

00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:53.730
It was planted in the middle of Manhattan
or San Francisco or whatever.

00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:58.299
You have the guy who knew where it was, you
knew it was going to go off in three minutes.

00:50:58.299 --> 00:51:05.490
All of these things which are completely ridiculous
but which have this way of narrowing down

00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:08.210
the question to a tiny point.

00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:14.559
But you are quite right that it isn't just
the Republican party, it's very true.

00:51:14.559 --> 00:51:19.779
Your second question about the belief in America
taking the high road I think cuts to the heart

00:51:19.779 --> 00:51:28.000
of a lot of things and it makes me sort of
quail for a second because there is this notion

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.309
and we do grow up with it in the United States.

00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:35.210
It's not just we grow up with it, it's part
our founding ideology that the US is different.

00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:40.480
It was founded in a different way and it was
founded on ideals of quality of all people,

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:49.539
quality of all men actually to be specific
but it was even at the time this ideology

00:51:49.539 --> 00:51:54.190
was not put in practice when it came to voting
 – when it came to a lot of things.

00:51:54.190 --> 00:51:58.740
But nonetheless, that's what the country is
founded on and there goes along with that,

00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:04.500
I think that conviction, the idea that we
are always the nice guys.

00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:07.849
We rebuilt Europe, we just didn't rape it
and take what we wanted.

00:52:07.849 --> 00:52:12.769
We rebuilt it and we're a country where we
don't go out and grab what we want, even though

00:52:12.769 --> 00:52:13.769
we could.

00:52:13.769 --> 00:52:19.569
We're all powerful but we're nice and with
that general ideology that we're above it

00:52:19.569 --> 00:52:25.230
all which is basically what you're saying
goes a notion as well that "No more Mr. Nice

00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:26.609
Guy", do you know what I mean?

00:52:26.609 --> 00:52:32.660
That when we're attacked, and I saw this frequently
after 9/11, this idea of "All right, you want

00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:36.579
to play that way, we can play that way. We
can be as tough as anyone."

00:52:36.579 --> 00:52:41.079
I remember I did a debate shortly before the
Iraq War began with Christopher Hitchens in

00:52:41.079 --> 00:52:42.400
Berkeley.

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:46.359
I was arguing against the war and he was arguing
for it.

00:52:46.359 --> 00:52:49.510
It was January 2003 so a couple of months
before the war.

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:53.029
It was a packed hall, several thousand people
and I'll never forget, and this is Berkeley,

00:52:53.029 --> 00:52:57.039
and I'll never forget at a certain point Christopher
said, "You know, at the end of the day we've

00:52:57.039 --> 00:53:03.519
been attacked and we have to respond", which
of course alighted the fact that Saddam did

00:53:03.519 --> 00:53:04.519
not attack us.

00:53:04.519 --> 00:53:09.530
But nonetheless, that's what he said and I
remember on the stage feeling this sort of

00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:13.430
surge from the audience, kind of the middle
of the audience was kind of like a lot of

00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:18.630
frat guys and sort of athletes -- you'll forgive
me, but it's kind of what it looked like from

00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:24.910
the stage -- and I heard this kind of [makes
a yelling rrrrr noise] in reaction, like "RRRRR.

00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:25.910
Yeah!"

00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:30.890
And I remember thinking it's this sort of
primal thing that "Hey, we've been nice. We

00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:36.859
don't drop our nukes even though we have them
but you know what? It's time to get tough."

00:53:36.859 --> 00:53:41.319
So I think that that way of thinking has its
roots in the general way I think you're saying

00:53:41.319 --> 00:53:45.900
which is "we're the nice guys, we're above
it all" and it has a kind of slingshot effect

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:50.390
which is that now we are going to get tough
and dirty and we can do it as well as anyone

00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:54.950
and I think that, in a sense, was the governing
ideology for a number of years and it's still

00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:59.509
strong on the part of many people.

00:53:59.509 --> 00:54:05.521
&gt;&gt; Hi. So I would say that on the moral issue
of whether torture is ever okay is that it's

00:54:05.521 --> 00:54:11.289
completely legitimate to say it should never
be done but on the pragmatic issue of whether

00:54:11.289 --> 00:54:22.170
it actually works, it seems that Obama more
than anyone else, would have been the guy

00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:38.789
to come into the White House and say, "We're
going to end this" and even he has sort of

00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:44.060
backed down a little bit from that, both in
rhetoric and action.

00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:49.019
So don't you think that's it possible that
he has sort of seen the information of whether

00:54:49.019 --> 00:54:55.290
it's been effective and reassessed his position
in pragmatic terms and said basically with

00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:56.710
torture we have this dilemma in that we have
to trade off the public good and the individual

00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:57.710
protections and given the new information
I have, I'm now leaning a little bit more

00:54:57.710 --> 00:54:59.740
in the public safety, probably good direction.

00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:00.740
Mark Danner: Mm-hmm.

00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:05.589
It's a very good question, first of all and
as to whether I believe that that's what's

00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:08.259
happened, the answer is no, I don't.

00:55:08.259 --> 00:55:12.049
I think there's no evidence of that whatever.

00:55:12.049 --> 00:55:17.410
The premise of course is that in the whole
metaphor of balancing the public good and

00:55:17.410 --> 00:55:23.029
following the law, or moral or however you'd
like to define the anti torture position,

00:55:23.029 --> 00:55:28.200
the premise of that of course is that torture
is the only way to get information under certain

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:34.450
circumstances, that it is indeed effective
and I think all evidence shows, or at least

00:55:34.450 --> 00:55:37.900
suggests, that Obama does not believe that.

00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:43.099
It's clear that former Vice President Cheney
does believe it fervently and one can't just

00:55:43.099 --> 00:55:48.269
say as many writers I admire do, "Well, torture
doesn't work."

00:55:48.269 --> 00:55:52.230
I think there is to some degree an open question
on that.

00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:57.230
I mean, some interrogators believe it does
work but an awful lot believe it doesn't,

00:55:57.230 --> 00:56:02.279
that it just gives bad information, that it
makes it harder to get information.

00:56:02.279 --> 00:56:06.730
I think if you took a consensus of sort of
professionals who do interrogation, the overwhelming

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:10.420
majority would say this stuff doesn't work,
it's a bad idea.

00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:16.940
However, to be honest, there's no way to judge
 - the Vice President continually says, "We

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:19.839
would have been attacked, we would have been
attacked."

00:56:19.839 --> 00:56:24.950
If you look at the evidence he's given to
date, it's very, very thin.

00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:31.829
He continually says, "I have secret documents
that will prove this, but alas they're classified."

00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:36.200
My view is that I had hoped that the Obama
Administration would essentially appoint,

00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:42.809
boring as it sounds, a high level commission
like the 9/11 Commission for all of its flaws,

00:56:42.809 --> 00:56:48.259
to investigate this thoroughly, to look at
what was done and what information was actually

00:56:48.259 --> 00:56:53.299
gained, and to weigh that against the damage
that this stuff did to the country.

00:56:53.299 --> 00:57:00.200
Because you know the war, and what you weigh
against torture is not just that it's immoral

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:05.329
or not just that it's illegal, which by the
way it is but the political damage you do

00:57:05.329 --> 00:57:06.849
yourself.

00:57:06.849 --> 00:57:10.759
Obama has talked about this frequently and
it was particularly in the context of closing

00:57:10.759 --> 00:57:16.170
Guantanamo, and I saw this myself in Iraq,
that Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo became huge

00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:17.420
issues throughout the Muslim world.

00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:24.450
I mean, you see on murals on the street, hooded
man on the box with the wires, leashed men,

00:57:24.450 --> 00:57:31.609
Lynndie England holding the leash with a naked
Iraqi prisoner on the ground sort of scrunched,

00:57:31.609 --> 00:57:33.959
with his face scrunched in agony.

00:57:33.959 --> 00:57:37.849
These things are extremely vivid issues in
what is, at the end of the day, a political

00:57:37.849 --> 00:57:38.849
war.

00:57:38.849 --> 00:57:42.220
I mean, we're not going to win this year by
killing all Jihadists.

00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:48.049
What eventually has to happen is that the
political impetus for joining these groups,

00:57:48.049 --> 00:57:51.539
or supporting these groups, has to be diminished
largely through political means.

00:57:51.539 --> 00:57:56.370
And Obama, I think to his great credit, realizes
that and that's why he want to Cairo and that

00:57:56.370 --> 00:58:00.210
is I think one of the main reasons he's been
quite outspoken about torture.

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:02.750
I mean, he mentions it repeatedly.

00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:08.460
It's just when it comes to the policy side
that his administration, it seems to me, is

00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:12.079
starting to hesitate about whether it's worth
it to push these things all the way.

00:58:12.079 --> 00:58:16.259
But to go back to your question, I see no
evidence that he has determined that this

00:58:16.259 --> 00:58:20.039
stuff is useful. I mean, he hasn't reinstituted
the policies so -

00:58:20.039 --> 00:58:22.740
&gt;&gt; Can I follow that up with two comments,
questions?

00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:23.940
&gt;&gt;Mark Danner: Sure. Yeah.

00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:28.600
So one of them is I think that if someone
full-heartedly believed that torture would

00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:34.200
absolutely save a thousand lives or ten thousand
lives, I think they would still, for most

00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:36.491
people, have a big moral issue with doing
it.

00:58:36.491 --> 00:58:42.170
So my question is if it doesn't work and if
the people who are participating in it are

00:58:42.170 --> 00:58:46.640
not seeing any results, why is this still
a discussion that's being had?

00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:49.170
Mark Danner: Well, let me just jump in there
quickly.

00:58:49.170 --> 00:58:55.089
I'm certainly not arguing that everyone who
used it didn't believe it worked.

00:58:55.089 --> 00:58:56.809
There's certainly people who believe it worked.

00:58:56.809 --> 00:59:03.260
There's no question about that and one shouldn't
be ambivalent about answering that.

00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:06.440
It's not just the Vice President -- there
were other people who believed it worked.

00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:10.849
It should be said also that some people involved
in the interrogations, including some have

00:59:10.849 --> 00:59:14.329
come out publicly, believe that it was a terrible
mistake.

00:59:14.329 --> 00:59:20.380
So I would never stand here and say everybody
who was involved in this thinks it's a waste

00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:22.140
of time and they shouldn't do it.

00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:23.670
I would not argue that.

00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:26.859
If it were true, we wouldn't really be having
this discussion.

00:59:26.859 --> 00:59:34.849
&gt;&gt; And on this -- you made a point about trying
to end terrorism with politics and that sort

00:59:34.849 --> 00:59:37.407
of thing, that I really think I disagree with
you because -

00:59:37.407 --> 00:59:39.890
Mark Danner: I didn't say 'end'. I said 'diminish'.

00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:43.680
&gt;&gt; Right, so my point is like the speech that
Obama made in Cairo was very good.

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:46.880
And to the best of my knowledge, there's no
evidence that anything has changed in terms

00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:49.769
of the Islamic world is one point.

00:59:49.769 --> 00:59:53.380
And the other point on something like Abu
Gharaib, obviously that was a disgusting thing.

00:59:53.380 --> 01:00:01.510
I don't know the details about how much the
higher levels knew about it but it seems to

01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:19.670
me that a lot of the Islamic world, the people
that get motivated to go out and blow themselves

01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:24.030
up, they believe for instance that the Jews
were responsible for 9/11.

01:00:24.030 --> 01:00:25.579
It's very widely believed that Israel wants
to be the - I don't remember the term but

01:00:25.579 --> 01:00:26.579
that huge, big country that's ten times bigger
than Israel is what many of them believe Israel

01:00:26.579 --> 01:00:27.579
seeks to become.

01:00:27.579 --> 01:00:28.579
Things that are not based on any evidence
so this is just that that culture is not one

01:00:28.579 --> 01:00:34.650
that values truth as much as it should and
so they are very easy to - they become vulnerable

01:00:34.650 --> 01:00:43.900
to all kinds of propaganda and we, to the
best of my knowledge, even the Bush administration

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:44.900
and Dick Cheney were opposed to what happened
with Abu Gharaib.

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:48.829
Mark Danner: Well, okay, let me jump in there
because you raised a lot of points.

01:00:48.829 --> 01:00:51.920
The first point was about the effect of Obama's
speech.

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:56.099
I didn't say his speech would end terrorism
or anything else.

01:00:56.099 --> 01:00:58.779
It's obvious that terrorism will continue.

01:00:58.779 --> 01:01:02.589
There will be more terrorism because there
was terrorism before 9/11.

01:01:02.589 --> 01:01:05.109
It's not going to go away.

01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:10.799
It's been with us for centuries literally
and it's very effective in some ways but I

01:01:10.799 --> 01:01:15.670
would completely disagree with you when you
say that there's no evidence that his speech

01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:16.670
had any effect.

01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:23.759
Public opinion polls in much of the Muslim
world show that the sort of catastrophic fall

01:01:23.759 --> 01:01:31.180
in the opinion of the United States has certainly
been reversed since Obama has become President.

01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:36.839
I think the question is what would you take
as evidence for the speech having been effective?

01:01:36.839 --> 01:01:44.089
And it seems to me incontrovertible that this
war, at the end of day, has political sources.

01:01:44.089 --> 01:01:48.000
I mean, you pointed to a lot of them yourself
in the second part of your question which

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.390
has to do with attitudes about the United
States.

01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:56.551
These are real things that people believe
and it makes no sense to me that in some way

01:01:56.551 --> 01:02:02.529
changing the behavior and also the rhetoric
of the US would have no effect whatever on

01:02:02.529 --> 01:02:06.380
people's perceptions of the US and their behavior.

01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:07.519
Now, will it change everyone's?

01:02:07.519 --> 01:02:09.540
Of course not, it won't.

01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:15.999
The roots of the struggle with Al Qaeda and
you can point this out by looking at Obama's

01:02:15.999 --> 01:02:20.460
speech itself, he talks in Cairo and it was
an eloquent speech.

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:25.130
I urge people who didn't see it to have a
look at it, it's very much worth looking at

01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:29.579
but the fact remains that he was standing
there in Cairo in the shadow of one of the

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:33.450
autocracies that these guys
are really jazzed about, these guys meaning

01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:34.450
Al Qaeda.

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:39.210
The Mubarak regime and the House of Saud,
in Saudi Arabia, are the two regimes that

01:02:39.210 --> 01:02:40.210
they are desperate to get rid of.

01:02:40.210 --> 01:02:41.210
Why?

01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:45.410
Because they believe that they're an apostate,
they believe they're illegitimate, they believe

01:02:45.410 --> 01:02:50.289
they should replaced by Islamic
governments and they having tried to remove

01:02:50.289 --> 01:02:56.310
them directly, especially Egypt and having
been crushed by Egypt's security forces, they

01:02:56.310 --> 01:03:00.999
then turned - that was the near enemy - they
then turned to the far enemy, the United States,

01:03:00.999 --> 01:03:06.509
because the US is perceived as the major backer
of the House of Saud and the Mubarak regime

01:03:06.509 --> 01:03:12.020
to which one should say the US does give two
billion dollars a year so the US is a major

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:13.020
backer.

01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:16.740
So, from their point of view, you attack the
United States to try to remove these regimes.

01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:23.249
Now, is there something we can do about that?
Well, Obama has not begun to change policy

01:03:23.249 --> 01:03:28.430
in any way but I would say that this is a
political problem that's recognizable.

01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:33.490
It has to do with political modernization,
which is a tendentious term, but I think it's

01:03:33.490 --> 01:03:36.460
true when it comes to Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:39.289
It comes from a lack of representation in
those countries.

01:03:39.289 --> 01:03:44.530
It comes from the frustration of a very youth
based population and in the case of Egypt,

01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:50.599
a highly educated population and in the case
of Saudi Arabia, a very rich population, that

01:03:50.599 --> 01:03:55.970
has greats frustration about not getting jobs,
about not having opportunity.

01:03:55.970 --> 01:04:01.059
A lot of things that it seems to me you can
trace to not having governments that are in

01:04:01.059 --> 01:04:02.109
any way representative.

01:04:02.109 --> 01:04:06.230
I mean, Egypt has been ruled for thirty years
under a state of emergency, has a terrible

01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:12.960
torture regime so you know during the Cold
War, the US supported autocracies in Latin

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:14.010
America, very similar.

01:04:14.010 --> 01:04:21.890
How do you support political modernization
without having a Communist regime come in?

01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:25.690
Here, how do you support political modernization
without having an Islamic regime come in?

01:04:25.690 --> 01:04:30.849
Because if you had a free election in Egypt
or Saudi Arabia, you'd probably have an Islamic

01:04:30.849 --> 01:04:33.230
regime and that is a real political problem.

01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:37.109
So I don't think it just has to do with culture,
I don't think it has to do with misperceptions

01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:40.619
but I do think it has a political answer and
I think this administration knows that and

01:04:40.619 --> 01:04:47.150
is trying to do something about it, however
difficult it is.

01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:51.960
&gt;&gt; Thanks for coming. I was wondering on the
topic of the political climate in America

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:55.799
and something that I've wondered is at least
five or six years ago, one absolutely unequivocal

01:04:55.799 --> 01:05:01.921
voice that torture by Americans is wrong was
John McCain -- he is a leading figure in the

01:05:01.921 --> 01:05:05.430
Republican party. Why didn't he ever have
any influence?

01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:08.940
Mark Danner: [laughs] These are all extremely
hard questions.

01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:14.670
I don't know why I'm looking at Ann but someone
has to be responsible.

01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:15.670
You're right.

01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:18.509
McCain had a long history of opposing torture.

01:05:18.509 --> 01:05:25.069
He was tortured very brutally by the North
Vietnamese when he was a prisoner in Hanoi

01:05:25.069 --> 01:05:35.559
and there's a gruesome account of that in
his memoir and in 2004 or 2005 - 2006, he

01:05:35.559 --> 01:05:42.299
was involved very directly in trying to mitigate
these policies and he was involved directly

01:05:42.299 --> 01:05:46.530
in the Detainee Treatment Act and the Military
Commissions Act.

01:05:46.530 --> 01:05:52.570
And he would claim, I think, that he was responsible
for putting a stop to waterboarding, among

01:05:52.570 --> 01:05:53.769
other things.

01:05:53.769 --> 01:05:59.900
Whether or not that's true, I don't know but
I do remember vividly I was in Washington

01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:02.660
to - people remember the Baker Commission?

01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:03.660
On Iraq.

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:08.599
I went there to testify to it and I remember
getting up, opening the door -- they have

01:06:08.599 --> 01:06:11.619
the newspaper waiting for you on the floor
there outside your room.

01:06:11.619 --> 01:06:18.200
And there was the Washington Post and the
headline, I wish I could quote it verbatim

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:24.269
but it was "McCain's Position on Torture May
Damage Nomination Hopes", front page.

01:06:24.269 --> 01:06:28.740
And I looked at this and thought, "Wow, what
a headline", and took the paper and read it

01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:33.400
and the piece was this amazing piece of journalism
in which there was really no news, all it

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:37.750
was was people, most of them unnamed, within
the Republican party saying, "Well, you know

01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:42.180
if John keeps after this issue, I don't know
whether he can get the nomination. The security

01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:44.789
hawks are going to be very alienated by this."

01:06:44.789 --> 01:06:50.119
So the whole thing was kind a letter to McCain
saying "you better hold off on this stuff

01:06:50.119 --> 01:06:53.549
or you're going to have trouble getting the
nomination".

01:06:53.549 --> 01:07:01.249
And I think, for political reasons, and indeed
we say that as if it's a curse, he is a politician.

01:07:01.249 --> 01:07:06.520
I think he did hold off to some degree on
this issue, although it should be said to

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:12.110
be fair to him, in the Republican primary
debates - I don't know of - God, to think

01:07:12.110 --> 01:07:14.359
of that, I wish I could get those out of my
head.

01:07:14.359 --> 01:07:19.369
But the debates during the primaries leading
up to his getting the Republican nomination,

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:26.299
at one point, I don't remember where it was
but Mitt Romney sort of said, "Close Guantanamo?

01:07:26.299 --> 01:07:29.640
We need more Guantanamos?"

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:36.410
More Guantanamos, more torture and Mc Cain
very aggressively took him on, on television,

01:07:36.410 --> 01:07:40.759
and sort of said, "No, this is wrong. You
are completely wrong about this. I know about

01:07:40.759 --> 01:07:41.759
torture."

01:07:41.759 --> 01:07:50.411
So he still remained kind of a spokesman on
this issue throughout the campaign but I think

01:07:50.411 --> 01:07:53.660
you're quite right, that he hasn't gone against
his party on this issue.

01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:59.210
And I would have real respect for him if he
came out against the Vice President and criticized

01:07:59.210 --> 01:08:05.260
him and he indeed has not done that and has
not been helpful on the Guantanamo issue either.

01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:09.269
And I think one could speculate on whether
he's moving to the right.

01:08:09.269 --> 01:08:13.920
He has a primary challenge in Arizona from
J.D. Hayworth and in general, he's perceived

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:20.210
to be moving to the right but the story of
McCain is a very interesting one when it comes

01:08:20.210 --> 01:08:25.539
to the general issue of torture and politics
which is one of my subjects today obviously.

01:08:25.539 --> 01:08:26.539
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

01:08:26.539 --> 01:08:27.539
Mark Danner: You're welcome.

01:08:27.539 --> 01:08:31.370
Sandy Deason: Well, that's all the time we
have for today.

01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:32.370
Thank you so much for coming.

01:08:32.370 --> 01:08:33.370
Mark Danner: Thank you.

01:08:33.370 --> 01:08:34.370
Thanks everybody for coming.

01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:35.370
[applause]

01:08:35.370 --> 01:08:35.373
It's a pleasure.
