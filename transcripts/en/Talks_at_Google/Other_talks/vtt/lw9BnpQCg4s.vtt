00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:07.180
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: Welcome everybody to another
issue of Authors at Google, here in the Santa

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:15.740
Monica office. I'm very delighted to welcome
Glen Creason today, a librarian at the Los

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.009
Angeles Public Library, who has worked in
the map department for over 20 years and he

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:30.820
has quite a few stories to tell us about the
maps that have been produced on Los Angeles.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.251
And I welcome Glen Creason. Thank you.

00:00:33.251 --> 00:00:36.610
[applause]

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:47.640
&gt;&gt;Glen: Good afternoon. This is something
to see this building. I come from Central

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.711
Library downtown, where I was telling Chris
we don't even have pencils anymore; has something

00:00:54.711 --> 00:01:03.160
to do with the budget and the mayor. Anyway,
I feel like I'm really, really lucky because

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:11.880
in 1989, there was a fire in the library in
1986. And in 1989, we moved the library to

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.500
temporary quarters and it was so difficult.
It was at 4th and Spring; it's a very dicey

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.609
neighborhood. The map librarian decided to
call it quits, so I ended up getting this

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:29.420
job and I was an English major at UCLA. I'm
not a cartographer and I have no scientific

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.229
background. I really didn't know anything,
so I literally started going drawer by drawer

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.329
and looking at the maps and trying to figure
out what they were. And so, in this process,

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:48.569
is this working? Can everyone hear me? OK.
Over the years, I just fell in love with these

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:55.829
maps and I realized that in looking at maps,
you learn so much about Los Angeles' history.

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.700
And the more you look at it, the more you
will learn. And you read them like they are

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.350
books and there are some of the maps that
are in this book you can literally spend weeks

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.700
with. I'm not gonna spends weeks with them,
but I'll try to keep this, you can tell me

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:19.489
when it's time to stop because I tend to just
keep talking. I also wanted to mention that

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:26.960
my experience in Santa Monica was when I was
a hippie a long time ago and I worked at a

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:34.480
glassworks at 10th and Pico with these hippies,
but I found out it's not a good business concept

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.400
to have hippies working for you cause they
tend to smoke hash and go to the beach instead

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.019
of doing their work, so. Anyway, I grew up
in Southgate and that's the first map I put

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:55.760
up there to show you it's about 20 miles away
from Santa Monica. It's a blue collar suburb

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:05.330
and not much to say about Southgate, except
that it used to be where General Motors was.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.780
&gt;&gt;audience #1: When were you there? In Southgate.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.769
&gt;&gt;Glen: In Southgate? In the 50s and 60s.

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.159
&gt;&gt;audience #1: [inaudible]

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.069
&gt;&gt;Glen: Really? Well, I was there one year
later.

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.130
&gt;&gt;audience #1: [inaudible]

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.160
&gt;&gt;Glen: Really.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.250
&gt;&gt;audience #1: [inaudible]

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.310
[Glen laughs]

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.379
&gt;&gt;presenter: [inaudible]

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.469
&gt;&gt;Glen: OK. Sure.

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:31.569
&gt;&gt;audience #1: [inaudible]

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:38.349
&gt;&gt;Glen: Well, I just threw this in because
I think it's interesting in that this is a

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:43.810
very early map of the coast of California.
Originally, there was a misconception that

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.230
lasted through, all throughout the 18th Century
that California was an island. And this is,

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:59.069
they corrected that eventually and this is
a map of the coast of California, where they

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:04.689
actually call it the City of the Angels, cause
that was the original name of the city and

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:10.830
the city was the City of Los Angeles de--,
I can't even pronounce Porciúncula, but it's

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:17.440
the river; Los Angeles River. One of the first
maps I wanted to use in the book, and this

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:24.970
does look pretty compressed, this is the Kirkman
Harriman Map. It was created by a very eccentric

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:32.220
columnist at the Los Angeles Times. Kirkman
Harriman, as it turns out, was a man who was

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.490
one of the first people to care for the indigent
in Los Angeles and he ran the county farm

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.660
where they would literally take care of homeless
people and so forth. I believe that he did

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:52.860
a lot of the research on this because he tracked
a lot of these kinds of things. Anyway, they

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.700
created this map and it's amazing in that
it was done in 1938, but it portrays the area

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:06.669
in 1860. And the thing about it is there's
layers of historical fact in this map. It

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:14.440
shows the early trails, the roads that people
traveled on, it shows battle sites and it

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.069
shows where the Indian villages were. And
I think there's a small misconception that

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:25.050
there wasn't much of a Native American presence
here and there was much more than you would

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:31.550
expect. That's what Santa Monica looks like
on this map and you can see there were villages

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:37.300
here. It was the Tongva Indians and further
north it was the Chumash Indians. Eventually,

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:45.720
they named them; they called them Gabrielinos,
or the Fernandinos, which is really an Anglo

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:52.050
naming of the Tongva Indians. They formed
the original settlement here, which was Yang-na,

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.449
which was here thousands of years; they thrived.
This was one of the most successful tribes

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:05.349
in North America, actually. But they lived
in a Stone Age. They didn't really need to

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:09.950
do much more than what they were doing, which
was enjoy this beautiful weather and this

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.870
harsh winter day here in Santa Monica.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.639
[laughter]

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:22.280
And they dug things out of the sand, they
fished, they hunted and they very rarely fought.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:30.621
This was a very, until the Spaniards came
there was very little conflict for them. Also,

00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:36.639
on this map you'll see these battle sites.
Those little crossed swords at the top of

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:41.030
this, right here, you can see that's still
Los Angeles River at the top flowing through

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:48.200
there. That is like the Cahuenga Pass right
there. And that's the Battle of La Providencia.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:55.919
That was a battle in which California fought
the Americans and because in this area, most

00:06:55.919 --> 00:07:00.710
of the battle were fought between family and
friends. They didn't really kill people, they

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.090
just kind of, too bad people don't do that
now, if they had drive-by shootings where

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:11.919
they'd shoot into the air. So, in this battle,
they actually only killed a mule and injured

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:20.180
a horse and that was the casualties for the
Battle of La Providencia. You can see at the

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:25.879
heart of this map, the thing that amazes me
about it is if you took this and reproduced

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:32.080
it on a transparency, you could put this right
over a map of the freeways today and you'd

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:40.870
be amazed to see how many of these trails
end up being freeways, or major thoroughfares.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:45.830
So, it's actually, on this map, you'll see,
Yes.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.970
&gt;&gt;audience #2: When was this map created?

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.470
&gt;&gt;Glen: It was created in 1938, but it portrays
1860.

00:07:52.470 --> 00:08:01.370
&gt;&gt;audience #2: Just to repeat, this is as,
intended to look as it did in 1860--

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.330
&gt;&gt;Glen: 1860, but it's layered with historical--

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.930
&gt;&gt;audience #2: Right, well are we seeing 1770,
January 16th here, so--

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:13.570
&gt;&gt;Glen: Right, those would be the events that
happened and a lot of the, when the Spanish

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:20.539
explorers came through here, first they just
sailed by in the 1540s and it looked nice,

00:08:20.539 --> 00:08:28.250
but they just kept going. Then eventually,
they had these inland expeditions and they

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:37.060
were commissioned by Spanish government to
seek out and create missions that would be

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:48.680
a backbone of civilization. So, on this map
you're gonna see up there, oh, you can see

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:58.140
Eagle Rock. There's Hollywood over there and
the roads going south, that would be like

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:06.519
the 110 freeway and you can actually see the
San Bernardino freeway there, the Hollywood

00:09:06.519 --> 00:09:14.839
freeway. All these, even though these maps
existed in the past and the present and also

00:09:14.839 --> 00:09:23.320
they're going to continue, the Mexican colonial,
Spanish colonial American period, they also

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:34.820
meld together in this one historical flow.
Which is why I threw this in because I thought

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:41.010
this was quite interesting. This is de Anza's,
the de Anza's trail as he came through here

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:46.779
and studying it historically, we can see that
he took the 101 to the 134 and then he got

00:09:46.779 --> 00:09:47.779
on the 60, headed out toward--

00:09:47.779 --> 00:09:48.779
[laughter]

00:09:48.779 --> 00:09:49.779
&gt;&gt;audience #3: That's what he wrote and he
said--

00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:55.910
&gt;&gt;audience #4: And there was a Sigalert up
there, heading towards the County Fair.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:06.120
&gt;&gt;Glen: The other, the next period really,
after of course the native Americans is the

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:13.190
Spanish and Mexican colonial periods where
they divided the city, or the area, into these

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:20.540
ranchos. And at first, it was a very, it was
1783. It was the first rancho and it was a

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:27.950
very informal process in which the people
that had settled here originally they actually

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:36.529
brought 44 people up here. Eleven families
came up here from Mexico on foot; walked up

00:10:36.529 --> 00:10:45.660
and in 1781, founded the Pueblo of Los Angeles.
And then, as time went on, they needed a place

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:52.070
to graze their cattle and so forth, so they
would just ask the governor, "May I have land?"

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:57.771
And they would be granted these ranchos. And
in some cases, I think one of the ranchos,

00:10:57.771 --> 00:11:05.279
Tijuana, he asked the governor and he said,
"Sure, you can have the land to the water."

00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:10.980
And that went from Compton to the Pacific
Ocean. Some of these ranchos were absolutely

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:24.760
immense. That's the Treaty of Guadalupe of
Hidalgo, which we'll get to later. The other

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:34.180
thing about these, actually the ranch showed
here is ironically entitled Rancho Santa Monica,

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:41.590
or one of them. There's Boca de Santa Monica,
also. At the center of all these ranchos is

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:47.440
the four square leads and that was granted
by the Spanish government. Where it says "Pueblo

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:57.600
de Los Angeles" that was an area that was
basically given to the government of the city.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:07.639
And it's quite important that they controlled
that little area and we'll see why this city

00:12:07.639 --> 00:12:13.990
grew because there are reasons why they were
able to annex all this territory all around

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:23.089
the city and it has to do with having this
right from the Spanish crown. I did a program

00:12:23.089 --> 00:12:34.040
with DJ Waldie, who's a historian. He was
called a rock star historian. Anyway, he explained

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.940
why Los Angeles is crooked--

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.910
&gt;&gt;audience #5: [inaudible]

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.220
&gt;&gt;Glen: Yeah.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.530
[Glen laughs]

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:47.740
Geographically crooked. It goes back to a
Roman ideals of the way you should lay out

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:53.839
a city and it was supposedly that you would
cock the streets at a 45 degree angle, but

00:12:53.839 --> 00:12:59.389
in Los Angeles, because of the geography and
the way the city was set up, it's actually

00:12:59.389 --> 00:13:07.029
38%. So the city is kind of, and you'll see
that in later maps and the maps that are used

00:13:07.029 --> 00:13:12.389
in the book, you'll see later when they started
trying to create a grid like cities on the

00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:20.300
East Coast, you'll see that the Pueblos tilted
to the side. But then again, it was all based

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:25.070
on this premise that the winds blew from the
North, South, East and West, which they don't

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:29.740
always do that. Not even in Santa Monica,
so.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.190
[Glen clears throat]

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:42.329
Yes? Oh, this. I skipped one.

00:13:42.329 --> 00:13:44.550
[pause]

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:52.040
You know, I think those are supposed to be
the missions. Although, there is an extra

00:13:52.040 --> 00:14:00.380
one there. Oh, you know what that is? That's
the plaza. That's the plaza church, cause

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:12.380
that was the center. That was the center of
the pueblo. Now, even though this is a pictorial

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:17.850
map and people think of it as plebeian, I
just wanted to use it in the book because

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:23.740
it shows how the city was laid out; how the
whole area was laid out. And because this

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:28.620
is a typical deseño, these were the maps
that were done of the rancho. And you can

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:36.690
see this looks like something that maybe your
kid did in 3rd grade, but surveying was so

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:42.180
primitive in those days, the way they measured
these ranchos is they would take two horsemen

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:48.839
on racing horses with a big rope in-between
them and they would ride like this; back and

00:14:48.839 --> 00:14:55.980
forth, back and forth. And that's how they
would measure. But once statehood came, the

00:14:55.980 --> 00:15:01.680
people that were gonna buy these ranchos;
they didn't want to rely on that kind of loose.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:08.880
So anyway, we'll get to that about how they
actually did survey these later on. This represents

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:16.380
two different things. This is what's called
the land case map and first it represents

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:22.800
the missions, which were these outposts of
civilization. And of all the missions along

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:27.690
California, Mission San Gabriel is probably
the most successful mission; the one that

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:35.620
really worked the best. But in 1833, they
secularized all the missions and they basically,

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:44.329
eventually sold those lands and they became
part of other ranchos. Now, when the Mexican

00:15:44.329 --> 00:15:50.800
government took over, and this is a very loose
control of the Californians who lived here,

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:56.380
the Californians who lived in Los Angeles
area paid very little attention to government.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:57.380
So--

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.380
&gt;&gt;audience #6: [inaudible]

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:09.759
&gt;&gt;Glen: No. [laughing] So, once that Treaty
of Guadalupe Hidalgo was settled, the US and

00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:15.670
Mexico they said, "We will recognize these
rancho lands." So, they heaved a sigh of relief

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:22.899
while these rancho owners. Unfortunately,
when statehood came, Uncle Sam wanted taxes

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:30.860
paid and this was not a cash economy here.
Most of these people were cattle ranchers

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:36.580
and would literally drive Longhorn cattle
from here all the way up to San Francisco.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:45.350
So, they basically had to sell their land
and the US government said that you have to

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:50.860
prove your title to the lands. And that meant
that they had to hire lawyers, they had to

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:57.540
survey the property, they had to send people
all the way up to Washington, DC for these

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:06.100
hearings. And these would take 15, 18 years.
In the meantime, they were completely drained

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:15.690
and most of the, or many, of these rancho
owners who lived this very beautiful, idyllic

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:22.460
life that you picture old California, like
the old Zorro episodes, they ended up in Sonora

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:28.700
Town, which is where Alvera Street is now;
absolutely impoverished with not a penny to

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:35.710
their names. This particular map here represents
the case of William Workman, who was at one

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:42.050
time mayor of Los Angeles, and one of the
very first bankers. And he was ruined by this

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:53.530
and he eventually actually committed suicide.
This is what the city looked like. This was

00:17:53.530 --> 00:18:00.860
a sketch done by a German artist. He's an
engineer and an artist. As they came down,

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:04.790
they were trying to find a rail route for
the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean. There

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:10.110
was no railroads in Los Angeles until the
1870s. So, they were trying to determine a

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:20.670
route to take and this is a sketch that this
German artist, Coppel, made. And you can see,

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:24.860
I guess I can't use a pointer, right? Or,
is there a pointer?

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.680
&gt;&gt;presenter: [inaudible]

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:31.240
&gt;&gt;Glen: I can actually point.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.060
&gt;&gt;presenter: [inaudible]

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:38.050
&gt;&gt;Glen: See this right there? That's the plaza
church. This is taken if you were climbing

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:45.870
up the hill towards Dodger Stadium looking
down, there's actually Main Street and if

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:52.550
you look at this map closely and it is reproduced
in the book and fairly large, apparently somebody

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:59.430
on Amazon didn't like my book because they
thought they should be able to use it like

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:00.430
a road atlas, so--

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:01.430
[laughter]

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:03.520
but a good, old magnifying glass will work
and you can see the oldest building in Los

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:11.210
Angeles, is the Villa Adobe, and you can see
it on this. You can see, basically, the plaza

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:18.910
and you see where Main Street was. And I'm
not sure what that building is in the foreground,

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:24.780
but normally they would put the jail on the
outskirts of any of these plazas. There's

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:33.460
a close-up so you can see. It looks all nice,
but Los Angeles in 1853 was anything but nice.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:41.210
It was very much Wild West and wild and wooly
and well, one of my favorite stories is one

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:47.220
of the more wealthy owners, land owners, in
Los Angeles was Abel Sterns and he had a party.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:52.400
He had the nicest place in Los Angeles and
he had a party and some party crashers showed

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:57.420
up and the way they handled that was they
just stuck rifles out the window and fired

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:08.150
them until the crowd of the and that discouraged
them. It worked. Now, we've come to the first

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:17.420
surveyed map of Los Angeles. This is Orin's
survey. This was done in 1949 and it's all

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:24.850
about the money. So, the city realizes that
the American government wants them to pay

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:32.840
taxes; the state of it is here and they don't
really have any money. So, they're gonna sell

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:41.730
city lands and they are gonna measure it exactly.
You can see on here, originally the settlers

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:49.120
who came here, the 44 original settlers. Actually,
two of them were deemed too lazy and they

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:56.700
were sent home after a year. It's a good lesson
for the boss that's in the crowd. You can

00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:05.170
see, and all of this was laid out as part
of the Spanish ideal of the way of pueblo.

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:13.680
The streets had to be a plaza of a certain
size. The lots were only like, 40 by 90 and

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:19.140
this is something that happened and continued
to happen right up into the 20th Century.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:24.770
They would name the cities in both Spanish
and English. So you see Calle Loma, that's

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:35.790
Hill Street. There's Acetuna; is Olive Street.
14, that became Broadway; that's 4th Street

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:43.530
and Principal. That's interesting because
Spring Street, I think people also ask the

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:50.030
question, "What was the spring? Where does
the spring come from?" Well, Spring is actually

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:56.670
Orin's girlfriend and then he called her Prima
Vera, so he named a street after her. Yes.

00:21:56.670 --> 00:22:00.430
&gt;&gt;audience #7: [inaudible]

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:06.560
&gt;&gt;Glen: It's, let's see. Yeah, like that way.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.310
[pause]

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:17.990
Now, the original Ord survey was something
they made up; it was on four sheets of paper

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:23.100
and they just stuck them together. There is
no original of the Orin. If anybody tries

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:30.600
to sell you the original Orin survey, don't
buy it. But this map is one of the first maps

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:35.970
in which they used the Ord survey and you
can really see they have really created a

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:44.840
proper grid. Now, the outlying lands, those
rectangles there, are called donation lots

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:52.370
and they're 35 acres in size and at the middle
is the original pueblo. This, again, this

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:59.340
city is 80 thousand dollars in debt and they're
gonna sell these properties. So, you could

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:07.520
buy one of these donation lots for a small
fee and if you're able to improve it over

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:15.400
the space of a year then you got title to
that land. So this is also, I just wanted

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:22.760
to mention that two of the early, real, real
big shots of Los Angeles are a man, George

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:27.050
Hanson, who is an Austrian immigrant and a
man named William Moore, and they were both

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:32.890
surveyors. And they're the ones that surveyed
all this land which was eventually was sold

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:39.540
in the city; became solvent by selling off
the land. Also, I love William Moore. He's

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:46.170
my hero because he's the guy who was impatient.
He was in San Francisco and he wanted to come

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:51.590
to Los Angeles; he saw opportunities here
and he didn't think the trains went fast enough,

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:56.810
so he walked from San Francisco to Los Angeles.

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:57.940
[pause]

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:05.660
&gt;&gt;audience #8: I'm looking at that layout
now and you said that it's a 35 acre rectangle,

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:12.790
which I guess is seven by five. But the nominal
layouts, more recently, tended to be townships;

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:19.470
160 acre pieces. So, when does that transition
take place, or am I not remembering that right?

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:25.910
&gt;&gt;Glen: No, that's true and the original settlers
were given both a lot within the pueblo and

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:32.450
a thing called the "suerte," which would be
agricultural purposes. These sold for about

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:38.860
a dollar an acre, too. So, it would have been
a pretty good investment.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:46.100
&gt;&gt;audience #8: I wish [inaudible].

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:56.710
&gt;&gt;Glen: Yeah.So, this is actually called the
Hanson Survey. This is one of my absolute

00:24:56.710 --> 00:25:03.180
favorites. This is a Stevenson map; not so
impressive like this, but this is truly a

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:11.740
map that you can read like a book. And I like
it because you see the river running through

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:20.450
the right, slightly off-center, so you'll
see both East Los Angeles and the Los Angeles

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:25.560
that we know of that's like where downtown
is now. You can also see there's--

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.280
&gt;&gt;audience #8: [inaudible]

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:36.030
&gt;&gt;Glen: where the Dodger's have been playing
poorly for the last 20 years, or at least

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:42.970
in a mediocre way. In the upper right hand
corner, that's where Highland Park is in the

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:52.500
Northeast. On this, you can see right in the
middle there, that's Echo Park. That's the

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:57.590
reservoir. You can see there's Chavez Ravine
to the right; it's pretty easy to spot. The

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:03.770
other body of water you can see up in the
top left there, that is what's Silver Lake

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:16.170
Reservoir now. Now, the thing that makes it
even more interesting is that it's a plat

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:22.790
map, and a plat map shows you the owners of
the property. And this was done in 1884 and

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:29.540
I've seen others that were done in the 1870s
and you can see the names, the old Spanish

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:35.950
names, of the fundadoras people, the original
people. They start to disappear, but even

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:43.240
on this you can start to see Ramirez and Avila,
Sepulveda. But then, you're gonna see more

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:55.490
Keller and Childs and
Beaudry. Beaudry was a real big butter and

00:26:55.490 --> 00:27:04.260
egg man. And one of the points that I found
in research in this book is Los Angeles was

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:10.370
always very much a multi-cultural city right
from the beginning. It was not just a purely

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:16.120
Spanish city. There was as much French spoken
on the streets as there was Spanish. And there

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:28.080
were other languages: Russian, German, Chinese,
and all kinds of, it was a mixture of people.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:35.160
This is one of the main stories of Los Angeles
and where the city, I mean it would have stayed

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:42.720
the sleepy, little place; it would've been
like Santa Ana or something if they hadn't

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:48.510
conquered the water problem. So, this is the
original, the Zanja Madre. This is a map that

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:55.210
was done in 1875 to demonstrate this mother
ditch, which they dug off of the Los Angeles

00:27:55.210 --> 00:28:01.660
River. I mean, this started in 1781. Just
as soon as they arrived here, these families,

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:10.511
they started digging these ditches off the
river for all kinds of purposes. This is what

00:28:10.511 --> 00:28:16.500
it looked like. I mean, these guys were called
water carriers and they would literally fill

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:23.160
these jugs and walk around like a Peerless
water delivery guy. And water was so dear,

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:30.860
it would be like 50 cents a bucket and that
water from the LA River and those zanja's

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:38.510
did everything. You bathed in it, you washed
your dishes, you washed your animals, you

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:47.590
irrigated land, and I just threw in some pictures.
This is, those hatched lines, that's the Zanja

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:54.330
Madre as it passes through the pueblo. You
can see those names. The funny thing on this

00:28:54.330 --> 00:29:05.480
map is that so many of the property owners
were women. It's a time of history, but women

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:11.360
owned a lot of the property. Anyway, this
is the Zanja Madre and these women are washing

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:18.650
their clothes in there and you're gonna be
drinking that water. And then this is what

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:24.650
it looked like. It went through all different
kinds of manifestations and this water being

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:31.880
such a major thing; it also was always the
big political issue. And also, this is another

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:38.840
story the mayor, I think it was Marchessault,
he came with an idea that they were gonna

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:44.440
hollow out logs and run the water through
these logs and make water available to everybody.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.250
So, they spent all this money and they did
that and it didn't work and he went into the

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:54.650
City Council meeting and shot himself during
the council. And researching parts of the

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:59.830
book, I went to the archives and I got out
the city council meetings, and all it says,

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:04.940
it doesn't even mention the fact that a man
shot himself in the council chambers, it just

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:06.670
says that the meeting adjourned early.

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:11.190
[laughter]

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:18.290
So, this is part two of that water problem
is as early as 1861, they started realizing

00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:25.860
that they had to find a way to store the water
because the river is always a very unpredictable

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:32.740
thing, and there was lots of flooding and
they had trouble controlling it. So, they

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:42.890
set out to create reservoirs and build ditches
and this was the big money-maker. This is

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:54.460
where, uh-oh. There's a little storm there.
Anyway, again, the same guys, Hanson and William

00:30:54.460 --> 00:31:04.050
Moore and Prudent Beaudry, they all had different
ideas about building a reservoir and creating

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:09.550
a water company. So this is, right at the
middle there where you see that, that is Echo

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:16.150
Park and they did eventually build this. I
think this was done in like, 1878. They did

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:27.250
build these reservoirs and on the way, they
went through Silver like that also was a reservoir.

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:34.000
And one of the ways that people became very
wealthy, is they bought property around these,

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:41.400
and we'll see later. I hope I make it to when
the Huntington's became involved in the building

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:48.300
streetcars and see, there's the reservoir.
And you can see the names again. There's Beaudry's

00:31:48.300 --> 00:32:00.370
name, there's Child's and so those. And they
could rely on gravity to get it all; it went

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:05.520
down Glendale Boulevard and what we know as
Glendale Boulevard now. And when it got down

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:11.500
there, there's a 78 foot drop, so they built
a mill. They built like a big waterwheel and

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:19.070
they built a mill. That was the very first
industrial, first factory in the city of Los

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:29.080
Angeles, was this Woolen mill that they created
in making Echo Park Reservoir. This is also

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:36.360
just a, I'm gonna just touch on this-this
is an important concept. Again, there's those

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:41.370
35 acre lots and there's the river running
through there. The reason I threw this in

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:50.060
is because they managed to, a lot of the thrust
in Los Angeles, especially in the 1870s, 1880s,

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:56.290
was to remove themselves from the Spanish
colonial city. They were trying to make it

00:32:56.290 --> 00:33:00.260
an American city, but not when it came to
the river. When it came to the river, they

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:08.580
wanted to stay Mexican, because in Mexican,
in the Mexican tradition was the pueblo owns

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:14.950
the water. So, in the American system, if
your house butts up on the river, that water's

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:23.650
yours, but not in the Mexican or Spanish system.
So, the city of Los Angeles, somehow, kept

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:30.090
the river and owned the river. And so, since
water was dear to everybody in Southern California,

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:35.460
all these cities ended up joining Los Angeles
and that's how Los Angeles got so much bigger.

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:41.100
Especially like a place like the San Fernando
Valley, where they just needed water desperately,

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:46.650
so they, and Hollywood, too was annexed by
the city of Los Angeles because of the water.

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:53.370
So, this is a map. On one side, there's East
Los Angeles, but that's what this is. Again,

00:33:53.370 --> 00:34:00.760
they're selling the property to make money,
but they're keeping hold of that water. And

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:07.390
this is the other problem about water that
Los Angeles had, which was they needed to

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:14.350
control, they needed storm drainage and they
needed a sewage system. Once the city started

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:21.389
growing, and in the 1880s, the population
was doubling every decade. So, a lot more

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:27.211
people. I think they were building something
like, 110 houses a month. That's a lot of

00:34:27.211 --> 00:34:35.380
building, and in a city like this with like
60 thousand people. So, they had to build

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:40.710
roads, they had to bring in gas lines and
they to figure out something to do with this

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:47.401
sewage. So this is a map that was used in
a report that was done by who was the city

00:34:47.401 --> 00:34:52.720
engineer, a man named Fred Eaton. His name
pops up in Los Angeles history all over the

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:59.260
place. He was the mayor eventually and he's
the guy that eventually was able to get the

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:05.540
Los Angeles reservoir created and that was
huge in LA history. So, this is the map that

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:12.480
he and The Sanitarian of this European, Rudolph
Herring, came up with of building a sewage

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:24.770
system where the big problem always was, where
is all that sewage gonna end up? So, the outfall

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:34.990
problem is the major problem and what they,
in this plan, they just basically ran it out

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:39.310
towards Southeast County, which is where I
was born and raised.

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:40.310
&gt;&gt;audience #9: [inaudible]

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:45.360
&gt;&gt;Glen: So, you know, we had all this sewage
out there, but there were all these truck

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:52.440
farms and people that really wanted this water
and they paid good money for this grey water

00:35:52.440 --> 00:36:01.030
or brown water probably. But anyway, if you
look at the Los Angeles newspapers in this

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:08.720
period, like the 1880s, even up to the 1890s,
that's all they talk about is how the government

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:15.780
is corrupt in there. And they had a plan where
they were gonna put it into the ocean, but

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:24.070
they didn't have it far enough and some of
this has to do with Santa Monica, also. And

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:29.410
I purposely left out a couple of things in
doing this just because they're so complicated

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:35.661
that I felt like my brain might explode, so
one of them is the harbor where Santa Monica

00:36:35.661 --> 00:36:42.790
and Wilmington fought over the harbor. And
luckily, if you're people in Santa Monica,

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:50.250
Wilmington won out. But anyway, if you look
at the book, there's a bibliography and I

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:59.580
do recommend certain books that they go into
that harbor problem. This is one of the other

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:07.140
major, major things about why LA grew and
is the incredible rapid transit system we

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:13.780
have; best in the entire world. It's not just
some huckster, you know, somebody trying to

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:21.020
get people to move here, it was for real.
They had a great streetcar system. So, you

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:30.400
can see on this map this was done in 1912
and already Henry Huntington, Collis Huntington

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:35.970
was the president of the Southern Pacific
Railway, and his nephew was the one who basically,

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:42.140
there were two systems. There was the LARy
system, that was streetcars within the city

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:48.120
and then there was Pacific Electric that was
in outlying areas. Well, eventually, he combined

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:55.300
the two and then he sold everything. He got,
I don't know, I guess he made enough money

00:37:55.300 --> 00:38:02.490
because when they built all these rail lines,
they also bought all that property. So whereas

00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:10.890
before, a place like Azuza or Monrovia or
Downie, I mean, this would be like so far

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:15.760
out in the sticks nobody even knew it was
there. Now people could actually work in Los

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:22.450
Angeles and get on the streetcar and go there.
You could also go to, from downtown LA; you

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:28.490
could go to Venice and walk around for a nickel.
Or, you could go to the top Mount Lowe and

00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:37.380
stay in a hotel up there. And you can see
this goes all the way up to San Bernardino.

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:49.480
It, as Mr. Waldie said, it covered the county
like paint. And this is such a complex story

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:56.320
about the streetcars and what happened to
the streetcars. How am I doing for time?

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.460
&gt;&gt;presenter: [inaudible]

00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:05.000
&gt;&gt;Glen: I got 20 more? OK. I'll just keep
going and then just disconnect the electricity

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:14.610
when, anyway. So, I have to admit that I am
old enough that I rode the streetcars, and

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:19.890
this was my father's idea of making a man
out of my brother and I, which never really

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:25.380
worked. He made us take the streetcar to the
Coliseum and we sold programs at Ram and SC

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:32.330
and UCLA games. And basically, I got on the
streetcar at Huntington Park and rode it over

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:36.360
to Slawson and then took that to Vernon and
then walked. And after being beaten up and

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:45.960
having the money taken away from us, we walked
to the Coliseum. But anyway, you can see how

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:52.480
the PE, the Pacific Electric System, in 1912,
after Huntington sold it, they painted them

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:59.210
all red. So, you'll hear people, old people,
say "riding the red cars", "the big red cars"

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:05.590
and all that. They didn't maintain these cars.
There were like, 900 trains and they would

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:14.950
constantly going, and the traffic in downtown
Los Angeles was just terrible because of all

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:19.620
the streetcars and eventually, they didn't
maintain them; they started adding buses.

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:31.110
So, by 1930, whoops, by 1930 the tide had
turned away from streetcars and the automobile

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:37.660
started taking over, and I will touch on that.
But I did want to look at a few of these things

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:42.430
called panoramic maps that I personally love
and I think they're fun to look at. And I

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:48.090
threw this one in just so you could see that
Santa Monica's represented. This is Santa

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:52.310
Monica in 1877; no parking problems.

00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:54.610
[laughter]

00:40:54.610 --> 00:41:02.500
No promenade. I think it's looking down, like
towards Malibu.

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:04.230
&gt;&gt;audience #10: [inaudible].

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:11.950
&gt;&gt;Glen: Oh, it is. Yeah. And that, the funny
thing about it, too, is that--

00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:13.840
&gt;&gt;audience #10: [inaudible]

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:21.290
&gt;&gt;Glen: in the rail. There had not been a
railway in Los Angeles until 1876, and they

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:26.790
connected us with San Francisco. So, but the
reason there is a railway there is because

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:36.700
they were trying to get the harbor. And Santa
Monica, thank God, didn't get it. This is

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:42.510
a typical panoramic map and these were created
to get people to move to Los Angeles, and

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:49.630
there's a style that they used. These were
done all through the Victorian era. They wanted

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:55.640
to make the city look like a garden spot and
this is like, the first, they're trying to

00:41:55.640 --> 00:42:01.490
sell the Southern California good life. But
they also, it's ringed by all these impressive

00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:11.310
public buildings and to show, "Oh, this is
a civilized city; up and coming." And that's

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:19.240
the City Hall and there's also, that's the
tallest building in Los Angeles because after

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:26.520
the San Francisco earthquake, they put limits,
so was is it. You could do three stories.

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:38.060
I like the fact, too, that City Hall, that,
oops. Next door. Oops. Next door to this is

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:43.820
the Temperance Temple; the Women's Christian
Temperance Union building. And somebody said

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:51.600
it had very little effect on City Hall, temperance.
So, this is an example of the detail. They're

00:42:51.600 --> 00:43:00.010
really terrific maps. I actually have this
on my wall at home. That is Fort More Hill

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:13.800
and part of Bunker Hill there. You can see
Bunker Hill Avenue and, oops. That's the new

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:17.451
high school there, right in the middle of
the building. Right in the middle of the map,

00:43:17.451 --> 00:43:24.620
that's the new high school. This is the absolute
masterpiece of these pictorial maps. This

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:30.410
was done; it's like a travel guide. All that
printing at the bottom, that tells you like,

00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:35.800
every building in the city and stuff to do
and how to get there, and you can see the

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:42.100
incredible detail. It took this man 16 months.
He walked the streets of Los Angeles making

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:52.220
sketches and I'm not sure if they actually
used the blimp, but this is 1909. So, in the

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:57.240
middle there you can see that that's actually
they called it Central Park then. That's what's

00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:02.260
now Pershing Square, which is now a big piece
of ugly concrete, but then it was a really

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:10.560
nice park. And this particular map, you can
go on the Library of Congress website and

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:18.510
they have a really great panoramic mapping
exhibit on there where you can bring this

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:25.240
up and you can zoom in on an individual building
and see these things really close up. It's

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:47.710
really impressive. And right here, in the
upper right hand corner, right there, [inaudible].

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:55.900
In talking about the streetcars, this is the
very first automobile map. This was done in

00:44:55.900 --> 00:45:01.580
1903, and it's called the Automobile and Miners
Road Map, which is kind of mysterious because

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:05.650
I'm not sure what the miners had to do with
this. And originally, when I saw the map,

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:13.770
I thought these little dots were oil wells
because this is when they had discovered oil.

00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:20.660
Doheny is the guy that discovered oil over
by La Brea Tar Pits. It's amazing that they

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:26.930
sharpened a eucalyptus tree and then drove
it into the ground. That's how they first

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:33.620
did oil discoveries. Anyway, this is when
the speed limit was eight miles per hour,

00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:39.020
but you can see that there it's still really
sprawled out. So, Los Angeles has always been

00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:49.060
this kind of sprawling, and it has a lot to
do with the ranchos, it has a lot to do with

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:57.150
streetcars. This is what downtown looked like
in 1913 and this is kind of a watershed year

00:45:57.150 --> 00:46:05.670
because the city of Los Angeles was the very
first city to have a population boom after

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:13.710
mass production of automobiles. And so, the
city, even though World War I was on the horizon,

00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:22.610
was really booming and there was a lot of
building and there were, in downtown, you

00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:28.940
can see that this is an amazing map, too,
cause it's an orthographic projection. And

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:35.880
it's like an aerial photo. You can see the
top there. Again, there's a central park.

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:42.260
Five years later, that became Pershing Square.
I guess Pershing was a hero in World War I.

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:50.300
And there were showing movies; the first movies
were being shown in downtown and the next

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:57.270
year, the Panama Canal opened and the Harbor
had already been approved, so then Los Angeles

00:46:57.270 --> 00:47:07.510
just really took off as an industrial power.
There again is Central Park and there's also

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:12.490
Hamburger's Department Store is in there.
That's where they had the movable staircase,

00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:19.320
they called it. This was done much later,
but this is an example of one of these tourist

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:28.490
come-on maps. I love this one because it has
some personal significance for me and I just

00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:37.360
think it's so funny because this man was a
German, and for some reason, he did the regular

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:44.890
tourist thing. So, on this you see the Brown
Derby and the Groman's Chinese and the Hollywood

00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:50.690
Bowl and things like that, but when he gets
to Santa Monica, what does he have? The Crystal

00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:53.369
Pier nude sunbaths.

00:47:53.369 --> 00:47:55.369
[laughter]

00:47:55.369 --> 00:48:03.750
And he also has, see there's Clover Field
up there. There's the Venice oil fields, Sunset

00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:12.730
Pier and he has the, my father happened to
be a craps dealer on a gambling boat. They

00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:18.820
used to take these ships and put them off
the coast outside of jurisdiction of the law

00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:22.990
and they would gamble out there, so my father
was a craps dealer there. So, that's not the

00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:29.240
one he was one, but in this, this guy who
did the map included them. This one here,

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:36.820
I think, is the quintessence of the Southern
California good life. You have all the flora

00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:44.550
and the fauna and everything just looks, everything
is like, washed in the sun and again, there's

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:53.300
Santa Monica. I tailored this for the Google
audience. Everybody's horseback riding and

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:56.250
having a great time. Nobody seems to work.

00:48:56.250 --> 00:48:57.250
[laughter]

00:48:57.250 --> 00:49:06.840
And there's a whale on the, see there's, but
he does include their oil well. See the oil

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:18.240
wells there, gushing oil along with some of
the actual, I think that's 1932. So, the called

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:27.869
the Coliseum the Olympic Stadium, cause this
was the year of the Olympics in '32. This

00:49:27.869 --> 00:49:36.670
is, to me, the greatest map ever. This is
a Joe Morrow. He was an immigrant from Uruguay;

00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:43.040
amazing artist. He was a great sculptor, he
was a painter. When he was 14 years old, he

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:49.150
already had a job as a cartoonist at the Boston
Herald and he did these things they called

00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:56.950
"carts." And at first, I think he did them
for his children for fun and this one he did

00:49:56.950 --> 00:50:05.990
in Los Angeles in 1942, and it's just incredible.
It's just like a history of the city. And

00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:13.770
everything around the edges there, at the
top, that's Los Angeles history and this man

00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:18.750
lived with the Indians and he was an expert
on Californios; the pre-statehood California

00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:25.720
history. He wrote a book on the Californios
and everything in those illustrations is exactly

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:29.970
correct, right down to the hair styles and
the clothes they're wearing. Although, at

00:50:29.970 --> 00:50:34.940
the bottom I really like, there's these, it
shows the population growth of the city and

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:40.500
its women wearing bathing suits, blowing up
these balloons that say, "80 thousand people"

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:45.550
or whatever. But it has like, when electricity
was invented, when the Pacific Coast League

00:50:45.550 --> 00:50:55.470
baseball started, earthquakes, the Pony Express,
which came through here. This is a close-up

00:50:55.470 --> 00:51:01.840
where you'll see the little Trojan there for
USC. There's a little Bruin for UCLA and even

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:04.250
a little Jesuit there for Loyola.

00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:10.100
[Glen clears throat]

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:17.240
I'm just throwing these in because these are
my Los Angeles stories. One of the things

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:23.110
that I personally wanted to do when I got
the chance to write this book, is to demonstrate

00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:31.550
that Los Angeles is not a city of empty-headed,
blond people laying on the beach, you know,

00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:40.620
with no culture. And I've been to New York;
I've heard those stories and so I personally

00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:46.661
like this because I've been a librarian for
30 years and this is a map of the library

00:51:46.661 --> 00:51:56.119
system done in 1930 of the branches of the
library. And in researching this, I was amazed

00:51:56.119 --> 00:52:04.300
to find that in 1930, Los Angeles was the
best read city in America. And we had this

00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:10.920
really terrific, it's ironic though, in that
I chose this little thing here, and I asked

00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:16.000
the other librarians, I said, "I don't know
where Hazard is and I don't know." Anyway,

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:21.180
what happened was they opened those branches
and then they had budget cuts and they closed

00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:27.490
them. So, but anyway, we've always been a
well-read city here in Los Angeles, and we've

00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:34.380
always had the vital cultural life and we
are one of the, have a really great audience

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:39.330
for contemporary classical music. How are
we doing for time?

00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:40.430
&gt;&gt;presenter: [inaudible]

00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:46.119
&gt;&gt;Glen: OK. You know what? I'll go for, I'm
gonna skip that, but this is the studios in

00:52:46.119 --> 00:52:47.119
Hollywood.

00:52:47.119 --> 00:52:52.860
[pause]

00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:58.490
I guess I'll just mention this one and then
I'll answer some questions. This is just a

00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:05.640
question that we had many times and I had
to actually work with a guy who writes a column

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:11.530
for LA Magazine and the Cecilia Rasmussen
from the LA Times. We read through all these

00:53:11.530 --> 00:53:17.380
accounts and they called people on the phone
and everything because there's this terrible

00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:24.710
story in Los Angeles history where these teenagers
had a party at this little reservoir and they

00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:29.380
had a fight and one of them got killed. You
know, the kind of stuff that happens all the

00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:38.580
time now, terrible stuff, but that little
square at the top there by the curving part,

00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:46.930
that's Sleepy Lagoon; the famous Sleepy Lagoon.
And after that event, it set forward this

00:53:46.930 --> 00:53:55.150
tide of racism in the city and then there
was the Zoot Suit riots, where they actually

00:53:55.150 --> 00:54:05.210
beat young Mexican Americans, Filipino, Blacks,
any soldiers who were here on leave. They

00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:13.200
just roamed the streets and it's a very sad
story. So anyway, we threw that in and I'll

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:26.900
skip that. I'll just open it to questions
now.

00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:30.490
&gt;&gt;audience #11: [ ]. At what point does the
first freeway go in? I'm thinking about the

00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:36.970
Arroyo Seco, going up from LA to Pasadena.
Was that about 1950 or something?

00:54:36.970 --> 00:54:37.970
&gt;&gt;Glen: 1938.

00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:38.970
&gt;&gt;audience #11: 1938?

00:54:38.970 --> 00:54:43.710
&gt;&gt;Glen: 38, yeah. And then they, I think,
in 1950 they passed the Highways Act and they

00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:44.710
just built--

00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:47.130
&gt;&gt;audience #11: Yeah, it was 1956 was the
Interstate highway.

00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:53.520
&gt;&gt;Glen: Even when I was a kid, we would go
from South Gate. There wasn't a Harbor freeway

00:54:53.520 --> 00:55:02.980
yet. We would go to Park La Brea. I also have
a bunch of maps that I brought, a few maps

00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:10.220
for people to actually touch them and see
them, which is, even though I have to admit

00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:17.690
that I did a lot of research on the book,
on Google books. There's nothing like hardcopy

00:55:17.690 --> 00:55:22.630
for some things. So, and this is a fire insurance
atlas, Sanborn Fire Insurance Atlas of Santa

00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:32.840
Monica. This was published in 1930 and then
when there where change in the neighborhood,

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:41.330
they would paste this piece of paper over
these [inaudible]. So, this is exactly what

00:55:41.330 --> 00:55:46.520
Santa Monica looked like building by building
in 1956.

00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:47.670
[pause]

00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:48.820
[laughter]

00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:58.680
&gt;&gt;audience #12: I was gonna say, it sounds
like you kind of touched on it. It seemed

00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:03.760
like a lot of times I hear people say that
Santa Monica is as spread out as it is because

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:09.730
of the building of freeways and the cars and
they blame the evil suburban sprawl and that,

00:56:09.730 --> 00:56:15.590
but it sounds like you've implied that LA
was always spread out and that cars just came

00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:16.590
about at random.

00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:20.110
&gt;&gt;Glen: In the rancho period, the ranchos
were all self-sufficient, so they had their

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:26.600
own schools, they had their own carpenter,
they made their own wine, they had their own

00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:35.400
security. It always was "we don't really need
government downtown." It's, yeah.

00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:44.300
&gt;&gt;audience #13: Going back to the libraries
map, I was, there's an Echo Park branch, then

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:50.710
there's an Edendale and there's an Alessandro.
Is that, are those all compressed, sort of

00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:55.140
along Glendale Boulevard, there were three
libraries? Those are all locations--

00:56:55.140 --> 00:57:01.650
&gt;&gt;Glen: Yeah, I think that was Atwater, Edendale,
Echo Park. Yeah.

00:57:01.650 --> 00:57:08.270
&gt;&gt;audience #13: Yeah, cause the Edendale branch
now is the Echo Park library, right?

00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:11.770
&gt;&gt;Glen: No, there's a separate Edendale now
that's over there by--

00:57:11.770 --> 00:57:13.390
&gt;&gt;audience #13: Sunset and Glendale.

00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:14.390
&gt;&gt;Glen: Yeah.

00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:18.290
&gt;&gt;audience #13: And then, it looks like north
of that, like that looks like that would be

00:57:18.290 --> 00:57:22.859
the Echo Park one. It looks like there's another
one and then there's another one on Alessandro,

00:57:22.859 --> 00:57:26.860
which is right, which is a street also in
Echo Park. So, it just looked like there was--

00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:32.930
&gt;&gt;Glen: I think maybe Alessandro, that was
like a storefront and then they moved it to

00:57:32.930 --> 00:57:33.930
Cypress Park on Pepper Street.

00:57:33.930 --> 00:57:44.930
&gt;&gt;audience #13: I see. I see.

00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:45.930
[pause]

00:57:45.930 --> 00:57:46.930
&gt;&gt;presenter: All right. Thank you, Glen.

00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:47.930
&gt;&gt;Glen: My pleasure.

00:57:47.930 --> 00:57:47.931
[applause]
