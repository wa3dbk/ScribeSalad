&gt;&gt;Male presenter: Welcome everybody.

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.000
I would like to especially welcome our families
and friends

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.280
and our young guests today who are joining
us to celebrate science.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:30.080
We have lined up some exciting events in about
an hour from now you will have a brilliant

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.530
punk science team from the London
science museum and that they will be doing,

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.720
in their own words, "old science" show.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.989
Please stay with us and enjoy that show.

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.660
The end of the meantime, you will find the
desks for the science fair, the science fair

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.320
team is organizing a science
competition in association with National Geographic

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.870
and Lego and The Scientific American, and
if you, you would like to join that competition,

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.150
you can go talk to their desk and find out
more about that.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.830
And what more privileged way
to celebrate science than to have Professor

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.920
Richard Dawkins here with us
to talk about his latest book.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.570
Professor Richard Dawkins was the first holder
of the Charles Simonyi Chair in Public

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.740
Understanding of Science at the University
of Oxford.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.070
He's a fellow member of the Royal Society
and the Royal Society of Literature.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.979
And he's a prominent scientist and evolutionary
biologist

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.070
and perhaps one of the world's most outspoken
atheists.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.950
He's, of course, the author
of numerous books, including his landmark

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.790
text, The Selfish Gene, his sensational take
on religion,

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.130
The God Delusion, and The Greatest Show on
Earth in which he makes a stirring defense

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.510
of Charles Darwin's theory of
evolution.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.990
And today he's here to talk with us about
his book,

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.859
which most of you have among in the audience
at your hands, his latest book,

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:04.289
The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really
True.

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.090
And at the end of his speech,
Professor Dawkins will be taking questions.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.420
Please use the microphone on the floor
to ask questions if you do have any and then

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.890
he's also offered to stay with us and sign
his books.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.210
It will be on the stage
right after his speech and Q and A session.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.130
Without any further ado and with great pleasure,
I would like to give you Professor Richard

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.410
Dawkins.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.690
[Applause]

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:40.940
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: Thank you, Baran, very
much.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.760
I am delighted that, of course,
that so many copies of my book are to be seen

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.950
in the room, slightly disconcerted as well.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.590
My Uncle Bill told me that when he was an
undergraduate at Oxford many years ago in

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.540
the 1930s, it was the custom for Oxford
undergraduates to read out their essays to

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.230
their tutor.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.650
And he, one week, had been caught a bit short
and so he had actually just copied out his

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.910
essay
from a book.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.980
And his tutor listened to his essay for a
while and then silently got up,

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:23.840
walked across to a bookshelf, pulled the volume
off the shelf, opened it, and then started

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.010
following with his finger.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.260
[Laughter]
And then at the end, my uncle valiantly soldiered

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.100
on reading out his essay,
and then at the end the tutor snapped the

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.280
book shut and said, "I see you agree with
Mr. So and So."

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.690
[Laughter]
So I'm a little bit worried that people may

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.480
be following what I say in the book,
so I'll try not to make it too word for word.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.930
The Magic of Reality,
it's a book for young people, the sort of

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.380
optimal target age that I was aiming at was
about twelve.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:05.230
But I hope, and I think believe, that it can
be read by adults

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.300
as well they can understand it.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.600
And also younger children as well.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.930
It’s a little bit difficult
to pitch in talk to the full range of ages

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:27.660
that I see in the audience today,
so I hope I won't be boring some age groups.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.060
There are twelve chapters in the book,
and those show the twelve chapters.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.949
They're nearly all a scientific question,
like who was was the first person, what is

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.759
the sun, what is a rainbow.

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:45.710
Every chapter begins with myths from around
the world in answer

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.600
to the question and then goes on to the meat
of the chapter,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.550
Which is the scientific answer what really
is the sun, what really is a rainbow,

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.419
what really is an earthquake, and so on.

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.569
The title, The Magic of Reality, I need to
clarify the word magic.

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:09.490
I see the word magic is used in three different
senses.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.639
The first kind of magic is fairy tale spells,
fairy godmothers

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.800
waving a wand
and turning a pumpkin into a coach or a frog

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.150
turning into a prince, that kind of thing.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.000
Nobody believes in that kind of magic.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.039
The second kind of magic is stage magic, conjuring.

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:32.840
In America,
conjurors are called magicians but everybody

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.610
knows,
of course, that what conjurors do is only

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:42.050
a trick although it looks like are real magic,
it looks like something supernatural.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.440
And the third kind of magic is the one that
I am really most keen on,

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.099
and the title of my book, which is the magic
of reality.

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:53.180
When we're moved to tears by a beautiful piece
of music we describe

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.349
it as magical.

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:59.340
Or we look up at the stars,
we look up at the Milky Way and we say what

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.530
a magical sight.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.460
The whole of science, the whole of what science
reveals it

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.440
seems to me
is magical in that sense, not supernatural,

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:16.830
but fills one with a sense of wonder, a sort
of swelling of the chest which one

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.509
can describe as magical.

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:26.249
The purpose of my book is to show that reality,
the facts of reality, as understood through

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:32.960
science, is magical in this third
sense, the poetic sense, the 'good to be alive'

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.400
sense.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.539
Now, I said that nobody believes in supernatural
magic, nobody believes in fairies

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:44.381
turning pumpkins into coaches, and frogs into
princes.

00:06:44.381 --> 00:06:50.651
And I want to make the point,
a really rather important point, it's actually

00:06:50.651 --> 00:06:55.889
not just that no one has ever actually seen
a frog turn into prince, there are very

00:06:55.889 --> 00:07:00.219
good reasons for saying it will never happen,
it's impossible.

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:04.539
And it is important to understand that, in
order to understand how it is

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:09.909
that frogs and princes and kangaroos and tigers
came into existence at all because they did

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:12.259
not come into existence by magic, of
course.

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:15.689
They came into existence by evolution.

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:23.750
So why is it that things can't magically turn
into other things from one magic blow?

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.949
Why can't frogs turn into princes?

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:28.539
Why can't pumpkins turn into coaches?

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:37.470
Well, the reason is, frogs and princes, and
pumpkins and coaches are all complicated things.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:42.449
And complicated means statistically improbable.

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:48.580
And statistically improbable means that
it isn't going to just happen by luck.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:56.340
So if you imagine making the task for our
fairy godmother, making a coach by magic a

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.009
little bit easier,
well imagine that instead of giving her a

00:07:59.009 --> 00:08:05.449
pumpkin to start with,
we give her a sort of IKEA kit for making

00:08:05.449 --> 00:08:06.620
a coach.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.400
It comes in a box, and she takes all the bits
in the box,

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.110
puts them in a great big sack and shakes them,
and shakes them,

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:18.740
and shakes them for a billion years, and every
time she shakes she looks to see whether a

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.900
coach has tumbled out.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:25.990
And of course it won't, not in a trillion
years, it won't.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:32.450
Coaches, and princes, and frogs, and us, and
aardvarks, and dinosaurs

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:38.010
are all much too complicated to happen by
chance.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.310
So how did they happen?

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:46.540
Oh, first of all, I should say that in some
cases we can calculate the odds against happening

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:47.670
by chance.

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:54.260
If we're playing cards and we deal thirteen
cards to each of four players

00:08:54.260 --> 00:09:00.250
as you would in Bridge and imagine that I
pick up my cards,

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:05.570
I pick up my thirteen cards and I gasped in
astonishment because I've got the perfect

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:09.030
hand of all spades.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:13.200
So I lay down my cards on the table and I
say no good going on with the game

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:18.540
I've obviously won this game because I've
got a perfect hand, and then to my amazement,

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.660
one by one the other three players
lay down their hands and somebody's got all

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:27.800
the diamonds, somebody's got all the clubs,
somebody's got all the hearts.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.830
Well,
that could happen.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:32.440
What are the odds against it?

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.780
Well, you all have worked out in your head
[Laughter]

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:57.380
that the odds against that are 536,447,737,765,488,792,839,237,442,000
against.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:04.250
However the particular deal is no less likely
than any other particular deal is,

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:09.310
just that we notice, we notice it because
there's something special about it.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:14.910
You could arbitrarily designate any particular
deal and say the odds against that happening

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:20.150
are also that number of
octillions, etcetera.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:22.640
By the way,
once I was reading that out while giving a

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.280
lecture in America,
and they have a rule there that you have to

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:31.530
have someone standing at the side of the stage
doing sign language so I couldn't

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:36.350
help stealing a look at her while I was doing
all this.

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:40.910
[laughter]
And I also, this is only totally an aside

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:43.881
now,
but I also during the same lecture had an

00:10:43.881 --> 00:10:50.440
occasion to refer
to the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva and

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.340
I was talking about how moved I was when I
went to visit the Large Hadron Collider

00:10:54.340 --> 00:11:01.380
and I told as an aside the story that in the
first edition of one of my books, this was

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.790
misprinted as Large Hard on Collider,
[laugher]

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:12.330
and I, again, have to look at this woman and
see how she was--.[laughter]

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:21.890
Anyway, as I was saying, in the case of a
perfect bridge, of a perfect deal in bridge,

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.510
you can calculate the odds against it.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:27.360
You can't calculate the odds of shaking up
the bits

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.800
of a prince, or shaking up the bits of a frog
and getting a prince,

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.330
but it's going to be just as high, just as
unlikely.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:40.080
Probably even more so than getting a perfect
hand in bridge.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:47.840
So how do
we get tigers and kangaroos and frogs and

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.370
princes?

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:56.780
The answer is it certainly does not come about
by chance, it comes about by the nonrandom

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:00.080
process,
of evolution by natural selection.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:06.330
The key to understanding that is that although
there is chance involved, there is luck

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:11.440
involved,
it's a very small amount of luck in each step

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.760
of the way.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.480
The point is
that there are millions of steps of the way,

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:22.070
one after the other through an immense amount
of geological time and each one of

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:29.190
those tiny steps means that a frog, for example,
turns into a slightly different kind of frog,

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:30.671
and then a slightly different kind of frog
again,

00:12:30.671 --> 00:12:32.950
and a slightly different kind of frog again.

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:39.350
Each of those tiny steps is not improbable,
is not a wildly improbable thing

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:43.290
like shaking the bits of a frog and getting
a prince.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:48.440
It's because there are so many steps, it's
because the luck is smeared out

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:53.970
into gradual steps that it works and that's
why we've been able to go from some kind of

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:59.930
bacterial ancestor three billion
years ago to all the different kinds of animal

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:03.500
and plant that we see today.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:12.650
Now, … [pause] I'm now going to take the
first, take the next chapter, chapter two,

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:17.420
which is the first of the chapters that follows
the plan of having a question

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.870
followed by myths followed by the true scientific
answer.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:26.760
And the question of this chapter is who was
the first person?

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:31.870
And, as you know,
this has been the subject of many myths,

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:37.320
and a particularly familiar myth is the Hebrew
myth of Adam and Eve,

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.700
the Jewish myth of Adam and Eve, which has
been adopted by Christians and by Muslims,

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.590
as you know.

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:51.940
And just to give you another myth, the myth
of Odin, the Norse myth,

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.470
which is just a quite separate myth.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:14:00.750
And there are thousands of origin myths
which account for the who was the first person.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:04.200
They're all colorful,
they're all nice stories but they're, of course,

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.380
not true.

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:11.160
And we're now going to come onto the true
answer to the question who was the first person.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.740
The scientific answer.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:18.740
Well, this may surprise you there never was
a first person.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:23.030
Because every person had to have parents and
they had to have parents,

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:25.100
and they had to have parents, and so on.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:30.860
And the same is true of rabbits and crocodiles
and, and, and lizards and everything.

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:35.110
Every animal ever born, every creature ever
born belonged

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:44.440
to the same species as its parents and its
children, and its grandparents and its great

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.420
grandparents.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:47.860
How far back can we take that?

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.270
Can we take about forever?

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:52.560
No, obviously we can't.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:15:00.070
Um, and this is the main lesson I want to
reach in this part of my talk.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:07.230
Even though every species ever born is the
same species as its parents and its children,

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:11.810
nevertheless, if you go back a sufficiently
large number of generations, then you come

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.660
to something very different.

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:19.570
So let's do a thought experiment.

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:21.660
Imagine that you take up, a thought experiment
is an experiment

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:24.830
you don't actually do, you just imagine.

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:32.170
Imagine that you take a picture of yourself
and put on top of it a picture of your father,

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:35.730
then on top of that, his father, and then
his father, and then his father,

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:41.610
and then his father
and build a gigantic skyscraper of pictures

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:44.250
going backwards in time.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.120
How far back should we go?

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:52.851
Well, I think we should go back 185,000,000
greats so I am going to go back to your one

00:15:52.851 --> 00:15:57.630
hundred
eighty-five million greats grandfather.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:01.380
How high would that skyscraper be?

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:06.950
It would be more than one hundred eighty New
York skyscrapers

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:09.170
piled on top of each other.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.570
So we're going back quite a long way.

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.670
Obviously that skyscraper would simply fall
over, it's much

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:14.880
too high.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:19.130
So let's tip it
on its side and put the pictures all the way

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.290
along a great big long bookshelf.

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:25.700
How long would that bookshelf be?

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.170
About forty
miles.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:34.950
So the near end of the bookshelf has a picture
of you, the far end of the bookshelf has a

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:41.360
picture of your one hundred
eighty-five million greats grandfather.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.530
What did he look like?

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:49.430
Was he an old man with wispy hair and side
whiskers?

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:52.590
Was he a cave man in a leopard skin?

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:55.120
No, forget any such thought.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.990
Your one hundred eighty-five million greats
grandfather

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:04.319
looked something like that.

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:08.699
Your one hundred eighty-five million greats
grandfather was a fish.

00:17:08.699 --> 00:17:11.709
[laughter]
So was your one hundred eighty-five million

00:17:11.709 --> 00:17:17.559
greats grandmother which is just as well.

00:17:17.559 --> 00:17:27.111
If we now walk along our forty mile long bookshelf,
we can pull off pictures now and again

00:17:27.111 --> 00:17:28.890
to see how we're going.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:35.470
Every picture shows a creature belonging to
the same species as it's immediate neighbors

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:38.259
on the
shelf.

00:17:38.259 --> 00:17:43.850
Yet if you go back sufficiently far,
where your four thousand greats grandfather

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:46.220
is, who you see there looks pretty much like
us,

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:50.970
your fifty thousand greats grandfather looks
just a bit different.

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.750
He would have been perhaps a member of the
species homo

00:17:53.750 --> 00:18:01.320
Erectus,
not the same species as us, but pretty similar,

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.480
nevertheless.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:07.879
Imagine that we take a time machine and we
ride backwards in time

00:18:07.879 --> 00:18:11.059
and we go back in steps of ten thousand years.

00:18:11.059 --> 00:18:15.690
If every step of ten thousand years, we get
out of our time machine,

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:21.240
and we look around and we see which of our
great, great, great, great grandparents we

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.990
can see.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:30.270
And we take on board one of them, and then
we hop another ten thousand years

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:34.840
and then we open the door, we look again at
who's out there, and we take on board a passenger

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:40.309
from that time
and we hop back another ten thousand years.

00:18:40.309 --> 00:18:48.630
Well, what we'll notice
is that every ten thousand years stop, the

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:52.320
new people that we see or the new animals
that we see

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.020
are going to be pretty similar to the last
lot that we've,

00:18:55.020 --> 00:19:00.530
that we saw the previous ten thousand year
hop and indeed they can interbreed if they

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:02.190
feel like it.

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:03.620
And they can probably
interbreed

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:07.470
with several more ten thousand year hops as
well

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:13.669
but there will come a time when they can no
longer interbreed with us.

00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:19.480
So if we go back a million years, then we
will probably find that we can just about

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.450
not interbreed with the people that we
discover.

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:26.470
Yet all the intermediates could interbreed
with their neighbors,

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:34.200
with the most recently joined party on the
time machine.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:40.710
Let's now pick out some more distant ones,
Your two hundred fifty thousand greats grandfather

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:46.149
who lived about six million years ago,
would have probably looked a bit like a chimpanzee.

00:19:46.149 --> 00:19:54.460
However, he wasn't a chimpanzee, he was the
common ancestor of ourselves and chimpanzees.

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:57.470
He was no more a chimpanzee than we are except
perhaps

00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:00.640
he looked a bit more like a chimpanzee than
he looked like us.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:06.830
Your one million and a half, sorry, your one
and a half million

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:09.600
greats grandfather, twenty five million years
ago,

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:16.179
would have looked like a monkey and would
have been the ancestor that we share with

00:20:16.179 --> 00:20:18.730
modern monkeys.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:23.879
Your seven million greats grandfather would
have lived sixty-three million years ago,

00:20:23.879 --> 00:20:27.769
and would have been the common ancestor of
us and modern lemurs.

00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:31.580
Once again, it would not have been a lemur,
it would have perhaps

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.440
looked bit more like a lemur than it looks
like us,

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:41.490
but would be the common ancestor of ourselves
and lemurs.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:46.669
Your forty-five million greats grandfather,
who lived one hundred and five million years

00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:53.070
ago would have been sort of like a shrew
and would have been the common ancestor of

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:56.789
actually probably most of the mammals, all
the mammals perhaps.

00:20:56.789 --> 00:21:01.509
Your one hundred and seventy million greats
grandfather would have would have looked kind

00:21:01.509 --> 00:21:02.509
of like a sort of lizard.

00:21:02.509 --> 00:21:06.100
And would have been the common ancestor of
us, that is to say all the mammals,

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:12.450
and all the reptiles, including birds, including
dinosaurs, birds are dinosaurs actually.

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:16.080
Your one hundred seventy-five million greats
grandfather would have

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:20.129
looked a bit like a salamander, the one on
the right there and would have been

00:21:20.129 --> 00:21:27.159
the common ancestor of modern salamanders
and frogs, and of all the other reptiles,

00:21:27.159 --> 00:21:30.169
and mammals and birds.

00:21:30.169 --> 00:21:34.130
And then finally we come back your one hundred
eight-five million greats grandfather,

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:36.159
and the fish that you've already seen.

00:21:36.159 --> 00:21:40.580
We can carry on this process, I won't do it,
but you can carry on.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:45.220
The line of pictures wends its way off into
the distance and eventually comes back to

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:50.790
something like
a bacterium.

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:55.200
I'm now just going to whiz through the chapter
titles of some of the other chapters just

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:59.399
to give you a feel
for what other questions we tackle.

00:21:59.399 --> 00:22:02.720
Tackle first by giving mythical answers, and
then by giving

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.879
the true scientific answer.

00:22:03.879 --> 00:22:07.320
"Why are there so many different kinds of
animals?"

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.309
"What are things made of?"

00:22:10.309 --> 00:22:14.539
If you, if you take stuff, matter, and cut
it into smaller, and smaller,

00:22:14.539 --> 00:22:19.700
and smaller, and smaller pieces, you eventually
come to a piece that no longer is that stuff

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.200
at all.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.740
It's about the atomic theory.

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:23.740
It's about chemistry.

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:24.740
It's about atoms.

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.130
It's about molecules.

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:30.720
"Why do we have night and day?

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.280
Why do we have winter and summer?"

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.549
Most people have a pretty good idea of why
we have night and day, it's because the earth

00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:40.740
is spinning on its axis
and therefore a different side of the earth

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:43.760
is turned toward the sun at different times.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.860
And I think most
people know why we have winter and summer,

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:52.240
but actually you'd be surprised how many people
think that winter is when the earth

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:58.889
is furthest from the sun in its orbit, and
summer is when it's nearest to the sun in

00:22:58.889 --> 00:23:01.039
its orbit.

00:23:01.039 --> 00:23:08.659
Nobody in Australia thinks
that.

00:23:08.659 --> 00:23:13.779
In the course of that chapter, I try to explain
what being in orbit means and this is a good

00:23:13.779 --> 00:23:17.210
opportunity for me
to mention that there is an app that goes

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:22.020
with the book, because the app, in addition
to being the complete book, including

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:27.009
illustrations, so you can read it like a Kindle
book, it also has simulations and games.

00:23:27.009 --> 00:23:35.990
And can we turn on this one now, is
that, who is in charge of that?

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:39.009
[pause]
Good, okay.

00:23:39.009 --> 00:23:45.320
So, here's the book, on the app.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:49.080
There are all the chapters you see swinging
along at the top.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.860
And then you can choose a particular chapter.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:53.500
We happen to have to have got to "Why do we
have night and day?"

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.190
so I choose
that, and then you see all the pages of "why

00:23:56.190 --> 00:24:02.070
do we have night and day?", and I want to
stop at the game which is in the

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:03.070
middle.

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:04.919
Which is this one.

00:24:04.919 --> 00:24:11.369
Isaac Newton illustrated the principle of
things being in orbit

00:24:11.369 --> 00:24:19.820
by imagining a cannon, and you see the cannon
there, sitting on top of the world.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:25.989
And Newton imagined firing a cannonball,
and if you fire a cannon ball rather slowly,

00:24:25.989 --> 00:24:27.619
it will splash into the sea there.

00:24:27.619 --> 00:24:31.110
If you fire it a bit stronger, it will go
there.

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:33.980
A bit stronger stronger still, it will go
there.

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:37.850
What it's doing is trying to go in a straight
line, but being pulled

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:40.470
down by gravity.

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:46.279
And if you fire it yet stronger still, it
will go on and finally go round the world

00:24:46.279 --> 00:24:47.279
altogether.

00:24:47.279 --> 00:24:50.280
And I'm going to show that here, I hope.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:58.850
Um, so you fire the cannon by pulling back
this pea shooter affair and that one

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:02.779
went into orbit.

00:25:02.779 --> 00:25:07.799
You fire it a bit less strong, it splashes
into the sea.

00:25:07.799 --> 00:25:11.749
If you fire it very strongly, it goes into
outer

00:25:11.749 --> 00:25:12.749
space.

00:25:12.749 --> 00:25:15.850
That one reached escape velocity.

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:21.649
The principle is the ball is actually falling
all the time, but it's falling around

00:25:21.649 --> 00:25:24.380
the world, because the world is curving away
from it.

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:28.820
And if it's given sufficient horizontal velocity,
then it will go on

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:34.019
falling forever, which is what the moon does,
and it's what artificial satellites do.

00:25:34.019 --> 00:25:40.080
So each chapter in the app has a game of that
sort which illustrates some sort of principle,

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.669
but the app does have the
complete book in it as well.

00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:52.009
So if we could go back to the Mac, and I'll
switch off the app, thank you.

00:25:52.009 --> 00:25:56.649
So the next chapter is "What is the Sun?"

00:25:56.649 --> 00:26:01.539
And I think there's another simulation here,
oh yes.

00:26:01.539 --> 00:26:09.630
There we are, we are zooming away from the
sun, and you see how small the sun is compared

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:10.630
to the universe.

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:11.630
We're going
away, and away, and away.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:15.649
We're seeing lots of other stars, the sun
is now invisible

00:26:15.649 --> 00:26:19.320
and we are moving away from sun, away from
the sun.

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:22.770
And now we are coming to our galaxy,
that's the Milky Way Galaxy.

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:26.820
We're zooming away, and away, and away from
the Milky Way Galaxy.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:32.169
Now there's another galaxy, and now all those
things there are now galaxies, comparable

00:26:32.169 --> 00:26:36.220
to ours, similar to ours.

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:41.639
[laughter]
That, that doesn't really belong.

00:26:41.639 --> 00:26:44.980
That's because there's another chapter which
is on "Are we alone?"

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:47.110
And I'll come to that in a moment.

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:50.710
The next chapter "What is a rainbow?"

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:55.250
Next chapter is "When and how did everything
begin?"

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:58.019
Which is a very difficult question, a very
profound question.

00:26:58.019 --> 00:27:00.239
A
question that we still don't know the answer

00:27:00.239 --> 00:27:04.259
to, but it's worth talking about because we
are getting a long way towards

00:27:04.259 --> 00:27:06.679
understanding the answer to it.

00:27:06.679 --> 00:27:09.170
The next chapter is the chapter on "Are we
alone?"

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:12.690
And that the very speculative chapter because
we don't know if we're

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:13.690
alone.

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:21.690
We don't know if this life elsewhere in the
universe, and one can argue the case either

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:22.690
way.

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:27.119
Some people think we're literally alone in
the universe, other people think

00:27:27.119 --> 00:27:32.110
that there's life, that the universe is teeming
with life.

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:36.190
And you can argue it both ways
and I do that in the book so it's good to

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:39.860
learn, it's good to realize that
we don't know everything in science and we

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:46.120
can actually speculate and an informed way
using our knowledge about the various

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.120
possibilities.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.889
Next chapter "What is earthquake?"

00:27:48.889 --> 00:27:55.350
And you know that's all about plate tectonics,
the movement of the continents.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:59.539
"Why do bad things happen?"

00:27:59.539 --> 00:28:04.580
Um not much different than why does anything
happen but some people rather superstitiously

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:08.799
think
that the world is out to get them and so why

00:28:08.799 --> 00:28:10.559
do bad things happen.

00:28:10.559 --> 00:28:14.039
Other people might say 'why do bad things
happen to good

00:28:14.039 --> 00:28:18.259
people' as though there were some rules that
said bad things should only happen to bad

00:28:18.259 --> 00:28:19.269
people.

00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:24.139
And the final chapter is "What is a miracle?"
which is sort of back to magic,

00:28:24.139 --> 00:28:29.399
but miracles are magic, supernatural magic,
that people believe in, as opposed to supernatural

00:28:29.399 --> 00:28:30.799
magic
they don't believe in.

00:28:30.799 --> 00:28:37.700
And there's no reason to believe in any kind
of supernatural magic at all.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:43.970
So I'm going to read the sort of final bit
of the book now:

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:49.070
There are things that not even the best scientists
of today can explain but that doesn't mean

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:54.119
we should block off all
investigation by resorting to phony explanations

00:28:54.119 --> 00:28:59.289
involving magic, or the supernatural,
Which don't explain anything at all.

00:28:59.289 --> 00:29:02.830
Just imagine how a medieval man, even the
most educated man

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:08.470
of his era, would have reacted if he'd seen
a jet plane or laptop computer, a mobile telephone

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:10.249
or sat-map device.

00:29:10.249 --> 00:29:18.059
He probably would have called them supernatural,
miraculous, but we don't have to go back that

00:29:18.059 --> 00:29:19.610
far.

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:25.190
If you even go back to
Victorian times, a Victorian detective like

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:28.659
Sherlock Holmes would have thought, for example,
if somebody,

00:29:28.659 --> 00:29:34.809
if a murder had been committed in London,
and the accused could prove he was in New

00:29:34.809 --> 00:29:38.929
York the same day,
then he couldn't have done the murder.

00:29:38.929 --> 00:29:43.600
Because in Victorian times it was literally
impossible to be in London and New York

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.600
on the same day.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.929
Now, of course, it's commonplace.

00:29:46.929 --> 00:29:53.100
The eminent science fiction writer, Arthur
C. Clarke, summed the point up as Clarke's

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.759
third law.

00:29:54.759 --> 00:30:01.509
Any sufficiently advanced
technology is indistinguishable from magic.

00:30:01.509 --> 00:30:06.669
The more you think about it, the more you
realize the very idea of the supernatural

00:30:06.669 --> 00:30:09.249
miracle is nonsense.

00:30:09.249 --> 00:30:14.570
If something happened that appears to be inexplicable
by science, you can safely conclude one of

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:16.110
two things.

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:22.220
Either it really didn't happen, the observer
was mistaken or was lying or was tricked,

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:27.249
or we've exposed a shortcoming in
present day science.

00:30:27.249 --> 00:30:32.539
If present day science encounters an observation
or experimental result that it cannot explain,

00:30:32.539 --> 00:30:36.379
then we
should not rest until we've proved our science

00:30:36.379 --> 00:30:39.769
so that it can provide an explanation.

00:30:39.769 --> 00:30:45.700
If it requires a radically new kind of
science, a revolutionary science so strange

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:51.889
that it, sorry, so strange that old scientists
scarcely recognize it as science

00:30:51.889 --> 00:30:54.070
at all, that's fine too.

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:55.639
It's happened before.

00:30:55.639 --> 00:31:02.489
But don't ever be lazy enough, defeatists
enough, cowardly enough, to say

00:31:02.489 --> 00:31:05.259
it must be supernatural because I don't understand
it.

00:31:05.259 --> 00:31:07.970
Or it must be a miracle.

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:12.549
Say instead that it's a puzzle,
it's strange, it's a challenge that we should

00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:14.220
rise to.

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:17.210
Whether we rise to the challenge by questioning
the truth of the

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:24.809
observation, or by expanding our science in
new and exciting directions, the proper and

00:31:24.809 --> 00:31:30.879
brave response to any such challenge
is to tackle it head on.

00:31:30.879 --> 00:31:35.700
And until we've found a proper answer to the
mystery, it's perfectly OK to simply say,

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:40.539
this is something we don't yet understand
but we're working on it.

00:31:40.539 --> 00:31:43.159
It's the only honest thing to do.

00:31:43.159 --> 00:31:48.559
Miracles, magic, and
myths they can be fun, and I have fun with

00:31:48.559 --> 00:31:50.960
them throughout the book.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.220
Everybody likes a good story, and if you read
the book

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:58.950
I hope you'll enjoy the myths, with which
I begin most of my chapters, but even more

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:04.539
I hope that you will enjoy the science that
comes after the myths.

00:32:04.539 --> 00:32:09.070
I hope you'll agree that the truth has a magic
of its own.

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:12.460
The truth is
more magical in the best and most exciting

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:18.279
sense of the word than any myth or made up
mystery or miracle.

00:32:18.279 --> 00:32:23.049
Science has its own magic, the magic of reality."

00:32:23.049 --> 00:32:25.960
Thank you very much.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.570
[Applause]

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:36.482
&gt;&gt;presenter: You want to answer questions?

00:32:36.482 --> 00:32:48.230
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: And now I'm very happy
to take questions.

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:50.359
There is a microphone there I see is that
meant for--

00:32:50.359 --> 00:32:52.090
&gt;&gt;presenter: There is a microphone in the
middle.

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:56.119
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: If anyone would like to
ask a question, do come up to the microphone

00:32:56.119 --> 00:32:57.119
here.

00:32:57.119 --> 00:32:59.049
&gt;&gt;presenter: Actually can I start with the
first question?

00:32:59.049 --> 00:33:00.049
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins:Yeah, mmm.

00:33:00.049 --> 00:33:05.779
&gt;&gt;presenter: In your book, you often times
refer to online material, at one point you

00:33:05.779 --> 00:33:10.659
also ask your readers to Google one of the
phenomenon that you're talking about,

00:33:10.659 --> 00:33:15.740
[laughter]
and this means people have access to some

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:19.039
times random information on the Internet.

00:33:19.039 --> 00:33:22.759
How do you find the impact of the Internet
for new media on the teaching of science?

00:33:22.759 --> 00:33:23.820
Is it good or bad?

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:27.970
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: Well, I'm delighted that
the word Google has become a verb.

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:31.169
And I presume it's gotten its way into the
Oxford Dictionary by now, hasn't it?

00:33:31.169 --> 00:33:32.169
Do people know?

00:33:32.169 --> 00:33:35.259
I imagine you know that, um, anybody know
that?

00:33:35.259 --> 00:33:36.580
I mean it ought to.

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:40.710
[audience responds] The criterion for getting
into the Oxford Dictionary is that it has

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:44.119
to be used without explanation.

00:33:44.119 --> 00:33:51.380
So, as it were, I Googled something, I Googled
so and so.

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:56.190
And it doesn't count if you say 'footnote,
Google means.'

00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:59.110
But
provided you can use the word without explanation,

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:03.480
without definition, without attribution then
it gets into the dictionary.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:07.289
I'm sure it must have done.

00:34:07.289 --> 00:34:15.380
The web is a superb resource for factual information
and also superb resource for utter rubbish.

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:21.530
[laughter]
And we can to switch off our critical faculties,

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:28.290
but I think the overall impression that I
get is overwhelmingly positive.

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:30.700
Before the
web came along, if you were having an argument

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:35.399
with somebody, so often it might turn on a
factual point

00:34:35.399 --> 00:34:40.980
and you couldn't actually establish the correct
answer without going into library.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:47.589
Rather absurdly, I remember after dinner
one evening with a group of people, there

00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:54.220
was a dispute about whether New Mexico has
a coastline and somebody bet somebody

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:59.990
else, I don't know, a bottle of wine or something,
that New Mexico has a coastline.

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:04.260
You can do that now because everybody
would whip out their IPhones and simply, simply

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:05.390
look it up.

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:09.390
So disputes can now be resolved very much
more quickly

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:15.490
than ever before because you can instantly
Google something and discover the true answer.

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:20.109
And if you need to look of three
or four times just to make sure, that's fine,

00:35:20.109 --> 00:35:27.069
because you may hit on a Creationist web site
or something the first time, and

00:35:27.069 --> 00:35:28.470
gets a lot of nonsense.

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:37.069
[light laughter] But you do have the, the
world is at your fingers tips literally.

00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:39.039
So I think it's overwhelmingly
positive.

00:35:39.039 --> 00:35:43.069
And by the way I'd like to put in a good word
for Wikipedia, because that often gets a lot

00:35:43.069 --> 00:35:46.059
of bad press.

00:35:46.059 --> 00:35:48.510
Somebody
had said to me before Wikipedia was launched

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:52.030
what their plan was, that they're going to
have an encyclopedia that the users

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:59.660
could edit and was going to be done from thousands
of users, I'd have said don't be so silly!

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:02.260
[laughter]
Couldn't possibly work.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:05.800
And yet, my impression is that it overwhelming
does.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.990
Whenever I've looked up something I happen
to know a

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:16.539
little bit about, I've been immensely surprised
at how, how accurate it usually is.

00:36:16.539 --> 00:36:21.800
So I think, um, I think my view of the
world wide web is overwhelmingly positive.

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:28.240
&gt;&gt;male #1: Professor Dawkins, thank you very
much for coming and I'm a great admirer of

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:32.220
your work and as
yourself a proud atheist.

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:40.349
When I was reading The God Delusion, I thought
of course in the end he's professor, his job

00:36:40.349 --> 00:36:42.420
is to spread knowledge.

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:49.059
And I was thinking, how can I when I discuss
with friends or family, how can I justify,

00:36:49.059 --> 00:36:52.609
to try to
change their minds about religion and about

00:36:52.609 --> 00:36:57.940
what they believe, if they themselves are
not active in trying to proselytize,

00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:00.270
or to convert others.

00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:06.099
Why, what is my justification in trying to
explain to them with, mostly with the help

00:37:06.099 --> 00:37:09.980
of your
arguments I must admit, that there is no God?

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:17.010
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: Well, you question implies
that they be allowed to sort of retain their

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:20.520
illusions without disturbing them.

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:23.460
You
know why go out of your way to shatter somebody's

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:24.680
illusions?

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:28.930
Um, if it were just that, then I think I would
say don't do it,

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:36.630
because why make somebody less happy, but
you're actually making them more happy because

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:40.700
you're showing them
the wonder of truth.

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:50.030
I mean, to go through your life laboring under
a Bronze Age delusion when you could be exposing

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:54.950
your
mind to the glories of the universe as modern

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:57.730
science understands it is a terrible shame.

00:37:57.730 --> 00:38:03.030
And it's actually positively wicked if you
bring up children, if you indoctrinate children

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:07.839
with Bronze Age myths as though they were
true, instead of exposing children

00:38:07.839 --> 00:38:12.220
to the wonders of the truth.

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:19.410
And so I wouldn't have any compunction in
arguing, and what I would suggest that you

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:24.300
say to
them is why do you believe what you do?

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:29.230
And the answer almost always, if they're religious,
the answer almost always will be

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:35.350
because that's what was handed down to me
through my family tradition.

00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:37.770
Our family has always believed so and so.

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:41.099
Our family
is part of the Christian tradition, or the

00:38:41.099 --> 00:38:45.060
Jewish tradition, or the Muslim tradition
that's why we believe it.

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:47.849
What a
terrible reason for believing anything!

00:38:47.849 --> 00:38:51.510
For a start, your tradition is different from
his tradition and her tradition

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:54.660
and they can't all be right.

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:57.740
So that would be one point you could make.

00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:02.210
You should say evidence is the only good reason
to

00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:04.180
believe anything.

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:11.660
Bad reasons for believing are tradition, authority,
I believe it because the priest or the pope

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:15.990
or the
imam or the rabbi told me to believe it.

00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:18.540
That's a terrible reason to believe anything,
too.

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:22.520
Or I believe it because of
private revelation.

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:29.980
Somebody said I just felt it inside me, I
just feel this inner revelation, that something

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:30.980
must be true.

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:34.780
That's probably the worst reason of all for
believing anything.

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:38.640
The only reason to believe anything is evidence
and nowadays

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.549
we have enormous amounts of evidence.

00:39:40.549 --> 00:39:45.720
It's not as though we're living in the Middle
Ages when evidence was a bit, a bit

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:47.579
scarce on the ground.

00:39:47.579 --> 00:39:51.920
Nowadays we have, we're overflowing with evidence
not least the World Wide Web as I'd just been

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:52.920
saying.

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:57.940
It's such a privilege to be living now when
there is so much evidence and as such fun

00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:59.260
to understand it.

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:02.380
It's such a
glorious experience to understand the answers

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:05.119
to questions like how big is the universe?

00:40:05.119 --> 00:40:07.010
How old is the universe?

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:08.539
When does
life start?

00:40:08.539 --> 00:40:10.220
How did life give rise to us?

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:11.220
Why are we here?

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:15.079
These are all fascinating questions, exhilarating
questions

00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:19.870
and it's our privilege living in the twenty-first
century to be able to answer those questions.

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:25.650
And is really a disreputable
thing to bring children up with Bronze Age

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:28.660
falsehoods when they could be being exposed
to this wonderful truth.

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:37.170
&gt;&gt;male #2: Hi Professor Dawkins, I was particularly
interested in the the question aspect of your

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:38.170
latest
book.

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:41.310
We at Google are running this competition
called the Science Fair.

00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:45.910
We're encouraging teenagers to come up with
questions and use questions to drive scientific

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:50.750
inquiry, which advice to the child or the
teenager who is looking for

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:51.819
inspiration for their question?

00:40:51.819 --> 00:40:54.050
How did they find questions in their world?

00:40:54.050 --> 00:41:01.930
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: Well, I suppose read up
some science, look at videos, look at some,

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:05.950
look at some scientific findings,
And then questions will automatically occur

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:07.740
to you.

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:10.951
There are lots of questions, um, I have lots
of questions that I would

00:41:10.951 --> 00:41:11.951
like answered.

00:41:11.951 --> 00:41:17.430
And I, whenever I meet a physicist or a chemist
or something, I usually do answer them.

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:21.480
So there's a very,
very rich field of questions.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:26.849
Many of which have answers, some of which
we don't, that are no answers.

00:41:26.849 --> 00:41:29.160
And that's
intriguing to because it may be that your

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:34.299
competition will expose some questions which,
as of yet, do not have an answer.

00:41:34.299 --> 00:41:40.450
And that might actually stimulate scientists
to examine what possible answers there might

00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:41.450
be.

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:43.720
[clears throat]
&gt;&gt;male #2: But sparking curiosity where curiosity

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.260
doesn't already exist in a child?

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:48.549
How do we go about doing
that?

00:41:48.549 --> 00:41:52.500
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: Show them films by David
Attenborough.

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:57.820
[laughter]
I mean, I honestly think that's not the problem.

00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:01.210
I be surprised if that was a problem.

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:03.730
If that really is a problem, we're
doing something wrong.

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:06.730
Because, because, give them my book.

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:09.549
[clears throat]
[laughter]

00:42:09.549 --> 00:42:13.299
&gt;&gt;male #2: Thank you.

00:42:13.299 --> 00:42:17.049
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: Anymore questions?

00:42:17.049 --> 00:42:22.680
&gt;&gt;male #3:Thank you again, Professor Dawkins.

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:24.930
A question about the actual writing of the
book.

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:28.660
How did you
find the process of writing a book targeted,

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:34.920
as you say, at the twelve year olds versus
pretty much the rest your previous

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:35.920
writings which have been pretty much adult
focused?

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:36.920
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: Right.

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:37.920
Pretty much the same, actually.

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.609
The only thing that I found was that I some,
I sort of had to

00:42:39.609 --> 00:42:42.460
modify my vocabulary a bit.

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:46.820
I had to, um, uh, just use, I suppose, a bit
of a more restricted vocabulary.

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:53.520
Um, I've always liked the idea of extending
both my, and my readers vocabulary.

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:58.940
If I've always felt that the dictionary is
your friend and it shouldn't be a bad thing

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:03.500
if, if you have to, if you're driven to the
dictionary to look up a word, but

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:09.430
there are limits to that and so a child should
not be expected to go to the dictionary too

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:10.430
often.

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:15.360
Um, and but it is a
problem, I mean, there are people in the audience

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:22.510
today who, who are obviously too young and,
um, I sort of didn't, maybe

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:27.230
another time might try to write a book for
very young children.

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:30.700
Um, twelve is really not that different than
adults

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:31.700
in comprehension.

00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:35.150
&gt;&gt;male #3: Did you find it easier or harder
in general?

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:37.730
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: I found it a little bit
harder.

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:40.910
Um,yes, and I don't know how well I succeeded.

00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:44.740
I did try it out on
various young people and the trouble is I

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:46.730
got quite a variety of answers.

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:54.109
Some of them said this is too easy,
but perhaps they were rather unusually bright.

00:43:54.109 --> 00:43:55.650
And others didn't.

00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:59.069
There were some rather curious things.

00:43:59.069 --> 00:44:07.059
One time, I needed to refer to a soccer ball,
I needed to, I was using the soccer ball as

00:44:07.059 --> 00:44:14.010
an analogy for the sun
and then if you, the idea was to get a scale

00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:15.350
of the universe.

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:19.039
You get a football, and you put it in the
middle of a field,

00:44:19.039 --> 00:44:25.670
and then you walk, I forget how many, twenty
paces, and then you put down, a, uh, I think

00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:31.970
it's a peppercorn,
for earth, and so that gives you an idea of

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:32.970
the scale.

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:36.710
Peppercorn versus football and twenty paces
away and then to the same

00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:43.050
scale, the moon I think is about an inch away,
from the peppercorn, and it is a pinhead.

00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:48.809
And then the nearest other star,
which is still pretty near, Proxima Centauri,

00:44:48.809 --> 00:44:50.779
is two thousand miles away.

00:44:50.779 --> 00:44:54.630
Um, okay, so in order to do that analogy,
I

00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:59.510
referred to a soccer ball, and I got complaints,
"What's soccer?"

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:03.420
[laughter]
Um, I had to say soccer because in America,

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:06.990
if you say football it means something like
a rugby ball.

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:10.740
Um, so I got rather
silly complaints like that but um[chuckles]

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:14.420
Next question if there is one.

00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:15.420
[laughter]

00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:17.690
&gt;&gt;female #1: Hi, I just wondered your opinion
about school science and and teaching falsehoods,

00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:23.470
I wondered
how you think I can, I mean a particular example

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:26.500
would be the teaching of shells, were you
teach a model that explains the

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:33.000
evidence that child is going to encounter
but we know it's false, it's an oversimplification

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.849
that will help a child to make
predictions

00:45:34.849 --> 00:45:35.849
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: Did you say shells?

00:45:35.849 --> 00:45:36.849
&gt;&gt;Unknown female speaker 1: Yeah.

00:45:36.849 --> 00:45:42.940
You know you teach shells and then you teach
more about it as you go along.

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.010
How do you
feel about that?

00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:45.010
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: You're a teacher?

00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:46.010
&gt;&gt;female #1: I have been, yes.

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:47.010
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: Yes.

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:48.010
And what do you teach about shells?

00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:50.599
&gt;&gt;female #1: I've always said this be an oversimplification
of what we currently know to be true that

00:45:50.599 --> 00:45:54.230
will
help you at this stage, but next year we'll

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:56.784
give you a model which will help you make
better predictions.

00:45:56.784 --> 00:45:58.599
But some teachers
just said, this is how it is.

00:45:58.599 --> 00:45:59.599
They are

00:45:59.599 --> 00:46:00.779
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: By shells you mean snail
shells?

00:46:00.779 --> 00:46:01.779
&gt;&gt;female #1: [giggles] No.

00:46:01.779 --> 00:46:04.930
You know, groups of orbitals around a shell,
Yeah.

00:46:04.930 --> 00:46:06.849
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: Oh, I got it.

00:46:06.849 --> 00:46:07.849
Okay sorry.

00:46:07.849 --> 00:46:12.430
&gt;&gt;female #1:I just hated having to teach it
when next year you have to tell them to forget,

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:15.470
but I wondered
what your opinion, do you think it's okay

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:17.480
to teach an oversimplication

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:18.700
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: yes , got it.

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:20.240
&gt;&gt;female #1: to children with that limited
understanding

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:23.390
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: I was confused by your
use of the word shells.

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:25.190
I'm sorry.

00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:29.760
Because actually, um, snail shells are very
interesting as well.

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:35.440
It is a very useful lesson about the way science
proceeds, because science does proceed by

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.430
successive
approximations.

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:42.599
And it is in a sense, in a real sense, true
that earlier models need to be superseded

00:46:42.599 --> 00:46:44.720
and in some sense are
false.

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:53.690
The atomic theory model of, say of, Niels
Bohr, which is sort of a solar system model

00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:59.110
with a nucleus and the electrons as particles
whizzing around the outside.

00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:00.960
That works up to a point.

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:05.010
But is then superseded and so the
lesson that what you learned in last year's

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:12.430
class was actually getting on for wrong, that
is a valuable lesson in itself about

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:13.760
the way science proceeds.

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:14.880
So I wouldn't shrink from that.

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:15.880
If

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:17.930
&gt;&gt;female #1: As long as it's pointed out.

00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:21.320
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: Yes, as long as it's pointed
out, yeah.

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:22.930
&gt;&gt;female #2: Hello, my question is also related
to education.

00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:23.930
I worked with a science teacher who was also
a

00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:29.760
Creationist, which I found to be a bit of
a contradiction.

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:32.980
I just wondered what you think of teaching
of evolution in

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:36.920
schools currently, because I know there's
been quite a lot of stuff you've been working

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:37.920
on recently.

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:38.920
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins:Yes.

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:42.110
Was your Creationist colleague what you might
call a Young Earth Creationist who believed

00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:43.710
the world is
only 6000 years old?

00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:45.170
&gt;&gt;female #2: I don't know the details, sorry.

00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:46.170
[giggles]

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:49.019
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: That's an important question
to ask actually.

00:47:49.019 --> 00:47:53.750
Because that really sorts them out, just to
say a

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:57.569
Creationist, it could mean, was it a he or
she?

00:47:57.569 --> 00:47:58.569
&gt;&gt;female #2: He.

00:47:58.569 --> 00:47:59.569
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: He.

00:47:59.569 --> 00:48:05.230
Could mean that he believes that pretty much
the whole scientific story is true,

00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:09.779
including the age of the universe, the age
of the earth, but that God just started it

00:48:09.779 --> 00:48:10.779
off.

00:48:10.779 --> 00:48:14.589
Which is a very different matter
from those Young Earth Creationists who think

00:48:14.589 --> 00:48:18.650
that the book of Genesis is literally true,
and on the first day God created

00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:22.680
this, and on the second day God created that,
and the whole process only took six days,

00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:25.930
and it all happened six thousand
years ago.

00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:31.650
Um, if the teacher was teaching them that,
then in my opinion, he should be fired instantly.

00:48:31.650 --> 00:48:34.760
&gt;&gt;female #2: He wasn't teaching that, but
that was his belief.

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:38.910
So it was a contradiction in terms
of the way that he taught evolution in schools,

00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:40.840
even though he didn't actually believe that
it occurred.

00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:43.040
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: He taught, he taught what
he didn't believe

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:44.040
&gt;&gt;Unknown female speaker 2: Yeah.

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.040
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: Yes.

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.910
&gt;&gt;female #2 : He obviously would have had
a bias when he was teaching.

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:48.560
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: Yes.

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:57.440
Um, I've actually got into a bit of an argument
about this, because in America, it's very--.The

00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:05.020
idea that your beliefs are private is sacred,
it's built into the American Constitution,

00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:06.400
and rightly so.

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:09.690
Which means that
I was trying to get my American colleagues

00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:16.400
to accept that if a teacher privately believes
something which is different than what he

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:25.609
publicly teaches, there there at least could
be an extreme example where you would not

00:49:25.609 --> 00:49:27.680
wish to employ him as a teacher.

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:32.930
So I tried to think of the most extreme example
I could, and the example I thought of was

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:39.930
a doctor teaching medical students
who doesn't believe in the sex theory of reproduction

00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:44.510
but believes in the stork theory of reproduction.

00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:49.029
And I said, surely, even you
Americans will accept, such a doctor should

00:49:49.029 --> 00:49:51.740
not be employed teaching medical students.

00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:59.180
I was kicked all around the room because his
private beliefs are not important so long

00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:03.640
as what he teaches is the truth.

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:09.260
I'm sorry I shouldn't have said that, the
scientific orthodoxy which is that babies

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:12.160
come because of sex.

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:15.349
And that was where I parted company from my
American colleagues

00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:19.890
because it seemed to me that somebody who
is capable of holding two such contradictory

00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:25.380
beliefs in his head is not somebody I would
wish to have teaching any child of mine.

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:29.950
I then tried to push an even more extreme
example, which is a teacher of geography

00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:36.210
who believes of the earth is flat but nevertheless
teaches that the earth is round.

00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:42.829
Once again, a very substantial number of
people who wrote in to this American web site

00:50:42.829 --> 00:50:49.470
were scandalized that I thought this teacher
of geography should be sacked.

00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:53.329
I
mean, I'm left bewildered by this because

00:50:53.329 --> 00:51:01.420
it seems to me that somehow he has damned
himself as a teacher by this

00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:02.530
contradiction.

00:51:02.530 --> 00:51:08.450
Another example, which is actually a real
one, not a hypothetical one, the professor

00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:13.180
of astronomy at Oxford told me of
a colleague of his who is a professional astronomer

00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:17.250
and writes learned papers in astronomical
journals and mathematical

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:24.460
papers had tacitly assume that the universe
is 13.7 billion years old.

00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:28.930
He writes these papers and gets them published,
privately believes universe is only six thousand

00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:34.369
years old and I can't get my head of around
this, absolutely flat

00:51:34.369 --> 00:51:35.369
contradiction.

00:51:35.369 --> 00:51:43.990
I don't see how you can say this person is
a proper astronomer if he holds these contradictions

00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:45.450
in his head.

00:51:45.450 --> 00:51:47.650
Um, that's all I've got to say.

00:51:47.650 --> 00:51:48.650
I'm just baffled.

00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:55.319
&gt;&gt;female #2: I just got to say I'm a geography
teacher and that if I taught the world was

00:51:55.319 --> 00:51:56.319
flat, I would've
been sacked by Ofsted so

00:51:56.319 --> 00:51:57.319
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: No. well.

00:51:57.319 --> 00:51:59.849
That’s right, but the hypothetical case
is that you teach that the world is round,

00:51:59.849 --> 00:52:01.220
but
privately believe it's flat.

00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:02.599
&gt;&gt;female #2: Okay.

00:52:02.599 --> 00:52:03.599
Thank you.

00:52:03.599 --> 00:52:06.740
&gt;&gt;male #4: Hi, my name is Mehdi.

00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:12.960
I just have a quick question considering that
the extremely small is more or less

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.680
equal to the extremely big.

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:19.539
Do you consider the solar system as just a
molecule?

00:52:19.539 --> 00:52:25.400
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: No, I am not sure it's
true that the extremely small, in a way that

00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:34.279
came up earlier, because the Bohr model
of the atom was indeed sort of inspired by

00:52:34.279 --> 00:52:35.650
the solar system.

00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:39.329
But it's actually rather wrong, and so one
can make a, maybe

00:52:39.329 --> 00:52:44.020
that's what you're doing, make a kind of science
fiction fantasy that actually our solar system

00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:46.930
is just an atom in some
gigantic universe.

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:55.660
It's a nice science fiction idea, but I don't
think it's very realistic.

00:52:55.660 --> 00:53:00.970
&gt;&gt;male #5: Hi, I like the way you presented
evolution by the pictures and stuff.

00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:07.220
Obviously, you had to stop at
some point, um and maybe the more inquisitive

00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:12.010
children here would still be wondering if
they had heard the answer or not,

00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:14.200
Who is the first man?

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:19.491
So my question is, in the book do you attempt
to tackle and explain abiogenesis and like

00:53:19.491 --> 00:53:22.160
the chemical
origins of life

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:26.089
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: Oh oh okay, so you're going
back much much further than just the first

00:53:26.089 --> 00:53:27.089
person.

00:53:27.089 --> 00:53:28.089
&gt;&gt;male #5: Yes.

00:53:28.089 --> 00:53:29.089
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: Yes, yes of course.

00:53:29.089 --> 00:53:34.520
It is true that the whole process of evolution
couldn't get started until a rather

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:39.859
singular chemical event happened, which was
the origin of, let's call it the first gene.

00:53:39.859 --> 00:53:42.539
It wouldn't have been DNA, but it would have
been

00:53:42.539 --> 00:53:48.700
some kind of molecule which had the property
of self-replication.

00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:50.890
The property of making copies of itself.

00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:55.530
Once you've got
that, and the copies have to be very accurate.

00:53:55.530 --> 00:54:00.109
Once you've got that, you're well on your
way to evolution and then the rest

00:54:00.109 --> 00:54:01.910
of evolution will follow.

00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:07.869
But we do have to have that first step, which
is the origin of the first cell replicating

00:54:07.869 --> 00:54:08.869
molecule.

00:54:08.869 --> 00:54:14.500
That would have been a phenomenon of Chemistry
which would have been a chance, a stroke of

00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:22.710
luck, which had to come
about probably in the primeval sea, and it

00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:28.309
only had to happen once so that really could
have been a massive stroke of luck.

00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:31.069
And we don't know whether it was a massive
stroke of luck.

00:54:31.069 --> 00:54:38.750
So far, no chemist as far as I know, has come
up with a plausible

00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:41.140
theory for exactly what happened.

00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:48.269
It is actually a rather interesting thought,
that if you are one of those people who

00:54:48.269 --> 00:54:52.241
believes we are alone in the universe, if
you're one of those people that thinks that

00:54:52.241 --> 00:54:57.240
this is the only life in the entire
universe, and there are people who think that,

00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:02.289
than that automatically commits you to a very
strange view.

00:55:02.289 --> 00:55:07.230
Since there are
probably at least ten to the twenty-two planets

00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:14.150
in the universe, that's a one with twenty-two
naughts after it, then in order for you

00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:20.910
to believe that we are alone in the universe,
than you would have to believe that the origin

00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:29.029
of life, on our planet, is a
staggeringly rare improbable event.

00:55:29.029 --> 00:55:34.400
Because it only happened in one of the ten
to the twenty-two opportunities for it to

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:35.400
happen.

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:44.960
Well, when you put it like that than you realize
that, um, it's actually very, very improbable

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:49.390
that we are the only
planet in the universe that has life, but

00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:50.990
we could be.

00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:56.769
We could be because if the origin of life
really was that improbable,

00:55:56.769 --> 00:56:02.769
that there's only one planet in the ten to
the twenty-two that has life than we would

00:56:02.769 --> 00:56:05.710
have to be that planet.

00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:08.270
Because here
we are talking about it.

00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:10.839
And so it's actually not impossible.

00:56:10.839 --> 00:56:13.160
I don't believe it, I think that the origin
of life was a

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:15.789
much more probable event than that.

00:56:15.789 --> 00:56:20.810
Which, the flip side of that automatically
means that I have to believe that there's

00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:22.940
lots of life all around the universe.

00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:30.579
The universe is teeming with life but because
universe is so big even if there are a

00:56:30.579 --> 00:56:36.920
billion examples of life dotted around the
universe, they will still be so spread out,

00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:40.390
so far apart from one another that
none of them will ever meet any of the others.

00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:46.750
Which is rather sad, a sort of celestial Polynesia
without the canoes to,

00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:50.549
um, to bridge the, to bridge the gaps.
[laughter]

00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:56.720
But maybe chemists will soon come up with
with the theory, of the theory of the origin

00:56:56.720 --> 00:57:00.790
of life so plausible that everyone will
say yes of course that's the way it had to

00:57:00.790 --> 00:57:01.790
happen.

00:57:01.790 --> 00:57:05.130
And once we've done that then, then we can
be pretty sure there's lots

00:57:05.130 --> 00:57:08.599
and lots of life all around the universe.

00:57:08.599 --> 00:57:10.769
&gt;&gt;male #5: Thanks.

00:57:10.769 --> 00:57:16.890
&gt;&gt;presenter: These will be our last three
questions for tonight.

00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:18.539
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: All right.

00:57:18.539 --> 00:57:20.190
&gt;&gt;male #6: Hi there.

00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:25.380
You gave a little tidbit of wisdom around
how you should generate your beliefs, how

00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:28.390
you
shouldn't generate them, from number five,

00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:30.800
people in authority.

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:35.430
And I was interested in understanding from
you how you

00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:44.289
generated your very strong beliefs when you
were young and how you actually grew up to

00:57:44.289 --> 00:57:49.470
be in a position where you are now,
where you have very strong beliefs based on

00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:51.260
facts and are vocal with that.

00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:57.539
But you didn't always have that,
and so taking yourself to the target age of

00:57:57.539 --> 00:58:04.450
your book, twelve, or to age of children here
how you actually as you grew up as

00:58:04.450 --> 00:58:08.500
a child developed these beliefs and everything

00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:09.500
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: Yes.

00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:14.119
I, I prefer not to talk about very strong
beliefs because it seems to me nobody's beliefs

00:58:14.119 --> 00:58:16.450
should be
so strong they're not open to change if new

00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:17.789
evidence comes in.

00:58:17.789 --> 00:58:23.720
And so, um, I think I prefer to say that if
the evidence for

00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:28.940
something is very strong then there comes
a point when you might use the word belief.

00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:40.029
But you ask about my own childhood, and I
was brought up in, well, I was sent Anglican

00:58:40.029 --> 00:58:49.599
schools, so I was brought up to believe, which
I did, Bronze Age myths and shed

00:58:49.599 --> 00:58:58.180
them when I became old enough to understand
the true scientific explanation for our own

00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:05.599
existence because I was very
impressed by the complexity and elegance of

00:59:05.599 --> 00:59:07.400
living things.

00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:11.079
And very impressed by the argument that there
must be a designer

00:59:11.079 --> 00:59:13.560
is it looks as though it's got a designer.

00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:18.020
It was only when I learned the Darwinian explanation
which we now know to be

00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:24.050
true, at least broadly true, that I was able
to shed that belief.

00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:27.890
Other people, they base their religious belief
on something

00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:31.549
else and so they will shed it for a different
reason.

00:59:31.549 --> 00:59:35.819
But my case it really was discovering Darwin.

00:59:35.819 --> 00:59:42.630
&gt;&gt;male #6: Were you a minority amongst your
peers at that time and age?

00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:43.630
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: No, I wouldn't say so,
no.

00:59:43.630 --> 00:59:44.630
&gt;&gt;male #6: Thanks.

00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:50.610
&gt;&gt;male #7: Excellent, the guy in front of
me always takes the question I was going to

00:59:50.610 --> 00:59:51.610
ask.

00:59:51.610 --> 00:59:54.500
[laughter]
Anyway, firstly I'd like to say thank you

00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:58.760
for that really excellent excellent explanation
one hundred eighty-fifth million greats

00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:05.670
grandfather, my son actually turned to me
and said there really is a family resemblance.

01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:06.980
[laughter]
And so thank you for that.

01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:11.869
I guess my question would be because there's
a lot of children in the audience, which I

01:00:11.869 --> 01:00:16.460
count
myself amongst, what, apart from your own

01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:20.420
book, what else would you be recommending
for children, you know, eight, ten,

01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:26.170
twelve to be reading, or what experiences
do you suggest they have to drive that inspiration

01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:27.170
about science?

01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:28.819
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: Gosh, I'm not the best
person to ask.

01:00:28.819 --> 01:00:31.260
I haven't actually looked into that question
very much and maybe there

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:33.430
are others here who could make suggestions.

01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:38.710
I bet there are some very good books,and probably
films, probably things on

01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:39.710
YouTube.

01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:44.000
There's some very inspiring things on YouTube
actually.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.880
I've already mentioned David Attenborough's
films.

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.530
I think they're
very, very inspiring.

01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:50.170
Carl Sagan's Cosmos.

01:00:50.170 --> 01:00:56.680
It's a bit old now but it's available on DVD
and is superb.

01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:00.480
There are some good
things on the Discovery channel.

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:07.150
I think we live in an extraordinarily rich
time for resources to explain the wonders

01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:08.150
of
science.

01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:11.390
&gt;&gt;male #7: Do you think technology's going
to play an increasing part in that, you know

01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:16.109
a ten year old, and
you showed your Apple hopefully Galaxy Tab

01:01:16.109 --> 01:01:19.640
as opposed to an IPad.
[laughter]

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:22.670
Do you think technology will increasing play
a part in that?

01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:24.020
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: Yes, I do.

01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:30.339
And in a way today's children are kind of
spoiled, I mean it's, if you can imagine going

01:01:30.339 --> 01:01:38.130
back to my childhood when I mean the sort
of thing you can see on everybody's laptop

01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:43.760
computer would have just dazzled the
socks off of me as a child.

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:53.799
And I mean I was desperately covetous of a
little toy where you could project little

01:01:53.799 --> 01:01:55.180
film strips
onto the wall.

01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:57.359
And I desperately wanted one of these things.

01:01:57.359 --> 01:01:59.430
The idea of having my own little projector
and could project

01:01:59.430 --> 01:02:01.450
onto the wall.

01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:10.670
And I tried to even make my own but getting
a roll of transparent, semitransparent loo

01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:17.160
paper and drawing on
each sheet and then shining a light through

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:19.109
and of course, it didn't work.

01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:22.579
And I prayed and prayed and prayed and prayed
to

01:02:22.579 --> 01:02:26.569
be given one of these little projectors for
Christmas and lo and behold I was.

01:02:26.569 --> 01:02:30.589
[laughter] And, um, but I mean that was the
height of

01:02:30.589 --> 01:02:35.369
ambition of a child in, when I was a child.

01:02:35.369 --> 01:02:39.890
And of course nowadays such a projector are
would would be big deal you know just

01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:42.130
think which you can do on your own laptop.

01:02:42.130 --> 01:02:48.079
And so, yes, I think that the Internet is
a magnificent resource and children

01:02:48.079 --> 01:02:54.430
should appreciate what wonderful opportunities
they have, and no doubt it's going to get

01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:58.519
better if Moore's law persists as
that as it looks like it will for a while.

01:02:58.519 --> 01:02:59.519
&gt;&gt;male #7: Great to know.

01:02:59.519 --> 01:03:04.190
I would just like to say one final comment
about people you discussed in terms of

01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:10.490
teaching something they don't necessarily
believe in, and our world we call those salesmen.

01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:11.490
[laughter]

01:03:11.490 --> 01:03:19.090
&gt;&gt;male #8: And my question is, did you consider
a psychology, or scientific psychology approach

01:03:19.090 --> 01:03:22.580
to the
question why does religion exist?

01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:24.470
And because

01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:25.470
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: Yes.

01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:29.039
&gt;&gt;male #8: I live in Ireland my kids go to
a state school which is, of course, a Catholic

01:03:29.039 --> 01:03:30.039
school,

01:03:30.039 --> 01:03:31.859
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: Yes.
and I think they must look around them and

01:03:31.859 --> 01:03:40.990
think if one nearly everybody else is Catholic,
everybody else believes, why?

01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:43.150
Why do people believe?

01:03:43.150 --> 01:03:47.900
And when you think of it and then they look
at it, I've introduced them

01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:49.847
to lots of different religions, I took them
to Greece two years ago.

01:03:49.847 --> 01:03:54.089
I think that's an interesting question, why,
why does religion

01:03:54.089 --> 01:03:55.089
exist?

01:03:55.089 --> 01:03:56.089
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: Yes.

01:03:56.089 --> 01:04:00.880
Will you pose it as a psychological question,
and I think as a question in psychology, you

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:04.819
almost
answered it because if children are sent to

01:04:04.819 --> 01:04:08.799
a school, in the case of Ireland it would
be a Catholic school as you say, where

01:04:08.799 --> 01:04:13.069
they're indoctrinated, and everyone around
them is indoctrinated in the same way, then

01:04:13.069 --> 01:04:17.270
requires a great deal of independence
of mind to break away from that.

01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:23.150
Fortunately, a large number of people actually
do but too many of them unfortunately don't

01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:27.940
and so childhood indoctrination of course
persists to the next generation and the next

01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:34.660
and the next because those people who
don't break away end up teaching in Irish

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:39.829
Catholic schools because obviously the ones
who do break away wouldn't be employed

01:04:39.829 --> 01:04:45.380
in teaching so it does persists from generation
to generation to generation.

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:47.599
And so that's the psychological answer.

01:04:47.599 --> 01:04:52.420
&gt;&gt;male #8: But there's hooks that religion
must fit into in our brains

01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:57.760
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins:There are hooks and I would
agree with you and and a one of those hooks

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:02.539
is that people tend to want to go
on believing what feels good.

01:05:02.539 --> 01:05:09.640
And so, for example, if you want to survive
your own death and religion tells you you

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:12.240
will
survive your own death, than you find that

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:14.950
an agreeable thought.

01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:17.900
I never quite got why it was that agreeable
when that also

01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:23.509
threaten you with going to burn forever in
hell.

01:05:23.509 --> 01:05:29.960
If you commit some footling list on offense,
I say footling

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:38.880
because in a way, um, there's a sort of law
that says if you're trying to persuade people

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:46.309
of something by threat then the more
implausible threat is.

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:53.079
The more horrible and nasty it has to be to
counteract its intrinsic implausibility.

01:05:53.079 --> 01:06:01.430
So if the threat is if you do something wrong
then if you'll be given some punishment like

01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:07.319
write out hundred lines or so,
or something, if the threat is very real because

01:06:07.319 --> 01:06:10.690
you know is highly plausible that you will
have to write a hundred lines.

01:06:10.690 --> 01:06:14.670
In my youth, it would have been being beaten.

01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:18.509
Also that was plausible because it really
did happen, but because the threat of

01:06:18.509 --> 01:06:26.069
hell is so ludicrously implausible, it has
to be made very, very nasty indeed.

01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:29.519
[chuckles] So that you take it seriously because
it just

01:06:29.519 --> 01:06:35.640
might be true and if it is true you're going
to burn in a lake of fire forever, and ever,

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:36.640
and ever, and ever.

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:38.200
Every time a
layer of skin is burned off, a new layer grows

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.789
that can be burned off you again.

01:06:39.789 --> 01:06:46.869
I mean, they pile it on, they pile on the
agony because it's so intrinsically implausible.

01:06:46.869 --> 01:06:49.150
Now that's another of the psychological hooks.

01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:54.039
Ultimately, as a Darwinian, I would need to
explain where those psychological hooks come

01:06:54.039 --> 01:06:58.591
from, from the evolutionary point of view,
and I think we can do that too, but I think

01:06:58.591 --> 01:07:03.059
that perhaps is another story which perhaps
we've have gone on long enough

01:07:03.059 --> 01:07:04.859
&gt;&gt;male #8: Next book..

01:07:04.859 --> 01:07:06.220
&gt;&gt;Richard Dawkins: Yes.

01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:09.630
&gt;&gt;presenter: Professor Dawkins, thank you
for joining us today and providing us with

01:07:09.630 --> 01:07:13.609
such a powerful book to teach science to our
young ones.

01:07:13.609 --> 01:07:18.690
And thank you for coming today and joining
us, and all of the Googlers joining us live

01:07:18.690 --> 01:07:22.749
through the web stream around Europe, thanks
for dialing in.

01:07:22.749 --> 01:07:26.119
Don't worry if you didn't get a chance to
ask a question to Professor Dawkins because

01:07:26.119 --> 01:07:31.269
after the signing session, he will uh,he told
me he would like to stay around and chat to

01:07:31.269 --> 01:07:32.970
us for a bit more while.

01:07:32.970 --> 01:07:35.160
Let's hear it one more time for Professor
Richard Dawkins.

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:35.460
[Applause]
