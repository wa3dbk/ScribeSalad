&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: Everything you need to know
about me is on the screen already. So there's

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.220
nothing left to say.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.220
[laughter]

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.519
I'm Brian Dunning. I do the podcast "Skeptoid."
It's been one of the top science podcasts

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:21.199
in iTunes for, since the beginning of 2007.
In one night, it went from the last pages

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.750
to the front page. And it went from 13,000
listeners to 40,000 listeners overnight, just

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.689
as soon as it went on the front page of the
science section.

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.030
And I guess now, it's up to about 135,000
per week. And that's the way I count. That's

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.960
unique IP addresses downloading one or more
episodes, and everyone counts them differently.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.130
What was that funny noise?

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.010
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: It's a dog.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.250
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: It's a dog.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.250
[laughter]

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.250
[dog yelps]

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.250
[Brian laughs]

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.020
I think it's a dog. Well, the show is called
"Sounds From Beyond." So that was a sound

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.190
from beyond the room.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.190
[laughter]

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.590
No, no. The dog's fun. Leave the dog alone.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.120
[laughter]

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.239
In fact, bring him out. Maybe he'll do some
tricks for us. That's always more fun than

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:07.771
PowerPoint. OK. Anyway. So, my show. We're
doing a talk. "Skeptoid" is about pop culture

00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:12.720
phenomena-- things that people generally believe
that either aren’t true, or that there's

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.940
a more interesting truth behind them.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.420
Fact is often more interesting than fiction.
And when you look at anything, any of these

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.780
urban legends, things in pop culture that
are promoted on television or whatever, and

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.140
you dig into the facts, you almost always
find something that's more interesting, more

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.850
engaging, than the popular paranormal, or
pop explanation-- whatever it might be.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.240
So every show, I deal with one particular
subject. The shows are short. They're 10 to

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:48.240
12 minutes long. So it's an easy little sound
bite to grab. And a lot of them are about

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.360
sounds, obviously, since it's an audio podcast.
And so I've collected a lot of these examples

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.220
and put them into this presentation, "Sounds
From Beyond." And if I had a little echo button,

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.020
I'd push it and sound really cool.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.020
[laughter]

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.040
So let's get started. Sounds from beyond.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.570
[high-pitched music]

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:13.960
There's my sounds from beyond. That's really
loud. Whoops. This is a beta test.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.380
[computerized sounds]

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.610
Pay no attention. I first got interested in
this when I was in high school. I lived in

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:30.480
Orinda, just across the Bay over here. And
we lived in a house that was built on landfill.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.920
There was this big ditch that had a creek
in it.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.750
And at the bottom of the creek, they'd bulldozed
in a whole bunch of dirt and debris. And they

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.710
built a couple of houses on it. And these
houses were really cheaply built. And the

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.710
land was always shifting. We had slides. And
so, the houses were always creaking and everything

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.480
was not quite straight. And my bedroom was
way up in the corner of the room, of the house.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.460
My head was four feet away from this one layer
of thin plywood ceiling that was the whole

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.310
roof of the house. There was no insulation
or anything. And right where I slept, my head

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:10.150
was in the absolute corner, there was a weird
creaking that would sound inside the wall.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.770
Sometimes it would sound like a mechanical
creak, like wood or metal or something, or

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:14.770
a hinge.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.460
Sometimes it would sound exactly like a cat
or a baby, or some kind of animal. This weird

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:27.130
reeh. And it would repeat itself at even intervals
all night long. And all day long, sometimes

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.681
during the day. And I could never figure out
what it was. And it always creeped me out.

00:03:31.681 --> 00:03:37.760
I was a teenager and at night, it would be
quite scary for me sometimes.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.790
So one summer day, I vowed that I was going
to figure out what the hell this sound was.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:43.790
Can I say hell? Sorry.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.790
[audience chatter]

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.070
Does that offend anyone?

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.070
[laughter]

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.680
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: After Dan Savage
yesterday?

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.880
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: OK.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.880
[laughter]

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.850
Will do. OK. Where was I? Did I start? I planned
this big assault to find out what the sound

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.070
was. I got a ladder. I climbed up onto the
roof of the house. I inspected the whole sides

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:10.270
of the house where there's these little metal,
hingy flaps for the air conditioning, I guess.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.880
Anything that could possibly move or bend
or creak, I was pushing and pulling and prodding,

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:21.230
under the house everywhere. And I couldn't
find any cause of the mysterious sound in

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:27.320
the wall. And to this day, it's an unsolved
mystery for me. But it's something that kind

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.430
of stuck with me. And it got me interested
in trying to solve mysteries.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.750
And mine is not the only one. There's plenty
of sounds in the walls in nature. This is

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.370
one that if you pay attention to CNN or newspapers
at all, you may have heard this. It's called

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.990
"the bloop." You can use Google. It's a nice
website.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.990
[laughter]

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.380
And you can google the bloop. Can I say google
as if it's a verb, or is that like verboten

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.380
here?

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.380
[laughter]

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.850
Will the lawyers come in and beat me? So you
can google for the bloop. And what you'll

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.820
always find is this article that uses much
of the same languages. The exact same sentences

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.240
copied and pasted between various news articles
and blogs.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.040
And they say that "scientists have determined
that it must be an unknown animal; some kind

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.710
of a sea monster." Here's what it sounds like.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.220
[plays audio clip]

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.240
[end clip]

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.220
What you're looking at here, obviously, is
a spectrogram, for those who don't know. You

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.400
have time along the X-axis. And the Y-axis
is frequency. And so, you're hearing the big

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.860
bloop. That second stroke is just kind of
a burst of static. I'll play it one more time.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.419
[plays audio clip]

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:40.460
[rushing wind]

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.500
[quick tapping]

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:50.040
So it's that bloop sound. This was recorded
in the South Pacific Ocean in 1997. It was

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.900
extremely loud. It was heard thousands of
miles in different directions. It was recorded

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.590
on a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration--
not sonogram-- what do you call them? Sono--?

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.410
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #3: Sonar.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.960
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: Sonar. Under the water. The
sonar arrays. The things sitting on the bottom

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.979
that were supposed to listen for undersea
earthquakes and movement along the Pacific

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:18.479
plate. And it's unsolved. NOAA has no explanation
for what this sound is. It's sped up 16 times.

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:22.241
So when you actually heard it, it was subsonic.
You would have had to listen to the--.

00:06:22.241 --> 00:06:27.010
You'd have to look at the spectrogram to tell
that there was any sound there. And when they

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:32.330
played it back sped up, that's what it sounded
like. So, this is widely promoted as evidence

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.480
of a sea monster, because they say, "Well,
its sounds, it has the same audio profile,

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.110
looking at the spectrogram, as living creatures,
like whales."

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:46.020
Well, it doesn't. I did a whole episode on
it. If you wanna look up the bloop on Skeptoid.com,

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:51.820
right there, you'll see a whole bunch of other
comparative sounds, actual whales and sounds

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.021
that actually do come from the sea-- volcanoes,
earthquakes, anything you can think of that

00:06:56.021 --> 00:06:58.910
it might be. And you can see it doesn't look
remotely like them.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.730
This is another sound, in fact, that's unsolved,
that I think sounds a lot scarier. I'll play

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:04.730
this one.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.699

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.660
[end clip]

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:18.229
It actually sounds a lot more like a whale,
but it doesn't look anything like a whale.

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:22.449
And that one is called "Julia." They just
gave it a name. And it's officially classified

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:27.389
as unsolved. There are no scientists who have
decided that these must be sea monsters.

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:33.360
That's strictly the ornamentation added to
the story by a reporter. Here's one that has

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.430
a really cool sound.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.230
[plays audio clip]

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.620
A really cool name.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.010

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:42.200
[end clip]

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:50.240
It's called "the train." Sounds like a train
whistle, doesn't it? Usually when I do this,

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:56.400
it's roughly synchronized with the train whistle.
But [pause] not only do you hear the high

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.550
frequency sound, but you see those low frequency
bands, also.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:02.889
Those are also part of the sound. And they're
also unexplained. This one is called "the

00:08:02.889 --> 00:08:03.889
slowdown."

00:08:03.889 --> 00:08:05.910

[wind slows down]

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:18.470
What do you think that might be? Obviously
the thing that comes to mind is an engine

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.410
slowing down-- a submarine, or a ship, or
something like that. It's not. Those sound

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:25.789
very different. They look very different on
a spectrogram. So, this is also officially

00:08:25.789 --> 00:08:28.640
unsolved. Here's one called "the upsweep."

[audio clip continues]

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:45.110
Sounds like a police siren or something. Nobody
has any idea what this could be. There's a

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:46.769
whole giant library of these at NOAA.

00:08:46.769 --> 00:08:47.769
[audio clip ends]

00:08:47.769 --> 00:08:50.940
They're really quite cool. If you--whoops.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:55.399
So here's another sound in the wall, if you
were, that's from a completely different part

00:08:55.399 --> 00:08:58.540
of the world. And I wanna see if you can guess
what this might be. And if you've already

00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:59.540
seen this presentation, don't shout it out,
you.

&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #7: Didgeridoo.

00:09:28.089 --> 00:09:31.899
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: Not a didgeridoo. I guess
that would be mechanical. Here is a hint.

00:09:31.899 --> 00:09:32.899
[audio clip ends]

00:09:32.899 --> 00:09:33.899

I apologize for the guy wearing Speedos. It
is sand squeaking. [audio clip ends] This

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:43.819
is the [plays previous audio clip of deep
wind rushing] singing sands. These are the

00:09:43.819 --> 00:09:48.860
Eureka Dunes in Death Valley. There's a number
of places in the world where the sand sings,

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.839
given the right conditions.

00:09:50.839 --> 00:09:54.381
Sand dunes, they're not all dry sand. Part
of the reason that they stay in pretty much

00:09:54.381 --> 00:09:59.360
the same place year after year is that 18
to 24 inches below the surface, they become

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:06.489
almost solid. Either there's wet sand or it's
hardened rock or dirt. And given the right

00:10:06.489 --> 00:10:10.899
temperature and humidity and wind, [audio
clip ends] the sand will actually make that

00:10:10.899 --> 00:10:11.899
noise.

00:10:11.899 --> 00:10:15.519
And you can actually hear it. That's an audible
recording. It's not sped up. The volume is

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:20.369
about what it would sound like if you were
there in person. And although this is partly

00:10:20.369 --> 00:10:24.899
understood, it's not completely understood
how and why this happens. So, that's just

00:10:24.899 --> 00:10:30.019
a really interesting area of research. The
complexities involved in what's causing that

00:10:30.019 --> 00:10:34.119
sound are really something pretty cool.

00:10:34.119 --> 00:10:38.639
And there's other sounds that don't turn out
to be scary when we learn what they are. This

00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:44.860
is one. You can guess from the picture that
this is a pulsar. This one is going one point

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:45.970
four times a second.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:47.410
[plays audio clip]

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:48.850
[mechanical tapping sound]

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:54.720
Now, when we first heard this, we thought
that it had to be an intelligent signal because

00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:01.319
it sounds so regular and so perfect. And it's
absolutely right on. It never changes. So

00:11:01.319 --> 00:11:04.970
this was called the LGM signal for a long
time-- Little Green Men.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:11.379
We thought it was aliens until we learned
what pulsars were. Pulsars, as you may know,

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:17.160
when a star goes supernova, it collapses.
And all of that rotational inertia is preserved.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:22.600
And as it collapses down into a neutron star,
it's spinning. So all the spin that the sun

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.970
had is greatly accelerated like a figure skater
bringing in her arms.

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:32.050
And so it's spinning quite fast. And it shoots
out this jet of x-rays and gamma rays, which

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:36.600
is also not completely understood how or why
they shoot out these jets. But each time that

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:41.170
jet spins by us, and if we're on the same
plane, we hear a click like that. And that's

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:45.399
not the only pulsar that there are. There's
others that spin faster. This is one in the

00:11:45.399 --> 00:11:46.399
VELA.

[end clip]

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:58.629
That was going eleven times a second. And
this one exploded ten thousand years ago.

00:11:58.629 --> 00:12:03.369
So, people probably saw it. Here's one that
people definitely saw. This happened in 1054

00:12:03.369 --> 00:12:09.170
AD. It's going even faster. It's 30 times
a second. And this is the Crab Pulsar in the

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:10.170
center of the Crab Nebula.

[end clip]

00:12:14.139 --> 00:12:20.379
Now I want you to stop for a second and reflect
on what you're hearing. That is a body in

00:12:20.379 --> 00:12:26.579
space, spinning that fast. It's about the
size of Earth and it's spinning that fast.

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:31.249
If you were up next to that thing in a spaceship,
watching something that size, moving that

00:12:31.249 --> 00:12:37.110
fast, it really boggles the mind. Or, how
about 174 times a second?

[laughter]

00:12:49.059 --> 00:12:52.569
Last one I'm gonna play for you is the second
fastest pulsar known. The surface of this

00:12:52.569 --> 00:12:56.829
body is moving one-seventh the speed of light
as it rotates.

[end clip]

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:08.449
And we all know all of that just by listening
to the sound and analyzing the sound that

00:13:08.449 --> 00:13:16.069
we heard. Now, some sounds are not quite as
useful as evidence in solving a mystery. Some

00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:18.170
sounds, we don't know where they came from.

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:21.650
We're not sure of their provenance. They're
just presented to us and somebody tells us

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:25.319
a story of where they heard the sound and
where they recorded it. And you might get

00:13:25.319 --> 00:13:26.319
a sound like this.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.040
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: That sounds like
a dog.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.959
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: What's that?

00:13:48.959 --> 00:13:51.239
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: That sounds like
a dog.

00:13:51.239 --> 00:13:53.470
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: That sounds like a dog? I
don't know what it sounds like. The reason

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:58.629
we know that it's Bigfoot is because it's
on an album titled, "The Bigfoot Recordings."

00:13:58.629 --> 00:14:00.359
[laughter]

00:14:00.359 --> 00:14:05.060
And the reason we can rely on that is because
they were analyzed by a "linguist." Quote,

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.060
unquote.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.060
[laughter]

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:12.449
The linguist, her professional background
is that she plays the flute and she speaks

00:14:12.449 --> 00:14:15.879
several languages. Therefore, it's Bigfoot.

00:14:15.879 --> 00:14:17.559
[laughter]

00:14:17.559 --> 00:14:22.319
And, if that's not enough science credibility
for you, the recording is narrated by Jonathan

00:14:34.929 --> 00:14:37.660

[end clip]

00:14:43.129 --> 00:14:49.679
So, I'll say just a little bit about why I'd
say that these sounds are useless as evidence.

00:14:49.679 --> 00:14:53.199
Why we can't just listen to that and say,
"Well, somebody says they recorded it at such

00:14:53.199 --> 00:14:57.170
and such a place, and at such and such a time,
and they don't know what it is and the linguist

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:59.249
says that it's Bigfoot, so therefore, it's
Bigfoot."

00:14:59.249 --> 00:15:04.389
Why do we dismiss that? You've probably all
heard the statement that that which can be

00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:08.809
asserted without evidence can be dismissed
without evidence. It's not necessarily as

00:15:08.809 --> 00:15:14.079
glib as that. When something has no provenance,
when something is an anecdote like that, we

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:16.929
can't test it. We can't verify it.

00:15:16.929 --> 00:15:20.920
And it's as simple as that, really. We're
not simply dismissing it. We have good reason

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:26.139
because we cannot test it. We don't know,
we don't actually know where it was recorded,

00:15:26.139 --> 00:15:31.410
when it was recorded, under what circumstances,
where the tape has been all these years. It's

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:35.459
interesting. And if somebody tells us, "I
recorded Bigfoot at this place and at this

00:15:35.459 --> 00:15:38.980
time," that can suggest directions for us
to go research.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:43.110
We can then send a real team to go and listen
and see if anything’s going on and document

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:50.429
it properly. But as far as evidence, itself,
it doesn't qualify yet. Anecdotal evidence.

00:15:50.429 --> 00:15:55.350
So, some sounds, however, do have a very useful
provenance that does allow us to solve the

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:59.949
mystery. If you watch any of the pseudo-History
channels, or the pseudo-Science channels on

00:15:59.949 --> 00:16:03.419
TV, you may have seen UFO shows.

00:16:03.419 --> 00:16:08.169
In fact, I bet you have. One of the UFO stories
you might have been told, is the case of the

00:16:08.169 --> 00:16:14.660
Rendlesham Forest UFO. This is one that happened
in the UK at an Air Force base inside the

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:21.309
UK in 1980. What happened was a bunch of young
US airmen saw some flashing lights out through

00:16:21.309 --> 00:16:24.731
the trees. They went running out through the
trees to track them down and see what it was.

00:16:24.731 --> 00:16:29.889
They initially thought a plane had crashed.
And so, they were following the flashing lights.

00:16:29.889 --> 00:16:35.240
And later, their story grew into what's now
told on the TV shows. But at the time, all

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:39.509
they reported was seeing flashing lights and
chasing them down. So they went back to the

00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:41.679
base and they got their Colonel--Colonel Halt.

00:16:41.679 --> 00:16:47.269
And he came back with an audio recorder. And
he made an officially documented audio recording

00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:51.139
of their chase through the trees, following
the blinking light. And here's a few seconds

00:16:51.139 --> 00:16:52.249
from that audio recording.

00:16:52.249 --> 00:16:56.499

&gt;&gt;Colonel Halt: Where?

00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:15.250
&gt;&gt;Male: Right on this position here, straight
ahead, in-between the tree--. There it is

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:16.250
again. Watch. Straight ahead off my flashlight.
There it is.

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:17.250
&gt;&gt;Colonel Halt: I see it, too. What is it?

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:18.250
&gt;&gt;Male: We don't know, sir. It's a strange,
small red light.

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.250
[end clip]

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:20.250
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: Now you see that is circled
in yellow up in the corner of this picture.

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:21.670
This is actually the view from the forest.
If you went all the way through the forest

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:25.350
where these guys were and came out of the
trees, this is what you would see. That is

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:29.070
the Orford Ness lighthouse.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:33.280
The constable showed up because the Air Force
base, they called the local constable and

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.930
said, "Hey, we think we've got a crashed plane
or some accident or something." They came

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:42.020
out, wrote in their report, "These guys saw
the lighthouse." And they left. And that's

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:46.510
obviously evidence of a government conspiracy
that they left with no further investigation.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:51.280
So, the Orford Ness lighthouse has a period
of exactly five seconds. Every lighthouse

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:55.800
has a unique period--the time between each
blink. That's how sailors can identify which

00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:00.780
lighthouse they're looking at. So, with a
five second beep, overlaid on top of this

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.590

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:28.360
That solved the mystery for us very reliably.
That's the value of sounds.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:35.250
So, sometimes, the sounds are not always clues
that help us solve mysteries. Sometimes, the

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:41.490
sounds are the mysteries themselves. You're
looking at a Royal Air Force base on the island

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:46.980
of Akrotiri in Cyprus.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:53.260
And short-wave radio enthusiasts have, for
about 20 years, 25 years, they've been hearing

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:57.631
a radio broadcast on a particular frequency,
at the same time of day, every single day.

00:18:57.631 --> 00:19:02.510
And this is what it sounds like.

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:19.730
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: And they triangulated it
to this RAF base. And so the conspiracy theories

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:26.110
started flying. These are called numbers stations.
If you Google the internets, you will find--

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:27.110
[laughter]

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:30.890
all sorts of stories about the numbers stations
and conspiracy theories about what they are.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:38.120
Sometimes, people suggest plausible explanations,
like there's buoys in the ocean transmitting

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.780
weather data and things like this.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:45.820
But those don't use a voice recording on short-wave.
So it must be governments transmitting evil

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:51.080
instructions to their evil spies. Here's another
one that interestingly comes from inside the

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.510
White Sands missile base in the United States--

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:56.160

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:04.240
followed by the same strings of five numbers
repeating over and over again. And this one

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:08.990
actually rotates frequencies. It plays the
same time of day on the same frequency, every

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:12.220
single day, stepping up a few frequencies
each time.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:18.180
It turns out in this case, that the conspiracy
theory explanation is the true one. There's

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:24.330
something that happened on 9/11 in the Pentagon
that may have been lost in the news for other

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:30.810
reasons. A woman was arrested in the Pentagon
on 9/11 and thrown in jail for listening to

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:33.400

There was also another group of spies, called
the "Wasp Network of Spies," that were arrested

00:20:55.020 --> 00:21:00.580
in 1998 and imprisoned for doing exactly the
same thing. They were listening to this radio

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:01.750
station every day.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:06.100
They were typing these groups of five numbers
into their laptop computer and a program was

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:10.830
decrypting it and getting their evil instructions
from the evil Cuban government. So, if you

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:14.720
know anything about cryptography, you'll know
that it's common for codes to be expressed

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.120
as, as strings of five digits.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:23.140
And that's exactly what the numbers stations
turned out to be. We have the RAF one on,

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:28.700
on Cyprus. We have the White Sands missile
range called "Yosemite Sam." And there are

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:34.382
dozens of these coming from all over the world.
[pause] But just because some of the sounds

00:21:34.382 --> 00:21:38.020
turn out to be conspiracy theories being true,
it doesn't mean that they all are.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:42.310
I'm sure you've all heard rock music played
backwards and how some people think that there's

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:47.170
messages encoded in that. Nothing new there.
Just as an example, listen to Jim Morrison

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:50.170
singing the phrase, "treasures there' from
"Break On Through."

Notice that I primed you. First I told you
what he was gonna say. And then I played it

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:07.490
for you so that you're guaranteed to have
heard what I wanted you to hear. If you hadn't

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:10.020
been primed, you would've heard him say this.

[laughter]

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:19.510
It's much less interesting when it's not carefully
edited and someone is not looking for a specific

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:25.930
string of text. So, there's a subculture of
people who call this "back masking." And their

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:31.510
theory is that our brains work in such a way
that it deliberately chooses words, which

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:34.990
when played backwards, will say what we actually
mean.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:37.970
[laughter]

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:44.640
Back masking. Here's another example of that.
Here's a guy giving some little talk.

Lean on me zurnielm. And if back masking is
true, then Jim Morrison actually, his purpose

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:08.540
in life is to convince us that he is Sataschneigel.

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:10.650

These sounds don't have to be played backwards.
Sometimes they can be played just forward,

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:22.490
just naturally. And they say something that
was not intended. Listen to this toy.

pull this doll off the market and re-release

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:57.410
So, here's a sound that I recorded myself.
You probably all know Mount Diablo across

00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:02.630
the Bay. And on the back side is the Black
Diamond Mine. And at the Black Diamond Mine,

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:07.350
there's a cemetery that's been there for I'm
not sure how long--a hundred years or so.

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:13.331
A lot of the graves are very old. And I actually
recorded this myself in 2003. Listen to this.

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:25.210
I'm gonna tell you more about that a little
bit later. But just remember that I played

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:31.860
something that sounded kinda silly. [pause]
A lot of times, these can just be plain fun.

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:34.870
We can learn a little bit of science from
them, but they're also fun.

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:41.120
This is a guy who took recorded voice, an
actual recording of somebody actually speaking,

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:47.900
separated it into six frequencies and played
back the six frequencies, each one separately

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:53.390
resonated as, as a noise. Pink noise? Is that
pink noise or white noise? Someone here has

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:56.170
to know that. You're all smart. They told
me.

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:57.170
[laughter]

00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:00.330
Pink? OK. So, I'm gonna tell you again. I'm
gonna prime you what this--. No, I won't.

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:02.310
I won't prime you. I'll make you listen to

OK. That was an actual voice. Someone actually
said that, but what you're hearing is not

You hear it now? Because you've been primed.
You've been told what it says. So you can't

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:53.210
not hear it. Here's another way of doing the
same thing, except the voices were reproduced

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:54.860
using a single sine wave.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.571
So if you were to look at the frequency of
this, you'd just see one little sine wave

00:25:57.571 --> 00:26:02.180
going like this. Much simplified. There's
no traditional speech cues in this. There's

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:07.000
no--. There are no constanents, for example.
And yet, you can still understand what it

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.190
says to some degree. Here's the same sentence.

Once you understand this, your brain adapts

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:12.240
fairly quickly. And it suddenly becomes much
easier to understand. But what's important

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:17.540
is note that when I primed you, it was really
obvious to tell what it says.

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:21.160
And I want you to pay attention the next time
you watch a ghost show on television, where

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:25.300
they have an electronic voice phenomenon that
they supposedly recorded that they say must

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:31.440
be a ghost. They will always, always prime
you first with what they want you to think

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.660
it says before they play the sound for you.

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:32.140
In December 2009, I spoke at the Chaos Computer
Conference in Berlin. And I was coming outside.

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:36.410
I was leaving the conference center at like
3AM. It's a 24-hour conference. I go out the

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:40.730
doors. It was December in Berlin, so it was
insanely cold.

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:46.720
I have no idea. And I almost stepped into
one of these. Between, between two notes,

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:50.740
it's, it's silent and there's no flash, so
you don't see anything. And this is like just

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:54.520
during a rest in the music that I happened
to come along and open the door and step out

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:57.660
here. Nearly walked into the thing, just as
it started playing another note.

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:02.150
It was like that far from my face. Scared
the living crap out of me. And I probably

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:04.470
almost died. I don't know.

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:05.470

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:17.600
Here's the guy who made one in his bedroom
just for fun.

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.980
[end clip]

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:23.750
Yeah, you're cool dude. Make a real YouTube
video.

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:24.750
[laughter]

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:30.450
Think how much better this would be if his
cat had come in while he's doing that.

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:31.450
[laughter]

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:36.260
All right. Sometimes, the sounds solve mysteries,
even when no sound was heard. For example,

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:43.090
when a sound is subsonic. This gentleman right
here is Vic Tandy. He's passed away now. But

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:47.990
he's relatively famous for some work that
he did during the last years of his life.

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:49.540
It started in 1980.

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:56.320
He was working in a lab in a basement in the
UK. And he kept seeing a blob in his peripheral

00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:00.480
vision. And he'd turn and there wouldn't be
anything there. He'd start working again.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:04.360
He'd see the blob and he'd turn. And there
wouldn't be anything there. And he told his

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.130
co-workers that and they said, "Oh, yeah.
That lab's haunted."

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:07.230
[laughter]

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:14.300
He goes, "OK." So the next day, he brings
in his fencing foil. He was a fencing enthusiast,

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:18.590
so he brought his foil into the lab. That's
company time theft because I'm sure that's

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:20.930
not what his research was supposed to be.

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:25.090
He puts his foil in a vice and he's about
to unscrew it or do something to it, and the

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:31.650
foil starts doing this. It starts oscillating
all on its own. And he said, "Aha. There must

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:36.830
be some low frequency sound that I can't hear."
And he got a hold of some sound testing equipment.

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:44.210
And he found out that indeed, there was 19
Hertz at a pretty substantial amplitude.

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:51.120
This is his actual tracing of what he recorded
in that lab, starting at five, ten, fifteen,

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:56.870
twenty Hertz. You can see that giant peak
just at about 19 Hertz. He measured the room

00:32:56.870 --> 00:33:00.740
and found out that the room was exactly half
the length of a 19 Hertz wavelength, which

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:10.170
is some 30, 33, 30 -something feet, I believe.
And the lab was half of that.

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:12.679
So he thought, "That's interesting." And he
was wondering if maybe that could account

00:33:12.679 --> 00:33:18.660
for the anomaly in his vision as well. Well,
that's not quite so far-fetched, because NASA

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:24.970
also did some of these tests for the same
thing. A Saturn V is damn loud. And it might

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:28.030
have some effect on astronaut’s ability
to perform.

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:33.490
And so, NASA, to be responsible, they had
to do some tests and see if--well, I wanna

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:41.610
say people, but they used animals--how that
would affect their vision. They put dogs in

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:46.200
chairs. Strapped them in chairs. They shook
the chairs. They shook the dog’s bodies.

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:51.080
And they shook the dog’s heads and tried
to see the effect on the dog's vision, how

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.440
it would be able to track its vision.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:34:01.500
They did the same thing with people when the
dogs didn't die. And they found this. Vision

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:06.090
was affected at--. Look at that frequency
where the highest peak is. It's just about

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:10.760
the same place--almost 19 Hertz. And it turns
out that this approximately 19 Hertz -- it's

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:15.539
gonna be a little bit different for everyone,
is the resonant frequency of your eyeball.

00:34:15.539 --> 00:34:16.940
And you can test that by if you--.

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:21.049
You know, if you ping a wine glass, the note
that it produces, that's its resonant frequency.

00:34:21.049 --> 00:34:22.470
So if you were to do that to your eyeball--.

00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:23.470
[laughter]

00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:28.899
I'm not gonna try it by way of demonstration,
but that's the sound of the thump that would

00:34:28.899 --> 00:34:32.950
make. Nineteen Hertz at subsonic, so you wouldn't
hear it. But that's the resonant frequency

00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:37.989
of an eyeball. So, NASA found that your vision
is affected at 19 Hertz. And this guy did

00:34:37.989 --> 00:34:40.899
find that he saw a blurb in his peripheral
vision.

00:34:40.899 --> 00:34:45.559
So, other people have tried following that
up to see if maybe this explains some cases

00:34:45.559 --> 00:34:50.500
of hauntings, because we have infrasound throughout
the world. In Vic Tandy's case, he found it

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:55.249
was caused by a fan--an air conditioning fan
that had been installed. The lab was either

00:34:55.249 --> 00:34:59.109
positively pressurized or negatively pressurized
and it was this particular fan that kept the

00:34:59.109 --> 00:35:04.180
air pressure where it was supposed to be that
once they shut it off, that frequency dropped

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:10.960
away. So my friend Richard Wiseman, who's
an experimental psychologist in the UK, in

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:16.349
2002, he did an experiment with some others.
They took what you see here. It's basically

00:35:16.349 --> 00:35:21.980
some big giant organ pipes. These things make
19 Hertz subsonic frequency.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:27.020
And they got 1750 people--a fairly large size
sample--in different groups. They put them

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:31.390
into a theater, a music hall, and they played
four pieces of music--the same four pieces

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:37.999
of music for all the people. They randomly--.
They did a random test where some of the groups

00:35:37.999 --> 00:35:41.849
got infrasound in the background, along with
the music.

00:35:41.849 --> 00:35:46.720
And then they asked everyone if they were
emotionally affected by the music. And they

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:51.220
found a statistically significant 22 percent
of the people were more emotionally affected

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:58.980
when this subsonic inaudible ultrasound, infrasound
was present. So, Tandy spent the rest of his

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:05.989
career basically investigating haunted sites
throughout the UK and seeing if he could find

00:36:05.989 --> 00:36:07.769
infrasound and turning it off.

00:36:07.769 --> 00:36:12.569
So, that was pretty cool. And the lesson that
we learned from all this is pretty simple:

00:36:12.569 --> 00:36:18.970
Doing the work and finding the real answers
is always more interesting than accepting

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:23.130
the popular explanations. Stopping at, "The
lab is haunted. That's all there is to it."

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:26.970
If you actually do the work, you're always
gonna learn something better and you're always

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:29.619
gonna learn something interesting.

00:36:29.619 --> 00:36:40.240

mysterious sound that I recorded in the cemetery.

00:37:00.809 --> 00:37:06.130
OK. Well that's the end of the talk. We're
gonna do some Q&amp;A if we have time. Do we have

00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:07.130
time?

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:08.130
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:10.920
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: OK. And while you're thinking
of your very interesting questions--. And

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:16.549
I guess we can also take questions from the
remote sites, yes? And the mysterious raptured

00:37:16.549 --> 00:37:19.779

us if we have them.

00:37:19.779 --> 00:37:23.980

you I'd forget, which was what?

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:28.390
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: We're going to lunch after
this. If anyone wants to join us, that's lots

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:35.290
of fun. We have--. This is allegedly an Authors@Google
talk, right? Not a Podcasters@Google? So I

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:36.430
quickly threw together a book.

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:39.109
[laughter]

00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:43.340
Every 50 episodes of the podcast--well, the
best 50 episodes--they go into a book. So,

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:47.589
this is Volume three. Volume four and five
should be coming out later this year. This

00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:52.349
one's called, "Pirates, Pyramids, and Papyrus,"
available on Amazon.com.

00:37:52.349 --> 00:37:57.259
And basically, this is--. These are all 50
stories that you've heard in pop culture.

00:37:57.259 --> 00:38:02.470
Most people will have heard of most of these.
And you get a great explanation on any of

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:07.131
them. If you've got any people in your family
who have strange beliefs, or who believe one

00:38:07.131 --> 00:38:10.530
of these stories that they heard on Oprah
or whatever, you can almost certainly find

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:13.029
the answer in this book, or one of its predecessors.

00:38:13.029 --> 00:38:17.380
So I recommend it. It's fun and I make money
every time you buy one. So, I recommend it

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:19.030
a second time.

Any questions about this or any other mysterious

00:38:35.529 --> 00:38:41.390
subjects that I may or may not have covered
yet? Blank stares. I was at Pixar yesterday.

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:42.390
Oh, go ahead.

00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:46.450
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #11: When you have
people talk to you about pseudoscience or

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:51.020
[ ], or just general discussion, what is your
theory on engaging with them, like friends,

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:52.329
loved ones and stuff?

00:38:52.329 --> 00:38:57.140
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: That's a very common question.
She asked--. I'm repeating the question. That

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:58.720
was the other thing I was going to forget.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:38:59.720
[laughter]

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.720
She's asking when I'm engaging in conversation
with people and they have some--. How did

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:03.720
you phrase it?

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.021
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #11: They have some
pseudoscience--.

00:39:06.021 --> 00:39:08.200
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: They have some pseudoscience
belief. How do I engage them in such a way

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:12.230
without them starting a fight or me starting
a fight and losing them as a friend, co-worker,

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:13.559
colleague, whatever they are?

00:39:13.559 --> 00:39:16.970
It's a very common question and it's a very
common problem. And it's a problem because

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:21.880
people do it when they shouldn't. I simply
don't do it. I almost never go up to someone

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:26.079
and say, "Ah, you're wearing the Power Balance
bracelet. That's fake." I don't do that. I

00:39:26.079 --> 00:39:29.530
don't go up and I don't criticize people who
are going to church on Sunday.

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:34.450
Whatever it is that they're doing, I have
no problem with it at all, unless they're

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:38.799
on their deathbed dying of cancer and they're
gonna be dead in the next 24 hours unless

00:39:38.799 --> 00:39:45.099
they go to a doctor. Then I might say something.
Otherwise, I say don't start an argument.

00:39:45.099 --> 00:39:50.410
And if you want to bring someone over to your
way of thinking, don't start by attacking

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:52.249
their cherished, sacred cow.

00:39:52.249 --> 00:39:57.299
Start with something where you have common
ground. I know it's self-serving, but I always

00:39:57.299 --> 00:40:01.539
say go to, go to Skeptoid and find a podcast
episode on something that you know you're

00:40:01.539 --> 00:40:04.870
both going to agree with, because a lot of
them are really interesting. Some of these

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:09.749
old historical cases, they don't challenge
anyone's beliefs, but everyone has fun learning

00:40:09.749 --> 00:40:10.749
about them.

00:40:10.749 --> 00:40:15.380
And you get people interested in this material
and they want more. And they'll, they'll start

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:19.670
cutting their way in closer and closer to
your way of thinking sooner or later. So,

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:24.619
don't create a problem. Don't, don't put friendships
on the line because you have the opportunity

00:40:24.619 --> 00:40:29.130
to not have a fight and to eventually win
them over with honey, not vinegar. Yes, sir.

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:34.020
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #12: Well, following
on to that, aside from specific views that

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:38.910
people have in some of this nonsense, there's
this widespread feeling that skepticism and

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:41.359
critical thinking are just kind of moods--

00:40:41.359 --> 00:40:45.829
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: Yes, yes. He's pointing out
that skepticism and critical thinking has

00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:50.809
a negative reputation for being, basically,
an inherently negative process. And that's

00:40:50.809 --> 00:40:53.079
absolutely true. I couldn't agree with you
more.

00:40:53.079 --> 00:40:58.279
I hate the word 'skeptic' and 'skepticism'.
I wish I hadn't called my podcast "Skeptoid."

00:40:58.279 --> 00:41:02.960
I'd call it anything else if I could, because
that doubles my work. First, people hear the

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:07.049
work "skeptic" and they go, "Oh, you're one
of those people that thinks 9/11 was a government

00:41:07.049 --> 00:41:08.049
conspiracy."

00:41:08.049 --> 00:41:09.049

00:41:09.049 --> 00:41:13.990
No. So you have to educate them on what you
consider skepticism to be, which is supposed

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:18.349
to be a positive process of finding more information
and finding the truth. But that's not the

00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:19.700
way that it happens.

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:24.900
You've got all these people, like Richard
Dawkins right now, writing these books that

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:27.850
are inflammatory as hell. Can I say hell?

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:29.079
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yes.

00:41:29.079 --> 00:41:30.079
[laughter]

00:41:30.079 --> 00:41:31.079
It's okay.

00:41:31.079 --> 00:41:35.450
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: I don't think that's the
way to go about it. I don't think being inherently

00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:37.410
negative is positive.

00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:39.259
[Brian laughs]

00:41:39.259 --> 00:41:43.930
And that's why what I try to do on my show--and
the early shows I was not as successful at

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:49.450
this. But what I try to do now is I try to
only be positive. I don't set out to debunk,

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:53.130
quote unquote, anything, because that's simply
inherently negative.

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:57.489
And that doesn't do anybody any good. Because
there is good science. There is interesting

00:41:57.489 --> 00:42:03.509
information behind almost every story. And
if you focus on that, then you've got something

00:42:03.509 --> 00:42:07.990
that everyone can enjoy and that everyone
can appreciate. So, you make an, you make

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:13.309
an important point that skepticism is often
negative and harmful and doesn't do anyone

00:42:13.309 --> 00:42:14.309
any good.

00:42:14.309 --> 00:42:20.960
And I agree with you completely. [pause] Any
questions from the mysterious voice in the

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:24.009
heavens? [pause] Maybe they were all raptured
already.

00:42:24.009 --> 00:42:25.009
[laughter]

00:42:25.009 --> 00:42:26.009
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #13: No, that's tomorrow.

00:42:26.009 --> 00:42:31.869
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: Well I started to say--.
I started to say that I was at Pixar yesterday

00:42:31.869 --> 00:42:36.359
and giving talks in the Bay Area--. Sorry
to offend anyone, but Bay Area is basically

00:42:36.359 --> 00:42:43.039
the center of alternative everything and there's
a lot of, shall we say, not quite scientific

00:42:43.039 --> 00:42:45.819
beliefs that are very popular up here.

00:42:45.819 --> 00:42:52.579
And Pixar – it's supposed to be a room of
all smart people. And someone asked a question

00:42:52.579 --> 00:42:58.700
about some news story that had been published.
And I pointed out that news stories, when

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:03.770
they report MIT or Harvard has just published
a study in which this was found or that was

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:08.029
found, what it almost always is, is the university's
PR department sending out a press release

00:43:08.029 --> 00:43:14.230
about some 17-year old undergrad who did something
completely flawed and faulty, but it's interesting

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:15.230
news.

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:19.319
And so, they'll send out a press release about
it. It doesn't mean that Harvard did a study,

00:43:19.319 --> 00:43:22.999
but it does mean that Harvard did a study
because some student did something. And that's

00:43:22.999 --> 00:43:26.561
exactly how the whole bottled water scare
got started. This is what I was saying at

00:43:26.561 --> 00:43:31.650
Pixar yesterday. And as soon as I said "bottled
water" I saw the radar going up. People in

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:34.700
the audience were getting pissed off like
this.

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:39.130
What happened at the University of Idaho was
this student had--. He was doing a test on

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:44.140
seeing if bottled water leeched evil toxic
chemicals--. The bottle, if it leeched evil

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:48.400
toxic chemicals into the water and makes you
die from drinking it. And so, what he found

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:54.630
that this particular brand of plastic bottles
leeched DEHA into the water.

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:58.020
And that got into the news. University sent
out a press release as they always do and

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:03.589
that got into the news and it went national.
And it’s been a common belief ever since.

00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:10.230
That bottle didn't even have DEHA in it. It
was from the lab equipment he was using--the

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:14.700
plastic tubes that the water flowed between
the bottle and his test equipment.

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:18.400
So, I don't know if he got an F or whatever,
but his study was completely flawed and by

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:24.670
no way would it be accurate to say the University
of Idaho has concluded this or that. So I

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:28.460
start telling the same story at Pixar yesterday
and I could tell that everyone in the room

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:31.960
wanted to fight with me because I just attacked
their sacred cow.

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:38.420
Because evil plastic bottles, that's the beginning
and end of government conspiracy and the evil

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:40.519
corporations out to kill us all with their
toxins.

00:44:40.519 --> 00:44:41.920
[laughter]

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:48.849
So I went in to another point that I often
make. And that's that every substance in the

00:44:48.849 --> 00:44:54.090
world is both poisonous and safe. There's
no dividing line between what's a poison and

00:44:54.090 --> 00:45:00.900
what's not. It's what concentration of it
will kill you. Water will kill you at a concentration.

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:04.380
Air will, oxygen will kill you at a certain
concentration.

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:09.170
One of the most toxic substances known as
Plutonium--how much Plutonium do you think

00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:15.119
you have in you right now? The average person
has 20 million atoms of Plutonium in their

00:45:15.119 --> 00:45:20.539
body. Why doesn't it kill you? Because it's
a safe level. That's a safe level of Plutonium.

00:45:20.539 --> 00:45:25.040
There's a safe level of BPA. There's a safe
level of DEHA.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:31.869
Plastic water bottles do contain BPA in many
cases, well below safe levels. Nevertheless,

00:45:31.869 --> 00:45:38.180
it's a really hard thing for people to accept
that something so deeply ingrained that they've

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:42.249
been told this is poisonous and it's an evil
corporate conspiracy to kill you because the

00:45:42.249 --> 00:45:46.910
lawsuits cost less than continuing to use
BPA.

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:52.920
People just do not wanna accept science that,
that contradicts with their preexisting beliefs.

00:45:52.920 --> 00:46:00.299
So, [pause] I could tell, I could tell that
when I made this point at Pixar that didn't

00:46:00.299 --> 00:46:05.120
sway everyone in the room. But watching the
audience reactions, I could tell a lot of

00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:08.519
people were getting pissed off when I mentioned
plastic water bottles and then I could see

00:46:08.519 --> 00:46:11.979
them going, "Yeah, OK. I can accept that."

00:46:11.979 --> 00:46:17.430
About half of them. The other half chased
me out of the building with pitchforks and

00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:18.540
torches shortly thereafter.

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:19.540
[laughter]

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:20.540
Yes, sir.

00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:38.519
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #14: Why do you think
the, the reporting around food in particular,

00:46:38.519 --> 00:46:39.519
and particularly in, with respect to diet--

00:46:39.519 --> 00:46:40.519
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: Uh-huh.

00:46:40.519 --> 00:46:41.519
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #14: Why do you think
that pseudoscience is so much more widespread

00:46:41.519 --> 00:46:42.519
and respected by people than most other things--

00:46:42.519 --> 00:46:43.519
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: Basically, why are all the
food pseudosciences and food-related conspiracy

00:46:43.519 --> 00:46:49.269
theories so popular? Aspartame, high, high
fructose corn syrup, all of these evil toxic

00:46:49.269 --> 00:46:52.380
chemicals. Why McDonalds? People love to bash
fast food.

00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:57.119
That's been one of the most popular subjects
in Hollywood for ten years. Why are these,

00:46:57.119 --> 00:47:02.950
these pseudosciences, if you will, so popular?
And it's because they're popular. It's because

00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:09.819
it's really popular right now. It's just a
social trend. Foodieism, is that a word? Foodieism.

00:47:09.819 --> 00:47:10.819
Google that somebody.

00:47:10.819 --> 00:47:11.819
[laughter]

00:47:11.819 --> 00:47:18.650
That's not funny. Don't laugh at that. That
was an obvious joke. That wasn't a good joke.

00:47:18.650 --> 00:47:24.219
Because it's simply popular. And it's a really
easy sell. Almost all of the food-related

00:47:24.219 --> 00:47:27.719
pseudosciences are centered on the whole all-natural
fallacy.

00:47:27.719 --> 00:47:33.979
If something is all-natural, it's therefore
healthy. If anything has chemicals in it--

00:47:33.979 --> 00:47:34.979
[laughter]

00:47:34.979 --> 00:47:45.009
[pause] it's immoral and evil. And that's
related to so many, so many other popular

00:47:45.009 --> 00:47:51.400
myths. The Big Pharma conspiracy is another
one. Why don't we all use herbs in everything?

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:56.719
All these drugs that the evil Big Pharma companies
are always pushing on us, they're all developed

00:47:56.719 --> 00:47:57.719
by humans.

00:47:57.719 --> 00:48:02.630
Therefore, they're immoral. But you see, almost
all drugs are developed from natural substances.

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:07.519
That's how we find them to begin with. I have
two friends who are microbiologists at the

00:48:07.519 --> 00:48:09.059
Scripps Institute in San Diego.

00:48:09.059 --> 00:48:13.539
All they do--their entire careers--they're
going to do nothing but pick through these

00:48:13.539 --> 00:48:17.960
little tiny pieces of seaweed in this one
little aquarium that they have in their basement

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:22.359
and they're just gonna test these, test these
compounds they find in the seaweed for some

00:48:22.359 --> 00:48:27.759
kind of a compound that's gonna have some
effect, positive as a drug, on some disease.

00:48:27.759 --> 00:48:30.950
They're probably gonna work their entire careers.
And they're probably gonna find nothing at

00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:38.349
all. It takes that much work for us to finally
find one drug in nature that works. It takes

00:48:38.349 --> 00:48:42.950
a lot of time, costs a hell of a lot of money.
Can I say hell? I think we've established

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:43.950
that.

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:44.950
[laughter]

00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:49.049
And when we do find one, we find ways that
we can mass produce it because taking one

00:48:49.049 --> 00:48:52.769
molecule out of a piece of seaweed is not
very efficient. We have to be able to mass

00:48:52.769 --> 00:48:54.469
produce it in volume. It has to be purified.

00:48:54.469 --> 00:49:00.239
We have to be able to know what the dose is.
So the whole Big Pharma process, largely,

00:49:00.239 --> 00:49:05.069
once you know about it, once you have friends
who are microbiologists working in the industry

00:49:05.069 --> 00:49:09.130
and you ask them, you find out how they do
their job, it really is all about nature and

00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:13.349
all about finding things that are positive
in nature and finding out how we can benefit

00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:14.349
from them.

00:49:14.349 --> 00:49:19.019
And then rather than tearing down the rainforests
to get every single, every single molecule

00:49:19.019 --> 00:49:22.519
that we need, how can we mass produce it?
How can we synthesize it? How can we produce

00:49:22.519 --> 00:49:27.369
it in volume? So, I don't hold to the all-natural
fallacies at all. I mean, you've all heard

00:49:27.369 --> 00:49:30.979
the argument, what are some other all-natural
compounds?

00:49:30.979 --> 00:49:37.079
Hemlock, box jellyfish neurotoxin, poison
oak. I mean, the list goes on and on and on.

00:49:37.079 --> 00:49:42.619
Mercury. How many things in nature are bad
for us? A lot. You have questions. Was that

00:49:42.619 --> 00:49:44.230
a scratch of the head?

00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:46.170
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #15: I'm scratching.

00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:57.770
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: Yes, the question was yes
it was a scratch on the head. How are we on

00:49:57.770 --> 00:49:58.770
time? Are we done? Yeah, we're close. We have
seven minutes. Yes, go ahead.

00:49:58.770 --> 00:50:00.719
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #16: When you were
talking about concentrations of things in

00:50:00.719 --> 00:50:05.809
your body. Do you have any particular [ ]?

00:50:05.809 --> 00:50:07.989
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: Homeopathy.

00:50:07.989 --> 00:50:08.989
[laughter]

00:50:08.989 --> 00:50:10.650
Any remarks about homeopathy?

00:50:10.650 --> 00:50:11.650
[laughter]

00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:16.249
I'll repeat the Twitter we just said today.
The ocean is now--what was it? The ocean is

00:50:16.249 --> 00:50:18.119
now a homeopathic cure for terrorism.

00:50:18.119 --> 00:50:22.450
[laughter]

00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:34.170
Love that. Homeopathy is, homeopathy is one
of those things that it's so stupid that you

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:38.150
can't believe it's actually a problem. But
if you go into a drug store now, you'll start

00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:44.160
to see homeopathic compounds everywhere. It
is really, really growing because these companies

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:49.499
have discovered we can sell no product at
all for just as much money as we were selling

00:50:49.499 --> 00:50:52.490
product before. [pause]

00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:58.799
It's based on the concept of dilution. Although,
that's not really accurate because there is

00:50:58.799 --> 00:51:03.069
none of the compound, none of the original
compound in it at all. If there is any, it

00:51:03.069 --> 00:51:10.049
is not homeopathy by definition, if you understand
what homeopathy actually is. A typical dilution

00:51:10.049 --> 00:51:15.779
is 30C. Thirty and then Roman numeral C. That's
one hundred to the 30th power-- one followed

00:51:15.779 --> 00:51:17.079
by 60 zeroes.

00:51:17.079 --> 00:51:23.859
That's equivalent to one atom in a sphere
of water the size of the Earth's orbit.

00:51:23.859 --> 00:51:26.230
[laughter]

00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:31.620
And you take one tiny little bit of that,
put it in a sugar pill and how likely is it

00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:36.789
that there's going to be any of that original
compound? It's impossible. It's well beyond

00:51:36.789 --> 00:51:41.349
what we consider to be chemically pure, which
is related to Avogadro's number, six times

00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:50.479
ten to the 23rd power. But it doesn't even
stop there. Because a sugar pill is dry.

00:51:50.479 --> 00:51:55.249
There is none of the water left in it. None
of the magic water is even in the bottle.

00:51:55.249 --> 00:52:01.690
It's sugar pills. It doesn't even contain
the magical water that they say homeopathy

00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:06.700
is all about. So it's one fallacy compounded
on top of another fallacy, compounded on top

00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:11.979
of another fallacy. It's just stupid. And
if you look at the labeling on a homeopathic

00:52:11.979 --> 00:52:16.829
product, next time you're in a drug store,
find one and check it out. And under active

00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:23.329
ingredients, it'll say it's got herb of root,
or whatever the hell it is. Can I say hell?

00:52:23.329 --> 00:52:26.119
[laughter]

00:52:26.119 --> 00:52:30.579
And it'll list that under "active ingredients."
So you might argue with me, how can you say

00:52:30.579 --> 00:52:34.469
there's none of it in here? It's listed under
the ingredients. But you'll notice that the

00:52:34.469 --> 00:52:39.890
concentration is listed as a homeopathic dilution,
which means by definition, there is nothing

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:40.890
in there.

00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:47.599
And it'll say inactive ingredients. And that's
where we get the sucrose and lactose, is what

00:52:47.599 --> 00:52:53.660
the sugar pills are made of. That's all that
they are. So homeopathy is, as stupid as it

00:52:53.660 --> 00:53:01.940
is, it's becoming a real problem because [pause]
drug companies--most supplement companies--are

00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:07.650
owned by the major drug companies because
they're so much more profitable.

00:53:07.650 --> 00:53:12.559
They're just starting to sell--. Zycam was
one of the first. Zycam used to sell a regular

00:53:12.559 --> 00:53:17.239
cold remedy, containing conventional cold
remedy stuff in it. And then they came out

00:53:17.239 --> 00:53:21.920
with another product, which in very small
letters said "homeopathic" on it. Sold for

00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:25.960
exactly the same price. They no longer make
the original product at all anymore.

00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:30.119
They're literally selling no product at all
for just as much money. And people are happy

00:53:30.119 --> 00:53:32.269
to buy it, simply because they don't understand
that. Yes, sir.

00:53:32.269 --> 00:53:35.049
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #17: You're talking
about the placebo effect, right?

00:53:35.049 --> 00:53:40.309
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: The placebo effect – yeah,
the placebo effect is often what people describe

00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:46.869
homeopathy as. I'm not convinced that it is
the placebo effect so much as it is confirmation

00:53:46.869 --> 00:53:52.710
bias. And confirmation bias is when you notice
things that confirm your existing beliefs

00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:56.849
and you ignore, or just skip over or your
brain just dismisses things that don't agree

00:53:56.849 --> 00:53:59.579
with your pre-existing beliefs.

00:53:59.579 --> 00:54:05.559
And for years, I took Vitamin C whenever I
got sick. Now, you can search the medical

00:54:05.559 --> 00:54:11.769
literature all day long and you'll find nothing
but studies determining that Vitamin C does

00:54:11.769 --> 00:54:16.690
nothing for a cold. It does not reduce the
severity. It does not prevent it. And yet,

00:54:16.690 --> 00:54:21.869
we all take Vitamin C whenever we get sick
or to prevent ourselves from getting sick.

00:54:21.869 --> 00:54:27.240
And I was taking it as recently as a couple
of years ago, even after I'd done episodes

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:31.440
about vitamin mega dosing and all that stuff.
And I knew what the medical science was. And

00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:34.779
I still kept taking it just because I'd been
doing it my whole life. And it was so hard

00:54:34.779 --> 00:54:41.410
for me to let go of that. But confirmation
bias is why I kept taking it. I'd get sick.

00:54:41.410 --> 00:54:43.970
I'd take a whole bunch of Vitamin C. And guess
what would happen?

00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:45.130
[laughter]

00:54:45.130 --> 00:54:46.130
I'd get better.

00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:47.690
[laughter]

00:54:47.690 --> 00:54:52.940
That Vitamin C must have worked. That's not
an example of the placebo effect so much as

00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:57.089
it is confirmation bias. Because I came away
from that with a conscious perception that

00:54:57.089 --> 00:54:59.789
the Vitamin C had cured my cold.

00:54:59.789 --> 00:55:04.060
So, I didn't notice the times when I took
Vitamin C. I didn't notice those first few

00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:08.029
days of taking it where I didn't get better
yet. I noticed the last day I took it. Wow,

00:55:08.029 --> 00:55:13.579
that Vitamin C really knocked out that cold.
So, could be a combination of either. Not

00:55:13.579 --> 00:55:14.999
sure. Yes.

00:55:14.999 --> 00:55:17.279
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #18: So then where's
the happy medium? 'Cause I don't wanna buy

00:55:17.279 --> 00:55:18.799
something that's just full of chemicals. I
want something natural.

00:55:18.799 --> 00:55:25.420
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: Where's the happy medium
if you don't wanna buy something that's full

00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:29.380
of chemicals and you want something that's
natural? What's the difference? What's not

00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:33.849
made of chemicals? Can you think of anything
that's not made of chemicals? Every chemical

00:55:33.849 --> 00:55:38.359
has a scary sounding name. No matter what
it is, the most beautiful blade of grass you'll

00:55:38.359 --> 00:55:39.359
find out here--. What's that?

00:55:39.359 --> 00:55:40.589
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #19: Dihydrogen monoxide.

00:55:40.589 --> 00:55:45.650
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: Dihydrogen monoxide, exactly.
The perfect example. I think probably everyone

00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:49.839
here has seen these things on TV where they'll
go out to some hippie rally some place--pardon

00:55:49.839 --> 00:55:54.440
anyone who that offends--you, sir.

00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:55.440
[laughter]

00:55:55.440 --> 00:56:02.420
And they'll have a--what do you call it when
you're signing your name? A petition, thank

00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:07.730
you. To ban dihydrogen monoxide. And people
go, "Oh, hell. I'll sign that. I don't even

00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:11.849
need to know what it is." And they've got
all sorts of great sales pitches that they

00:56:11.849 --> 00:56:14.069
can tell you about the evil dihydrogen monoxide.

00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:15.630
It promoted excess urination.

00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:18.759
[laughter]

00:56:18.759 --> 00:56:22.369
It's found throughout our environment. It's
in all of our food. It's in all of the water

00:56:22.369 --> 00:56:23.369
that we drink.

00:56:23.369 --> 00:56:24.369
[laughter]

00:56:24.369 --> 00:56:28.270
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #20: A major component
of acid rain.

00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:30.569
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: A major component of acid
rain, exactly. These are the things that it's

00:56:30.569 --> 00:56:36.489
easy to sell that sounds so scary and it sounds
so plausible. What's that?

00:56:36.489 --> 00:56:39.539
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #21: It causes tsunamis.

00:56:39.539 --> 00:56:42.589
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: It causes tsunamis. It's
true.

00:56:42.589 --> 00:56:43.589
[laughter]

00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:46.609
But it does homeopathically cure terrorism.
[laughter] So it does have one thing going

00:56:46.609 --> 00:56:52.829
for it. So when you say where do you find
the happy medium, there's all sorts of reasons

00:56:52.829 --> 00:56:56.729
not to buy products that have nothing to do
with science.

00:56:56.729 --> 00:57:02.190
For example, being a vegetarian. I might choose
not to eat meat because I don't like to kill

00:57:02.190 --> 00:57:07.759
animals. That's perfectly valid. That's an
ideology. That's absolutely valid. You don't

00:57:07.759 --> 00:57:13.309
have to have science proving that it's healthy
to not eat meat. You can do it if you want

00:57:13.309 --> 00:57:16.039
to. So I say the same thing. If you wanna
buy--.

00:57:16.039 --> 00:57:19.430
If you don't wanna go to the doctor when you
get sick, fine. You're probably not gonna

00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:24.239
die. The human body has an amazing capacity
for self-healing. It's one of the most amazing

00:57:24.239 --> 00:57:31.170
things that has ever existed in all of science,
is the capacity of the human body for self-healing.

00:57:31.170 --> 00:57:35.489
In fact, every drug that we produce, every
surgical procedure, it does not heal us.

00:57:35.489 --> 00:57:41.529
It creates optimal conditions for our body
to heal itself. So, you're really not too

00:57:41.529 --> 00:57:46.479
likely to die from any given disease. Until
a hundred years ago, there was really no such

00:57:46.479 --> 00:57:50.759
thing as medical science. We had what we thought
was medical science, but it did more harm

00:57:50.759 --> 00:57:51.950
than good as often as not.

00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:57.380
So I have no problem with people who wanna
take an ideological or a philosophical perspective

00:57:57.380 --> 00:58:01.170
of "I don't wanna go to McDonalds because
I don't like the company." "I don't wanna

00:58:01.170 --> 00:58:07.209
eat meat." "I don't wanna buy Big Pharma drugs."
That's fine. Where it's not fine is when you

00:58:07.209 --> 00:58:10.839
look for scientific facts, when you try to
cherry-pick what's out there.

00:58:10.839 --> 00:58:15.579
When you try to search the internet and find
information that supports that view and convince

00:58:15.579 --> 00:58:19.140
yourself that it's based on good science.
Because it's not. There's a difference between

00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:23.670
science and ideology. Science is facts and
figures. You're either right or you're wrong.

00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:26.940
Ideology, it's fair to be wherever you wanna
be on the spectrum.

00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:35.239
So, just keep in mind what's science and what's
not. [pause] That's kind of a good sound bite

00:58:35.239 --> 00:58:37.349
to end on.

00:58:37.349 --> 00:58:38.349
[laughter]

00:58:38.349 --> 00:58:42.049
Anything else? Not a single question from
above. I'm disappointed in the people from

00:58:42.049 --> 00:58:46.430
above. Where's the camera? Can they see me?
Are they here or are they there? They're there.

00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:52.579
What's wrong with you people? Let's go. I
came all the way to your town to do this.

00:58:52.579 --> 00:58:53.579
[laugher]

00:58:53.579 --> 00:58:54.849
OK. I'm sorry. Go ahead.

00:58:54.849 --> 00:58:58.180
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #21: Yeah, so what
goes into making an episode?

00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:03.769
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: What goes into making an
episode? Boy. [laughs] A lot of hard work.

00:59:03.769 --> 00:59:10.410
I do an episode every week. It's ten to twelve
minutes. There's 1700 and 50 words written.

00:59:10.410 --> 00:59:14.479
I spend about a week researching and writing
each one, simply because they come out every

00:59:14.479 --> 00:59:15.479
week.

00:59:15.479 --> 00:59:19.920
I'm usually working on two to four of them
at a time. So, I'll just have several in my

00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:26.009
folder and I'll work on whichever one is – kind
of grabs my interest the most, so I'm most

00:59:26.009 --> 00:59:30.549
motivated whenever I'm sitting down. And I
just do a lot of--. I start all of my research

00:59:30.549 --> 00:59:35.269
on the internet because that's the easiest
way. Most of the time, I can get everything

00:59:35.269 --> 00:59:37.039
I need.

00:59:37.039 --> 00:59:42.290
I have subscriptions to virtually every scientific
journal so I can look up anything most of

00:59:42.290 --> 00:59:45.279
the time without having to go to a library
in person, 'cause I simply don't have the

00:59:45.279 --> 00:59:52.259
time to do that. I also rely on--. Great sources
are these archives of newspaper articles.

00:59:52.259 --> 00:59:56.640
There's two in particular that I use that
have billions of newspaper articles, so they

00:59:56.640 --> 01:00:00.670
say--I haven't counted them personally--in
every language from hundreds of years. And

01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:04.809
when you're going over something that happened
in the 1600s, you can find a newspaper article

01:00:04.809 --> 01:00:06.940
about it. It's really something. Actually,
that's not true.

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:12.289
They didn't have printing back then. So I'm
lying. You should’ve caught me on that.

01:00:12.289 --> 01:00:13.289
[laughter]

01:00:13.289 --> 01:00:17.809
But 200 years ago, you can find newspaper
articles about it. And that's amazing, going

01:00:17.809 --> 01:00:24.970
back to the original sources. I also have
a list of a Google group. Thank you very much.

01:00:24.970 --> 01:00:28.369
About 500 people on it now that are scientists
in virtually every discipline.

01:00:28.369 --> 01:00:32.220
And whenever I have a question that I simply
can't find the answer to, I will send a question

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:39.170
out to this list. I don't use it as often
as I wish, because I'm usually out of time.

01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:43.259
I don't have time to wait for answers. But
whenever I do get them, I get great ones.

01:00:43.259 --> 01:00:45.059
And sometimes, I'll take an entire episode.

01:00:45.059 --> 01:00:49.260
If it's about a medical subject, for example,
I'm not a doctor but I'll write the whole

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:53.630
thing first and I'll post the entire transcript
up there and there's probably 200 of these

01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:57.660
people are doctors. And enough of them will
read it and give me feedback. And I'll always

01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:03.259
end up making changes and fixes. So, that's
the process.

01:01:03.259 --> 01:01:09.920
It's just a lot of hard work and a lot of
research. My educational background--. I went

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:14.829
to college for computer science back in the
80s, but I never did anything with it professionally.

01:01:14.829 --> 01:01:20.059
And I also went to UCLA and USC for writing
for film and television. And that's not a

01:01:20.059 --> 01:01:21.069
job. So--.

01:01:21.069 --> 01:01:22.759
[laughter]

01:01:22.759 --> 01:01:27.269
I had a job that I didn't take and spent my
time on something that wasn't a job. So it

01:01:27.269 --> 01:01:32.150
wasn't until podcasting came out, about five
years ago, five, six years ago, that here's

01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:35.400
suddenly a perfect confluence of doing all--.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:40.609
I do all the back end programming on the website
and the podcast by myself. So it combined

01:01:40.609 --> 01:01:45.119
all my interests--general science, computer
science, writing for film and television,

01:01:45.119 --> 01:01:52.329
doing the research. Like many people, as a
kid I had just a great passion for the paranormal.

01:01:52.329 --> 01:01:57.799
I was reading every book on UFOs and Bigfoots
and believing every word of it.

01:01:57.799 --> 01:02:02.019
So I always had a great interest in that stuff.
And so, that's where the subject matter came

01:02:02.019 --> 01:02:07.400
from. But doing the podcasts is just the,
it's the perfect job for me. It's doing everything

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:13.559
that I love. And it's something that I was
doing as a hobby for the first few years.

01:02:13.559 --> 01:02:17.779
And by the end of this year, I plan to be
doing it full time, which is a heck of an

01:02:17.779 --> 01:02:21.119
accomplishment for a completely independent
podcaster.

01:02:21.119 --> 01:02:26.910
Most of the show's income is donations from
listeners. And then there's also advertising

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:30.319
on the website. I've got great placement in
certain search engines.

01:02:30.319 --> 01:02:31.440
[laughter]

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:38.940
Just because I've done 258 episodes. All of
them are about 1750 words of very good quality.

01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:43.069
It's all original content. It's very--. I
don't know if "keyword density" means anything

01:02:43.069 --> 01:02:45.320
anymore. I'm sure you guys know more about
that than I do.

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:51.400
At least I hope so. But they're all really
good relevant articles. And so, if you search

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:56.599
for 2012 Apocalypse, for example, I come up
on Page One. That's a hell of an accomplishment--can

01:02:56.599 --> 01:02:58.310
I say hell?--right there.

01:02:58.310 --> 01:02:59.310
[laughter]

01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:03.700
Because that's a term that there's a lot of
competition for. So, I have advertising on

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:07.650
the site that I'm not doing a very good job
of. Anyone feel free to contact me if you

01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:11.509
work in the AdSense department. Tell me what
the hell I'm doing wrong. Can I say hell?

01:03:11.509 --> 01:03:12.739
God, I say that a lot.

01:03:12.739 --> 01:03:13.739
[laughter]

01:03:13.739 --> 01:03:14.739
I said "God." I am horrible.

01:03:14.739 --> 01:03:15.739
[laughter]

01:03:15.739 --> 01:03:18.731
Who's in charge of this? Don't you screen
these people?

01:03:18.731 --> 01:03:20.519
[laughter]

01:03:20.519 --> 01:03:22.690
Oh, you are.

01:03:22.690 --> 01:03:24.589
&gt;&gt;Male From Above: Excuse me.

01:03:24.589 --> 01:03:26.499
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: There we go.

01:03:26.499 --> 01:03:27.920
&gt;&gt;Male From Above: I have a question.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.809
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: I hope you have a question
and you're not someone telling us you need

01:03:29.809 --> 01:03:30.809
the room now.

01:03:30.809 --> 01:03:31.809
[laughter]

01:03:31.809 --> 01:03:32.809
Go ahead.

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:35.759
&gt;&gt;Male From Above: I do have a question. So,
you talk about myths and misinformation or

01:03:35.759 --> 01:03:38.709
bad science in pop culture, what about aren't
there any bright spots or positive things?

01:03:38.709 --> 01:03:44.690
In particular, do you see some positive trend
or science-friendly, science-positive message

01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:51.420
in some say, TV shows or anything like that?

01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:57.319
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: Do you need me to repeat
the questions for the video? Or do you have

01:03:57.319 --> 01:04:06.140
those? You have those, OK. Do I see any positive
trends? No. Well, I mean there are some. But

01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:09.670
overall, I think we have a negative trend.

01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:15.539
The realm of rationality and reason, I think,
is gonna continue to slide. And the reason,

01:04:15.539 --> 01:04:20.079
I think, we're going to continue to lose ground
as far as capturing hearts and minds of the

01:04:20.079 --> 01:04:27.809
general public is because of the internet
and television. It's become so easy to reach

01:04:27.809 --> 01:04:31.039
so many people with a sensational message.

01:04:31.039 --> 01:04:34.520
People don't have time to listen to ten things
a day. They have time to listen to one thing

01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:39.190
a day and it's whatever is easiest. It's the
front page of CNN, or it's the first five

01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:44.630
minutes of Oprah. That's where people get
their science information. And people want

01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:47.350
sensational information. They don't care if
information is true.

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:51.740
They probably care, but they don't know whether
information is true or not. They're attracted

01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:56.499
to sensational information. You may or may
not be aware that about two years ago, CNN

01:04:56.499 --> 01:05:00.749
fired its entire science department. CNN no
longer has a science bureau.

01:05:00.749 --> 01:05:05.640
They replaced it with something they called
the "Empowered Patient Bureau," which is basically

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:10.979
alternative medicine--medicine that either,
by definition, has been proven not to work,

01:05:10.979 --> 01:05:17.849
or not proven to work. That's what the empowered
patient is, because that's sensational information.

01:05:17.849 --> 01:05:20.979
It's easy to say, "Hey, we have a cure for
cancer."

01:05:20.979 --> 01:05:25.690
Or, "Here's a new diet that you can try that's
gonna make you miraculously healthy." That's

01:05:25.690 --> 01:05:28.950
the information that people want and that
they're attracted to. They're not attracted

01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:34.240
to the dry facts of what's going on. So I
think we're gonna continue to lose ground

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:38.510
for that reason. However, I don't mean to
sound gloomy and doomy about that, 'cause

01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:39.849
I see it as a huge opportunity.

01:05:39.849 --> 01:05:42.049
[voice in background talking on cell phone]

01:05:42.049 --> 01:05:44.880
Running around, talking on our cell phone,
making noise.

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:45.880
[laughter]

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:50.979
Ha. I can interrupt your phone call, too.
Ha ha ha ha. What was going on? Something

01:05:50.979 --> 01:05:51.979
burning down?

01:05:51.979 --> 01:05:57.150
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #22: We can't talk
about it.

01:05:57.150 --> 01:05:58.150
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: Oh, OK.

01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:59.150
[laughter]

01:05:59.150 --> 01:06:00.150
Any other questions from above?

01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:01.150
[pause]

01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:02.150
Oooooh.

01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:03.150
[laughter]

01:06:03.150 --> 01:06:04.150
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I guess not.

01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:07.670
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: I guess not. Yes, sir.

01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:14.849
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #23: So you interrupted
in saying [ ]

01:06:14.849 --> 01:06:19.380
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunning: Thank you. You're saying
that I interrupted myself. I interrupted myself,

01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:25.670
thank you, by saying that it's a great opportunity
that we have because we do. You see, it's--.

01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:30.789
[pause] How many people here have listened
to my show?

01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:37.759
OK. Enough of you. And would most of you agree
that at least some of them are really interesting

01:06:37.759 --> 01:06:43.829
and contain information that you haven't heard
before? OK. And it's a lot of work. The best

01:06:43.829 --> 01:06:52.109
ones are the ones that took the most work.
To make fact interesting is a lot harder than

01:06:52.109 --> 01:06:55.489
to just make up something sensational.

01:06:55.489 --> 01:07:01.299
And that's why Oprah, et cetera, et cetera,
et cetera -- they just do something sensational.

01:07:01.299 --> 01:07:06.059
Because that's what gets eyeball share. There's
no need to go to the extra work. There's no

01:07:06.059 --> 01:07:11.729
upside in doing all the extra work to make
fact sensational. It's just a lot of extra

01:07:11.729 --> 01:07:18.630
work. So, I work really hard at it. And I
think I'm reasonably successful, at least.

01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:23.410
And I hope I become more successful at it.
And I hope other people do the same example.

01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:28.730
Every TV show that's out there, every Ghost
Hunter TV show, if they put in five times

01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:33.479
as much work, their show could present nothing
but great information and still be just as

01:07:33.479 --> 01:07:37.130
fascinating. But it would take that much more
work.

01:07:37.130 --> 01:07:41.940
So, if you're proud of what it is that you
do for a living, if you care about whether

01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:45.910
you're actually providing a service or whether
you're just providing entertainment, and I

01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:51.339
think a lot of people do--I think most people
do-- then it's very personally fulfilling

01:07:51.339 --> 01:07:54.289
to put in that extra work and to be proud
of what you're doing.

01:07:54.289 --> 01:07:58.930
That's the way I feel about it. And I do a
lot of this talking heads stuff, where I'll

01:07:58.930 --> 01:08:03.839
be a little guest expert on some documentary
or something like that. And the TV crews that

01:08:03.839 --> 01:08:10.549
I've worked with, almost to the last person,
they all feel the same way. They have no background

01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:14.730
in science, or communicating science. They
don't know any better than the shows that

01:08:14.730 --> 01:08:17.279
they're making whether the information is
true or not.

01:08:17.279 --> 01:08:21.870
They think it is. They assume it is. They
like making it sensational. And they really

01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:26.510
appreciate good information, but they simply
don't have the background to tell what's true,

01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:32.600
what's fiction from what's nonsense, from
what's real. But they do have the interest.

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:38.600
And I think most people can be brought around
to better science education, better appreciation

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:39.600
for what's real.

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:44.510
I think most people who are in the media can
be brought around to doing the extra work,

01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:52.060
because it is more fulfilling, I think. If
that makes any sense.

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:53.060
[pause]

01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.060
[applause]

01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:55.060
Applause, thank you.

01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:55.061
[applause]
