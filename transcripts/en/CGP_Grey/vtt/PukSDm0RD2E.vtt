00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
Imagine you're in charge of government

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.900
and you decide that it's time to take your existing jungle council

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.800
and you're going to switch it over to STV.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.500
One of the things that is an option is

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.500
because STV requires there to be more than one representative per range,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.000
you can either triple, at a bare minimum

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
or quintuple the number of politicians you have,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.500
which might be something you want to do

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.800
but there many good reasons why you might not want to do that.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.100
Here's a more reasonable way

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.000
in which you actually switch over a country to STV.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Here is a map of our current electoral ranges

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
each of which sends one representative.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.500
So, Step 1 is we're going to get rid of all these ranges

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.500
and we're going to redraw the boundaries.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.800
So instead of everybody getting elected from one range

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.500
we're going to draw ranges that have five representatives in each.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.300
Now, if local representation means anything

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.000
you're probably going to want to try draw these boundaries

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
in meaningful ways in your country.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So, they follow natural boundaries,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.500
or they follow town boundaries, or historical boundaries..

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.500
you're going to want to try to match those as close as you reasonably can.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.800
But an important thing to realize

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.400
is that you do not have to have all of the ranges

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.000
be the exact same size in terms of representatives.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So, in the bottom corner of the map over here

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
you can see we have a kind of "animal city."

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And so what you can do is

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.800
instead of trying to divide that up into

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.300
a bunch of 5 representative ranges

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.000
you can take it and say "No we're just going to cut it into two."

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
There's the north half of the city, and the south half of the city

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.500
and that's two ranges with nine representatives each.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.800
Now you may be asking "Why don't you just make it one range with 18 representatives?"

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.000
The answer is there's a kind of trade-off for making larger ranges

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.040
The larger the range is that you have a benefit

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.000
in that it is going to be more representative of the local population.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.400
So, in theory, a range with 40 or 50 representatives

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.800
would be even better than a range with just, say, five.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.800
But the price you pay for a bigger range

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.800
is a more complicated election

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.000
because if there are, say, nine seats open

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.600
you're probably going to have at least twenty candidates running

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.500
So if you actually have a range that has eighteen seats available

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.000
you're probably looking at an election that that's going to have 40 or 50 candidates

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.500
which is a little bit beyond what you can expect a reasonable person to be able to distinguish among.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.300
Even eighteen is getting a bit up there

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.000
which is why reasonable STV systems allow you to just list your favorites

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
as far as you care to go. Say 1-5.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And then just not fill in the ballot anymore because you don't care anymore

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.500
Now the flipside to this problem is when you have a very sparsely populated region

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.500
as we have in the upper left here.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.500
Many countries have their own version of fly-over regions

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.000
where the population is widely, widely distributed and very thin.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.400
In that case, trying to draw a range that had five representatives might just be comically large,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.500
so big as to just make a mockery of the very notion

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.000
that these representatives are "local", in any sense of that word.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
So if you have a very sparsely populated region

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
you can have a smaller range as well.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.500
So in this case we're going to make one range with three representatives in the corner.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.000
Now, as before, the advantage you get with a smaller election

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
is that it is easier to follow - there are going to be fewer candidates running.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.500
However, smaller ranges are much more susceptible to intentional gerrymandering

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.500
and three is at about that number.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.000
If your country is switching over to Single Transferrable Vote

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and it wants to make all of the ranges three

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
you should be very suspicious because three is gerrymander-able.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.200
It is going less proportionate than a larger range.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.000
It is acceptable under certain, reasonable circumstances

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
but it definitely shouldn't be the standard.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Five should really be the minimum, and nine should probably be the maximum.
