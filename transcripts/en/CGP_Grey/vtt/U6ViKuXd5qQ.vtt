00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.560
Some families divide first cousins into two groups : Parallel and Cross.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.860
Let's focus on you for a second to make this easier to think about.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.740
Now, your father's brother's children and your mother's sister's children are your parallel cousins.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.600
That's when the sex of your parent matches the sex of their sibling.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.280
The sex of the cousins in question is totally irrelevant.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:31.100
And cross cousins are just the reverse. Your father's sister's children and your mother's brother's children are your cross cousins.
