00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.985
The Lord of the Rings has lots of 
different kinds of people:

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.809
Elven people, dwarvin people, tree people,
half-sized people, even people people.

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:09.633
There's, like, a million pages  of
background explaining this world

00:00:09.657 --> 00:00:11.757
that goes much deeper than the books
or the movies

00:00:11.781 --> 00:00:13.181
but if you don't want to read 
it all,

00:00:13.205 --> 00:00:14.805
here's a four-minute summary.

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:15.729
Starting with wizards.

00:00:15.753 --> 00:00:18.553
It's easy to mistake the wizards
as humans trained in magic,

00:00:18.577 --> 00:00:19.477
like elsewhere.

00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:22.901
But, in The Lord of the Rings, wizards
are low-ish level angels.

00:00:22.925 --> 00:00:25.625
They're called The Istari
(get ready for lots of names in this video)

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.649
and there are ﬁve of them:
Sauroman the white, Gandalf the gray,

00:00:28.673 --> 00:00:30.673
Radgast the brown, and the two
Blue Wizards.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:35.297
Their power comes mostly from being
supernatural and not so much from book

00:00:35.321 --> 00:00:35.621
learning.

00:00:35.645 --> 00:00:38.745
Their sent(by who? We'll get to that in a
second) to help the people of

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:40.169
world stand against evil.

00:00:40.193 --> 00:00:42.193
Not wildly successfully, either.

00:00:42.217 --> 00:00:45.017
Sauroman, the leader of the ﬁve,
with a mind of metal and wheels

00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:48.741
gets corrupted, Radgast gets distracted
by all the pretty nature, the Blue Wizards

00:00:48.765 --> 00:00:52.165
just kind of fade into the east,
possibly starting cults of magic,

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:54.689
and it's only Gandalf that stays
true to the quest.

00:00:54.713 --> 00:00:57.813
Now, where there's angels, there's a
god, and in this universe,

00:00:57.837 --> 00:00:59.037
that's Eru Ilúvatar.

00:00:59.061 --> 00:01:02.661
In the beginning, there was not but Eru,
and the infinite timeless nothing,

00:01:02.685 --> 00:01:06.385
which is rather boring, so he created
lots of angels to keep him company.

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.709
Ilúvatar's angels are called The Ainur
and are divided into two groups:

00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:12.333
The Valar, guardians of the world,
of which there are fourteen.

00:01:12.357 --> 00:01:14.157
(or ﬁfteen, depending on who you
want to count)

00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:15.181
And their servants, The Mayar.

00:01:15.205 --> 00:01:18.305
So, the wizards are the Istari, a
subset of the Mayar, which serve the

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.329
Valar, all created by Ilúvatar.

00:01:20.353 --> 00:01:23.653
Ilúvatar, and all his angels sang
together to make the world.

00:01:23.677 --> 00:01:26.877
The harmony started out great, but
there was one Valar, named Melkor,

00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:30.501
and just from the name, Melkor,
you know what's going to happen

00:01:30.525 --> 00:01:33.925
even before learning he's also the
smartest, and the most powerful

00:01:33.949 --> 00:01:34.649
of the angels.

00:01:34.673 --> 00:01:35.973
And also a bit of a loner.

00:01:35.997 --> 00:01:38.897
Melkor didn't want just to be part of
the chorus, like his dimmer Valar

00:01:38.921 --> 00:01:39.421
co-workers,

00:01:39.445 --> 00:01:41.545
he wanted his own song in creations.

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:44.069
And so, his voice became discordant
from the others...

00:01:44.093 --> 00:01:46.493
and created all the suffering and evil
in the world.

00:01:46.517 --> 00:01:49.317
But, Melkor's song also attracted some
Maylar to his side,

00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:53.041
including the balrogs, which means the
balrog is a low-level angel,

00:01:53.065 --> 00:01:56.565
making him on the same level
of the power org chart as Gandalf.

00:01:56.589 --> 00:02:00.489
Which explains why an old man can
hold his ground against a giant lava

00:02:00.513 --> 00:02:00.913
monster.

00:02:00.937 --> 00:02:03.837
Through his discordant singing,
Melkor also created some of the evil

00:02:03.861 --> 00:02:06.261
creatures in the world, such as the
dragons and trolls, which

00:02:06.285 --> 00:02:08.285
ﬁnally gets us to things that aren't
angels.

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:12.409
Other valar also made their own
non-angelic creations, though in a more

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:13.833
cooperative spirit with Ilúvatar.

00:02:13.857 --> 00:02:16.357
Manwë makes the Great Eagles,
Aulë made the dwarves,

00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:20.281
and his wife, Yavanna made all of the
animals and the plants in the world,

00:02:20.305 --> 00:02:23.505
before capping off that minor task with
The Ents, her own

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:24.829
race of sentient creatures.

00:02:24.853 --> 00:02:26.953
While Ilúvatar seemed happy
to leave it to his Vala

00:02:26.977 --> 00:02:29.577
to make *most* of the stuff,
he did personally create

00:02:29.601 --> 00:02:30.801
men and elves,

00:02:30.825 --> 00:02:33.825
which makes them special,
and kind of above all the other living

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:34.249
creatures.

00:02:34.273 --> 00:02:35.373
Sorry, Dwarves.

00:02:35.397 --> 00:02:39.297
And, of these two, the men
are Ilúvatar's favorite children.

00:02:39.321 --> 00:02:43.021
And, he shows this by giving men
shorter lives than everybody else,

00:02:43.045 --> 00:02:45.045
and also the gift of death?

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.269
Thanks a lot, Dad.

00:02:46.293 --> 00:02:48.893
But, their short live set them apart
from the other creatures, and they

00:02:48.917 --> 00:02:52.517
aren't tied to the music of creation
and the world, like everyone else.

00:02:52.541 --> 00:02:55.041
And so, are able to forge their own
futures.

00:02:55.065 --> 00:02:58.665
These qualities make them the
"Get Stuff Done" species of Middle Earth.

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.089
Elves, on the other hand, are so
connected to the world that practically

00:03:02.113 --> 00:03:05.113
made of nature. Same with the dwarves
in their own way

00:03:05.137 --> 00:03:06.137
and the Ents, of course.

00:03:07.161 --> 00:03:10.061
These species all but follow the flow
of nature, and it's partly why the

00:03:10.085 --> 00:03:13.385
humans have such a hard time getting
them to do anything.

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:16.809
Even when faced with armies of Orcs,
which brings us to Orcs.

00:03:16.833 --> 00:03:20.533
Melkor was powerful, but couldn't make
his creatures as great as the elves and

00:03:20.557 --> 00:03:23.357
men, and so cheated by corrupting some
of them in the beginning and

00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:26.881
selectively breading them over the
generations into these creatures.

00:03:26.905 --> 00:03:30.305
This business Melkor was up to of
torturing elves, making monsters,

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.129
recuiting angels from the other side
eventually, but unsurprisingly, led to

00:03:34.153 --> 00:03:37.453
a war that Melkor looses and got him
banished into the void.

00:03:37.477 --> 00:03:40.477
All of the conflict in
The Lord of The Rings comes long after the

00:03:40.501 --> 00:03:43.501
epic Good vs. Evil fight of
that universe.

00:03:43.525 --> 00:03:46.325
Sauron, the Big Bad, who caused all of
the trouble in these books,

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.349
was just one of the Mayar, though
an unusually powerful one

00:03:49.373 --> 00:03:52.073
who started his career as Melkor's
lieutenant.

00:03:52.097 --> 00:03:55.197
After the war, he did make a ring to
focus his strength, but that's a

00:03:55.221 --> 00:03:56.721
story for another time.

00:03:56.745 --> 00:03:59.045
Last, but not least, we have the Hobbits.

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.869
Even though they seem related to Dwarves,
what with the living underground and the

00:04:01.893 --> 00:04:04.393
vertical challenge, Hobbits are a
subspecies of men.

00:04:04.417 --> 00:04:07.617
For such an important and pivotal race,
there is little written of their origin,

00:04:07.641 --> 00:04:09.441
other than the phrase "related to men".

00:04:09.465 --> 00:04:12.765
Turns out, with a million pages,
you still can't talk about everything,

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:14.789
just like in a four-minute video.
