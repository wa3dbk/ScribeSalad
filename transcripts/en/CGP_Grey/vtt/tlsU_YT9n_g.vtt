# Q&amp;A with Grey `#2 (One Million Subscribers)

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:02.890
Hi.

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.859
So I think this is the part where I'm supposed
to have a dramatic opening, perhaps the 2001

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:11.780
theme song playing in the background as the
number 1,000,000 fades into view, but obviously

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:12.780
that's not happening.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.879
Don't get me wrong, I'm lucky that so many
people want to watch my videos. It's just

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:21.560
that one million is a number too large to
be comprehended with a monkey-derived brain.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.950
To try and have it feel more real I've takes
some YouTube data and made a spreadsheet!

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:25.950
(I make lots of spreadsheets)

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.550
You can select your country and enter the
population of the city where you live, and

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.090
it will spit out the statistically approximate
number of other people in that city who are

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.590
subscribed to this channel.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.890
Doing that for London shows there are about
9,000 people in the city who are subscribers.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.040
Now 9,000 is obviously smaller that one-*million*
but it's a number with constraints and is

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.990
small enough to possibly be understood while
still large enough to be very intimidating.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.010
So, if you're interested, you can click here
to play around with the spreadsheet. Now,

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.000
as promised: on to the Q&amp;A.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.640
## What do you like most about being a YouTuber?
--Conzo_K

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.990
The best thing about this strange new world
is the people I've met -- which is quite the

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.210
statement for a social recluse to make. All
these guys are amazing to talk with and I

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.320
feel very lucky that I get the occasional
chance to do so.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.110
## What's the biggest change of opinion you've
had? --Steam23

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.890
That's a little too personal to share with
say, one-*million* people, but I do want to

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.000
talk about the importance of being able to
change your mind in general.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.810
The trick is to keep your identity separate
from your opinions -- they are objects in

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.670
a box you carry with you and should be easily
replaceable if it turns out they're no good.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.740
If you think that the opinions in the box
are *who you are* then you'll cling to them

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.880
despite any evidence to the contrary.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.420
Bottom line: If you want to always be right,
you need to always be prepared to change your

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.420
mind.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.120
## Were you trying to create a unique aesthetic
by using stick-figures? --Waggles_ 20

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.780
No it's just that I can't draw.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.770
## After moving to London how long did it
take until you stopped saying 'Math' and started

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.770
saying 'Maths'? --brockheinz

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.340
I haven't -- I'm sticking with 'math'.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.750
Americans living in the UK often end up with
an unfortunate accent I call 'psuedo-british'.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.380
I try very hard to avoid this, but when you've
spend the majority of your talking time with

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.799
British people over a decade it's impossible
to completely fight the creeping pseudo-british

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.549
accent no matter how abhorrent you think it
makes you sound.

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.550
## Did your students know about your YouTube
channel? --qiyitam

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.420
I would never talk about it, but I know some
of them knew. However it's impossible to express

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.610
how little they cared. My classes were like
not hour-long CGP Grey videos.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.489
## Would you like to see the interrobang more
widely adopted? --aaronboardley

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.489
Who wouldn't‽

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:13.870
## Why don't you have an upload schedule?
--ManavT

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.849
Right: the big question. Usually phrased in
the YouTube comment section as 'y u no make

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:18.939
moar vids'?

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:22.469
So on average over the past couple of years
I've posted a 'Grey Explains' video about

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:27.919
every five weeks, which means if I could switch
to a weekly schedule my income would *quin*tupple.

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:30.010
Trust me, I would if I could.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.219
I've talked before about how long it takes
to make these videos, but one of the other

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.639
problem I haven't mentioned is the failure
rate of projects.

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:40.250
For every video you see there's at least two
or three that didn't make it.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.879
Most of the time that's just a lost afternoon
of working on an idea before realizing it's

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.260
a dud, but sometimes it's weeks before a fatal
flaw reveals itself -- sometimes I'll discover

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.980
too late a central fact of the video isn't
correct or, sometimes the whole script is

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.919
just unfixably *boring*.

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:57.730
Either way the decision to kill a video that
isn't working is depressing and frustrating

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.219
because of the sunk cost of all those hours.

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:04.859
The videos you see are (mostly) pretty good
precisely because I try my best to kill the

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.700
ones that weren't -- that's why there isn't
a schedule, and there never can be.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.090
## What's the biggest video you killed? --tyroncs

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.809
The most time I lost was on an important video
to convince the world why *Settlers of Catan*

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:18.590
is the greatest board game ever made.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.450
I had a couple thousand words as a starting
point, harassed people for footage of a now-famous

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.079
game that took place at YouTube EDU, got a
bunch of random videos from my ever-helpful

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.930
twitter followers had a and an outline for
a 'How to Play Settlers of Catan' tutorial

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.150
video for my second channel.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.670
But the script kept growing and growing and
began to look more like a documentary film

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.669
on board game design than a YouTube video
-- which might, depending on who you are sound

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:42.480
really interesting, but it had the boring
problem I mentioned before.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.650
My last ditch effort to save a project like
this is to get rid of everything, work on

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.849
something else for a few days, then write
a brand new script by hand -- which I did.

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:55.069
But that script still wasn't good and weeks
after starting the project I shelved it. But

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.599
I'm talking about it now because it's an idea
that I still just can't let go and might come

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.040
back to some day.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.219
## Why don't you hire people to help you?
--WhoAteEarth

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:07.209
That's a big topic that deserves more time,
but for now let me just say the kind of work

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.549
produced by individuals is very different
than kind work of produced by groups. One

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.409
isn't intrinsically better than the other,
but I think the kinds of videos I've made

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:19.120
have all benefited from being a one-man project
from start to finish.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.280
## Your opinion on koalas. --blanket_warrior

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.250
They sleep 20 hours a day -- never going to
be a koala-based civilization with that kind

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.250
of work ethic.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.290
## If you could transfer your brain into a
robotic body, would you? --xyon21

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.290
Obviously yes.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.440
## You can add three amendments to the US
constitution. What do they do? --raloon

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.410
Oh, so many tempting changes to make. Off
the top of my head I'd say:

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.060
1. Abolish private funding of all elections
and instead make them run from a limited pool

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.060
of tax money.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.740
2. Abolish the Senate and replace it with
some kind of proportional body.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.910
3. Overturn the Interstate-commerce clause
-- which basically gives the federal government

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.120
too much power over the affairs of the States.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.510
Of course, if it was actually my responsibility,
I'd consult with some experts rather than

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.460
just idly mull it over for a couple of days.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.460
Running a country of 300 million is more complicated
than it looks.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.050
## What advice you would give for a successful
life? --pringlesaddict99

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.250
Build a self-evaluation loop in your life.
If you don't periodically review your actions,

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:12.640
their effects and your decision-making process
there hope for improvement other than random

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.640
chance.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.580
I do very small weekly reviews, and bigger
quarterly and yearly reviews of how my life

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:24.600
is going and how I might want it to be different
in both the biggest and smallest ways.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.950
That's the best, high level advice I have.
For more tactical advice I recommend two books:

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.330
one that changed my life *Getting Things Done*
by David Allen and another that might change

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.520
yours: *So Good They Can't Ignore You* by
Cal Newport. You can click those books to

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.639
read my reviews of them.

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:40.240
## Have you made a video you don't like how
it came out? --Gourounaki

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.060
With the exceptions of the 2012 and Holland
videos, I'm unhappy with *all of them*. I

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.860
don't watch my own videos after upload if
I can possibly avoid it: they're graveyards

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.210
of the could-have been.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.260
## Favorite non-educational YouTube channels?
--DB101

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.480
1st: Glove and Boots, who I'm suprised haven't
yet gotten ALL THE SUBSCRIBERS. 2nd: I'm a

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.170
also huge fan of Yahtzee, the Roger Ebert
of video games.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.320
## What was your first memory of the internet?
Mine is playing flash games. --vicorator

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.680
Mine is B.B.S.s. Now get off my lawn and go
watch this documentary you whippersnapper.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.950
## Who are your heros? --reed17

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.370
Mostly Dark Seer and Necrolyte.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.190
## What do you find hardest when making a
video? --willdood

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.190
Writing the script is the hardest and unfortunately
it's the bottleneck for the whole process.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.560
The most *uncomfortable* part is editing the
audio. Just like everyone else there is a

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.910
voice in my head that I like and a voice on
the tape that I don't.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.190
## Have any of your answers from your previous
Q&amp;A changed? --MessiahPenguin

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.750
You're probably referring to these, and no.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.530
## How long would you survive a zombie apocalypse?
--One_Wheel_Drive

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.420
I wouldn't. If a Walking-Dead-style zombie
apocalypse arrises the correct course of action

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.020
is suicide.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.750
## What do you listen to while making videos?
--syphen94

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.730
My most reliable writing music is Girl Talk's
'All Day' which I would link to on YouTube

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.740
but it's copyright-infringement-tasktic. But
you can get it from his website and if you

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.320
like remixes you should give it a listen.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.660
However, I often get some random terrible
song in my head while writing and end up buying

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:59.460
it and putting on repeat -- for hours. For
this script my iTunes reveals I listened to

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:05.440
a single song 127 times. That might be torture
in some jurisdictions but the repetitiveness

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.270
really zones me into writing.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:12.530
Animating, however, is incredibly tedious
so I listen to a ton of podcasts and audiobooks

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:13.659
to keep my sanity.

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:15.920
## What's the most interesting 'could-have-been'
of history? --SCE-2-AUX

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.420
Historical-could-have-beens mostly strike
me as a missing-the-point thought exerciese.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.410
The real driver of history is neither great
men nor the actions of the masses but the

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:27.700
ceaseless march of science and technology,
which is mostly indifferent to the imaginary

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.740
lines drawn by packs of monkeys.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.350
Knowing my perspective you'll see why if I
*had* to pick one it would this primitive

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.330
greek steam engine invented 2,000 years ago.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.920
There are reasons why it wasn't developed
further but if some rich Greek had gotten

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.800
obsessed with the technology perhaps we would
have had an industrial revolution two millennia

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.110
earlier and we'd now be a trans-galactic-post-singularity
civilization. With robot bodies.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.200
## What is the most British thing you have
encountered that you can't get your head around?

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.200
--vikihogg

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.350
The idea that the best way to cool down on
a summer day while confined to a non-air-conditioned

00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:01.560
office is to drink hot tea. Madness, absolute
madness.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.280
## Should we create a universal language?
--vsa11

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.780
We already have, it's just not very universal.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.010
## What question do you want me to ask the
most? --Gregorian_Hawke

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:09.010
Hmmm…

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:12.500
## I love your videos and have even watched
this somewhat tedious one until the very end.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.860
How can I help support you? --Gregorian_Hawke

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.690
I'm glad you asked Gregorian_Hawke.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:19.870
The best way is though a subscription at subbable
where you can get signed posters and other

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:24.950
stuff, and there’s also t-shirts and addiction
mugs (and flamethrowers) over at DFTBA.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:28.400
Well Internet, it's been fun. And I'm sorry
if you're question didn't make it into this

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.719
video -- there were loads I had to cut -- but
now that we're in this realm of numbers so

00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:37.329
big they don't make sense perhaps I'll turn
Q&amp;A's into an occasional random thing rather

00:08:37.329 --> 00:08:40.610
than a waiting for an arbitrary base ten roll
over thing.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:44.629
Thank you again to everyone for your continued
support and thank you for subscribing and

00:08:44.629 --> 00:08:47.509
for watching -- these last two years have
been quite a ride.
