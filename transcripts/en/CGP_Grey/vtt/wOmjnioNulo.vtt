00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
Sheep... weren't always this fluffy.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.520
We fluffy-fied them by breeding the fluffiest in each generation.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.400
This is domestication: sculpting wild animals for better human use.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.880
As we saw in Part 1, for early man, animals were powerful tools

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.260
...food, clothing, transportation, tractors.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.960
Yet, though there were animals everywhere, only a handful were domesticated in the pre-modern world.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.160
What made these different?

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.900
Let's make a domestication checklist, shall we?

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.440
First up: Feedable

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.080
A cow is a machine that turns grass into steaks

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.060
And a tiger a machine that turns steaks into… tiger.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.040
Ten pounds of grass make a pound of steak. And ten pounds of steak make a pound of tiger.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.500
... but these have the same number of calories -- so you might as well just eat the cow and save yourself a lot of work.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.060
So pure carnivores: you're not going to domesticate, just because of thermodynamics.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.340
You're looking for herbivores that aren't picky.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.560
They should eat something that's everywhere that you can't eat.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.280
Any omnivores better be happy eating whatever and better be super worth it.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.980
We are, however, putting the pig before the pen here because first we need to catch something that's…

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.640
Friendly

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.700
OK, obviously catching a carnivore is a bad idea anyway because their day job is murder.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.060
But plenty of omnivores like grizzleys moonlight in murder.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.220
No safety in vegetarians either: buffalo are terrifying tanks for all the reasons mentioned before...

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.940
...hippos hold the murder high-score in Africa,

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.560
...giraffes look real dorky until you consider their striking range -- lions mostly leave them alone.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.920
Animals it would be awesome to domesticate are, not coincidentally, super dangerous.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.600
War bears would be a hell of an advantage for your tribe, but it's not going to happen.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.840
And if it's big and not dangerous, it's a nervous wreck.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.820
Try sneaking up on a gazelle? Rhymes with "LOL".

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.120
Sure, you and a team of buddies could spend the whole day marathon jogging it down to exhaustion...

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.880
...but if it doesn't break it's own neck as you try to drag it back home,

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.700
...then it's going to casually leap out of whatever pen you built for it.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.680
Ok, next up: some animals have reproductive -ah- preferences...

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.280
...that make them incompatible with captivity.  Looking at you, Pandas.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.860
The time and energy humans have spent to get pandas to get on with it is comical.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.680
Hunter-Gatherers need an animal so eager to breed, it gets it wrong sometimes.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.180
... not an animal whose mating seasons they have to keep careful track of.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.800
So: Friendly, Feedable and -- Fecund.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.580
It also needs to grow up fast.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.680
This gets us to the heart of domestication versus taming.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.900
Again: to domesticate a species is to change it to make it better for us.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.540
And side note here: we domesticate plants as well.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.920
We've bred them to be monstrous versions of their wild selves.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.560
So when hippies talk about going back to nature, they forget that these plants are just as man made as this pop-tart.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.860
Anyway, back to the animals...

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.700
The pig porkification project succeeded because pig generations are shorter than human generations.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.440
A single, clever human can make porky progress in their lifetime.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.300
Compare and contrast: Elephants.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:00.000
Two years to make a calf, five years in between calves, nine years until female maturity, fifteen years for males?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.480
You've got to be kidding, Elephants. There's no time for this.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.360
But humans can still tame elephants. You can catch an elephant, and train it not to freak out around humans.  Then, put it to work.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.840
But elephant domestication would require accurate records over several human lives...

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.300
...never mind that keeping one or two tamed elephants around is incredibly costly

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.340
...which is why war elephants only happened on occasion in already complex societies.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:30.820
Tame elephants are a luxury, hence this rule of thumb: if it's on farm, it's domesticated, if it's in a circus, it's tame.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.500
Finally: families.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.460
OK: zebra vs horses.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:40.620
Horses are civilization game-changers -- it's remarkable to think that from thousands BC until the telegraph...

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.800
...a dude on a horse was the best internet available.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.700
Horses were domesticated in Eurasia, but humans started in Africa which has Zebra ...

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.520
...why didn't the first humans ride out of Africa on the backs of zebra to conquer the world?

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.780
Because zebra are bastards.  They live to kick and bite: dangerous in a pre-penicillin world.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.420
...and zebra also have a ducking reflex making them very frustrating to lasso.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.880
In addition to being a real pain in the ass animal, Zebra lack a family structure.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.660
Horse herds hierarchy -- you can see it when they travel in a line: the male, top female, her foals, second female, her foals, and so on.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.680
Humans, by capturing and taming the lead male, become head horse.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.100
Lots of barnyard animals are barnyard animals because they have family values humans exploit --

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.740
...they just  grow up with the idea that this human is a funny sort of take-charge cow or whatever.  No big deal.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.060
Chickens will peck, peck, peck until they've worked out who's top chicken.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.920
But you know whose really top chicken?  We're top chicken.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.020
Dogs and cats: this is what makes them different.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.860
Dogs will love you and defend you and hunt with you because you're part of the pack.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:51.320
Dogs live to be useful to us -- which in the modern world means falling over to play dead -- but they love it

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.160
"Bang! .... Good girl. Good girl!" [laughing]

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.180
... whereas a cat is a tiny tiger that lives in your house.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.420
Ok, back to these guys.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.540
For zebra, there's no such thing as society.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.280
They hang out in groups because it's a good survival strategy but they don't really care.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.460
Catch a zebra and his family won't follow, try to ride him and you'll be lucky to keep your fingers.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.340
Zebra look like horses on the outside, but not on the inside.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.340
So that's the checklist: 
Friendly - Feedable - Fecund - Family Friendly

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:25.500
It's not a long checklist, but for Hunter-Gatherers, any animal they wanted to domesticate needed everything,...

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:32.940
...which is why in early human history only a bakers dozen of big animals were domesticated the world over.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.820
