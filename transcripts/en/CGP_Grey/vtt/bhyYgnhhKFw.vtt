00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.679
Look. At. That.
What a waste. That queen, living it off the

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:08.050
government in her castles with her corgis.
(and gin) Just how much does this cost to

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.940
maintain?
The answer: 40 million pounds.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.080
That’s about 65 pence per person per year
of tax money going to the royal family.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.910
Sure, It’s still twenty-three pence short
of a complete shield, but it might be more

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.250
than you want to pay.
Any after all, those are your coins. Why does

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.560
the queen get to steal them?
Well, it’s a little complicated.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.090
The story starts with this guy: King George
the third, most well known as the monarch

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.250
who lost the United States for the Empire.
Less well known – but far more interesting

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.730
– is he likely suffered from a mental illness
called Porphyria which has the unusual side

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.290
effect of transforming your poop from it’s
normal boring brown to a delightful shade

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.360
of purple.
But I digress – back to the the reason the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.059
Royals get tax money.
King George was having trouble paying his

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.460
bills and had racked up debt.
While he did own huge tracts of land, the

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.329
profit from their rental was too small to
cover his expenses.

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.829
He offered a deal to parliament: for the rest
of his life he would surrender the profits

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.380
from the rents on his land in exchange for
getting a fixed annual salary and having his

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.350
debts removed.
Parliament took him up on the deal, guessing

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.960
that the profits from the rents would pay
off long-term.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.959
Just how well did parliament do? Back to the
present let’s compare their profits and

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:10.889
losses by using a tenner to represent 10 million
pounds.

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:13.999
The cost to maintain the royal family today
is 40 million pounds per year.

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:18.189
But the revenue paid to the UK from the royal
lands is 200 million.

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:24.299
200 million in revenue subtract 40 million
in salary costs equals 160 million pounds

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.130
in profit.
That’s right: The United Kingdom earns 160

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.601
million pounds in profit, every year from
the Royal Family.

00:01:32.601 --> 00:01:33.601
So stop all your moaning about the Royal family
and how much they cost and how worthless they

00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:34.639
are. The Royal Family is Great for Great Britain.
Doing the individual’s math again:

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:39.779
160 million pounds divided by 62 million people
is about 2 pounds and 60 pence.

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:44.009
Because of the Royal Family, your taxes are
actually 2 pounds and 60 pence cheaper each

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.520
year than they would otherwise be.
But perhaps that’s not enough for you because

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.859
you’re a real greedy geezer. Why not kick
they royals out and keep 100% of the revenue.

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:55.700
Because it’s still their land. King George
the crazy wasn’t crazy enough to give up

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.469
everything, just the profits.
But it wasn’t only him: every Monarch since

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:04.079
King George the third has voluntarilyturned
over the profits from their land to the United

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.829
Kingdom. Again: Voluntarily.
If the government stopped paying the Royal

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.060
Family’s living and state expenses the Royals
would be forced to take back the profits from

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.870
their land. And your taxes, dear Monarchy-haters,
would go UP not DOWN.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.140
Plus 160 million is just the easily measurable
money the United Kingdom makes from the royal

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.810
family.
Don’t forget their huge indirect golden

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.760
goose: tourists.
Annoying though they might be to the locals

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.600
by blocking the tube and refusing to stand
on the right, they dump buckets of money on

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.740
the UK to see the sights, travel ludicrously
short distances by public transport, and generally

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.390
act silly a long way from home.
Sure not everything they come to see is royal,

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.190
but the most expensive stuff is.
And who are the biggest spenders? The Yanks.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.410
After they’ve finished buying maple syrup
&amp; cheap, pharmaceuticals, Tijuanaian professional

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.970
services &amp; illegal pharmaceuticals, where
do they go next?

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.741
The United Kingdom.
Americans fly across an ocean to see a land

00:02:48.741 --> 00:02:52.490
filled with Castles that aren’t plastic.
And why do the Americans think Frances castles

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.990
are so boring and stinky and the UK’s castles
so awesome? Because real monarchs still use

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.520
them.
The tower of London is so stunning to visitors

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.300
because the Royal Crest on the Yeomen Warders
Uniform is real. It’s not a lame historical

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.860
re-enactment or modern LARPing.
It’s the embodiment of the living, breathing

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.160
queen.
Everywhere you look she’s sprinkled fairy

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.200
dust on banal objects to make them magically
attractive to tourists.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.150
12 million of whom visit every year spending
7,000 million pounds.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.810
Which suddenly makes those direct profits
look like rather small change.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.620
But perhaps you don’t care than the monarchs
are a perpetual GOLD MINE for the UK. You’re

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.230
a Republican and you dislike like the royal
family because of their political power. After

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.690
all, the government gets all its right to
rule through the crown, not the people.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.790
And yes, I’ll grant you that back in the
head-choppy days of yore, this was a legitimate

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.760
concern, but the modern queen isn’t a dangerous
political lion but a declawed kitten.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.070
Her powers are limited to a kabuki theater
act of approving what parliament wants to

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.720
do anyway.
Remove the royal family from government and

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.569
fundamentally nothing would be different except
now you wouldn’t live in the magical United

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.970
Kingdom but the rather dull United Republic
of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.680
A.K.A URESWNI for short. Doesn’t quite have
the same ring to it.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.200
But, maybe I’m wrong – perhaps the queen
is a political ticking time bomb, just waiting

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.980
for her chance to declare random wars and
devolve parliaments for the lulz.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.490
But until that day comes.
God save the queen.�
