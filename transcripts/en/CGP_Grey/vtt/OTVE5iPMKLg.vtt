00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.310
Every day the world consumes 300 tones of
caffeine -- enough for one cup of coffee for

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.140
every man, woman and child.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.970
The world's largest buyer of coffee, the US,
has to import nearly all of this as the coffee

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.990
trees from which caffeine is harvested will
only grow at commercial levels between the

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.110
tropic of cancer and the tropic of capricorn
in an area called the coffee belt. Only a

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.610
single state, Hawaii, is within the belt.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.449
However, the United States is only the largest
buyer because it's so populous. The most enthusiastic

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.529
coffee drinkers per capita are, in increasing
order, the Netherlands, Denmark, Iceland,

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.570
Norway and, the world champions, Finland,
where they drink three times as much coffee

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.200
a day as the average American. All of these
countries are outside of the coffee belt and

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.210
must import 100% of their caffeine supply.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.210
To get this caffeine, first bees must pollinate
the flowers of a coffee tree and these flowers

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.289
develop into bright red berries. Unlike more
cooperative domesticated plants, the coffee

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.219
tree does not ripen all its berries at the
same time so they need to be hand picked and

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:50.409
sorted.

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:53.679
Once picked, the coffee bean is removed from
inside the berry. This young seedling of the

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:57.229
tree is then dried, heated, ground and submersed
in boiling water to get out the precious,

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:01.139
precious caffeine. It takes about 40 coffee
beans to make one shot of espresso.

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:05.129
But why is caffeine in the coffee beans in
the first place? It's not like the coffee

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.229
trees want to have humans cutting bits of
them off and committing a holocaust of their

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.310
offspring.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.310
Well, the trees, of course, don't want or
feel anything and originally evolved caffeine

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.659
for their own benefit. Caffeine is an insecticide
that effectively paralyzes or kills bugs chomping

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:18.659
on the tree.

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.509
Whether or not the insects go out experiencing
the greatest caffeine high ever is not known.

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.759
While caffeine is /technically/ lethal, it's
adapted for for 1g bugs, not monkeys 100,000

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.770
times more massive. So you'd really have to
try to win this Darwin Award.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.289
But, if you must: to calculate the dose of
caffeine you'll need to ingest to have a 50%

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.820
of death, take your mass in kilograms and
multiply it by 150mg.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.530
Or in terms of coffee, for every kilogram
of mass you have you need to drink one latte

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.060
to get a visit from the grim reaper.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.479
That's a lot of coffee so it's not suprising
that there are no recored deaths in healthy

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.289
adults from this method and it's doubtful
that it's even possible. Because, while you're

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.509
busy getting the coffee in, your body is busy
getting it out by one way or another.

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.969
The rare recorded deaths from caffeine are
from diet pills, pep pills and crazy people

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.530
who eat the drug in its pure form.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.810
Poison though caffeine is, you do still develop
addiction to the stuff. And it's is a real

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.729
physiological addiction not a wimpy psychological
addition like people claim for videos games

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:10.729
and the internet.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.530
But caffeine isn't heroine -- rapid withdrawal
won't kill you -- it might make you cranky

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.930
and give you a wicked headache -- but since
caffeine releases dopamine to make you happy

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.220
and it gets rid of headaches there's really
no reason to ever stop using it.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.630
And who would want to give up the stuff anyway?
I mean, aside from converts to Mormonism and

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.890
Rastafarianism. Caffeine is the world's most
used psychoactive drug -- and with good reason

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.310
it's pure awesome.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.360
It increases concentration, decreases fatigue
and gives you better memory.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.420
This isn't just a placebo -- these are real
effects replicable in a laboratory.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.439
And, contrary to popular belief, drinking
coffee isn't a faustian bargain where the

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:45.180
devil gives you the ability to work faster
but in exchange makes your life shorter.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.790
For normal, healthy humans there are no medical
concerns. Coffee and the caffeine within it

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.549
may even has medical benefits such as protection
from cardiovascular disease, diabetes and

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:53.870
Parkinson's.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.840
Caffeine can even get rid of migraines, but
the amount required and the and method of

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.180
ingestion is... uncomfortable.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.220
Moving right along...

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.730
You know what else you can thank caffeine
for? A little thing called the enlightenment.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.390
In the 1600s people drank more beer and gin
than water. But with the introduction of coffee

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.980
and tea, people switched from a depressant
to a stimulant. It's not surprising then that

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.810
this time was an intellectual boon compared
to earlier centuries.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.510
Ben Franklin and Edward Lloyd loved their
coffee for the same reason that modern workers

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.010
and students do. It's invaluable for staying
awake and concentrating when you need to finish

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.730
a TPS report or to get through that boring
physics class.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.310
Coffee is the fuel of the modern world, so
go grab a cup guilt-free and get working smarter

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.939
and faster.
