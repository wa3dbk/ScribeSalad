00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.880
One of the simplest

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.240
if not the best ways to do a proportional system

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.540
is to have voters simply put an "X" next to their favorite party

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.020
and then you take those results from the citizens' votes

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.160
and you try to match your representatives to that as closely as possible

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.880
given the number of seats that you have in your legislative branch.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.260
But, one of the philosophical problems that you might have with such a system

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.240
is that the citizens aren't voting for individuals in particular,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.380
they're voting for the party in general.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.420
And what that means is there needs to be a meeting that happens somewhere

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.120
at the party headquarters where they determine who their favorite candidates are.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.980
And so when the monkey party gets told that they have three seats

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.900
they have already made a list of who gets the first seat, the second seat, and the third seat.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.540
Proportional systems do have the advantage that their explicit goal is to try to match

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.840
the legislative branch of the government as closely as possible to how the citizens have voted.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.180
STV is a bit of a proportional"ish" system.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.680
Proportionality is not its goal; its goal is actually trying to make sure that

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.760
as many citizens as possible have local representatives that they voted for

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.160
and also to minimize the number of unhappy voters.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.900
And as a side effect you get a roughly proportional legislature, but not exactly.
