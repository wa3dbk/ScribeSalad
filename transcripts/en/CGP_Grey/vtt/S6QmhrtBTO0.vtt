00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.780
As you might expect from a 2000 year old religion that employs a million people in every country, there are a lot of idiosyncratic traditions,

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:11.920
and even the phrase 'The Catholic Church' is a bit of a misnomer because it's really made of 23 catholic churches each with different traditions,

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.190
though they all do report back to the Pope. As a result, this video will necessarily have to be an overview of the process,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.420
not an exact description of how to climb to the top from every potential starting point.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.400
If you really want to become Pope, please be sure to check your local rules and regulations before applying.
