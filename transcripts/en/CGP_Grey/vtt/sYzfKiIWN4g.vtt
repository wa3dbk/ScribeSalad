# 5.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.190
Vikings

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.180
What would a Viking be without his trusty
battle helmet and its impressive horns?

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.650
The answer is: a more historically accurate
viking.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.441
Think, for a moment about wearing headgear
like that into battle: the horns are just

00:00:15.441 --> 00:00:18.090
easy targets for your opponent to hit and
knock off your helmet.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.150
Or, if you strap on your helmet, now your
opponent has a convenient lever with which

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.590
to drag you to the ground and something to
hold onto while slitting your throat.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.330
Horned helmets are a terrible idea, which
is why archeologists have never found them

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.010
at viking battle sites and there's no evidence
that they were ever used.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.280
It was poets and artists -- people not known
for caring about facts and reality -- who

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.820
gave the Vikings their silly hats during the
late 1800s, long after the vikings could 'correct'

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.170
their misconceptions.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.199
4.

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:42.199
Lady Godiva

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.999
The story of this 11th century English noblewoman
is that her mean husband the Earl raised taxes

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:49.550
on the townspeople of Coventry which Lady
Godiva -- and not surprising the locals -- thought

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.819
were too high.

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:54.460
She badgered her husband and he conceded in
exasperation to lower the taxes if she rode

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.750
through town naked -- assuming that she never
would, but she did.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.129
Because people don't likes taxes -- even though
they're how civilization is purchased -- Lady

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.090
Godiva's story lives on notably in the Godiva
logo and in popular songs.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.760
But while Lady Godiva was a real person and
Coventry is a real town there is no record

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.300
of her nude ride from the time when it happened
-- so we can assume the story is false.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.590
Just as with the Vikings, again poets and
artists are to blame, who made up the tale

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.980
long after Lady Godiva's death.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:19.980
3.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:20.980
Napoleon

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.750
Famously this tiny, tiny general -- perhaps
to compensate for his short stature -- took

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.790
control of France greatly expanded its influence
and dubbed himself emperor.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.020
Napoleon's official height was indeed 5 foot
2 inches but at the time French inches were

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.410
longer than English inches, so doing the unit
conversion, Napoleon's height should have

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.590
been reported as 5'7 in England's imperial
units -- which is short by today's standard

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.930
but was average or slightly above average
in the early 1800s.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.660
However England, with it's eternal love for
all things French, didn't care and went the

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.540
Napoleon-is-so-short-LOL version of the story
in newspapers and cartoons.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.870
Meanwhile, Napoleon was busy introducing the
Metric System to France and the wider world

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.120
to standardize measurements so this sort of
confusion would never happen again -- and

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.720
thankfully the whole world now uses metric.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.720
Mostly.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.720
Sort of.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.720
2.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.720
Roman Vomit

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.030
Ah, the Roman empire, so great and powerful,
but corrupted by decadence from within.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.590
And what could be a better symbol of that
decadence than the Vometorum: where Romans,

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.870
after stuffing themselves with delicious foods,
could vomit them all up to make room to feast

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.230
anew.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.560
Vometoria are real but this idea of them is
not, though confusion is understandable because

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.150
their name -- Vomit-orium -- seems to make
their purpose so clear.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.060
Even if for some reason you know latin -- perhaps
because you live in a country that insists

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.319
you waste hundreds of hours of your life learning
a dead, useless language -- this knowledge

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.340
still won't help you because the root word
'vomitum' means 'to spew forth'.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.340
So what is it really?

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.100
If you've ever been to a big stadium, like
say, the ones made by the romans, you have

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.930
already used a vometorium.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.130
This is what the vometoria are -- the passageways
that lets lots of people enter or exit at

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.130
once.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.020
The people are what spews forth in the vometoria,
not the contents of the people.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.020
1.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.020
Columbus

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.830
There is so very much wrong with the common
retelling of the story of Christopher Columbus

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.740
that it's hard to know where to begin, but
the biggest misconception is that everyone

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.500
else thought the world was flat, but Columbus
was the only guy smart enough to know that

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.500
it's round.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.890
It makes a daring story, but knowledge of
a spherical earth goes back to at least 5,000

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.750
BC that's six and a half thousand years before
Columbus set sail -- and that knowledge was

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.250
never lost to western civilization.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.910
In 200 BC Eratosthenes calculated Earth's
circumference and his estimate was still well

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.440
know and being used in Columbus's time.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.520
The argument Columbus had with queen Isabella
was not over the shape of the earth, but of

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.520
its size.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.910
Columbus estimated the Earth was much smaller
than Queen Isabella and her scientific advisors

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.830
did which was way he thought he could make
it across the empty Atlantic to India.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.520
But Columbus's size estimate was wrong -- again,
just like Napoleon's height -- because of

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.630
mixed up units.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.430
However, his error did send him West to become
the first European to discover America -- as

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.960
long as you ignore the hornless vikings who
beat him by 500 years.
