00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.830
 Every year on December 24th, children from all over the world come up with milk and biscuits. 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.150
 Bar looked to be able to attract a fat-grand grandfather into the house and leave a gift before he got into the neighbor's house. 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.879
 How was this strange custom born? 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:16.010
 Perhaps the most blame for you is Nordic. The winter there is cold and black and melancholy. 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.180
 The coldest and darkest is the winter solstice on December 21 or 22. 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.090
 The sun only rises for an hour, emitting some faint light, and some places are at night. 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.610
 These people who have been taken away from the sun invented magic to visit them and make them comfortable with gifts and blessings. 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.430
 These magical spells include elves, gods, goats, etc., two of which have a special impact on modern stories. 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.930
 The first one is St Nick in the Netherlands. St. Nick is very thin and even harsh. 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.370
 But the gift will still be brought to the children in early December. He is red and white, 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.850
 Holding a staff, like a bishop. His mount is a horse called Amerigo, and the children of the Netherlands will leave carrots for it. 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.870
 Saint Nick is called Sinterklaas in Dutch. 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.550
 The second place is England's Father Christmas. Christmas dad is a big man, 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.680
 Wearing a funny pagan green dress with a sacred corolla on top. 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.190
 Traditionally, he is not very close to children and gifts, and has more to do with food, wine and celebrations. 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.140
 Perhaps the most well-known is this: he is one of the three ghosts of Christmas that threaten the miser. 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.030
 After Europe began to colonize, St. Nick, Christmas Dad and other magical geniuses gradually merged. 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.120
 This explains why the US version has many of these names. Santa Claus is Americanized Sinterklaas. 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.070
 But he is also known as Saint Nick, Christmas Dad and Kris Kringle from Germany. 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.570
 Different spells in the old days have become the same in the new world over time. 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.560
 Just like other ancient legends. 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.780
 For example, the New York poem "Christmas Eve", which appeared in 1823. 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.460
 It laid the tradition of Santa Claus landing from the roof and filling up socks with toys. 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.100
 However, this Santa Claus is an elf, just like other Santa Claus from Northern Europe. He is very small, 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.570
 Driving a small reindeer sleigh - this makes sense. 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.820
 After all, his work included drilling into the chimney. 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.150
 In addition, Santa did not appear in the poem. The original name of the poem was called "The Visit of St. Nick." 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.150
 In the 19th century, the fat old Santa became a standard among American writers. 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.810
 In the United States, he not only got the power of the elves but also got his wife. 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.680
 By the 20th century, Santa became the iconic image of the present. It is worth mentioning that, 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.500
 Contrary to what is generally believed, Coca-Cola did not package Santa Claus into the logo of the company. 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.369
 Instead, in 1931, the red and white Santa Claus was used directly in the off-season to promote drinks. 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.340
 Although I didn’t shoot a full range of gift ads for Santa Claus, 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.739
 Coca-Cola may indeed have brought the only true Santa as a brand into the minds of thousands of people. 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.739
 It has made Santa Claus take root in many countries where there is no winter gift tradition. 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.150
 Santa Claus in the United States in turn affected his relatives in Northern Europe. They always become more and more similar to their American relatives, 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.580
 No matter if the locals are happy. 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.120
 Especially in the UK, Christmas dad has completely turned into Santa Claus. 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.599
 So many British people don't even know that they have been different. 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.910
 However, in the Netherlands, St. Nick still managed to hold on to the fact that he was an independent magician. 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.540
 Regarding the modern Santa Claus, it is worth arguing, especially the details that deserve to be debated by various countries. 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.830
 Where does he live? 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.629
 At the end of the century, his home was located in the northern pole of the aurora. 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.310
 Although this is the best choice from a diplomatic point of view, but since then 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.670
 The North magnetic pole slipped into the ocean from the Arctic ice sheet. That is not a good place to open a toy factory. 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.090
 Therefore, Canada claims that his toy workshop is located somewhere in Nunavut and gave Santa a zip code. 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.819
 And - no joke - Canadian legal citizenship. 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.230
 The American response is that the Arctic does not refer to the obvious uninhabitable ice sheet. 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.230
 It refers to the border town of the Arctic, Alaska. 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.510
 Denmark claims that Santa Claus lives in their former colony, Greenland. Greenland did not agree with it surprisingly. 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.980
 The Nordic countries are arguing about the exact location of Santa Claus, but Finland 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.120
 With Rovaniemi in the Arctic Circle, it is obviously more advantageous. 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.500
 If you need evidence, you can actually visit Santa, as well as elves, toys, reindeer and post office. 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.410
 This makes the Finnish statement seem invulnerable. Santa can be seen even during the non-Christmas season. 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.239
 However, no matter where his base is, Santa always has the means to travel around the world overnight. 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:36.239
 And send out all the gifts... and eat all the cookies.
