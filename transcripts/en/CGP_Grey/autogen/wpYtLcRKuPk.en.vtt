00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.110
Hello, Internet.

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.130
A lot of you sent me this image making the
rounds which concerns the Mayan prediction

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.700
that the world will end on December 21, 2012.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.599
The claim is that the Mayan calendar short
counted the years because they forgot about

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.969
leap days so the world should have already
ended.

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.959
This is followed by Mind = Blown, which I'm
not sure how to take.

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:18.500
Do people think that the world forgot to have
its apocalypse or that were it not for leap

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.500
days that we'd already be living in the future?

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.740
Either way, it's spawned many an argument
that people ask me to explain, which I'm happy

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.340
to do, because my next big video was delayed
by pestilence, which struck me down into the

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.750
depths of unproductive misery for the last
few weeks.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.090
So, if you haven't already, please watch the
related videos now as otherwise this won't

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.980
make a whole lot of sense and there are a
few corrections I'd like to make.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.980
The first of these is that I shouldn't have
called the Mayans "Mayans".

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.080
Maya is the correct singular and plural noun
to use in the same way that sheep is both

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.550
singular and plural.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.600
Mayan is the name of the language and the
adjective form of the word as in the Mayan

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.600
civilization.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.760
Secondly, I showed a picture of the Aztec
calendar stone, rather than a Mayan calendar

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.440
in my 2012 video, which at the time I thought
was okay because the Aztec calendar is the

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.149
same as the Mayan, just with different names,
sort of like the Greek and Roman Gods.

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.790
And, frankly, the Aztec one is much cooler
looking.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.220
But I was still wrong to show it because despite
naming it the Aztec calendar stone, archeologists

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.950
don't actually think it's a calendar.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.890
And, speaking of stone, I used the term Stone
Age to describe the Maya which made many people

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.890
very angry.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.500
For clarity, Stone Age does not mean stupid,
it's the technological classification of a

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.710
civilization limited to stone tools.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.950
Advanced though their astronomy and mathematics
were, the Maya never discovered metallurgy

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.680
and thus couldn't move on to the Bronze Age
then the Iron Age then the Diamond Age.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.680
Right.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.680
Enough corrections.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.531
It's explanation time for this image which
raised three questions: 1) Does the Mayan

00:01:29.531 --> 00:01:30.590
calendar have leap days?

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.580
2) Did the Maya miscount the years, 3) Should
the world have already ended?

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.380
The answer to all of these is, no.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.590
To briefly recap, leap years exist to stop
seasons from drifting out of sync with the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.810
calendar, a problem that vexed Pope Gregory
because every year Easter and spring were

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.280
getting further apart.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.610
To fix this, he introduced the modestly named
Gregorian calendar with its fancy leap year

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.990
rules to keep the seasons and thus the holidays
together.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.479
But, while Pope Gregory cared about the seasons,
the ancient Maya did not.

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.770
Presumably because where they lived the weather
comes in only one season, too hot and too

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.770
humid.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.721
So the Mayan calendar ignores seasons in favor
of accurately tracking the days since the

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:03.380
creation of the Mayan religion.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.880
This renders leaps years an unnecessary complication.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.170
Though the Mayan calendar is no stranger to
complication with its cycles within cycles

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.670
within cycles within cycles within cycles
that, if you're interested, Hank Green can

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.340
tell you much more about.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.540
But back to the miscounting claims which comes
from our idea that leap days are extra days

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.160
which, of course, they really aren't.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.480
The Gregorian calendar doesn't give people
extra days any more than daylight saving time

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.060
gives people extra sunlight.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.750
If you transported Pope Gregory 1,000 years
back in time to meet the Mayan Lady Xoc and

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.930
then made them count the days until this year's
winter solstice, they'd agree on that number

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.430
because they're just counting sunrises.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.620
It's not like Pope Gregory with his clever
modern calendar would notice 500+ days that

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.370
the Lady Xoc somehow missed, perhaps while
distracted by the pain from her thorns through

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.480
the tongue routine.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.470
The only thing that they would disagree on
is what to call that day with Pope Gregory

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.750
insisting on December 21, 2012 and Lady Xoc
preferring the 13th Baktun.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.090
So, this image is wrong because it's an apples
to oranges comparison.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.900
The Mayan calendar doesn't have leap days
because it doesn't need them.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.130
It counts days just fine and its long cycle
will finish on December 21, 2012, but the

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.310
world will still go on.
