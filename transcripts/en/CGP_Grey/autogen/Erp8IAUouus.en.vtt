00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.680
 Americans love their independence. 

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.040
 A nation of pioneers who live away from the watchful eye of the government. 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.900
 (except for all government). 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.620
 For example, unlike other countries, Americans do not have a national ID card ... 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.860
 ... and even the idea of ​​making one is every election a popular topic. 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.740
 The result is always the same: "We don't need no ID card." 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.240
 But strangely enough, US citizens have this: 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.480
 a card with a unique number that many places will ask for as proof of who you are. 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.000
 This is the "Social Security" card and number ... 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.040
 ... and it has become, as it were, an ID / unique password to identify citizens ... 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.620
 ... but that was never what it was intended for. 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.520
 For Americans it is extremely important to keep this number secret, 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.940
 because it is the key for the government and for banks to identify you as you ... 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.240
 ... and losing control of it is the worst form of identity theft that can happen. 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.880
 So how did Americans end up with a national ID number ... 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.380
 ... that there is not one and a card is not suitable for identification? 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.200
 It all started in the great Depression of long, long ago ... 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.660
 ... when the government made the social security program; ... 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.200
 ... a kind of compulsory pension: 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.700
 Citizens are required to pay during the period in which they work ... 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.920
 ... and take money from them when they retire. 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.620
 The idea is that even when you have not saved from the past ... 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.020
 for the later years of future-you, the ultimately old, current you ... 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.020
 ... still has something to live on. 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.020
 To think that social security is a benefit that the government gives you ... 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.720
 ... or that it is a bank account that is yours ... 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.500
 ... is ... controversial, but anyway, this song was made ... 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.280
 ... to keep track of what you put in and what you get out of it. 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.340
 Well, because it's just a government program, related to the period that you work, ... 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.760
 ... you only had to request a card when you actually started working. 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.860
 But over time that has changed and the younger you are, ... 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.000
 ... the more likely it is that you will have one from the moment you were born, ... 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.740
 ... despite the uselessness of babies as child laborers. 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.460
 So why? 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.800
 It comes back to Americans who do not have a national identity card with a national number, ... 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.980
 ... which makes it more difficult for institutions to keep an eye on people's lives. 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.680
 With a hundred million citizens, 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.340
 names and birthdays that are not unique, 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.120
 people move, people get married, people change their names .. 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.080
 And if you try to keep track of everyone, ... 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.600
 ... as the tax authorities of the United States would like to do ... 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.940
 ... that can be a big problem, especially in the days before the computer. 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.400
 "Hey, wait a minute. Look at * this * number that just lies here," 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.540
 said the tax authorities. 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.540
 "It is not intended to be used as an ID number," 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.740
 Said the social security department. 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.960
 "" There are security reasons why you don't-- " 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.460
 "Yoink!" 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.140
 For example, the tax authorities have made useful use of the work done by the social security department; ... 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.060
 ... link all working adults to a number, ... 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.240
 ... which made tax tracking easier ... 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.000
 ... and she strongly encouraged parents to take a number ... 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.220
 ... for their children, by applying a tax reduction. 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.580
 Strangely enough, counting children for tax credits used trust, ... 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.340
 The US tax authorities said to the people: 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.720
 1. We will give you a discount on your tax for every child you have. And: 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.440
 2. Write down how many children you have ... 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.080
 please be honest; we have no way of checking it. 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.920
 What people just ask, no, beg to lie. 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.920
 Whatever they did, give birth to millions of ghost children on paper. 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.000
 But after every child was forced to have a number linked to a birth certificate ... 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.640
 ... before the parents could get their tax credit, ... 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.200
 all these ghosts have been swept away. 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.700
 This changed the number to a unique number ... 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.760
 ... that all citizens had it right from the start, 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.700
 And that made it easy for a lot of other places, ... 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.340
 ... such as banks and schools and companies and landlords ... 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.800
 ... to also use the number as an easy way ... 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.540
 ... to keep an eye on people, without creating their own system, ... 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.140
 ... and to make it possible to share information about people between two institutes. 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.180
 This is extremely useful for institutions, so ... 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.120
 ... the desire of Americans not to have a national identity card led ... 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.420
 ... somewhat inevitable, ... 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.700
 ... to use the most similar thing available as a replacement ... 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.520
 ... which was even worse, because the social security number ... 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.660
 ... was never designed to be used that way in the distant past. 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.160
 You can see that because there is no security in it. 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.700
 There is a handy trick that most ID numbers use ... 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.380
 ... where they can check themselves if they are invalid. 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.920
 The simplest way is to make the sum of the rest by the last few digits. 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.400
 A lot of different ID cards and barcodes do this, because it makes it impossible ... 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.400
 ... entering incorrect numbers in a computer ... 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.480
 ... and makes it harder for fraudsters to guess correct numbers. 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.420
 This is how when you try to buy something online by ... 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.420
 ... guess a credit card number, the website knows it is incorrect ... 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.400
 ... before you click on 'buy'. 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.820
 But because the social security number is his life ... 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.260
 ... started a long time ago, it's just a number ... 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.980
 ... without a built-in, self-checking protection 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.920
 In fact, if you were born before 2011, it's not that hard to guess the number: 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.980
 The first three numbers are the state where the parent applied for the card ... 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:34.640
 ... and the last four numbers is one added, and the middle numbers follow a normal pattern. 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.120
 So you can take your number, subtract one and that is a valid number ... 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.900
 ... from someone who was probably born in the same hospital as you ... 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.260
 ... at about the same time. 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.140
 In other words, a fraudster who knows the time and location of your birth, ... 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.820
 ... can probably look up the first five numbers in a table. 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.420
 Institutes ask for the last four numbers to identify you as you ... 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.980
 ... which means that it is not too difficult to put together your number ... 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.700
 ... after a security leak somewhere or after connecting a number of puzzle pieces. 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.700
 The physical map also does not help: 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.340
 Literally a piece of cardboard, depending on when it was issued, not even laminated. 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.960
 The social security department wrote ... 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.160
 ... "Not to be used as identification" on the cards ... 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.440
 ... as a useless attempt to stop institutions from asking for the cards as IDs, ... 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.180
 ... because there is nothing on the card that can identify a person, ... 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.360
 ... but in the end they gave up and deleted these words, ... 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.960
 ... because, as opposed to passports or driving licenses, ... 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.220
 ... you can assume that all Americans have this one card. 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.960
 All this means that your social security card and number ... 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.120
 ... probably have worse security than your library card, ... 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.540
 ... while it is many times more important. 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.000
 It is unsuitable as a secure number, ... 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.160
 it is unsuitable as a good identity card, ... 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.480
 ... but it is at least universal *, which is why people use it. 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.020
 Oh hello, little star, my old friend. 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.940
 No of course not. This program is actually not universal: 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.280
 Not everyone has a social security number ... 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.440
 ... and not everyone contributes to the program. 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.640
 If you do not want to pay, all you have to do is: 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.640
 One: Never received social security benefits ... 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.640
 ... and give up all your rights to having it in the future. 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.840
 What looks fair. You must also: 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.760
 Being a member of a religion opposite to the idea of ​​social security. 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.540
 Normally because it is a type of insurance and an insurance is a type of gambling. 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.700
 That is harder, but you can also ... 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.500
 ... start your own religion, if you take tax avoidance very seriously. 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.500
 But your own religion must then: 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.900
 Taking care of his elderly and dependent members, ... 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.180
 ... which means that you have to copy a social security program or something similar for your religion. 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.920
 (while you are also against the idea of ​​social security) 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.380
 And if creating a contradictory religion doesn't scare you ... 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.860
 Finally, it must have existed in one piece since 1950. 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.200
 Which indicates that this exception was exclusively written ... 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.360
 ... for the Amish and Mennonites and destroys your plans, ... 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.900
 ... unless you want to undergo a substantial lifestyle change. 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.180
 It doesn't stop there: 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.620
 Keep searching and you will find several other very strange exceptions, ... 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.700
 ... including some railroad workers or firefighters or police or teachers (but only in Chicago). 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.860
 Normally these are groups that long ago ... 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.440
 ... were given the opportunity to exit the program when it was created. 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.440
 So nothing is obvious. 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.140
 And that's how it is with this social security card: 

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.900
 Contains a national number for citizens who do not want one, ... 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.680
 ... on an identity card that is not suitable for identification, ... 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.960
 ... given to all citizens - except when it is not ... 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.980
 ... for a universal program, except when it is not. 

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.360
