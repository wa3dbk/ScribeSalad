Speaker 1:          00:00          I'm making this video to say hi to my viewers and listeners in China and also to wish them happy new year. I was prompted to do so by Ms Dot Mangee, a Chinese students studying in Germany who has worked diligently to translate and subtitle a number of my videos. I've placed links to those in the description of this video. Mangy has also organized a number of people to work on the translations. They have a group on Weebo, which I have linked to in the description. Thanks mangy. Much appreciated. I would also like to announce that my new book, 12 rules for life will be translated into Chinese and published by Beijing cheers books. I don't know the publication date yet, but I will let everyone know as soon as I do. Links to the publisher are also in the description. I am extremely pleased to hear that my lectures are finding an audience in China and happy new year to everyone there. Bye for now.
