Speaker 1:          00:32          Neat. You talking about the European state of mind at the end of the 19th century. So Nisha says, well we're in this terrible situation, right? God is dead. We've killed them. What does that mean? While we've taken our evolved metaphysics, which structures are moral viewpoint and undermined by rational criticism, a peculiar move, Toma softly cause it was never established on rational grounds. Anyways, we've undermined it rationally and replaced it with well nothing, nothing. What's the consequences that, well he outlines that here of what is great. One must either be silent or speak with greatness and you can think about this as a prophecy on the events of World War One and World War II and the Gulag archipelago and the 60 million people dead in the Soviet Union and the whole unfolding of 20th century history and the great ideological battles that characterize that unfolding. So this is something nature sees coming and knows was why he says of what is great.

Speaker 1:          01:33          One must either be silent or speak with greatness, with greatness. So that means cynically I'm with innocence. What I related to the history of the next two centuries. I describe what is coming, what can no longer come differently? The advent of nihilism, right? The belief and nothing. Our whole European culture is moving for some time now with a tortured tension that's growing from decade to decade, I was towards a catastrophe restlessly violently headlong like a river that wants to reach the end that no longer reflects. It's afraid to reflect. He that speaks here has conversely done nothing so far, but to reflect as a philosopher and solitary by instinct who is found his advantage and standing aside outside. Why is the advent of nihilism become necessary? Because the values we've had hitherto thus draw their final consequence because nihilism represents the ultimate logical conclusion of our great values and ideals.

Speaker 1:          02:33          Because we must experience nihilism before we can find out what value these values really had. We require at some sometime new values. Nihilism stands at the door when it comes this uncanny, first of all, guests nihilism, right? Your beliefs or undermined once. What's the consequence of that? Well, one consequences. The belief has undermined the other consequences. More metaphysical, which is fooled once you no longer have the belief. But maybe it's even worse than that because human beings can generalize, fooled once you never have any, you no longer have any belief in beliefs, which mean you say something like this, I don't care what you think. It doesn't matter what you think. The world is such a terrible place that no interpretation whatsoever can possibly suffice. That's nihilism. No meaning system whatsoever can possibly suffice. Well, what's the flaw or the flyers? Well, of course, no system of coherent belief can suffice because most of the world's transcendent, you can't encapsulate everything that is in your sphere of belief.

Speaker 1:          03:42          And what you might say then is that if you ever believe that what you believe is what should support you, the facts, you know, say, or the interpretation you place in the world, then your faith is badly misplaced. You don't believe in what you believe. You believe in something that's deeper than that. And so then you see what's wrong with Tolstoy, right? And tolstoy story. And tolstoy says, uh, accounting for his collapse in the stability of Christian belief. He said, this all happened, this collapse of my belief when I was not yet 50 years old, I should have been considered a completely happy man. I had a good loving and beloved wife find children and the largest state growing and expanding without any effort on my part. I was respected by friends and acquaintances, praised by strangers and could claim a certain renown. I was not physically nor mentally unhealthy.

Speaker 1:          04:35          On the contrary, I enjoyed a physical and mental vigor. I had rarely encountered among others my age. I could keep up with a peasant's working in the fields and work eight and 10 hours at a stretch without suffering any after effects from the stream and in such a state of affairs. I came to a point where I could not live and even though I fear death, I had to employ ruses against myself to keep from committing suicide. It was as though I had lived a little wondered a little until I came to a precipice and I clearly saw that there was nothing ahead except room and there was no stopping or turning back. No closing my eyes so that I would not see that there was nothing ahead except the deception of life and of happiness and of the reality of suffering and death of complete annihilation.

Speaker 1:          05:19          I grew sick of life. Some irresistible force was leading me to somehow get rid of it. This thought was such a temptation that I had to use counting against myself in order to not to go through with it. And there I was, a fortunate man carrying a rope from my room where I was alone every night as I addressed so that I would not hang myself from the beam between the closets and I quit going hunting with a gun so that I would not be too easily tempted to rid myself of life. I myself did not know what I wanted. It was afraid of life. I struggled to get rid of it, yet I hope for something from it. My position was terrible. I knew that I could find nothing in the way of rational knowledge except denial of life and in faith I could find nothing except the denial of reason. And for me this was even more impossible than a denial of life. I myself according to rational knowledge at followed that life is evil and people know it. I describe my spiritual condition of myself in this way.

Speaker 2:          06:15          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:16          My life has some kind of stupid and evil practical joke that someone is playing on me in spite of the fact that I did not acknowledge the existence of any someone who might've created me. The notion that someone brought me into the world as a stupid and evil joke seem to be the most natural way to describe my condition.

Speaker 2:          06:33          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:34          I could not be deceived. All is vanity. Happy is he was never been born. Death is better than life. We must rid ourselves of life. Having realized all the stupidity of the joke that is being played on us and seeing that the blessings of the dead are greater than those are the living and that it's better not to exist. The strong act and put an end to this stupid joke and they use any means of doing it. A rope around the neck, water, a knife in the heart or a train. Now, the interesting thing about this, I think is first of all, a Russian wrote it and second of all, it was written in the late 19 hundreds and even more particularly is that you note that when the strong act using a rope around the neck, water, a knife in the heart and a train, well tolstoy is talking about suicide, but there's no necessary reason to presume that this should only be violence and gender against the self, right? If life is a stupid and evil joke, then what's stopping you from benevolently putting an end to the suffering of others, right? Benevolently in theory at least.

Speaker 1:          07:40          Well, you know, that's one perspective, right? But then there's always the perspective of the lady who went to see the psychiatrist in ts Elliot's poem, which is, well, if when your eyes are open, life appears as nothing but suffering and pain to you. It could be that that is how life is. But it can also be that there's something wrong with the way that you're looking at the world. And in some ways that's a much more humble perspective, right? Because the alternative the as well, I know what's going on and I just look out there and there's the world and I'm pretty much got it. Like I know what it means and what it means is pointless suffering and pain and that's my model and I don't see any reason to question it, but then the alternative is, well, wait a second. There's always the possibility that I don't know absolutely everything and this final and horrible judgment that I'm placing on the conditions of existence could conceivably be misplaced given the sort of presumptuousness of the claim. Right. I'm in a position to render final judgment on the moral value of existence as such. It seems to me

Speaker 1:          08:44          reasonable to presume that that's not the kind of statement that you should easily make. Can I remember when George Bush launched his most recent war? The initial terminology, I think this was for the Afghanistan battle was operation infinite justice, but he retracted that phrase after a number of religious leaders objected to. It's kind of presumptuousness, which I thought was quite reasonable because infinite justice is something that most people should probably not hope for, right? Because you never know precisely what infinite justice means because it might just mean that every bloodied mistake you've ever made, you're going to pay for. And I suppose that would be just as applicable to George W. Bush as it would to anybody else. And then Milton again describes the development of this adversarial spirit. He says, first pride, pride, and worse ambition threw me down. That's Satan's lament when he's in hell. And Milton's description of hell is extremely interesting.

Speaker 1:          09:44          He said, the reason that hell is characterized by its structure is not so much because of its nature. Precisely. It's because of its distance from the good. So the farther you are away say from what constitutes the good, the more suffering is the more suffering is endemic to that state. So it's, it's the distance away from something that constitutes the suffering. And then Melton says, it's very interesting to do an analysis of Satan's character and the notion of hell per say, because how in the world can you reconcile the idea of a good God with the notion of this continual suffering? And so Milton says, well, Satan can step out of hell in one moment. All he has to do is meant that he was wrong. And that's the one thing that he will not do under any circumstances whatsoever. So then we put one more twist on the story and we say something like this.

Speaker 1:          10:31          Okay, we already know that part of the reason that people have belief systems is so that they can structure their interactions with the world. It's a toolbox. Say we're playing a game, we share the rules, that's fine. We can cooperate with one another. It could be other than it is, but it's the way it is and it works for us. That's fine. There's nothing absolute about it except that a structure like that's necessary. Now whenever there's a threat to that shared view of the world, well then we're afraid and for good reason. And, and it's not surprising under those circumstances that we fight to defend what we've made ours. But then you say, let's say you adopt this perspective, right? And it's this vengeful desire to wreak havoc that extends beyond other individuals and beyond society. Even to the structure of experience as such. And then you think, well, what's the best mask for that?

Speaker 1:          11:22          And how do these two processes sort of interact? And you think, well, the most efficient way to do terrible things is to mask them with the highest order morality. And that's precisely what the totalitarian does. So that way he gets to have his cake and eat it too. He's perfectly well protected from apprehension of the world because his belief system is complaint plus these underground motivations, which is this constant desire for revenge, can find their expression within the totalitarian structure and remain invisible even to himself. So he can say to himself, well, the reason I threw all those farmers out of their house in 1920 I'm stalled. Their soup and their food and their grandmothers blankets and everything they'd work to own was because I was building the socialist paradise. Right. And it was a good thing for me to go into that house and not a bad thing. And as long as he believes that or acts as if he believes that, then he can look in the mirror without screaming. And there's no recognition whatsoever of precisely the sort of game that he's involved in. So he has it both ways, right? He can do everything terrible that he always dreams of doing and consider himself not only good but good, even at a higher level then the people that he was actually afflicting. And of course, that's just standard description of what happened in the Soviet Union.

Speaker 1:          12:48          He just says, I love this definition of morality is the most cynical thing niche ever said. I think the idiosyncrasy of decadence with the ulterior motive of revenging oneself against life successfully, I attach value to this definition said, well, why are you an idiot log? Well, it's a good way to simplify the world, right? It's a procrustean bed. You just chop off everything that doesn't fit, then you don't have to think, right? So that's good because thinking is difficult and it's trouble. Someone, it takes courage and so forth to transform chaos into order is no trivial matter. And if it's all ordered for you, well then there's really nothing left for you to do. But then need, she goes even below that, he says, yeah, well there's more to the story than that, isn't there? It's like once he got this little procrustean bed all arranged for your enemies, then you can, you can allow your most base vengeful instincts, full flow by just continually chopping people. So they fit and you do it all the while by well saying, wow, it's obviously the best thing that could possibly be done.

Speaker 3:          13:55          Okay.

Speaker 1:          13:59          And so then you look at Stellan say, because not everybody who's adopted a vantage full tack on existence, it's sort of like the archetype of vengefulness or adversarial spirit. But he had to get now and then the people like stolen, who are good counter example say to the people like Gandhi and so stones, very instructive. And so we could start by looking at what he did in the Ukraine. So at the end of 1929 the Kremlin decree that millions of peasants from individually owned farms would be forced into agricultural collectives or cold causes seen in the eyes of the politburo as pliant providers of Soviet agricultural needs in defiance of the facts. So they did the Ologists, hammered out inappropriate Marxist terminology to explain what was going on throughout grain producing areas. It was sad.

Speaker 3:          14:48          Okay.

Speaker 1:          14:48          Resistance to this scientific scheme was being by so called rich peasants are cool acts with his customer of brutality. Therefore stellan decreed the liquidation of the cooler acts as a class we'll stand in like this idea of like group guilt. That was a major theme for Stalin that man I really didn't have to ever pay attention to you as an individual. I could just decide if you were a doctor engineer or a Kulak or a German or whatever ethnic racial or educational division happened to characterize my particular target at the time and it didn't matter if you were guilty as an individual. That whole notion never even obtained. It was class guilt. It mattered and if you were in one of those classes as well, we are better without you and of course the nature of the class just changed constantly, but it was perfectly logical thing to think if you believed in like historical determinism.

Speaker 1:          15:35          If your parents were rich version law, what was the probability that you are going to be a useful part of the workers' collective bs? You're just to get rid of you ahead of time so you didn't cause too much trouble. So then you think about these kulaks rich peasants. Well who are these people like when we get down to the individual level. So you go on village village was full of surfs like not 40 years before. So these are people just struggling out of the feudal society, right? And you got some people in there who've managed to be successful enough as farmers, which is no easy thing to like have a house and maybe hire one person and you know, maybe have a little extra food in a larder and a few kind of material possessions. So these are successful people. And so you could say, well they're the ones that actually knew how to farm to one theory.

Speaker 1:          16:21          Or You could say the reason they had all this stuff was cause they stoled it from all the other people, right? And then you think, okay, so I marched into town. I'm a Soviet revolutionary and I say, hey guys, you know those rich people, they stoled everything they have from you. And then you think, okay, which of you guys is going to listen to that? Well, it's not going to be the sort of struggling people just underneath them who are really trying to get ahead, right? Because that's where they're hoping to get. It's going to be. They're resentful and revengeful few who think, well, the world is fundamentally unfair and it's obvious that those sons of bitches got what they want by stealing it from me. And here it turns out that if I just go down the street and steal it back, well not only, not only am I allowed to do that, but according to this new and emergent ideology, man, that's the best thing I could possibly do.

Speaker 1:          17:08          So then multiply that story by several million participants and you have like the first five years of the Soviet Empire. And so what do we have there? The result was a catastrophic onslaught on millions of peasant households at first party activists and local officials read bullies, right? Brutalized hesitance, forcing them to surrender their homesteads and their possessions, deportations, arrests, and killing soon followed as terror, generalized the violence mounted to full scale rebellion in various places with regular troops engaged for months. For example, suppressing peasant uprisings resistance took various forms, usually reflecting the hopeless desperate anguish of a population in the Ukraine. There were even women's rebellions, spontaneous uprisings of peasant women who attack the local Coco's is Tibet demand. The return of confiscated farm products with a colossal impact on the Soviet economy. Peasants slaughtered their animals by the millions rather than see them seized for two years.

Speaker 1:          18:10          The fighting raged as the dreadful process of deep cooler conization continued Stella in order to further assault on the recalcitrant peasantry what conquest calls the terror famine of 1932 Moscow rights conquest. It's from a book called the harvest of sorrow. Knowingly decreed grain poker procurements from Ukraine and elsewhere exceeding by far with the local population could produce right, which meant that everyone who lived there was forced in ordered to deliver more grain than they had ever grown. Communists Brigades roam the countryside, forcing agriculturalist to discourage the little they had been able to produce under conditions of severe dislocation. Grain sat unused in state reserves while the local population starved.

Speaker 1:          18:59          This is from wisdom park riffle. Biblical writings before they reasoned unsoundly saying to themselves short and Sora for all is our life and there is no remedy when a man comes to his end and no one has been known to return from Haiti's because we were born by mere chance and hereafter we shall be as though we had never been because the breath in our nostrils is smoke and reason a spark kindled by the beating of our hearts. When it is extinguished, the body will turn to ashes and the spirit will dissolve like empty air. Our Name will be forgotten in time and no one will remember our works. Our life will pass away like the traces of a cloud and be scattered like mist that is chased by the rays of the sun and overcome by its heat for our allotted time is the passing of the shadow.

Speaker 1:          19:46          And there no return from our death because it is sealed up and no one turns back. So a piece of writing thousands of years old. And so Nisha says at the end of the 19 hundreds well, rationality undermines our faith and religion, but you have a piece of writing from more than 2000 years ago that says, look, what is it about being alive? It's short and there's nothing to it, right? Our thoughts are biologically produced and when we die, there's nothing left. Well, that's a very modern thought. Yep. It was expressed thousands of years ago. So you know, I think merely from observing that, that the crisis of faith that characterizes modern society is a reflection of the permanent crisis of faith that characterizes human beings. What's happening with the totalitarian, while the totalitarian is afraid of the unknown for good, for good reason. I mean, and he's very interested in sustaining his own belief structure.

Speaker 1:          20:42          And the combination of those two things, it can start off trivially is that the more convinced that you have to maintain the stability of your current belief structure, the more afraid you are of going to have anything that's unknown and the more afraid you are of anything that's unknown, the less likely you are to go out and explore it. And then the less likely you already go out and explore it, the weaker you get cause you start gathering information and then the week or you get the more necessary it is that you have to have this frame of reference in, it has to remain intact and this sort of thing starts to cycle and cycle. So you undermine your own sense of your own autonomy and ability and you make yourself more and more a rigid tool of the propagandistic system and you're more and more adopt the stance of enmity towards anything you don't understand.

Speaker 1:          21:28          And that's a spiral that goes rapidly downhill right rapidly into a state. It's characterized by complete internal chaos. And I think that's a good definition of what is meant in metaphysical language by hell. Hell is a bottomless pit. Why? Well, I don't care how bad things are for you or around you. There's always some bloody thing you could do to make it worse, right? There's always some suffering. You can extend others. There's always some bit of stubbornness or rejection that you can pull off that'll make your already terrible situation worse, right? So there's no bottom, and that seems to me to be right. If he, if you do just a cursory historical analysis, no matter what terrible account you can come across with regards to say, concentration, camp brutality in some other book, there's some worst story, right? Limited only by the absolute, the absolute ends of the most brutal form of imagination. All a consequence, I think of this process, right? And you can't really say what causes it because on the one hand there's cowardice and lack of faith, right? Anything I don't understand powered his pride in lack of faith, anything I don't understand doesn't exist. Plus I'm not the person to confront it anyways, right? That's the lack of faith. Each of those things feeds into the other and it's very difficult to say where it starts.

Speaker 2:          22:48          Ooh.

Speaker 1:          22:50          The thing that's kind of interesting about the self referential processes is that they don't have to start dramatically. Like the loop can start very, very small and it picks up speed very, very rapidly. So you imagine you're speaking into a tape recorder and the speakers on you get too close to the speaker with the microphone and you get some feedback. And if you bring the microphone a little closer, the feedback develops more and more intensely. It can blow up. The whole system doesn't have to start dramatically to move forward very, very rapidly. And what that means, at least in principle, is that even small mistakes anywhere along this circle can start the development of precisely this kind of spiral. And so you'll say, well, people do, people need to be abused to become totalitarian. Well, and the answer to that is no, because everyone's been abused sufficiently by Samo currencies in their life to justify taking negative tack on the nature of experience.

Speaker 1:          23:47          They say, well, how cowardly do you have to be in order to run away from things? And you think, well, not that cowardly because under most circumstances your life is characterized by sins of omission, right? It's, there are things you left on done and like how just exactly how rigid do you want your belief systems to be? And you say, well, I like them to be stable because without that stability, then I'm terrified. And then you can say, well, fair enough, but that's all a sign of a kind of existential weakness. And then if social circumstances come around and give your life a good tweak, say like they did with the Germans prior to World War II, you just never know what side you're going to end up on. And so all these little tiny mistakes, you know, mistakes that I think are marked by your own conscious are precisely that leads you down this terrible path.

Speaker 1:          24:33          And if you think, well, no, that can't be right. Well then you have to remember that in these processes, say of d Kula causation and that immense wave of desks that characterize the Soviet Union. And the Nazi Germany, most people were involved and if they weren't involved, indirect acts of commission, they were absolutely involved in direct acts of omission, right? They knew, but they didn't say anything. Well, classically sins of commission or regarded as much more evil say than sins of omission. But I actually think that's backwards. The sins of omission are worse because every time you walk away and what do you do when you walk away from a Nazi? What are you walking away from? Well, we know what you're walking away from, right? If you're walking away from a domain that's likely to expand into something that's completely undifferentiatable from hell and it's no wonder you'd walk away from that, but the fact that you walk away from it makes it much more likely that it's going to happen.

Speaker 3:          25:35          Okay,

Speaker 1:          25:36          so then I think to end this, something like this,

Speaker 3:          25:40          okay,

Speaker 1:          25:41          we look for economic reasons to explain great, terrible acts, right? We look for social reasons, we look for political reasons, but we have niches, observation, which is something like this. I don't care whether or not your life's been characterized by suffering and deprivation. The mere fact of suffering and deprivation does not allow you to draw a particular conclusion. You can't say that there's a causal path between economic deprivation say, and the rise of a totalitarian state because any events susceptible to multiple interpretations. Well, how do these states come about? Well, I think, well, we look for political and economic and social reasons because that's the easiest place to look, right? If you ratchet up the level of description to social forces that are beyond your control, then you never have to worry about what it is that you're doing or not doing this actually causing this sort of thing.

Speaker 1:          26:29          But I think if you look at the historical record, especially if you look at it from a mythological perspective, the stories basically clear and it, it goes something like this. Every time you make a mistake that you know is a mistake and you don't fix it, the world moves more towards that. And it might be trivial maybe, but it might not be. So you look at Adolf Eichmann, for example, who is the little bureaucrat who planned the final solution and you find out he's just your little ratty guy, right? You see him in a bar. You don't even notice him. He's a negligible nobody. But he's the guy who planned the final solution. He was a normal person. I mean, maybe even slightly less than normal, right? He was no monster. He wasn't the sort of person you'd remark on if you saw him. Precisely the opposite. Invisible, quiet, unassuming, presuming. No doubt that at least until he was arrested that he was just doing what he was told. And that was just fine.
