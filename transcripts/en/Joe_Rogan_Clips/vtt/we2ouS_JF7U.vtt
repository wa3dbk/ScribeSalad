1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690
So let,
let,
let,
let me ask you,
um,
the rules you have are not based in US law,

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.450
right?
US law doesn't recognize restrictions on hate speech.

3
00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:07.410
It's considered free speech.

4
00:00:07.411 --> 00:00:09.630
So if you want to stand on a street corner and yell the craziest things in the

5
00:00:09.631 --> 00:00:12.870
world,
you're allowed to on your platform,
Twitter,
you're not allowed to.

6
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.670
So even in that sense alone,
your rules do have an ideology behind them.

7
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.880
I don't completely disagree.
I think,
you know,
I don't want harassment.
Um,

8
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.170
but the reason I bring this up is getting into the discussion about democratic

9
00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:28.180
health of a nation.
So I think it's,

10
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.950
it can't be disputed at this point that Twitter is extremely powerful in

11
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:33.990
influencing elections.
You know,
I,

12
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.900
I'm pretty sure you guys published recently a bunch of tweets from foreign

13
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:38.730
actors that were trying to mettle in elections.

14
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.910
So even you as a company recognize that foreign entities are trying to

15
00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:44.450
manipulate people using this platform.
So I,
I,

16
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.140
there's a few things I want to ask beyond this,

17
00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:51.060
but if wouldn't it be important then to just as a,
at a certain point,

18
00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:54.900
Twitter becomes so powerful in influencing elections and giving access to even

19
00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:58.200
the president's tweets that you should allow people to use the platform based

20
00:00:58.201 --> 00:01:02.250
under the norms of US law,
First Amendment,
free speech,

21
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.480
the right to expression on the platform.
This is becoming too much,
uh,
of uh,

22
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.140
it's becoming too powerful and how our elections are,
are taking place.

23
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.290
So even if you are saying,
well,
hate speeches,

24
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.100
our role in a lot of people agree with that.
If at any 0.1 person disagrees,

25
00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:19.160
they're still an American who has a right to this,
you know,

26
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.280
to access to the public discourse and you've essentially monopolize that and not

27
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:24.750
completely,
but for the most part.

28
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.100
So isn't there some responsibility on you to guarantee at at a certain extent,

29
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.430
less regulation happen,
right?
Like,
look,
if you,

30
00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:35.340
if you recognize foreign governments are manipulating our elections,

31
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.880
then shouldn't you guarantee the right to an American to access this platform to

32
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:40.200
be involved in the electoral process?

33
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.980
<v 1>I'm not sure I see the,
the,
the tie between those things,</v>

34
00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:49.100
but I will address one of your points,
which was,
uh,
we're not,

35
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.930
we're a platform that serves the world.
So we're a global,
uh,

36
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.770
75% of the users of Twitter or outside of the United States.
Oh,
right,
right,

37
00:01:57.771 --> 00:01:59.700
right.
So we don't,
uh,

38
00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:04.040
apply laws of Jess one country when we're thinking about it and we think about,

39
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.550
um,

40
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.350
how do you have a global standard that can meet the threshold of as many

41
00:02:09.351 --> 00:02:12.380
countries as possible because we want all the people in the world to be able to

42
00:02:12.381 --> 00:02:13.730
participate in this conversation.

43
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.910
<v 0>Some elections like the Indian election coming up as well.
Right.
And I'm,
I'm,
I,</v>

44
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.710
my understanding is you were also accused of being biased against conservatives

45
00:02:20.711 --> 00:02:21.544
in India recently.

46
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.690
There was a report on that as well as you held up a sign that said something

47
00:02:25.691 --> 00:02:30.670
offensive about the Brahman [inaudible].
Yeah.
So in that sense,

48
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.350
even in other countries,

49
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.840
you're accused of the same things that you're being accused of by American

50
00:02:34.841 --> 00:02:36.080
conservatives.
Okay.

51
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.930
<v 1>I think there,
those situations are very,
very different.
Um,</v>

52
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.230
and I don't think that that the ideologies in play are the same at all.
Well,

53
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.410
so the,
the reason everyone,
can we clarify that?
[inaudible] I,

54
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.950
I'm not sure what you're talking about,

55
00:02:49.951 --> 00:02:53.910
but we did have our vice president public policy testified in front of Indian

56
00:02:53.911 --> 00:02:55.800
parliament a couple of weeks ago and he was,

57
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.860
they were really focused on election integrity and safety and abuse,
harassment

58
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.070
<v 0>of women in political figures in the likes.
So,
so my,
my,</v>

59
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.250
my concern I guess is I recognize your globe.

60
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.540
You're a company that serves the world,

61
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.100
but as an American I have a concern that the democracy I live in the Democratic

62
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.110
Republic,
I'm sorry,
in the democratic functions are healthy.

63
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.010
One of the biggest threats is,
you know,
Russia,
Iran,
Russia,
Iran,
China,

64
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:20.170
they're trying to meddle in our elections using your platform.

65
00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:23.110
And it's effective.
So much so that you've actually come out and removed money.

66
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:26.920
People,
you know,
Covington was apparently started by account base in Brazil.

67
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.371
You know,

68
00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:31.510
the Covington scandal where this fake news goes viral was reported by CNN.

69
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:33.040
That was,
it was a dummy account.

70
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:35.710
They were trying to prop it up and they were pushing out this out of context

71
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:38.740
information.
So they do this,
they use your platform to do it.

72
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.300
You've now got a platform that is so powerful in our American discourse that

73
00:03:44.771 --> 00:03:47.290
foreign governments are using it as weapons against us.

74
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.430
And you've taken a stance against the laws of the United States.

75
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.860
I don't mean like against like you're breaking the law.
I mean you,

76
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.070
you have rules that go beyond the scope of the u s which will restrict American

77
00:03:57.071 --> 00:03:59.080
citizens from being able to participate.
Meanwhile,

78
00:03:59.081 --> 00:04:02.080
foreign actors are free to do so,
so long as they play by your rules.

79
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.160
So our elections are being threatened by the fact that if there's an American

80
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:08.950
citizen who says,
I do not believe in your mis-gendering policy,

81
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.550
and you bend them,
that person has been removed from public discourse on Twitter.

82
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.970
Right?
But they don't get banned for saying they don't agree with it.

83
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.520
Getting him for sure specifically violating it by targeting an individual,

84
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.750
let's say in protest and individual repeatedly says,
no,

85
00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:25.960
I refuse to use your pronouns in like Megan Murphy's case.
And she's Canadian,

86
00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:27.130
so I don't want to use her specifically.

87
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.410
The point I'm trying to make is at a certain level,

88
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.980
there are going to be American citizens who have been removed from this public

89
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:35.050
discourse,
which has become so absurdly powerful.

90
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:38.380
Foreign governments weaponize it because you have different rules than the

91
00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:42.610
American country has.
Just to be clear,
my understanding,

92
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:44.260
and I'm not expert on all the platforms,

93
00:04:44.261 --> 00:04:45.820
is that foreign governments use multiple,

94
00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:50.410
multiple different ways to interfere in elections and not limited to our

95
00:04:50.411 --> 00:04:53.870
platform,
nor is that limited to social media.
But the president design Twitter,

96
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.300
right president is on a lot of different platforms as is the White House.
Uh,

97
00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.370
I think it's fair to point out the media coverage of his Twitter account is

98
00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:05.080
insane and they run a new stories every time he tweets and certainly undeniable.

99
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.310
I'm just pointing out that there are a number of different avenues and

100
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.610
individuals have choices and how they use the platform so that you'd have other

101
00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:15.190
platforms,
but he uses Twitter exclusively.

102
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.460
And what I'm trying to bring up is that if Twitter refuses to acknowledge this

103
00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:21.880
problem,
you are facing regulation.
I don't,
I don't know if you care about that,

104
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.130
but at a certain point,
which problem,

105
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.180
if you're going to restrict American citizens from participating on a platform

106
00:05:28.181 --> 00:05:31.390
or even the president speaks and it's essentially you have a private,

107
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.160
privately owned public space,

108
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.810
as if I could use an analogy that would be most apt and you've set rules that

109
00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:41.800
are not recognized by the u s in fact,
when it came to a supreme court hearing,

110
00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:44.710
they said,
hate speech is not a violation.
It's actually protected free speech.

111
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.100
So there's an actual odds.
So there might be someone who says,

112
00:05:48.101 --> 00:05:51.640
I refuse to live by any other means than,
uh,
what the Supreme Court sat down.

113
00:05:51.641 --> 00:05:53.830
That means I have a right to hate speech.
You will bend them.

114
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.470
That means your platform is so powerful.
It's,

115
00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.320
it's being used to manipulate elections and you have rules that are not

116
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:03.170
recognized by the government to remove American citizens from that discourse.

117
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:04.460
So as a private platform,

118
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:08.960
you've become too powerful to not be regulated if you refuse to allow people

119
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:09.794
free speech.

120
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.700
<v 2>But,
um,
I'm trying to pick apart,
um,
the connection.</v>

121
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.980
I think so,
yes,
we,

122
00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:21.210
we do have an issue with,
um,

123
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.210
foreign entities and misinformation and,

124
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.320
and this is a extremely complicated issue,

125
00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:33.060
which we're just beginning to understand and grasp and take action on.

126
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.310
I,

127
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:39.310
I don't think that issue is solved purely by not being more aggressive on

128
00:06:42.181 --> 00:06:46.080
something else that is taking people off the platform entirely as well,

129
00:06:46.081 --> 00:06:48.210
which is abuse and harassment.

130
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.780
It's a cost benefit analysis ultimately in our rules are designed again and you

131
00:06:55.071 --> 00:06:57.720
know,
they don't always manifest this way in the outcomes,

132
00:06:57.721 --> 00:07:02.040
but in terms of what we're trying to drive is opportunity for every single

133
00:07:02.041 --> 00:07:05.520
person to be able to speak freely on the platform.

134
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.110
<v 0>That's absolutely not true.
You would done a lightspeed allow hate speech.</v>

135
00:07:10.111 --> 00:07:13.260
So free speech is not on your platform.
I said,

136
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.860
speak for enable everyone that create the opportunity for everyone to speak on

137
00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.020
our service unless they've all right.

138
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.130
<v 2>And then in part of that,</v>

139
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:28.360
the recognition that we're taking action on is that when some people encounter

140
00:07:28.361 --> 00:07:33.361
particular conduct that we see them wanting to remove themselves from the

141
00:07:34.421 --> 00:07:35.380
platform completely,

142
00:07:35.381 --> 00:07:39.610
which goes against that principle of enabling everyone to speak or giving people

143
00:07:39.611 --> 00:07:40.630
the opportunity to speak.

144
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.640
Our rules are focused on the the opportunities presented and we have particular

145
00:07:46.421 --> 00:07:48.490
outcomes to make sure that those opportunities are

146
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.630
<v 0>soldier as possible.
Let's,
let's separate the first I,</v>

147
00:07:50.631 --> 00:07:54.020
the point I made about foreign governments was just to explain the,
the,

148
00:07:54.021 --> 00:07:57.080
the power that your platform holds.
How can be weaponized?

149
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.103
We'll separate that now.

150
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.150
When antifa shows up to Berkeley and bashes a guy over there with a bike lock

151
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.870
that is suppressing his speech,
right?
That's an act of physical violence.
However,

152
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.260
when Auntie fall links hands and blocks the door so that no one can go to an

153
00:08:09.261 --> 00:08:12.050
event that is also legally allowed,
right?

154
00:08:12.051 --> 00:08:15.470
So what you're saying is that if someone is engaging in behavior such as going

155
00:08:15.471 --> 00:08:18.230
on Twitter and shouting someone down relentlessly,

156
00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:21.200
that's something external to what happens in,
in,

157
00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:22.580
in the world under the u s government.

158
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:27.380
I am allowed to scream very close to you and not let you speak in public,

159
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:29.060
but on Twitter you don't allow that.

160
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.970
So there's a dramatic difference between what Twitter thinks is okay and what

161
00:08:31.971 --> 00:08:33.290
the u s government thinks is okay.

162
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.270
Our democracy functions and how Twitter functions.

163
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:39.710
The issue I'm pointing out is that we know Twitter is becoming extremely

164
00:08:39.711 --> 00:08:41.960
important in how our public discourse is occurring,

165
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:45.170
how our cultural culture is developing and who even gets elected.

166
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.220
So if you have rules that are based on a global policy,

167
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.360
that means American citizens who are abiding by all of the laws of our country

168
00:08:53.361 --> 00:08:55.740
are being restricted from engaging in public discourse because you've

169
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:57.510
monopolized it.
Can I counter that though?

170
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.210
Because these foreign governments are restricted by the same rules.

171
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.480
So if they violate those same rules,
they will be,
they will be removed.

172
00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:05.160
So play within those rules.

173
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.460
They can participate in the discourse even if they are just trying to manipulate

174
00:09:08.461 --> 00:09:10.560
our elections.
On the other hand,

175
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.550
if the people that are on the platform play by those rules,

176
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:19.350
they can also counteract unless their ideology goes in line with us.

177
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.020
Law and it's legally allowed as opposed to what you allow.

178
00:09:22.021 --> 00:09:26.070
So foreign governments can can absolutely keep making new accounts and keep

179
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:27.390
bottling and keep manipulating.

180
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:30.300
They can even post things that'll go viral and then get banned and not care.

181
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.210
Right.
But a private American citizen can say,
here's my opinion,

182
00:09:33.211 --> 00:09:35.490
I refuse to back down.
I see what you're saying.
You will ban him.

183
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:40.210
So we can see that at a certain point you have a lot your,
your,

184
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.750
your Twitter is slowly gaining in,
in my opinion,

185
00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:46.680
too much control from your personal ideology based on what you've researched,

186
00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:51.090
what you think is right over American discourse.
If you,
if Twitter,

187
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:52.770
and this again is my opinion,
I'm not a lawmaker,

188
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:58.130
but I would have to assume if Twitter refuses to say in the United States you

189
00:09:59.071 --> 00:10:01.710
are allowed to say what is legally acceptable period.

190
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:05.250
Then lawmakers only choice will be to enforce regulation on your company.

191
00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:06.141
<v 1>Actually tell him,</v>

192
00:10:06.141 --> 00:10:09.250
I spent quite a bit of time talking to lawmakers as part of my role,

193
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.610
had a public policy.
Um,
I spent a lot of time in DC.

194
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:17.230
I want to say the Jack and I have both spent a lot of time in DC and I think

195
00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.780
from the perspective of of lawmakers,

196
00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:25.630
they across the spectrum are also in favor of policing,

197
00:10:25.631 --> 00:10:28.150
abuse and harassment online and bullying online.

198
00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:32.620
Those are things that people care about because they affect their children if

199
00:10:32.621 --> 00:10:35.080
they affect their communities and they fact individuals.

200
00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:38.560
And so I don't think that,
and as a,

201
00:10:38.561 --> 00:10:40.510
as a private American business,

202
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:45.280
we can have different standards than what an American government owned

203
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.550
corporations or American government would have to institute.

204
00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.850
Those are two different things,
American bit.

205
00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:54.070
And I understand your point about the influence and I'm not denying that.

206
00:10:54.071 --> 00:10:58.330
Certainly Twitter is an influential platform,
but like anything,

207
00:10:58.331 --> 00:11:02.110
whether it's the American law or the rules of Twitter or the rules of Facebook

208
00:11:02.111 --> 00:11:05.620
or wills of any platform,
there are rules and those rules have to be followed.

209
00:11:05.621 --> 00:11:09.040
So it is your choice whether to follow those rules and to continue to

210
00:11:09.041 --> 00:11:12.690
participate in a civic dialogue.
And it's your choice to not do that.

211
00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:13.341
<v 0>Absolutely.</v>

212
00:11:13.341 --> 00:11:17.180
You've monopolized public discourse to an extreme degree and you say my way or

213
00:11:17.181 --> 00:11:17.870
the highway

214
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.300
<v 1>we are facing Tim,
we haven't monopolize it.</v>

215
00:11:20.301 --> 00:11:23.720
There are many different avenues for people to continue to have a voice.

216
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:27.830
There are many different platforms that offer that we are a largely influential

217
00:11:27.831 --> 00:11:30.440
line.
I'm not trying to take away from that and we're a very important one.

218
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.820
You don't need to be the most important.

219
00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:35.540
It's just that you are extremely important and that's,
and it's a compliment.

220
00:11:35.541 --> 00:11:37.460
Twitter has become extremely powerful,

221
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.040
<v 0>but at a certain point you should not have the right to control what people are</v>

222
00:11:41.041 --> 00:11:44.490
allowed to say.
No private or outlook.
I'm a social liberal.

223
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.330
I think we should regulate you guys because you are unelected officials running

224
00:11:48.331 --> 00:11:52.290
your system the way you see fit against the wishes of a democratic republic.

225
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.450
And there are who disagree with you or being excised from public discourse

226
00:11:55.451 --> 00:11:57.970
because of your ideology.
That terrifies me.

227
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.700
And we can take it one step further just so I understand.

228
00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:05.380
So are you suggesting that we don't have any policies around abuse and

229
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:07.660
harassment on the platform?
Um,

230
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:10.120
I'm trying to understand what it is you're saying cause I'm not,

231
00:12:10.121 --> 00:12:11.320
I'm not sure I'm following you.

232
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:14.290
So you don't think we should have any rules about abuse and harassment.

233
00:12:14.291 --> 00:12:17.680
So even though the threats that you received that you mentioned that we did,

234
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.850
but you mentioned a number of threats that you received in your quite frustrated

235
00:12:21.851 --> 00:12:24.280
that we hadn't taken action on them,
that you think we shouldn't have roles.

236
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.360
That I'm frustrated because of the hypocrisy.
When I,
when I see,

237
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.560
I see the flow of one direction and then what I see are Republican politicians

238
00:12:32.561 --> 00:12:34.990
who in my opinion are just too ignorant to understand what the hell's going on

239
00:12:34.991 --> 00:12:35.770
around them.

240
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:40.510
And I see people burning signs that say free speech Icu openly saying we

241
00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:44.260
recognize the power of our platform and we're not going to abide by American

242
00:12:44.261 --> 00:12:49.060
norms.
I see the manipulation of Twitter for uh,
in violation of our elections.

243
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:53.830
I see democratic operatives in Alabama waging a false flag campaign using fake

244
00:12:53.831 --> 00:12:55.500
Russian accounts and the,
and the,

245
00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.990
and the guy who runs that company has not been banned from your platform even

246
00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:01.300
after it's been written by the New York Times.
He was doing this.

247
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.720
So we know that not only are people manipulating your platform,

248
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.950
you have rules that remove honest American citizens with bad opinions who have a

249
00:13:08.951 --> 00:13:10.480
right to engage in public discourse.

250
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.680
And it's like you recognize it but you like having the power.

251
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.140
I'm not quite sure at what point,
get back to my point.

252
00:13:17.141 --> 00:13:21.310
So you believe that Twitter should not have any rules about abuse and harassment

253
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.290
or any sort of hate speech on the platform that that's your position.

254
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:28.600
That's a extremely productive,
I don't know that maybe,
maybe too simplistic.

255
00:13:28.601 --> 00:13:31.360
The point I'm trying to make is,
but that would have you ain't,

256
00:13:31.361 --> 00:13:32.011
you're trying to make your,

257
00:13:32.011 --> 00:13:36.580
you're asking us to comply with the u s law that would criminalize potential

258
00:13:36.581 --> 00:13:40.090
speech and put people in jail for it.
And you're asking us to enforce those,

259
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:44.650
those while,
I mean,
if you insight death,
you will,
it's a crime.
You can go,

260
00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:48.410
you can go to jail for that.
So at the very least,
you could,
you like when you,

261
00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:50.500
when you have people on your platform who committed a crime,
you don't ban them.

262
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:51.820
I say,
well,
that's really weird.

263
00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.310
And then when you have people on your platform who say a bad,
naughty word.
