00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.580
Holy cow!

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.846
About a third of the
building has been blown away.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.413
(sirens)

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.790
This is a scene from one
of the United States'

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.410
deadliest domestic attacks.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.970
KOCO news report:

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:17.631
As we walked up,

00:00:17.631 --> 00:00:19.730
I could not believe what was happening.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.820
You really couldn't believe your eyes
and you especially couldn't believe that

00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:25.460
it was actually happening
here in Oklahoma City.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.230
President Bill Clinton:

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.230
The bombing in Oklahoma City was an attack
on innocent children and defenseless

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.903
citizens.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.300
Connie Chung:

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.410
The attack came without warning and
according to a U.S. government source told

00:00:38.411 --> 00:00:42.430
CBS News that it has Middle East
terrorism written all over it.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.380
But it wasn't some foreign agent
that killed 168 adults and children.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.900
This was the result of
homegrown right-wing extremism.

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:55.680
Timothy McVeigh: Well, am I,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.880
am I pure evil?

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.450
Am I the face of terror
sitting here in front of you?

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.470
The Oklahoma City bombing happened years
before this Charlottesville, Virginia

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.333
attack.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.810
Both assaults are examples
of the United States'

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.770
long running struggle with
right-wing extremism and brutality.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.620
Hey fam,

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.280
I'm Imaeyen.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.110
In part one of our series,

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.890
we took a look at the rise of right-wing
fanaticism in the United States and the

00:01:27.891 --> 00:01:28.970
government's response to it.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.350
Today,

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.520
I'm standing at a memorial dedicated to
the victims of the Oklahoma City bombing

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.940
to find out what this disaster
can teach us about our future.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.280
This is Oklahoma.

00:01:54.431 --> 00:01:55.264
Cowboy country. 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.930
The birthplace of the legendary Mickey Mantle.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.550
And the location of the
country's deadliest domestic
attack committed by one of

00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:06.384
its own.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:08.620
Water resources council hearing: Basically, 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.200
there are four elements that I have to

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.140
receive information regarding ... (explosion)

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.140
It's been 24 years since a moving truck
filled with explosives parked near a

00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:32.760
federal building in Oklahoma City,

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.070
destroying it and devastating a nation.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.970
The explosion killed 168 people,

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.330
including small children
and injured 500 more.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.110
CBS News report: The blast was catastrophic.

00:02:45.111 --> 00:02:48.680
Half of the nine-story federal
building collapsed into the street,

00:02:48.681 --> 00:02:52.490
an estimated 900 people inside.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.730
This attack is one type
of far-right extremism,

00:02:55.731 --> 00:02:58.850
which generally falls into two categories:

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.210
Hate-based, like the neo-Nazis
or white nationalists,

00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:02.990
as we discussed in part one of our series

00:03:05.221 --> 00:03:06.581
and anti-government,

00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:08.530
like the men responsible for
the Oklahoma City bombing.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.140
These are the names of the survivors of
the attack that happened at 9:02 a.m. on

00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:16.180
April 19, 1995

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.890
Dennis Purifoy is one of those survivors
and we're on our way to meet him.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.140
So this is where I was sitting.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.881
The building,

00:03:27.881 --> 00:03:29.050
as you can see here,

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.660
at one time I figured I was
115 feet from the bombing.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:35.720
That's so close to you.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.063
Yeah.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.480
That is so close.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.880
Here's how Purifoy's office
looked before the explosion.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.370
Look at the date on this photo.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.400
It was taken only a few
weeks before the disaster.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.000
This is what Purifoy's office building
looked like after a massive truck bomb

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.840
blasted off the façade of a
building with a daycare center,

00:03:57.841 --> 00:04:02.340
instantly killing a hundred people and
trapping dozens more beneath rubble.

00:04:02.341 --> 00:04:07.341
I saw a flash and I don't know if it was
a reflection on the computer screen of

00:04:08.701 --> 00:04:12.240
the actual explosion or if
it was an electrical spark.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.500
Everything went totally dark and
I was knocked out of my chair.

00:04:16.501 --> 00:04:19.770
That seemed to all happen at once.

00:04:19.771 --> 00:04:23.340
A ceiling tile fell on
Purifoy, trapping him.

00:04:23.341 --> 00:04:24.720
A coworker helped him escape.

00:04:24.721 --> 00:04:26.640
He suffered no major injuries.

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:28.380
And along with a few colleagues,

00:04:28.381 --> 00:04:30.570
got to a place where they could get help.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.740
In the immediate aftermath of the bombing,

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:36.210
there were two searches.

00:04:36.211 --> 00:04:37.890
One for the missing.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.590
This is Elijah and he's two,

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.030
and this,

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.890
this is Aaron.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.170
And one for the assailants.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.150
Purifoy: It was several days before I started even
paying attention to who supposedly the

00:04:56.151 --> 00:04:58.280
suspects were and that kind of thing.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.110
I was going to hospitals
where coworkers were.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.230
And then after a few days,

00:05:03.231 --> 00:05:05.330
I started going to funerals.

00:05:05.331 --> 00:05:09.440
I have the obits I think for
all of my coworkers in here.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.780
Ibanga: How hard was it to go to all of those

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.210
funerals?

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.540
Purifoy:

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:15.040
I was,

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.480
something I really wanted to do.

00:05:17.481 --> 00:05:18.710
I wanted to be

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.810
at every one.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.680
One reason that it was hard is that
there were sometimes multiple ones on the

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.810
same day.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.380
The earliest news coverage
quickly speculated

00:05:29.381 --> 00:05:34.180
so called "Middle Eastern terrorism,"
but the bombers weren't a group of Brown

00:05:34.181 --> 00:05:35.800
people from far off places.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.810
They were homegrown far-right militants
motivated by their hatred of the federal

00:05:40.811 --> 00:05:41.644
government.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.430
This is what the bombers
actually looked like.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.000
Purifoy: I think I was kind of in
shock like most people were.

00:05:49.691 --> 00:05:53.290
What, what would possess Timothy McVeigh,

00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:54.670
who was an army veteran,

00:05:54.671 --> 00:05:55.660
why would he do such a thing?

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.760
And this was during a period where the
U.S. had seen several violent far-right acts.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.040
The bombing attack shares the
same date as the Waco siege.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.130
And Olympic bomber,

00:06:14.131 --> 00:06:19.080
Eric Rudolph, planted an explosive
at the Atlanta Games in 1996.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.290
The news media failed to link these
stories in the same way they so eagerly do

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.140
with so-called "Islamic extremist" acts.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.240
Ibanga: How much did you know about far-right 
extremism before Oklahoma City?

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.420
Purifoy: Really nothing. I hadn't
paid attention to it.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.010
It hadn't been in the news.

00:06:38.011 --> 00:06:40.020
Before the bombing,

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.950
I really didn't know the extent of
far-right extremism in the country.

00:06:43.951 --> 00:06:46.230
Once I became aware of it,

00:06:46.231 --> 00:06:48.120
I tried to let other people know.

00:06:48.121 --> 00:06:49.410
I talked about it,

00:06:49.411 --> 00:06:50.910
I talked about it at church.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.111
I didn't,

00:06:55.111 --> 00:06:56.340
I don't know that I was on a crusade,

00:06:56.341 --> 00:06:57.061
but I,

00:06:57.061 --> 00:07:00.210
I was definitely interested in more
people learning about it and being aware

00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:00.780
about it.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:01.840
The plot,

00:07:01.841 --> 00:07:06.640
Timothy McVeigh and Terry
Nichols concocted is eerily
similar to one that a trio

00:07:06.641 --> 00:07:11.110
of white men had hoped to execute the
day after the 2016 presidential election

00:07:11.111 --> 00:07:12.460
in Garden City, Kansas.

00:07:12.461 --> 00:07:17.440
The militia men who dubbed themselves
'the crusaders,' schemed to kill as many

00:07:17.441 --> 00:07:22.130
Somali refugees as possible by detonating
four car bombs outside an apartment

00:07:22.131 --> 00:07:24.670
complex that also doubled as a mosque.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.720
David Neiwert: They were planning to blow up
this community in Garden City,

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.650
with Timothy McVeigh-style truck bombs,

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:39.010
situate themselves at the exits to the
community with machine guns, and shoot

00:07:40.071 --> 00:07:41.390
anybody who tried to flee.

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.130
So it was going to be a horrible massacre.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.900
This is David Neiwert.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.470
And the reason he knows so much
about what happened in Kansas

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:54.990
is because he's been studying far-right
extremism in the U.S. since the 1970s.

00:07:57.641 --> 00:08:00.790
A judge sentenced those three Kansas men to
25 to 30 years in jail.

00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:04.650
And their plot shows something Neiwert
says the nation has forgotten.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.360
Neiwert: People understood prior to 9/11 that
terrorism could take a variety of shapes.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.030
After 9/11,

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:18.490
the only kind of terrorism that people
thought of were essentially Arabs,

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:22.320
Muslims.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:25.880
President George W. Bush:
Today we've had a national tragedy.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:32.650
Two airplanes have crashed into the World
Trade Center in an apparent terrorist

00:08:34.551 --> 00:08:35.470
attack on our country.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.390
Bush's focus was on threats
coming from overseas.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.950
His so-called “war on terror" didn't
address far-right figures like McVeigh,

00:08:56.761 --> 00:08:57.594
Nichols or Rudolph.

00:08:59.011 --> 00:08:59.910
President Bush: But we're going to smoke them out.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:06.130
Our mission is to battle terrorism
and to join was freedom-loving people.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.390
This is a long-term

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:10.960
battle, war.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.900
And while President Bush literally said,

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:18.070
"Islam is peace" to make a distinction
between religion and acts of terror,

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.460
the country’s focus on Iraq
and Afghanistan meant that
the far-right threat that

00:09:22.461 --> 00:09:27.461
so recently had its attention faded from
its collective memory. 

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:33.070
While the United States was focused on Al Qaeda and
Muslims, far-right hate was organizing and

00:09:33.071 --> 00:09:33.904
energizing.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:35.510
Daryl Johnson: Unfortunately, America

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:40.770
a lot of times our legislators and
even law enforcement to some degree,

00:09:40.771 --> 00:09:41.790
are reactive.

00:09:41.791 --> 00:09:46.740
Something significant has to happen in
order for people to actually do something

00:09:46.741 --> 00:09:47.700
about the problem.

00:09:48.701 --> 00:09:50.730
Former Department of
Homeland Security analyst,

00:09:50.731 --> 00:09:52.020
Daryl Johnson,

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.350
watched as far-right extremism became
a bigger threat to the country,

00:09:55.351 --> 00:09:58.320
particularly after
Donald Trump was elected.

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.290
Johnson: So typically during
Democratic administrations,

00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:03.870
like Obama Administration,

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:04.171
Clinton administration,

00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:06.630
we see a rise of the far right.

00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:08.550
And then typically during a
Republican administration,

00:10:08.551 --> 00:10:09.750
we see just the opposite.

00:10:09.751 --> 00:10:11.760
But this time in 2016,

00:10:11.761 --> 00:10:16.290
we had a Republican administration
coming to power and the far right has

00:10:16.291 --> 00:10:18.250
continued to operate
at a heightened level,

00:10:18.251 --> 00:10:23.251
which goes against all the trending that
I've seen over the past 30 to 40 years.

00:10:23.281 --> 00:10:27.780
Johnson and Neiwert both believed
the president's heated rhetoric has

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.040
mainstreamed extremist messages.

00:10:30.041 --> 00:10:35.041
And Neiwert says President Trump has soft-peddled a version of white nationalism

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.880
and made it more palatable
for a wider audience.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.320
Neiwert: The people who were
committing these crimes,

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.580
were either referencing
Trump's name directly,

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.280
like shouting "Trump, Trump, Trump,”

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:52.280
as they beat people up or
threatened people, or using his name to say,

00:10:54.871 --> 00:10:55.171
you know, well, 

00:10:55.411 --> 00:10:58.890
"Trump's going to get you outta here."
This problem didn't start with Donald Trump, 

00:10:59.161 --> 00:11:00.870
he took advantage of it,

00:11:00.871 --> 00:11:05.871
but he definitely fueled it and it's
massively expanded because of his presidency. 

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.570
President Trump: And yes, we will

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.440
build the wall.

00:11:10.441 --> 00:11:12.330
We've already started planning.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:14.610
It will be built.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:15.443
(Cheers)

00:11:17.461 --> 00:11:20.880
Neiwert says there's a thread he's seen
connect the philosophy of far-right

00:11:20.881 --> 00:11:23.430
extremism to its believers.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:24.110
 

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:29.110
Neiwert: The personality type is drawn to these
movements consistently is what we call

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:31.100
right-wing authoritarians.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:36.700
Authoritarian personalities are basically
people who want to be told what to do,

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:41.490
people who want an authoritarian rule
because they feel more safe and secure.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.620
This is the role that Trump plays.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.280
This isn't the first time
that this has happened.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:50.450
The country's history is littered with
examples of far-right extremism being

00:11:50.451 --> 00:11:51.230
overlooked,

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:51.920
ignored,

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.060
and sometimes even being
turned into government policy.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.480
Think of all the violence
associated with Jim Crow.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:04.300
How worried are you that people
will forget Oklahoma City?

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.310
That it'll fade from the memories?

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:08.080
Purifoy: I think as time goes on,

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:11.050
it will start fading
from memory a little bit,

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:12.850
but it is.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:13.691
It still,

00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:14.590
even to this day,

00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:19.591
it's the largest domestic terrorism as
far as number of casualties in the 

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:21.183
United States.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:27.180
I hope that we remain for many years
to come - the still - the largest domestic

00:12:29.111 --> 00:12:31.180
terrorism incident in our history.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.380
We can't any more just say
"It's not my business like I,

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:39.580
I can't pay attention to all of that."
It is our business and we have to pay

00:12:39.581 --> 00:12:40.414
attention to it.

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:45.980
Right now the nation is at a place where
it's been before in confronting

00:12:45.981 --> 00:12:49.520
right-wing fanaticism, and it's making
some of the same decisions

00:12:49.521 --> 00:12:53.750
it's may before in governmental
policies and in news coverage.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:58.010
See the governmental response isn't the
only thing contributing to this problem.

00:12:58.370 --> 00:12:59.210
The news media,

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.400
they have culpability too. Both Purifoy
and Neiwert say part of the reason people

00:13:04.401 --> 00:13:09.380
don't see far-right extremism as a threat
is because of how the news media has

00:13:09.381 --> 00:13:10.820
and continues to portray it.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:12.200
Purifoy: I think,

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.780
I think they should report more in-depth.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.160
So unless you get,

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.620
unless the media provides some background,

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:23.570
people really do remain
pretty much ignorant about it.

00:13:23.571 --> 00:13:26.210
The book that inspired Timothy McVeigh,

00:13:26.211 --> 00:13:29.930
it's been inciting far-right 
violence for decades.

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:30.921
Purifoy: Timothy McVeigh,

00:13:30.921 --> 00:13:33.560
he would try to convince people
for months and months and months,

00:13:33.561 --> 00:13:34.341
his circle of friends,

00:13:34.341 --> 00:13:35.630
he tried to convince them,

00:13:35.631 --> 00:13:39.620
he tried to get them to read
the "Turner Diaries" and stuff like that.

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:44.650
The “Turner Diaries” is a racist dystopian
novel written by a neo-Nazi leader.

00:13:44.681 --> 00:13:49.340
The book reached the pinnacle of its
popularity in 1995, once a connection to

00:13:49.341 --> 00:13:50.870
Timothy McVeigh was made,

00:13:50.871 --> 00:13:53.030
but there's something 1995 didn't have,

00:13:53.031 --> 00:13:55.780
which may have limited its reach:

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.011
widespread high-speed internet.

00:13:58.011 --> 00:14:03.011
The internet and social
media revolutionized how
right-wing extremism met

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:08.500
grew and conspired, and that's really
important because not all right-wing extremism

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:09.703
is created equal.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:11.403
(Clashes)

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.880
It can be found in even
the most liberal of places.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:24.270
Jason Downard: There’s people you won't know you're trained
to blend in with your community.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:30.330
Hey fam,

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:31.560
thanks so much for watching.

One of the things that was the most
intriguing to me at the Oklahoma City

00:14:37.141 --> 00:14:39.180
memorial were the two
gates that they have.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:42.990
There's one at 9:01, symbolizing the
city's innocence before the bombing,

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:47.580
and then there's a gate symbolizing 9:03,
one minute after the bombing and what

00:14:47.581 --> 00:14:49.260
happens to Oklahoma City afterward.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:53.010
Be sure to stay tuned for the third and
final part of our series and we'll see

00:14:53.011 --> 00:14:53.760
you next time.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:54.420
Thanks for watching.
