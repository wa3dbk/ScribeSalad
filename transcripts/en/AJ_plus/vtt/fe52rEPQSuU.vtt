00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
This is me eating bison ribs ...

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.660
smothered in a spicy blueberry barbecue sauce.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.420
And something mouth-wateringly
incredible called a posu bowl.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.220
And a fry bread taco.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.540
What do all these foods have in common?

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.100
They're Native American cuisine.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.560
The cuisine of the indigenous people of this land,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.000
made with ingredients you could once 
only find here and nowhere else,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.780
made by people who were here
before colonists like this guy

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.200
and children of immigrants like me.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.200
Hi, my name is Yara and if you've seen me before,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.860
you probably know that I take 
great enjoyment in eating things.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.900
Delicious lamb fat.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.960
Before I made this video I had never eaten a legit Native American meal made by the Native community,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.740
which is strange because I grew up in the
San Francisco Bay Area.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.360
And it's pretty cosmopolitan here.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.340
I've eaten Burmese,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.840
Indian,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.340
Mexican,

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.840
Russian,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.340
Korean,

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.840
Japanese,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.340
Syrian,

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.840
Peruvian

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.340
and Ethiopian food.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.780
But I had never eaten at a Native restaurant.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.480
I'd never even seen one.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.440
There are supposedly some 
600,000 restaurants in the U.S.,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.600
but barely any of them, National Geographic says 
a handful, are Native American.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.300
When a lot of people think of Native cuisine

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.260
they think of Thanksgiving food or fry bread,
which are definitely a thing.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.860
But when I went on a road trip through the American Southwest with my co-producer Tabish,

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.040
Santa Fe!

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.440
I realized that it's so much more than that.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.580
Like so,

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.460
so,

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.760
so much more than that.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.540
So what is Native cuisine today?

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.720
What did it used to be?

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.960
And why don't we see more of it on every street corner?

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.560
So what's a Native American restaurant
actually like?

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.820
To show you we're gonna start 
our story here in Colorado.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.200
We have arrived in Denver

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.760
at like 3:00 in the morning with very little sleep.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.200
We just drove for eight and a half hours.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.180
So we're going to Tocabe, which is a Native American restaurant.

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.420
And that's what we met Ben.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.260
We're very late.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.240
He's a member of the Osage Nation.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.980
In 2008, he and his business partner Matt
opened their first restaurant.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.140
And now they have two locations and a food truck.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.180
So they gave us a behind-the-scenes 
look at what their foods like.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.560
We are in the kitchen.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.400
Oh my God, something is on fire.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.660
Wow.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.280
So we are setting what on fire?

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.780
Cedar.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.620
We need to burn down a little bit more into ash.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.340
OK.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.980
And then we're gonna mix
it in that blue corn.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.340
We're gonna make blue corn mush.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.360
We'll get some water and we'll 
have to move to the stove.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.440
So this is the most important part, 
watching it come to a boil.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.820
I'm stirring the water.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.900
If this is not that exciting we can do something else.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.600
This is way more exciting than
watching water boil.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.400
We cook them in a bison stock that we make so it really is the flavor of the animal.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.140
And we covered them in this incredible, like, seriously incredible, spicy blueberry barbecue sauce.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.840
I've never tasted anything like
this in my life.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.780
It's spicy, it's blueberry, it's barbecue-y.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.140
And then when you put it on the bison rib

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.740
the richness of the bison rib with the berry
blends really, really well.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.820
We cut it right on the grill.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.340
Your knife just goes right down and it just glides past.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.380
Nice.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.400
Alright, oh my God. OK.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.680
So I grew up in a restaurant.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.400
Just go all the way through.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.360
No.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.160
Your interview has come to an end.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.520
And then we put it all together.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.000
Beautiful.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.600
So this is Wojapi, like a northern
plains berry jam, you could say.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.640
That's beautiful.
Look at all those colors.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.471
Shall we?

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.060
Dude, you're killing me.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.600
Is it good?

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.880
First with the sauce, now with this.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.820
Let's try the ribs.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.260
Man, the texture of the meat, that sauce ...

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.300
OK. I'm just going to take this.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.940
I was going to say ... I was about to have a bite.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:55.990
All together now.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.460
But there was more.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.480
Today we're going to make our posu bowl.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.980
OK.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.660
We're gonna do a base of the wild rice.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.620
Black beans or pinto beans, do you have a preference?

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:06.520
Shredded bison.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.020
Yes.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.460
Hominy – it's white puffy corn,

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.140
cranberries,

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.820
cilantro,

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:11.580
red onion.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.580
Yellow squash,

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.080
zucchini

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.660
and jicama.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:16.960
Some green chilies.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.631
Elderberry vinaigrette.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.740
Let's show the camera.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.480
The idea for Tocabe came up

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.960
when Ben and Matt had this question:

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.380
Like, why is Native cuisine not present outside of our community.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.520
So you know, you can get it at home,

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.580
you can get it at pow wows,

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.640
you can get it at community gatherings,

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.140
but why is it not available on a daily basis?

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.460
So, they made it available on a daily basis.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.280
And today Tocabe is one of the only Native
American restaurant chains in America.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.280
I mean I wish we could have shown you how they make their fry bread taco with bison.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.400
Or their pozole soup with plump
hominy,

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.680
or their sweet fry bread nuggets

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.500
and their lightly charred soft bread called bannock.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.780
So, so good.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.820
Native cuisine has been around for thousands of years,

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.840
but the food we had it Tocabe that's something totally new.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.600
Native food professionals are taking ancestral ingredients

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.300
and combining and preparing them
in new ways around the country.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.820
You know we're the oldest cultures
on this land,

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.420
but in many ways we have the youngest cuisine.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.280
And the reason for that is it's not clearly defined outside of, like, our communities.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.940
But how did this new Native American 
cuisine come about

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.540
and what exactly makes it, well, 
Native American?

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.000
For that I've got to rewind and tell you how we ended up here.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.840
Our journey actually started in New Mexico.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.920
This airport is so festive.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.980
We're here to cook with a master of 
Southwest Native American cuisine

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.480
who's a chef slash photographer
slash PhD.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.400
We are on our way to Santa Fe tonight.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.640
There are chilies next to our hotel room.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.380
We are here to interview Lois Ellen Frank.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.540
Hey

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.660
Lois is part of the Kiowa Nation on her mom's side

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.480
and Sephardic Jewish on her
dad's side.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.980
She owns a catering company specializing
in Native cuisine

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.920
and she runs it with Chef Walter Whitewater,
who's from the Navajo nation.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.460
Together they host exclusive dinners showcasing a unique take on ancient recipes,

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.080
recipes Lois included in her award-winning cookbook.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.060
Native American cuisine has evolved over 10,000 years.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.160
And it's super diverse.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.620
There are over 570
federally recognized tribes in the U.S.,

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.620
each hailing from different regions.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.240
Tribes in the Great Plains might have eaten bison and chokecherries.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.860
In the East they consumed wild turkeys, turtles and other small game.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.040
And those in the Pacific Northwest had access to multiple types of salmon and wild onions.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.960
But despite that diversity Lois has categorized thousands of years of Native American cuisine

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.220
into four distinct historical periods.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.900
The first is the pre-contact period which is  ...

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.560
all the foods that existed before contact with
any other culture group outside of Native people.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.700
That includes all the food Natives hunted,
 gathered, grew and traded on their own

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.700
before the European invasion.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.980
And that would be the basis, the
foundation for Native American cuisine.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.260
So wild game.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.540
And.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.240
What I call the magic eight, so

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.620
Does that mean corn didn't exist outside of 
the Americas in 1491?

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.740
Beans, squash didn't exist outside of the
Americas.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.300
The Italians didn't have the tomato

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.600
The Irish didn't have the potato.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.280
The Russians, they didn't have vodka from the potato.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.800
Half the British national dish – fish 
and chips – did not exist.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.020
No chilies in any Asian cuisine,
in any East Indian cuisine.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.760
And the French had no confection using
vanilla or chocolate.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.020
So many dishes that are familiar to you and me

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.700
as you know them without
Native American ingredients.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.080
Which brings us to the next period.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.820
So we have cuisine that's

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.300
and then we have this contact,

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.400
with the Europeans.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.540
Alright let's just focus on

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.860
And we can say well they brought horses, guns, disease and rats, OK, but

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.900
They brought domesticated animals

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.296
sheep, pork, beef, chickens.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.940
And the byproducts of those animals.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:19.400
If you think about Native Americans most of us are
lactose-intolerant, we ate wild game.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.780
Do you think you could get close enough
to an elk to milk it?

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.380
After a few centuries of this food exchange Native ingredients spread throughout the world.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.600
But as that happened Native Americans were being robbed of their land.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.080
Millions and millions of immigrants were coming to the United States.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.820
And maybe that's a good thing for the immigrants,

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.360
but not such a good thing for Native people.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.120
These new settlers really really wanted land

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.620
and they pillaged plundered and
killed natives

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.020
and burned down their towns to get their hands on it.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.220
The U.S. government played a massive role too.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.740
They even passed something called
the Indian Removal Act.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:58.220
And one of the biggest atrocities they committed came
to be known as the Trail of Tears.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.800
Starting in the 1830s, tens of thousands
of Natives in the southeast

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.920
were forced to march thousands of miles 
in harsh conditions.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.380
Thousands upon thousands died.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.460
Those that survived were confined to a
designated "Indian Territory".

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.440
Right around here.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.480
And over the next few decades even
more tribes were crammed into this space.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:20.260
My tribe is evicted and moved to 
"Indian Territory".

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.720
And the land the U.S, government confined them to?

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.640
Little by little, even that was seized by the settlers.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.200
Other tribes were being forced onto plots of land called reservations as a way to control them.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.440
Once there they couldn't hunt, gather or grow 
traditional foods like they used to.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.820
This is when a lot of Native
cuisine was lost.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.280
Whenever you're displaced,

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.840
you lose traditional knowledge surrounding where 
you've been living for thousands of years.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.120
What foods grow, what animals are there.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.940
When to plant, when to harvest.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.440
Now, Native people were living on unfamiliar land,

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.000
forced to live without the
resources they used to have.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.280
So the government steps in and
issues commodity foods,

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.000
starvation foods, army rations

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.220
to keep them alive, barely.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.980
We call this the government-issue.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.120
The government issued foods for survival.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.960
These were ingredients like flour, lard, coffee and sugar.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.940
Foods that were completely different 
from what Natives were used to,

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.500
with far less nutritional value than
their own traditional cuisine.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.740
Out of this period fry bread is born.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:20.120
And so, fry bread is an interesting Native food,

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.180
an imposed government food that we use for survival.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.380
Those elders if they didn't come up with this bread

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:26.760
maybe they would have perished.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.000
But it also represents colonization.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.840
That history is why some Native chefs 
use fry bread and others don't.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.580
And that brings us to the last
period, the one we're in now.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.380
It's what Lois calls new Native American cuisine.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:45.540
Now, Native chefs around the United States are classically trained equal to their European counterparts

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:51.460
and we are choosing what ingredients from what period we want to put into our menus.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.900
I can construct menus from any of those
periods, all of those periods.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.560
And the way we present them are very new.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.600
So, we helped them prep for one of their big events.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.800
What are we making today?

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.780
Roasted chilies.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.500
We're stuffing bison inside of it.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.520
It needs a starch, because 
that holds it together.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.600
I use quinoa.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:16.280
The Native people always tell you, like, don't cook it when you're angry, you know,

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.720
or you'll make the food bitter.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.980
Native people a long time ago devised this
method of charring chilies

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:26.060
because when you char a chili
you bring the oil out.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:29.060
So, the oil is the medicine and the oil is the flavor.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.160
I'm just filling my little boat with goodies.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.340
One, two, three.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.260
What are we making?

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:42.660
So this is sage from the garden.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.620
This is probably the first
ancestral oven.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.420
We're gonna roll it in corn husk, which I call the 
Native American aluminum foil.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.220
We're mummifying this.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.040
And then we're gonna wrap it in clay.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:11:59.980
Once it's in clay ...

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:01.740
Oh.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:02.940
Oh no, you ripped it.

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:07.040
It would've been put into the fire,
but the clay protects it, steaming it.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.280
Beautiful, beautiful.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.900
And then the guests arrived.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.980
And Lois gave them an important history refresher.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.260
It's always about who's telling the story.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:22.700
So if Native people got on boats and went to Europe, Europe would be the new world.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:23.740
And then we ate.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.893
I think Daric has a good reaction.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.180
It was amazing.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.660
There was so much complexity and depth
to all the flavors.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:47.420
Everything that was on this table tonight blew my mind.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:48.960
Oh and I almost forgot.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.840
Does anyone want to experience the cracking?

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:54.580
Isn't that amazing?

00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:00.220
And really what we've done is we've
created an ancient oven.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.160
It smells amazing.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:01.940
It does smell amazing.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:03.220
I think I made that one.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.200
So, in some instances you're gonna have 
to be a little more aggressive.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.920
So you can actually see the herbs right inside.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.480
Corn is a pretty amazing plant.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:19.600
We can use the husk, we can use the cobs and we can use the kernel.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:21.900
is

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:24.294
What's the sauce?

00:13:24.294 --> 00:13:25.660
This is a guajillo chile.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.840
Look how beautiful ... its moist, it's steamed.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.400
I didn't just want to attend an event,
eat the food and move on.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.680
I wanted to know more about the people behind that
food and their history.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.000
So Walter was kind enough to invite us to the 
Navajo Nation where he grew up.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.340
So we packed our bags

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:51.900
and said goodbye to the hotel.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.040
After a long drive ...

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.520
we ended up in a place called

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.600
It's all here. It's all right there. The voice.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.000
Oh, that it's phenomenally beautiful

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:13.540
Wow.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.040
Canyon de Chelly is a sacred site for
the Navajo,

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.360
especially because of the towering Spider Rock.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.940
Legend has it, the rock was home to Spider Woman, who taught the Navajo the art of weaving.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.440
But the canyons walls are also etched with a tragic story of hurt and pain.

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:32.140
This land and your connection to it, what 
happened here 150 years ago?

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.680
People took The Long Walk.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:39.620
In the 1860s, thousands of Navajos and some Apaches were violently removed from their lands.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:44.560
They were forced to march to what was essentially a concentration camp in southeastern New Mexico.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.260
I believe they called it the New
Mexico Trail of Tears.

00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:50.140
Everything was taken away from us.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.540
Hundreds of Navajo died during The Long Walk.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.240
They were starved and raped

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.360
and shot if they couldn't keep up

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.760
that included pregnant women and the elderly.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:03.720
And the story at Canyon de Chelly, a Navajo stronghold,
was particularly horrifying.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.120
The American military carried out a scorched earth campaign.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.180
They slaughtered the Navajos sheep,

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:10.300
burned their crops

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.920
and starved them until they surrendered.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:16.120
When they seen that their crops, their animals were being destroyed,

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.320
taking that Long Walk without food and water,

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.820
when that happened, when everything
is taken away from you,

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.580
it shatters everyone, you know.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:27.620
The Navajo eventually arrived at the
camp but the land wasn't fit for farming

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.160
and hunting was difficult there.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.200
They had no choice but to abandon their ancestral foods

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.780
and survive off of nutritionally poor
U.S. military food rations.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:40.360
As a result over 2,000 of them died of
disease and starvation.

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:43.580
Eventually, the U.S. government
released those that survived.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.920
But like other tribes they were 
then confined to a reservation,

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.440
which has today become the Navajo Nation.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:54.780
These forced removals of Native people were guided by a racist ideology known as Manifest Destiny.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:59.340
That somehow this land belonged
to white settlers and only white settlers

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.460
through some sort of divine
order.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:05.040
Even to this day some of the old people talk people talk about what happened

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:10.320
and how we're going to carry on our traditional ways that we used to have.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.220
So much of Native culture was passed down by word of mouth,

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.260
but being robbed of their land,
their way of life,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.400
being killed and forced onto reservations,

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.460
that led to the loss of a lot of cultural traditions including culinary ones.

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:27.280
The repercussions of that brutal colonial past are apparent as soon as you drive onto the reservation.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.360
Not only is there a severe lack of Native
restaurants here

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.800
there's, well, a severe lack of everything food-related.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.320
The Navajo Nation is a food desert.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:42.220
There are about only about ten grocery stores in the entire area of nearly 28,000 square miles.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:47.280
And 80% of the foods in those
stores have little to no nutritional value.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:51.820
Driving around the reservation it's hard to find much else besides fast food.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:56.460
Native peoples traditional diets
have been decimated by years of colonization.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:00.140
And this has led to extremely high rates
of obesity and diabetes.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:04.480
Today, Native Americans are twice as likely 
to get diabetes as someone who's white.

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.280
And that's why, for Walter,

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:10.400
helping others from his community reconnect with their culinary traditions is so important.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.440
If you don't pass it, it's gonna go away.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:16.240
They always tell us hang on to your root, hang on to what you have.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.760
Little that I can, I always pass it down
to whoever that wants to learn, you know.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.100
And you're keeping it alive yourself.

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:22.600
Oh yeah.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.960
Before we left the Navajo Nation,

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:31.480
Walter taught me how to cook this incredible dish
of lamb chops in a chili honey glaze.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.320
I love the color on that.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.120
So we got some chili powder

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.240
and then we're gonna get some honey.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.120
Ooh, that's really good.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.240
Look at that.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.360
Pine nuts are also very much a Navajo ingredient.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:00.880
Oh yeah.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.320
And the food was so tasty.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.080
Especially this delicious piece of

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:06.880
lamb fat.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.520
After cleaning up,

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.160
high-fiving Walter

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.520
and feeding bones to some stray dogs.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:14.500
No, it's there.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.060
We were on our way to our
final destination,

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:18.620
the place where this video started.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.180
The drive there was very pretty

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.540
and exhilarating.

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.180
Dang. Wait, zoom into the cows dude.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.660
And if you remember I was pretty delirious by the time we arrived.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.500
Oh my God, it is late.

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.840
So we're back at Tocabe with Ben and Matt

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.720
where we ate this, this, this and this.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.240
But let's go back to that initial question that inspired this whole trip.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.680
So in a lot of big cities across the country, we have Chinese restaurants, we have Italian restaurants,

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:48.060
we have Mexican restaurants, but we don't
have a Native American restaurant

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.300
like on every street corner.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.060
Why is that?

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:54.640
I think for so long the food was very much 
held within the community.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.560
We didn't have a lot of other restaurants
to really look towards,

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.120
to like design ourselves off of, to build off of ...

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:06.060
And remember that has a lot to do with the centuries of ruthless colonization

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.840
that devastated Native food culture, 
the forced removals, the killings,

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:13.400
the rupturing of ancestral traditions that date back thousands of years.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.720
Now we're at this place where there are Native chefs,

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.520
I mean like, really successful,
highly skilled Native chefs.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.500
And we can really create what we want the food to be.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.300
And we can create it in a restaurant environment

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.640
that not only tells the story of the food

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.020
but tells the story of the people.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:30.300
And really has, like, the heart of it because what we do at the end of the day is we represent people.

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.360
And that really needs [to be] part of what the food is.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:37.340
Chefs like Lois, Ben, Walter and others are bringing about a revival of Native American cuisine

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.580
and restoring it to its rightful place.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.660
And while the new Native restaurant 
scene is still emerging

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:45.700
Native food is already, in a sense, everywhere.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.320
It's in your pasta, it's in
your curry and it's in your dessert.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.860
Everyone's cuisine owes something to
Native Americans.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:55.320
And who knows maybe someday soon we'll have 
Native American restaurants,

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.820
run by native people telling their own stories,

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:01.460
on every street corner, in every major city 
across this country.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.920
Because, seriously, you need to try this f*cking incredible spicy blueberry barbecue sauce

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.780
on these f*cking incredible bison ribs.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:09.080
Hey I have a beard.

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.880
Anyway, you guys Native cuisine is really, really good.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.680
If you haven't tried it just like I hadn't

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.920
try to find a Native American restaurant
near where you live.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:20.340
Drive there, commute there, run there, try to find a way to get there because it may very well blow your mind.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:23.460
