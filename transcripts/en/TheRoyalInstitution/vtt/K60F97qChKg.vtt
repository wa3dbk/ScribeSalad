00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.749
I'm...there have been an enormous number of

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:24.059
wonderful really revolutionary developments in these subjects of Geometry and symbology in three dimensions over the last

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.970
30 odd [years] and even an astonishing number of new things have been learned since the

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.489
Turn of the century [and] what I want to do tonight [may] be a little bit ambitious

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.790
But I'm hoping to take you on a whistle-stop tour

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.029
Through some of the ideas that have been involved so but in order to tell you about

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.209
What's happened in the last 15 years

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.660
Really I need to start by going back to the turn [of] the previous century

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.559
and

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.599
We need to look at some of the things that were going on then

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:08.849
To explain a little bit about geometry and topology as it was at that time and we'll see how that gets carried over

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.229
so the

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.829
Plan of my talk, we shall first see a little bit about what is hyperbolic geometry

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.280
That's the geometry that a lot of these developments are based on. What is this word topology?

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.579
Surfaces I'm sure everyone knows what a surface is

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.360
We will then move on into 3D, and then we get to the sort of late

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.790
1970s a complete revolution happens with the American mathematician

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.129
Bill Thurston, and so I want to give you at least try to give you some sense of the

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.189
Enormous strides that Thurston

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.340
introduced and

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.030
then

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.390
Since the Millennium there have been further

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.569
Enormous strides which in some sense have completed a large part of the programs that the stand

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.809
Initiated so I want to try and give a flavor of that, and then finally talk a little bit about an open problem

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.619
Which I think is very

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.619
fascinating and which touches on

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.609
The work that I've [been] doing and which also relate to some of the ideas

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.790
[I] shall be telling you, so that's where we're going to go

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.610
So hyperbolic geometry if you think about geometry at the end of the 19th [century] it was a lot of discussion

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.610
What is geometry?

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.050
[you] could say Geometries study of

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.589
Space well, we're going to start in two dimensions space in which wherever you are in whichever Direction

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.040
You look what you see is kind of the same, so whatever it is. It looks the same [everywhere] and

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.510
Of course the most obvious kind is ordinary euclidean geometry

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.969
But you might also be living on the surface of a sphere [and] wherever you are on the surface of a round sphere

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.140
Things look the same they don't look quite. The same as if you're on the flat

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.729
But they look the same and the third kind the [kind] that was

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.370
missing

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.380
Up to about 200 years ago is called hyperbolic geometry

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.160
So here's a picture that shows rather well

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.440
Euclidean geometry

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.100
Everybody knows the sum of Angles in a triangle is [180] degrees in a sphere

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.690
[well], what are the straight lines on a sphere? They're the great circles the way Aero planes would fly to go the

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.220
quickest way

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.279
so the great circles on the sphere

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.739
And if you start playing around drawing triangles on a sphere whose sides are great circles

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:50.249
You very quickly come to the conclusion [that] the Angles add [up] to something greater than 180

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.860
How much more than 180?

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.540
depends by a very precise way on the area of the triangle and

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.439
The third kind of Geometry then is the kind where?

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:09.059
The sum [of] the Angles in a triangle is less than 180 so there's a kind of pairing between these two things

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.959
so hyperbolic geometry you can think of as

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.469
Geometry on a surface which is everywhere

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:23.849
Saddle-shaped so you see in this picture it sort of curves down that way and then over a hump in the other direction

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.050
a surface of negative curvature

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.110
hyperbolic Geometry

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.210
was first discovered in the search for a proof of

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:35.520
Euclid's parallel postulate

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.109
but rather than finding a proof a whole new world of Geometry was discovered and

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.770
We can nowadays interpret it in this rather nice way

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:45.610
so

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.180
How are we going to model this geometry?

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.199
well

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.129
You can't put the whole

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:58.889
Sort of plane of this geometry

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.069
into Ordinary flat Euclidean space

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.729
because

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:08.848
It's too big basically, so this is one of a rather nice

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.270
series of crochet

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:16.978
Models that's been developed by [this] person [diana] tamina

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:23.249
There's in fact a whole book you can buy about making crochet models of geometry there's a whole project

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:29.309
Which has made a coral reef out of crochet which I think is in Dublin and not quite sure anyway

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:35.759
You can make these models and the main pointers once you [start] trying to make a surface that's curved the right way it

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:37.889
starts crinkling up and crinkling up

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.079
and if you kept on before too long

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:45.568
[you] would find it was just so crinkled around the edge that you just couldn't fit it in there anymore

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:51.119
And you would [just] have to stop because you you wouldn't have any more space to make your stitches basically

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:53.849
so

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:56.729
Here's another way to do it which perhaps

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:03.359
some people may be familiar with so if you know anything about the theory of special relativity

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:08.669
[you] [can] use the space which in which

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.549
special relativity takes place and

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:15.159
I'm talking about a

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:18.689
[two-dimensional] usually one has three dimensions of space [and] one of time

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.310
This we're just going [to] have two dimensions [X&amp;Y] space and this is

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.830
time and this

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:34.258
picture over here on the left is a rather nice model made by a

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:40.430
colleague, so this is the show upon which Geometry takes place and

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:43.789
let me just go [on] and

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:49.669
It's not so easy to understand geometry there, so rather than doing that we project it

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.050
so just as you can think about Geometry on the surface of a sphere and

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.669
Projected onto the flat plane

00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:02.389
So we can take geometry on this shape here with this rather curious formulas

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:05.749
And we can project it onto this circle

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.819
And this is the first time Poincaré's name comes up his name will come up repeatedly

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.050
through the talk

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:16.490
We projected onto this circle now. I didn't say but a

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:24.199
Shortest distance path on this thing turns out to be the intersection of a plane through the origin

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:26.219
with this

00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:27.900
hyperboloid. This blue

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.909
Object and when you project it [down] what you see is

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:37.430
You see a disc here, and you see these lines, so these are shortest distance

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:43.519
Paths, Sort of Straight Lines in this geometry and what they look like in our map projection is

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:46.278
Arcs of Circles that hit the Boundary

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.919
that's right Angles and

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.620
So things are very distorted

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:55.459
But Angles are correct, so that's good

00:07:55.889 --> 00:08:02.658
There is a of course there are precise formulas for all this which I'm not going to try to explain tonight there are formulas

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.589
and

00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:12.229
The main thing to remember that this is like a very distorted thing like when you projects onto a flat atlas

00:08:12.569 --> 00:08:17.989
Things are completely distorted up near the north pole. They're very wrong so don't think that this is a correct picture

00:08:20.129 --> 00:08:22.819
but nevertheless let's carry on and

00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:28.069
Talk about tilings a lot of what I want to say is connected with tilings

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:33.979
So everybody knows how to make tiling patterns in the ordinary Euclidean plane

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.120
Kind of thing you

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.120
play around with it's cool and

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.449
You can make tilings of the sphere

00:08:41.449 --> 00:08:46.879
this is another nice model made by Henry Segerman, so here is a sphere with a

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:55.610
tiling [Pattern] on it, and he's rather nicely projected it in this photo onto the flat plane and

00:08:56.189 --> 00:08:58.339
Of course here, you can see here's a sphere

00:08:58.339 --> 00:09:04.339
Well here's everything distorted so we kind of see the idea of distortion in a projection

00:09:04.709 --> 00:09:10.938
what about tiling the hyperbolic plane there is [a] picture of a tiling of the

00:09:11.369 --> 00:09:18.349
Hyperbolic plane and the thing to take in here is that although these shapes. They're actually hexagons

00:09:19.199 --> 00:09:21.349
Although they look different

00:09:22.139 --> 00:09:27.649
actually from the Viewpoints of this geometry they're really the same so in other words just as in the

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.519
[hexagons] picture every tile is identical to every [other] one

00:09:31.769 --> 00:09:38.359
There's a rigid motion of geometry that carries one to the other the same thing is true in this picture

00:09:38.819 --> 00:09:41.509
[one] thing about this picture is that

00:09:42.959 --> 00:09:47.359
If you count the number of tiles around here they increase

00:09:49.499 --> 00:09:56.479
Linearly as the radius of your circle if you count the number of tiles here you find they increase

00:09:56.699 --> 00:10:02.719
Exponentially fast and that's related to this croche surface that I had that was all crumpled up

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.100
There's more and more and more of them, and there's an infinite number of them to get from here to here

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.429
It's an infinite distance and this rather

00:10:11.249 --> 00:10:15.199
Wonderful Little video clip shows you probably better

00:10:16.019 --> 00:10:21.828
It's going very fast, but there we [are] all of these shapes are the same and we're zooming on

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:30.290
Peter Leaper is another computer graphics person who's got kind of fascinated by some of the things that can be done in Mathematics

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:34.819
So this is a picture and as you see we go on and on and on forever

00:10:35.089 --> 00:10:38.928
And out at the Horizon it just goes [on] [and] on and it's infinitely far away

00:10:41.249 --> 00:10:46.849
So that's my very quick introduction to hyperbolic geometry we're going to come back to this geometry

00:10:47.579 --> 00:10:49.049
repeatedly

00:10:49.049 --> 00:10:52.129
Let's go on to what the word topology means

00:10:53.939 --> 00:10:56.449
So [Topology], what is it?

00:10:57.809 --> 00:11:01.369
[it's] the study of things that remain invariant

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.400
unchanged when you do deformations here is a

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.900
picture of

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:13.500
What do I mean by a continuous deformation will I take a thing and I squish it and I scrunch it

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.349
and I pull it, but I don't rip or tear it and

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.969
I want to ask. What remains the same well if you like

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:27.719
The fact that there's a little hole [that] I could sort of go through here between her [buck] and her front

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:33.839
It's still here [even] though things are a bit kind of distorted well, there's more the same in these pictures

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.790
But you could distort much more than that. So that's what's topology is about and

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:47.370
Well again, the name of Poincaré comes in so let me introduce Poincaré. I'm sure many people here

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:55.499
well acquainted with Poincare a he was really one of the absolutely great mathematicians of all time [man] smart Mathematician and

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.880
Mathematical Physics he

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.880
contributed to

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.359
enormous numbers of different areas and in particular

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:08.130
He's often known [as] the father of this subject of Topology although

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:14.219
He wasn't quite the first person to do it, but he was really the [first] person he made

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:20.189
Introduced an enormous number of ideas that are still the fundamental tools of this subject

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:24.539
He also of course was the person who

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:32.219
wrote down the Lorentz transformations in their modern form which are used in the theory of relativity special relativity

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.230
He was the person who probably can be credited with the invention

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:44.760
In some sense with the invention of what we now know as Chaos theory so many many things and I rather like this

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.980
quotation which I'll leave you to read

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.320
Felix Klein was one of the leading

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:54.239
German Mathematicians at the sort of later part of the 19th century

00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:02.789
Klein actually drove himself and to have a breakdown trying to compete with Poincaré, and eventually [I] think gave up and

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.400
realised and

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.690
Wrote a lot about Poincaré this rather wonderful tribute

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:17.190
so this is Poincaré as I say his name is going to keep continually cropping up throughout the

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.690
so what about

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:24.830
Surfaces then what can we say about

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.710
surfaces from this Viewpoint of

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:31.909
Topology and perhaps by the time I've said it you will have a bit more feeling

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:36.500
So the idea is we take it easier to see a picture. [here's] [a] surface

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.880
now if you

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:44.479
Take a loop a closed loop on this surface that just kind of goes round it once here

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:50.180
And you cut it of course, it'll come apart and what will [it] look like in Topology?

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:57.919
Well, it would be like a cylinder, but a cylinder is really the same thing if I took a sphere and I cut two

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:00.320
discs out of the cylinder

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:07.640
And then I squashed it so from the Viewpoint of Topology if I make [one] cut through this thing I get a sphere

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.920
with two holes and

00:14:10.529 --> 00:14:12.648
if I took this one

00:14:12.649 --> 00:14:19.099
And I cut each one of the two handle things with a cut and I opened it out

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:24.980
I would find I had a sphere with four holes, and if I did it on this one

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:28.940
I would have a sphere with I think six holes

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.500
so

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:35.779
Here's another one you might think this one is different because it's all twisted up

00:14:35.779 --> 00:14:38.419
It's still like this, but it's all twisted up

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:44.120
but it's only twisted up from the Viewpoint of [how] it's been put inside three dimensional space and

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:46.620
that the

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.900
Classification that we're talking about doesn't see how it's sitting in three dimensional space

00:14:51.089 --> 00:14:57.289
Still if you made one cut it would still fall apart into this sort of cylinder with two ends, so it's still a torus

00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:59.870
So the way we classify

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.060
surfaces

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.879
Here's a rather beautiful. [I]

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:08.929
Think this is a bronze cast it's not very large

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:13.609
I [think] the real thing Carlos [sequin] is another of these kind of computer people

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.990
With a very artistic bent who makes rather wonderful

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:20.370
representations of

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:21.690
Topological

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:26.089
Objects, so it's much harder to see this has got to you can see it's got some

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.379
Holes cut in it, but it's harder to understand. It's got

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.980
It's genus [2] but let's believe that's what it is

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:36.530
so that surfaces

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:43.070
And it took I've told you this in lesson in a couple of minutes it took a long time to sort all this out

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:45.070
So this is not meant to be

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.169
Obvious depends what you think of surfaces to start with?

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:52.879
Anyway, that surfaces now. We're going to now go [into]

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.530
Geometry on surfaces

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:58.160
What can we say about Geometry on surfaces?

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:04.910
So this is one of the very important ideas in [this] talk and one of the important ideas in

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:12.349
the I could say really in the modern study of Topology, what's the

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:15.259
Geometric structure, so

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:19.310
supposing [that] I've got some objects and

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:22.380
supposing that

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:29.630
In a little region around where I'm standing I can manage in some way to measure distance and Angles in

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.269
Such a way that it looks identical with a bit of one of these

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:39.199
basic Geometries, I've talked about so it might look a bit like

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:45.500
this flat euclidean geometry it might look [like] a little piece of sphere, or it might look like a little piece of

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.390
hyperbolic Geometry

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:52.340
So [a] sphere well everywhere I stand on is fear, and I look around me

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.310
I see a little piece of a sphere, so that's not very exciting

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.169
What about a torus so I'm sure that you've seen

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:05.540
Pictures like this you take a rectangle of paper

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:11.150
You glue two sides together to make our cylinder. Here's our cylinder.

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:17.300
You pull the two things round you stick them together and Lo and behold. You've got a torus

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.880
I'll tell you where this picture came from

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:22.290
later

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:29.300
[okay], so we can make a torus actually there's a sort of cheat in this because of course [I] can roll up and make a

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:33.739
cylinder if I try and to do this part

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:37.610
actually if I try and do this in 3D

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:39.750
Naively

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.950
Plainly the things going to all crinkle and crunch all up

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:47.330
It's not going to work very so there is a bit of cheating here

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:53.029
But it's not really cheating because what I'm talking about is what you would see [if] you were [a] fly

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:58.460
This is a kind of abstract concept if you like if you were a fly living here

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:02.150
Well actually or if you even with a fly and you walked across this line

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:06.259
It would be no different [from] going across here, and then coming back in here

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.339
So somehow there is a meaning [to] seeing this thing is basically

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.330
coming from a rectangle cut out of

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
[Euclidian] geometry

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.580
so

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:24.080
The torus has got euclidean structure. So here's a picture

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.949
I take my square, but then if I went across this side

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:33.229
I kind of unfold it and see another copy of the square and another copy and another copy

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:40.459
Really I translate it, but let's not get too detailed here, so you can so here is another picture

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.050
Here's another picture of gluing up this torus

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:50.959
And there's one very crucial feature in doing this that it was very important that

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:57.920
when I glued well first of all when I glued from here to here [that] this plus that

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:05.839
Were to 90 degrees so they made 180 degrees so they met at a straight line, and then when I put the two ends together

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.890
I've got to lots of 180 degrees and

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:14.280
That's um

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:19.849
Those add up to 360 and that makes a nice smooth flat piece

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:22.430
it makes 360 degrees and that's

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:25.759
fine, so there is

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:32.300
What we mean by saying a torus has a euclidean structure, so I've somehow to this surface

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:35.660
attached a natural notion of

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:38.930
Euclidean geometry

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:41.270
Well, what happens

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:42.630
if

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:46.609
I now go to a surface which has got two holes

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.760
genus 2

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:57.229
So here is [a] picture if you follow through this if you would to glue the opposite sides of this thing together

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.630
You can go home and puzzle about this for a long time

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:09.970
But it is true. [I] assure you that if you glue the opposite sides together you're going to have to kind of come round yourself

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:13.120
Maybe go through [yourself] depending

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.390
How you do it?

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:21.999
But you should in the end be able to convince yourself that if you glue it up you come out with a thing like this

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:30.429
Okay, so let us believe that but the trouble is if you took an ordinary octagon

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:36.370
then eight of these corners have got to meet up here and

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:43.569
whatever the angle in an octagon is I think it's 135 degrees if anyway if you glue aided them together

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:48.640
There's no way it makes 360 degrees. It's way way more. It's too much

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:53.949
So you glue [em] together and the angle is much too big so you haven't got a nice?

00:20:54.679 --> 00:20:58.959
Euclidean structure because if you try and cut it out of a piece [of] paper and glue it up

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:04.479
At the last minute you'll have a nasty mess in the middle where it doesn't fit together flats

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:08.259
So what are you going to do about it? Well you remember

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:14.020
That in hyperbolic geometry the angles in a triangle

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:21.880
Don't have to add [up], or don't add up to 180 they add [up] [to] something less [than] 180

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:28.119
and actually you can create triangles whose angles add [up] [to] anything you like less than

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:36.249
180 and here is a really beautiful tiling of the hyperbolic plane in which we've got a nice regular octagon and

00:21:36.679 --> 00:21:38.769
the Angles here have been

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:42.489
manufactured each to be 45 degrees

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:45.489
so when I stick eight of them together

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.059
Lo and Behold I make 360 degrees

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:51.730
so it's nice and

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:53.540
locally

00:21:53.540 --> 00:22:01.389
making the right angle that it should do and so I've created a surface if I could cut this piece of paper out of

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:06.189
hyperbolic paper which has got this kind of curvature, and if I could stick them together

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.910
I would have created the surface of genus 2

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:11.580
and

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:18.230
Actually by just adjusting the angle using this trick. You can make a surface of

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:21.589
any higher genus you like and

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:28.549
this was I suppose known and understood it was being studied a lot in the

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:34.339
1920s and you might say well, so what [actually] [it] became very important because

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:40.429
Anything you want to study about this surface you want to know what closed loops are on it

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.970
Somehow if you look at this pattern [that's] rather complicated

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:53.240
But beautiful pattern you can read off all sorts of things here and one thing you can do is you can study particles?

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:59.630
Sliding around on this surface, and it turns out that by studying the intricacies of this pattern

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.240
and by realising that things

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:08.630
Geodesics in this in this hyperbolic plane they come close together, and then they kind of diverge from each other

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:12.349
and that's the essence of chaotic motion, so

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:15.980
sliding around on one of these surfaces is a

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:24.139
Prototype for what we now call chaotic motion and this was one of the first examples. That was really studied and

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:26.490
introduced the idea of

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:30.769
Randomness and chaotic motion but by a perfectly well-defined formula

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:36.199
So this was in the sort of [1920s] and probably 1930s for that

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:43.370
So let me just recap very fast we have learned that we know how to classify

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:49.880
Surfaces and every surface in a natural way has got a geometry on it

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:54.049
It's either like a sphere or it's like a piece of Euclidean plane

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.820
but in usually

00:23:55.820 --> 00:24:03.559
it's like the hyperbolic plane right so now we are set to proceed [into] three dimensions, so

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:14.420
[my] first problem in this is there is not a normal English language word for the 3D analog of a surface

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.970
Nobody's yet. Come up with a very good word

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:24.169
So a thing that's an analogue of a surface, but in more dimensions is known to mathematicians as a manifold

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:29.899
So we took court talked about a 3-manifolds, [so] what it means is everywhere. You look in a little bit

00:24:29.899 --> 00:24:33.079
it looks like some sort of very squatchy vague version of

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:34.950
three-dimensional space

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:41.960
But it's got all sorts of complicated loops and tubes and holes and goodness knows what's in it. So some very complicated thing

00:24:44.279 --> 00:24:48.379
Well, we just seen how to make a surface by

00:24:48.929 --> 00:24:51.528
gluing up the sides of a hyperbolic octagon

00:24:52.139 --> 00:24:54.679
So supposing we took a hyperbolic polyhedron

00:24:56.159 --> 00:24:57.690
and

00:24:57.690 --> 00:24:59.779
supposing we glued up the faces [if]

00:25:00.419 --> 00:25:02.778
We were lucky we could fix the angles

00:25:03.299 --> 00:25:05.449
So it would all work and they'd fit round

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:10.730
They'd have to fit around the edges nicely and they'd have to fit right at the corners, but if we were clever

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:12.950
we might be able to do it and

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:17.719
We might be able to produce one of these [3-dimensional]

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.649
objects

00:25:19.649 --> 00:25:24.649
which just in the same way that we glued up in 2D and created a

00:25:25.139 --> 00:25:27.859
Surface of some genus we can create

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:34.460
something in 3D which we can say has a hyperbolic structure and

00:25:35.639 --> 00:25:39.439
It comes from this process and now we come to some really

00:25:40.049 --> 00:25:46.158
Amazing pictures just as in 2D we could tile we could kind of unfold the thing the torus

00:25:46.409 --> 00:25:48.409
into a square tiling

00:25:48.659 --> 00:25:50.659
so in 3D

00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:56.479
we can start with for example this which is the same as the one on the previous slide and

00:25:57.299 --> 00:26:01.158
we can unfold it into a tiling of

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.980
three dimensional space, so

00:26:05.399 --> 00:26:10.189
[I] don't quite know how to make a drawing like this like it's amazing, but anyway, so here we are

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:15.529
we've got that the walls of this thing have [been] made transparent so you can see and

00:26:16.169 --> 00:26:22.758
you're sort of seeing through to the cells [if] you like so imagine you could imagine a sort of

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:26.570
A

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:32.809
[cubical] tiling of ordinary Euclidean space this is an [analogue] in Hyperbolic space and Jos

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:40.699
Leys... Jos Leys by the way has a rather nice website with all sorts of pictures in particular. There's a whole section of

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:44.599
Rather Wonderful tilings of Hyperbolic 3-space

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:50.990
Okay, so hyperbolic geometry in 3D. Well it produces some pretty pictures, okay?

00:26:51.929 --> 00:26:53.929
Right okay?

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.600
Before I can go and I have to give you an alternative

00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:58.889
Viewpoints

00:26:58.889 --> 00:27:02.269
if you go back to my original picture about

00:27:03.059 --> 00:27:04.259
hyperbolic Geometry

00:27:04.259 --> 00:27:08.689
sitting inside the spectrum in Minkowski space of special relativity if

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:14.929
You look out to infinity along the light cone. You see it sort of in 2D. You see a circle in 3D

00:27:14.929 --> 00:27:18.859
You'd see a sphere of stuff. That's way out at infinity and

00:27:19.679 --> 00:27:21.679
I

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:24.230
Also, said we can model

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:30.319
Two-dimensional hyperbolic [spaces] the inside of a disc so not surprisingly you can put 3D hyperbolic space

00:27:31.019 --> 00:27:32.850
inside a sphere

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:34.850
So far so good

00:27:35.309 --> 00:27:40.969
So here is a picture another picture by Jos Leys this tiling that we saw

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:45.590
you could stand sort of on the outside of the universe and look in and

00:27:46.259 --> 00:27:49.279
You would see something rather wonderful like this

00:27:50.879 --> 00:27:56.419
Point [quarry] I guess when he was working with these lorentz transformations and special relativity

00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.750
realised that

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.919
the

00:28:01.919 --> 00:28:03.110
Isometries is word

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:10.159
I haven't used...Isometry means a rigid motion a congruence things like that are like congruence is in Euclidean Geometry

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:16.129
So Isometry means keeping the distances the same

00:28:17.399 --> 00:28:18.899
so

00:28:18.899 --> 00:28:21.559
We have something a rigid motion inside

00:28:21.929 --> 00:28:24.739
Hyperbolic space that's moving tiles to other tiles

00:28:25.169 --> 00:28:30.439
But actually it does something to this sphere at infinity and on this sphere at infinity

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:34.909
You [can] calculate the formula now. It's a formula [on] a sphere

00:28:35.549 --> 00:28:36.929
but

00:28:36.929 --> 00:28:38.820
No doubt some of you

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:44.840
know how you can think of the sphere you can project it from the top onto the plane and

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:47.959
You can think of the plane in terms of complex numbers?

00:28:48.509 --> 00:28:50.509
x plus iy

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:54.579
and so if you take the plane together with one points

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:56.420
points at infinity

00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:02.079
[you've] made a sphere, so you can kind of transits really like stereographic projection nothing more than that

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:06.340
So you can translate the formulas into some simple formulas?

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.060
with complex numbers and

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:15.280
we can write down the effects of an isometry of

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:21.910
[three] [dimensional] Hyperbolic space inside the ball we can write down the effects out on the boundary and

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:29.410
This formula at the beauty of this formula is it's just a two by two Matrix or a nice formula like that

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:34.450
And we can just multiply two by two matrices and do all [our] calculations

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:40.239
So instead of having to have some quite complicated 3D stuff. We can work in 2D and

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:44.350
Hope yeah there we go

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:52.060
Now we can see what what I'm doing? Now is I'm showing [you] the effects of a

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:56.260
particular isometry of three dimensional Hyperbolic space

00:29:56.260 --> 00:30:02.109
But I'm just looking out at infinity and watching what it does out at infinity

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:05.829
So this man is getting transported around

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:12.519
And that's why we're watching him waiting for him. Here's the formula

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:22.510
so I just wants you to remember this for later on [and] so everybody will remember this a plus d is an important quantity and

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:26.380
Why is it important well you can see that [this]?

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:33.849
Person is going around in spirals, and he goes forward into a kind of sink, and he goes backwards into a sink

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:40.390
So there are there's a forward sink and a backward sink and in 3D. What's this isometry doing?

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:47.709
there is a hyperbolic geodesic going from a line going from

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:55.270
one end to the other end, so it's a sort of piece of circle or [Saag] and also my boundaries fear and

00:30:56.420 --> 00:31:03.189
This transformation is pushing along this axis and twisting as it goes so it pushes along

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:07.249
And the twisting is you see that effect in [the] spiraling?

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:09.830
So that's what one of these

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:12.649
mappings does so it's very important when

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:18.320
[you] look out at infinity all the facts about being rigid motions

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:22.159
go away, but still a lot of good stuff remains and

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:28.009
just think about this kind of motion along an axis that you translate on you rotates and

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:32.989
That can be read off from this this a plus d number called the trace

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:36.410
okay, so

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:40.399
Now I need to introduce another

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:43.940
idea that was one

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:47.240
Isometry supposing I had two or several isometries

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:52.759
And supposing I do a bit of one and a bit of another [and] a bit of another and a bit of another I keep

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:58.879
Going with them, and I allowed them to go backwards as well, and I pick up the picture of this poor man

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:05.569
And I transport him around this particular one has just got he's got one thing

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:11.779
That's pushing him one way and another thing pushing him another way, and he gets twiddle around and what happens

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:16.369
Instead of the being just two fixed points a source and a sink

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.220
There are actually a whole

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:20.550
continuum of

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:27.080
sources [and] [sing] well a whole countable number of sources and sinks and he get you to see his images get smaller and smaller and

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:33.980
smaller but they go all the way around the edge of this thing and this thing is called the limit set of this collection of

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:36.030
Matrices and

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:40.129
You can also think of it as the chaotic set when you get to that level

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:44.540
Everything's moving around chaotically in fact you don't quite see it in this picture

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:49.820
But there's boundary here is a very complicated and rather beautiful fractal curve

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:53.119
Now I'm not really going to go into this

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:55.910
too much this evening, but

00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:00.110
We explore. I wrote a book some years ago with

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:02.990
these other people and

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:09.799
David Mumford is a very brilliant mathematician David wright was originally a student at Harvard

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:14.479
[he's] also a number theorist, but he's extremely good at

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.059
Computing we wrote a book [explaining]

00:33:18.059 --> 00:33:20.059
How you make pictures like this?

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:27.569
And in particular a number of people have taken that up in particular. Jos Lays used some of our recipes, and that's how he

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:30.120
Created some of his pictures

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:37.530
so let me now start I can now start telling you some more recent Mathematics and

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:41.130
The first thing I'm going to tell you is about

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:45.510
Hyperbolic manifolds, whose volume is finite?

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.319
right well, I take a finite sort of

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:52.410
original Tile or cell

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:59.189
finite size, and I glow up the side so what I get is a finite size, so that's what we're talking about and

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:04.380
we assume that this thing is glued up, so there's no boundary anywhere and

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:13.530
Now there's something about 2D. I didn't tell you if I make for [example] a torus by gluing up a

00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:19.080
rectangle I can make it a long thin rectangle or a short fat rectangle and

00:34:19.869 --> 00:34:24.089
I can actually skew it into a parallelogram and still glue up the sides

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:30.209
So I can do a lot of things and it will still be euclidean, but the tiling of the plane will change

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:37.320
And it turns out in 2D, you can always do that. There's a whole science called tight molar theory about

00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:40.050
how you can deform

00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:45.029
Geometric structures on surfaces in [3D] a

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.060
Theorem

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:55.500
Famous Theorem called the Mostow Rigidity Theorem says in 3D. You can't do that things have fixed. They're rigid

00:34:56.050 --> 00:35:01.619
so what does this thing say supposing I've got two of these finite volume manifolds and

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:04.300
supposing

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.449
Well for the mathematicians supposing

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:09.359
They're fundamental groups or abstractly isomorphic

00:35:09.359 --> 00:35:14.099
But imagine not all of you were mathematicians so supposing

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:21.389
they're topologically the same somehow you know that you can squish one and do all kinds of mess to it forget the Geometry altogether and

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.760
You can get to the other one

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:30.689
Actually, then they're really the same thing there isometric. So rigidly you pick one up, and it's exactly the same I see

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:34.650
So that's what Masters theorem says

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:41.369
And now I'm going to talk about something else. So that was a tile

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:47.460
Which was finite volume I've been more concerned with tiles which have got infinite volume

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:50.219
So here's a picture in 2D

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:55.860
So this particular yellow tile you can see it goes all the way out to infinity, and there's a kind of

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.749
Thickish piece that goes out and that means it's got infinite

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:03.390
size, and

00:36:03.490 --> 00:36:06.569
here's another picture now this picture is a

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:09.660
What you see [at] infinity?

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:13.829
from a 3D tile so imagine I've got my

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:21.809
Hyperbolic space inside the ball, and I'm kind of looking through from the outside in and there's some complicated basic tile

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.049
And it hits the boundary at infinity

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:30.660
And then you can take all the copies of it and so I tile the stuff at infinity

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:37.619
So [that's] what you're seeing in that picture, and you can see how the tiles get smaller and smaller and of course

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:43.470
what do they do they pile up on this same thing the limit set of the group and

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:48.900
If you would take this stuff out at infinity you

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:53.460
[could] play the game [of] gluing up the sides of the tile

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:56.020
but now

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:59.490
We're distorting things by these mobius maps

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:04.019
That have forgotten how to measure distance, but they do know how to measure angles

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:11.009
So you can think that whatever it is. I mean by Riemann surface. It's a kind of structure

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:17.370
That's like geometry that only remembers angles and there was a great deal of work in the 50s and 60s

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:23.730
Studying these things and here's another note famous theorem. It's a bit like him

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:28.440
an [analogue] of the Moscow Theorem, it says

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:32.129
that if I stick up these things

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:37.889
then if I control what happens out it in so it's so

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:44.159
There's a tile and in the middle of hyperbolic space that what we glue up the sides of the tile

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:49.289
And we produce a solid thing that has some bit that goes off out to infinity

00:37:49.869 --> 00:37:53.969
An out at infinity, we have this floppy tile

00:37:53.970 --> 00:38:01.199
that's glued up which only remembers angles and what Berbs theorem says is if I know what happens to the

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:08.219
Angles that there's stuff out at infinity, and I know that for every part of the tile that went out to infinity

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:14.969
Then I know everything then it's fixed so it's sort of like an analogue of [Mostow's] theorem

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:22.139
so hyperbolic manifolds we can think of finite volume we can think of ones with tiles going out to infinity and

00:38:22.779 --> 00:38:27.599
Then there's a rather subtle distinction that probably kind of lost

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:30.750
at the moment, but anyway you can have

00:38:31.329 --> 00:38:37.018
Finitely many sides or infinitely many sides of the tile, so what do we know well

00:38:37.019 --> 00:38:40.259
there's a tile with an infinite number of sides and

00:38:43.779 --> 00:38:47.819
We're sitting inside a tile. It actually only takes two

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.279
Transformations you wouldn't quite believe it

00:38:50.279 --> 00:38:57.809
But because of spiraling that you don't really see it actually only takes two isometries to glue up all of this stuff and [make]

00:38:58.299 --> 00:39:00.299
some complicated manifolds

00:39:00.789 --> 00:39:02.789
So what was known well

00:39:04.299 --> 00:39:08.399
We knew this wonderful monster rigidity theory, but we didn't really have many examples

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:13.920
there was some there were some nice examples, but they were sort of a bit special and

00:39:14.859 --> 00:39:21.268
Almost like curiosities. Maybe some examples to do with number theory then we had the theory

00:39:22.779 --> 00:39:24.779
Bers Theorem and

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:27.839
There's a picture of Bers who was I

00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:31.529
think he was originally finished, but he spent the

00:39:32.319 --> 00:39:39.508
Latter part of his life in the United States originally he worked on fluids, but he got drawn into [this] subject

00:39:42.099 --> 00:39:49.229
So well okay there was this that was pretty much not many examples, but we understood something

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:56.250
something was understood here these were a complete mystery except Bers and

00:39:57.069 --> 00:40:02.789
The work of a few other people said there must be some funny things which don't fall into this category

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:06.120
So there is some that we don't really know anything about still

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:12.689
so that's where we were at and then William Thurston came along, so

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:16.500
[in] the sort of late seventies and early eighties

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:25.349
Thurston started he came into this subject, and he started proving just incredible theorems

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:29.340
Remembering in 2D we knew

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:35.070
That every surface had a certain kind of geometry attached to it either

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.579
Euclidean hyperbolic or spherical

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:43.350
so the first thing that Thurston began doing

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:46.020
Was he started taking

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:50.939
lots of three dimensional manifolds that the topologist kind of Understood

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:52.940
but only in terms of Topology

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:59.999
they didn't know anything about they didn't have anything to do with Geometry he just took these sort of abstract constructs of

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:02.110
Topological

00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:10.110
Objects, and he showed that actually you could impose all the in a natural way [a] hyperbolic structure you could make this

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:13.799
Basic Crystal that you could glue up, and you could make it hyperbolic

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:18.870
So I don't have time to tell you what it's very technical what classes of Manifolds, but

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:23.310
Really very large classes, and this was completely astonishing nobody had

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:28.709
imagined anything like this before one of the classes was if you

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:36.660
Take 3D space, and you draw some complicated [knotted] loop and then you drill that out of space and throw it away

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:38.879
And take everything that's left

00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:45.360
That's the manifold, and he showed that most of those are actually hyperbolic manifolds in a very

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:48.060
precisely defined sense

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:50.430
so

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:56.729
He then went even further and he made something known as the geometrization conjecture [that]

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:06.479
He might ask is it possible then that there's a way of putting Geometry on every three dimensional manifold

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.480
We could do it in 2D well

00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:09.940
you

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:12.750
Nobody before him conceived anything like this

00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:16.950
But he conjectured that in view of all the things he'd already done

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:22.319
and he'd shown were hyperbolic that actually not that there was a

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:27.089
Particular Geometry on every Manifold, but that after you

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:35.250
So just as if I take a curve on a surface and cut it before it opens out if I for example draw a torus

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:38.040
Inside a manifold and cut along that

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:42.449
I'll get two bits of manifold the bit that's on one side and the bit on the other and

00:42:43.089 --> 00:42:48.269
maybe the bits on one side and the bit on the other side separately have some geometry so that's

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:53.849
what he showed, and he also showed there were only eight types of geometry and

00:42:54.880 --> 00:43:01.020
They're all quite simple and in particular. [we've] got spherical, Euclidean, and hyperbolic and

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:04.409
Actually, so he conjectured this was true. I

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:07.859
Didn't prove it to just give you a sense of how

00:43:08.859 --> 00:43:15.239
Sort of what an immense conjecture this was I'm sure many people have heard about the Poincaré conjecture which I will

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.200
come on to

00:43:20.559 --> 00:43:25.019
Let me not say what the Poincaré conjecture is right now people may have heard of it

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:32.999
But the Poincaré conjecture was a problem that throughout the 20th century was basically driving Mathematicians nuts

00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:36.609
and

00:43:36.609 --> 00:43:40.649
Says he not to me is not only that he proved these

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:45.270
Wonderful theorems, but he introduced all sorts of wonderful

00:43:46.299 --> 00:43:48.959
Concepts he was a very visual hands-on

00:43:52.059 --> 00:43:59.489
Mathematician Sadly he died quite young and we're not young, but I mean he was not old you see a couple of years ago

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:04.619
But he was always tremendously keen on getting

00:44:05.079 --> 00:44:11.999
students and schoolchildren a [saw] and doing things by hand and making shapes and playing with shapes and so on So he

00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:18.659
He left an enormous legacy of of ideas and he had so let me

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:21.150
Show my next slide

00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:24.150
so by the time

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:26.890
Thurston Had

00:44:28.249 --> 00:44:33.729
Been working with [a] large group of students who were attracted to work with him

00:44:34.579 --> 00:44:39.339
what has happened in Finite volume closed Manifolds well an

00:44:40.099 --> 00:44:45.729
Enormous amount from being a few [isolated] examples with a good theorem muster rigidity

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:49.599
It became a huge big subject huge big area

00:44:50.809 --> 00:44:54.849
Large large large classes of Manifolds are actually

00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:56.960
hyperbolic and

00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:02.859
A great deal of effort went into writing up sort of nice versions of his proofs and so on

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:08.289
here's a picture of this and more reason there was a big conference on his 60th birthday and

00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:15.609
All of these students of his have them in themselves and of themselves made large contributions to Mathematics

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:22.720
so this case well let me just say it was recast from A

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:27.039
Subject that was mainly about mobius maps out of infinity

00:45:27.529 --> 00:45:31.689
into something to do with Topology and Geometry and 3D and

00:45:33.079 --> 00:45:36.548
This rather mysterious thing that must exist well

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:40.390
Thurston did not

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:45.849
Solve the problem, but he began to tell us what to do

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:53.470
So what has happened since the year?

00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:56.950
2000

00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:58.460
well

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:00.460
these two conjectures

00:46:01.069 --> 00:46:06.849
[which] I only had told you what the poincare conjecture is but the poincare conjecture and this

00:46:07.249 --> 00:46:10.809
Geometrization conjecture, which is much bigger and includes the poincare conjecture

00:46:11.809 --> 00:46:14.349
Then there are three things whose names

00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:23.109
Won't mean anything, but three other very important things which Thurston and some of his school put together

00:46:23.749 --> 00:46:30.009
that between them if you understood this you would have understood this mysterious exotic case and

00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:32.680
People really didn't know how to do this stuff

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:37.540
Maybe they had a little bit of idea about how to do this as I'll show you but really

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:40.300
Beyond that there was a lot of

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:42.590
unknown stuff and

00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:45.969
What have we done used to show you mathematicians been quite busy?

00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:49.070
so famously

00:46:49.070 --> 00:46:52.239
With an enormous amount of press coverage Grigori Perelman

00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:59.949
Proved the poincare conjecture [right] that I mean depends when you think a theorem was proved that from the time the person first

00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:06.519
Announces the proof to the time when it gets checked and possibly published can be really quite long in mathematics

00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:08.520
So dates are a little bit

00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:15.129
so Perelman proved this Poincaré conjecture whatever that says and then

00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:17.890
based on these methods

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:19.520
this

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:26.469
Perelman went further and he explained her to use his ideas which were completely coming from a completely different direction to

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:31.689
[prove] geometrization he left a little some gaps that have been filled in

00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:36.069
Then these three things [all] of these were large

00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:41.469
Pieces of work, so we've kind of done it all you know everything

00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:47.889
Right [so] let me tell you in a little bit more detail. What's the Poincaré conjecture?

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:55.419
the Poincaré conjecture in 2D if I draw a loop on a sphere I

00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:58.030
can shrink it down to a point.

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:05.020
So I could ask the opposite question if I had a surface such at any time. I drew a loop on [it]

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:07.149
I could shrink it down to a point on the surface

00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:10.869
Would it be a sphere and that's part of how you classify?

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:15.550
surfaces so it's true that if I gave you a surface and

00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:18.099
Every loop that. You could draw around the surface

00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:23.889
So here's a torus [I] can draw a loop so [this] orange thing rounds here

00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:28.960
And no matter how I move it around and stretch and twist, [I] will never get rid [of] it

00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:31.020
I can't shrink it down to nothing

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:37.869
So I can detect if I was a fly I could detect whether I was on a sphere or on the torus

00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:40.899
By looking at these loops and could I shrink them [down] or not?

00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:46.630
So an innocuous sounding thing supposing I went up to 3D

00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:53.450
Three dimensional thing if I was in a three dimensional sphere I could do the same thing could shrink everything to a point

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:57.379
What happens the other way [around] if I could shrink everything would it be a sphere?

00:48:58.170 --> 00:49:00.710
Well you might think that wouldn't be so hard

00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:08.329
But actually it's incredibly hard. I'm really incredibly hard and all sorts of people tried and

00:49:09.569 --> 00:49:11.130
There were many

00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:18.410
Sort of incorrect proofs that were announced and then people worked hard and found the mistake in them and this went on and on

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.299
Another slightly strange thing in mathematics you might not be able to do something in three dimensions

00:49:26.299 --> 00:49:28.639
So let's try and go to higher dimensions. Maybe it's easier

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:32.000
And it's kind [of] easier because there's more space

00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:36.199
So it's kind of it's [harder] to think about it. We don't think about it

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:42.649
[you] can just move things so you can kind of move things out [of] the way and move them around each other and so

00:49:43.289 --> 00:49:45.349
It could be proved in

00:49:47.039 --> 00:49:52.189
Dimensions greater than or equals five and then it was proved in Dimension 4 and it was still sitting there

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:55.190
unsolved in Dimension 3 and

00:49:55.829 --> 00:49:59.268
Some big prizes the claimed Millennium prizes were set up

00:50:00.839 --> 00:50:03.949
Just before the year 2000 of some outstanding

00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:08.839
Problems of mathematics there was going to be a million-dollar prize for the solution of any of these

00:50:08.970 --> 00:50:11.539
the Poincaré conjecture was one of them and

00:50:13.079 --> 00:50:17.929
Well just about the time Grigori Perelman you see here

00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:24.709
Proved it and he used. I'm not an expert on this at all, but his methods were completely different

00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:30.049
He started with not a homogeneous kind of metric at all, but a way of measuring distance

00:50:30.049 --> 00:50:36.319
That was just sort of anything and as a clever way of kind of smoothing it out. Smoothing it out

00:50:36.359 --> 00:50:38.808
smoothing it out and you come to

00:50:39.839 --> 00:50:46.159
Sort of singularities, and you have to get round and cleverly but eventually you proved that this thing that you

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:48.740
Didn't know was a sphere has to be a sphere

00:50:49.769 --> 00:50:54.019
and then he went on in outlines how to prove geometrization and

00:50:54.839 --> 00:50:59.989
using similar methods and as I say the word there was some some gaps, but they've been for

00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:07.010
Okay, and then we have the other three conjectures which is more the direction

00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:14.300
I've been involved in so here's a picture one of the things this and did he didn't have time to write up his stuff

00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:17.930
nicely just throwing out ideas [everyday], but there is a

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:19.890
huge

00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:23.779
volume known as Thurston's notes which with lectures he gave and

00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:26.420
were typed up and

00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:30.020
the sort of beginning part has now been

00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:36.469
Very beautifully [edited] and filled in and produces a book the latter part is still sitting there

00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:41.269
You can find it online of course here's a picture about

00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:45.680
So we've got this manifold with infinite volume and the thing is

00:51:46.590 --> 00:51:50.690
What he said, it looks like you don't really don't know what happens as [it] goes off to [infinity]

00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:54.679
but what he said it might look like is this you might have [a]

00:51:55.830 --> 00:52:02.059
Surface and then just take copies of the surface all the way going up and create a three-dimensional object

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.430
So just like you can take a circle

00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:08.809
And then a line and make a cylinder you can take a surface of some kind

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.270
genus 2 in this picture and go up

00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:18.440
And you make a 3D thing and the key point really was that as you go out along here in

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:23.240
These weird examples these exotic examples there would be

00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:31.969
Geodesic loops that wouldn't be getting very long all the way out along this thing forever and ever so the on the face of it

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:33.240
this

00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:36.140
End of this manifold is infinite volume bit

00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:41.059
We couldn't understand might have done anything it might have been twisted in all kinds of terrible Wild ways

00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:43.850
but actually he sort of tamed it and

00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:51.500
This timeless conjecture says that well maybe it always looks like this so Thurston showed in certain cases

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:55.520
it looks like this and then Thurston also showed that

00:52:57.870 --> 00:53:01.549
Well, how would you recognise which type it was?

00:53:02.070 --> 00:53:08.719
It turns out these curves that go sort of lie on these surfaces these geodesic loops that go out and out and out

00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:11.959
They you can sort of think of them like rational numbers

00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:19.310
And they have a limit which is some kind of irrational number an object thirst and introduced called a geodesic

00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:21.830
Lamination and

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:24.380
what he conjectured was if

00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:27.140
you knew what the

00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:34.969
Irrational numbers as it were connected to each of these ends were then you'd know everything well that seems pretty remarkable

00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:37.669
But actually turns out. That's true

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:39.890
Not only is it true

00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:44.209
If you know what happens on the ends here actually you can more or less

00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:50.089
Reconstruct everything that happens in the middle and this was not thirst and this was largely yair, Minsky

00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:54.439
working with various other people introducing some really beautiful mathematics and

00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:58.429
understanding the kind of course Geometry of the whole

00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:03.650
Hyperbolic manifold [just] from a very small [amount] [of] Data about [the] ends

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:10.100
And then finally well could there be any of these things kind of sitting out there?

00:54:10.170 --> 00:54:11.700
We don't know where they are

00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:13.700
Well the answer is no they couldn't

00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:18.470
They'd always have to be limits the ones that we knew about and it turned out that once

00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:21.890
We kind of got this far. This bit was

00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:30.799
Fairly Routine and quite routine, but it was more obvious to see how to go about proving that so that was also proved

00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:40.489
right well now I don't know if I have time, but let me try to go very quickly through so

00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:45.830
You I'd say we've solved all the problems. So we one thing I didn't say was

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:55.250
These [three-dimensional] things you can put geometry on them. We know a great [deal] now about the geometry examples

00:54:56.220 --> 00:55:03.140
It actually turns out that if you in many senses pick a manifold at random. It's going to be hyperbolic

00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:05.390
Just as most surfaces are hyperbolic

00:55:05.730 --> 00:55:11.540
so in three dimensions by far the most common thing to happen is for your

00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:16.610
manifold to be hyperbolic, so hyperbolic has gone from being a kind of

00:55:17.730 --> 00:55:19.230
slight

00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:24.770
Sideshow to something really fundamental, and I would say we're at a point now. Where we kind of understand

00:55:26.110 --> 00:55:32.069
But I said that surfaces were used for example to develop things to do with Chaos theory

00:55:32.770 --> 00:55:35.820
People are playing now, but I think the facts

00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:42.630
We now know about these [three-dimensional] things are surely going to come into play [in] the future in ways that we haven't as yet

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:44.680
Understood

00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:46.600
ok so

00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:49.499
well very fast okay, so

00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:54.299
discreteness so discrete means

00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:57.060
That you can move things away

00:55:57.940 --> 00:56:03.900
Frigid motions of some tiling you can move the tile away from itself and it never comes back and hits itself

00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:11.729
On the other hand if you start [rotating] thing and you go rounds an irrational angle

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:18.209
an angle that's that's not commensurable with [2PI] then you can go round and

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.110
You'll come back, but you won't come [back] exactly on top of yourself

00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:27.569
And you'll keep going round and round and [round] and you'll end up producing a picture like this and the longer you go the more

00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:30.239
It's the [more] you'll overlap yourself

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:32.880
So being discrete is kind of nice

00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:37.650
let me just skip here and

00:56:38.350 --> 00:56:44.069
Then let me just show you my last slide, so I don't have time to tell you that but let me just leave you with

00:56:46.030 --> 00:56:48.300
this last picture, so

00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:53.099
Just a picture of what it looks like to fly around in

00:56:54.130 --> 00:56:56.130
three dimensional

00:56:56.170 --> 00:56:59.100
hyperbolic space [this] picture was made by

00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:08.250
this Geometry center which was part of the offshoots of all the flurry of activity round cisterns work, so

00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:11.400
I'll leave you that thank you [very] much

00:57:19.590 --> 00:57:25.729
What would a galaxy your solar system look like in the universe with hyperbolic geometry?
