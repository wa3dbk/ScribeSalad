Now that our application logic and our resources are stored

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.730
in the app cache, let's talk about how we store

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.980
data locally. There are several different ways to store data

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.290
locally, many of which have developed over time. So let's

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.970
cover each of these briefly. Local storage is the oldest

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.690
and most basic of the storage APIs. It let's you

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.220
get and set key value pairs and iterate through all

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.100
the keys. However, each value is just a string and

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.180
each domain can only store a total between two

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.659
and five megabytes in local storage, depending on the browser.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:36.000
There's no real searching capability. You can index through all

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.390
the keys one at a time, or you can ask

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.390
for the value associated with a particular key, but

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.250
that's basically it. The local storage API is really simple

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.010
to use, take a look at how you can store

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.390
an item using setItem, retrieve the value for a particular

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.690
item with getItem. You can remove one

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.910
key value pair with removeItem, iterate through all

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.595
the key values pairs with length key and

00:00:59.595 --> 00:01:02.960
getIitem or clear the entire local storage system.
