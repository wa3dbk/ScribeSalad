00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.060
Throughout this lesson and the last,

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.040
we've discussed many ways to help you
find and connect with your audience.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.790
Because the most challenging time for

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.970
a new company is when you
start growing your user base.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.190
There are many tips out there to gain
your first thousand users and beyond.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.240
Your first real users are critical.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.160
These are people who aren't
just your friends and

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.182
family that are testing out your app.

00:00:21.182 --> 00:00:24.640
You want to pay attention to what the
real people are saying about your app,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.080
and how they're rating it.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.810
Now think about it from a user's
point of view for a second.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.650
Not many people are going to want to
download an app with only ten downloads.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.620
So you'll need to show new users that
your app actually means something to

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.380
the people who are actually using it,
and who are enjoying it.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.310
Now, let's go back to our
entrepreneurs to learn a few more tips

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.140
about growing your user base and hearing
about the real world experience creating

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.310
companies that started
just like yours is today.
