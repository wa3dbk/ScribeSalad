00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.344
Hi, I'm Gabrielle and
I'm going to be your instructor for

00:00:03.344 --> 00:00:05.675
this short course on Swift Syntax.

00:00:05.675 --> 00:00:08.870
Swift is already having a huge
impact on iOS development.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.910
It's fast, concise, easy to read, and
comes with tools like playgrounds that

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.000
make it easier than ever
to visualize your code.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.100
A welcoming language for beginner and
intermediate programmers,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.030
Swift makes the road to building your
own iOS apps considerably less steep.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.360
Fantastic resources for
learning Swift are easy to find.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.210
Not least among them is Apple's guide,
The Swift Programming Language

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.980
which we hope you'll come
to rely on as a reference.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.495
This course hopes to offer something
that is less common among other Swift

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:39.990
resources, practice.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.702
Throughout the course, we'll be
working through examples together, and

00:00:43.702 --> 00:00:46.486
each lesson will end with a set
of exercises to get you more

00:00:46.486 --> 00:00:48.757
comfortable with Swift's idiosyncrasies.

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:52.071
We'll start out with some basics
of types and operators and

00:00:52.071 --> 00:00:56.187
practice manipulating strings and
declaring variables and constants.

00:00:56.187 --> 00:00:59.272
Then we'll move on to what is
arguably Swifts most unique and

00:00:59.272 --> 00:01:00.483
confounding feature.

00:01:00.483 --> 00:01:02.143
Optional types.

00:01:02.143 --> 00:01:04.885
We'll talk about collections and
control flow,

00:01:04.885 --> 00:01:07.834
including lots of practice
with switch statements.

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:10.240
Functions and classes.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.040
Enumerations and structs.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.080
Which are considerably more powerful
in Swift than in other languages.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.410
Protocols.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.510
And will wrap things up by
exploring closure expressions.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.170
Which can be tricky at first, but

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.810
wonderfully convenient once
you get the hang of them.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.040
This course is designed for

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.350
programmers who have some prior
object oriented experience.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.130
For students who,
through work with other languages

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.851
are already familiar with most of
the concepts I've just listed.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.490
So let's get started with Swift types.
