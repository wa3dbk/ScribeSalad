00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.953
I'll start with the small layout.

00:00:02.953 --> 00:00:08.760
At min-width 450 pixels, the only
real change from the default, is that

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.538
the light blue and the green elements
both take up 50% of the viewport.

00:00:12.538 --> 00:00:17.070
So, at min-width 450 pixels,
I set width 50% for

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.260
the light blue and the green elements.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.006
So far, so good.

00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:26.300
At min-width 550 pixels,
it looks like the only difference is

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.640
that now the red box only takes up 40%
of view port, while the orange box,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.830
takes up 60% of the view port.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.690
So, I made my change,
and well to be honest,

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.150
this doesn't quite look
like what I expected.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.070
I thought the red box would be
probably a little bit farther over.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.660
So you know what, let's go ahead and
change something.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.440
Inside Dev Tools, I'll change that 40%,
which I was mistaken about.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.080
And I'll change that to 33%,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.493
which means that the width of
the orange box needs to be 66.6%.

00:00:54.493 --> 00:00:58.420
I was a little bold there and instead
of testing first, I just went ahead and

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.690
set the widths inside my source code,
but looking at this height,

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.940
this isn't actually what I expected.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.330
I think the orange isn't
taking up enough space, and

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.940
I think the red is taking
up too much space.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.430
So, I think I'll use devtools
to make some adjustments.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.250
Instead of 40 60, I'll go ahead and
make it one-third and two-thirds.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.144
So, red becomes 33.3%,
and orange becomes 66.6%.

00:01:21.144 --> 00:01:24.910
All right, that's looking a lot better.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.380
And lastly, there's min-width,
800 pixels.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.320
The only difference between 550 and
800 pixels, is that with 800 pixels,

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.770
there are now left and right margins.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.540
At the break point with
the min-width of 800 pixels.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.270
I went ahead and
set a fixed width of 800 pixels and

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.480
then a margin left and
margin right of auto.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.620
With a quick save and
a refresh of the browser,

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.305
it looks like the page now has
margins on the left and right.

00:01:51.305 --> 00:01:52.890
Already, that looks pretty good.
