So go ahead and take a look at

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:05.320
the documentation and objectify for custom indexes. I

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.850
want you to figure out what's the code

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.070
to index the city property of a conference,

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.020
only if it's not in the default city. So, when you've figured out the code to

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.770
index the city, only if it's not the

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.640
default value, come and enter the value here.
