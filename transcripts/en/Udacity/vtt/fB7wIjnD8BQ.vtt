00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And the answer is rabbit. Tada!

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I figured that was a good animal to use for a magic trick and have it come out of the hat.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
But how did that work? There wasn't anything tricky about the code itself.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It really is literally doing what I said, which is taking the weights that you give it,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
multiplying them by the feature values for each of the animals computing a score and then sorting.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Here's what happens when I gave it the values that I just had in the code here,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and you see that just like the numbers that you used with the numbers that I used,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
rabbit ended up in this fourth position and in this position, that's labeled no. 3.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But you can change these values.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
You get a different ordering for everything, but you always get rabbit coming out in that position.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And so that's the little bit of trickiness, right?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I had to set things up so that rabbit would always come out in exactly this position.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The other ones can change values, but rabbit can't.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And the way that I did this is by making sure that in all of these lists

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
all these different feature values, the rabbit was always the fourth highest

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and it was always higher than mouse, frog, and sparrow

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and always smaller than dog, shark, lion, horse, human, hippopotamus, and elephant.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
They can have different orderings relative to each other,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
but they always have to have the same ordering relative to rabbit.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And so once we've actually combined all these weights together,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
what we'll find is that whatever the weight is that the total score is going to be for rabbit--

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
for example, horse has to be bigger because it's bigger on every single one of the dimensions

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
when we take this non-negative weighted combination--

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
it's going to keep that property as it is and that's the magic trick.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
There's one other thing I could've done, but I didn't do,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
which is to have two different animals who always have exactly opposite values on some feature.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
That no matter what combination I used, they're either, let's say frog and shark, that either

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
frog is below and shark is above or shark is above and frog is below.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
But I wanted to stay as close as possible to the actual values that I was able to find on the Internet.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
As you might imagine, these aren't actually the values that I found.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I found values and then I tweaked them to make sure that the property held.
