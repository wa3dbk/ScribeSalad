00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's go through this one in parts.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Any regular expression starts with r' or r".

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm going to use the single quotes this time so that I won't have to escape

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
quite as many of these.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Then we want to match the blue " here at the beginning,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and somewhere way at the end, we'll want to match the closing one,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and that will be the end of our regular expression.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So now we just have to think of what goes in here in the middle,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and this may not be enough room. I may have to erase it and write it again.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now whatever it is, it's going to be 0 or more of something,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and as we're going across the string, there's sort of backslashes,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
which are important, and everything else, which is not so important.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So if there's any character that's not a backslash,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and here I'm escaping the backslash,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
we can just read right over it--that's no problem inside of our string--

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
or you could actually have an escape sequence, like this \".

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
That looks like a literal backslash, followed by anything, and then it's done.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So let me just diagram this a little more.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Say this opening quote is 1, that matches things like this opening quote in the string.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Then in here, we have anything that's not a backslash--that's 2.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
That's I-space-say-s-a-y-comma,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
but then eventually we do get to a backslash.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Over here, we have a 2-character sequence that's a backslash followed by a dot.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
These 2 characters--the backslash, followed by the quote--they are 3,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and then we're back to matching 2's--h, e, l, l, o, dot.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Now we have another backslash and a quote, so these 2 together will be another 3,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and then this part at the end is number 4.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
So I have 0 or more copies of my string body.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The elements of my string body are either normal characters

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
or 2-character escape sequences.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
All of this looks like 3 characters. It's really just 2.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I have to escape the backslash.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
As a minor aside, after the Beatles and Sound of Music examples from above,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
you may not be surprised to know that a number of English songs

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.000
of enduring popularity--ABC 123, BINGO--seem to have a regular expression sort of feel.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Repetition is very common in songs, and you get the same thing out of it

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
that you get out of a regular expression,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
a concise notation versus in choruses, but then when you expand it out,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
it takes a long time to sing.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
However, there is 1 song that is actually too complicated for regular expressions--

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
the dreaded 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
If you actually want the counting to work out correctly--

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
99 to 98 to 97--we can't fit it in a regular expression framework.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
We'll have to return to that later, and eventually we'll be smart enough to sing this song.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
For more info on this, Don Knuth, the computer scientist has written an essay

00:02:48.000 --> 09:59:59.000
on the complexity of songs.
