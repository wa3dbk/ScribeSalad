00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So I said there were 2 main differences between strings and lists.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The first we've seen already is that a list can hold

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
anything we want, whereas a string, the elements could only be characters.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The second big difference between lists and strings

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
is that lists support mutation.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Mutation sounds a little bit scary, and in some ways it is scary.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It makes it much harder to understand what our programs mean,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
but it's also very powerful.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What mutation means is we can change the value of a list

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
after we've created it.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
To explain what that means and to see why it's so different

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
from the behavior we can get with strings,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
let's recap what happens with strings.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We can create a string. We can store it in a variable.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We can change the value of the variable

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
by creating a new string.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So what's going on there, it's changing the value of s,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
but it's not changing the value of the string.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
When we did the first statement, this one,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
it created a string with the value "Hello,"

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and it introduced a variable, s, which referred to that string.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
When we execute the second statement,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
that creates a new string

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
with the value "Yello," and it changes s

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
to refer to that new string.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It hasn't changed the string that we created with the value Hello.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We just don't have a way to refer to that any more.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
With strings, we can also use the + operator to concatenate 2 strings.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It looks like this is changing the value of the string.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
You might think that the result of this is, well, now the string

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that was previously Yello spelled wrong is now Yellow

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
spelled with the w added at the end.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
But that's not actually what happens.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
We don't actually modify the string we had.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
What happens when we use the + operator,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
it creates a completely new string where the value of the new string

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
is the result of concatenating the 2 input strings.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
When we execute the third statement,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
first a new string with the value w is created.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Then when we do the concatenation,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
it doesn't modify the previous string that we've created.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It creates a whole new string

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
which will have the value "Yellow" spelled with a w.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And then the assignment changes what s refers to

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
to refer to the new string.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Now let's see what we can do with lists.
