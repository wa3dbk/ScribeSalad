00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.350
These are the correct answers, great work if you found those two. For the first

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.500
one, we want to start by multiplying our numbers together, and our variables

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.358
together. We'll have 20 times 2, which equals 40, x to the 5th times x squared

00:00:12.358 --> 00:00:18.760
which x to the 7th. The y squared times y to the 4th, which y to the 6th. Since

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.525
under a cube root, we want to find factors that appear three times. We can

00:00:23.525 --> 00:00:28.582
split up 40 into 8 times 5 since the cubed root of 8 equals 2. We have to leave

00:00:28.582 --> 00:00:32.828
the 5 inside of our cube root since this factor doesn't appear 3 times. It's

00:00:32.828 --> 00:00:36.234
not a perfect cube. Finally we deal with our variables by using power divided

00:00:36.234 --> 00:00:41.730
by root. 7 divided by 3 is 2 remainder 1, so we'll have x squared on the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.389
outside and x to the 1 on the inside. The cubed root of y to the 6th, is just 6

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:52.485
divided by 3, so y squared comes out. This gives us our final result, I hope

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:56.390
you found it. For the second one, we want to start by distributing 3 root 2 to

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.390
each of these radical terms. Pull out 3 root 2 times root 18, and 3 root 2

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.506
times negative 2 root 6. For the first term we'll multiply these two radicals

00:01:08.506 --> 00:01:13.484
together to get 3 root 36. For our second term, we'll multiply 3 times negative

00:01:13.484 --> 00:01:19.820
2, which equals negative 6, and root 2 times 6, which equals root 12. The

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.322
square root of 36 equals 6, and then we can break down the square root of 12

00:01:22.322 --> 00:01:27.349
into the square root of 4 times 3. We simplify further, by multiplying 3 times

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:32.210
6, which is 18, and then we take the square root of 4, which is 2. We multiply

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.370
these two numbers together to give us our final answer, 18 minus 12 root 3.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.703
Nice work if you found that one as well.
