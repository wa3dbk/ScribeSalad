00:00:00.078 --> 00:00:02.480
So now let's take a quick break and have a recap

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.300
of what we just discussed. I want you to think about what

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.850
are the major causes of the software crisis. I'm going to provide you

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.250
a set of possibilities and I would like for you to mark

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.160
all that apply. Was that increasing costs of computers? Was it increasing

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.990
product complexity, or maybe the lack of programmers? Or was it, instead,

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.000
this slow programmers productivity growth? The

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.540
lack of funding for software engineering

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.210
research? The rise in demand for software? And finally, was it maybe

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.500
the lack of caffeine in software

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.570
development organizations? Again, mark all that apply.
