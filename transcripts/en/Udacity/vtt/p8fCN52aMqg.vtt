00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.980
So if we start by looking at a varying number of elements per row,

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.914
what we've just seen is that the thread per element approach

00:00:05.914 --> 00:00:08.251
is insensitive to the structure of the matrix,

00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:10.914
whereas if we have a varying number of elements per row,

00:00:10.914 --> 00:00:12.991
thread per row suffers from load imbalance

00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:15.797
and it has a runtime dependent on the longest row.

00:00:15.797 --> 00:00:19.892
So of these 2 methods, thread per element is probably a better choice.

00:00:19.892 --> 00:00:23.640
It's completely insensitive to the structure of the matrix.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.325
But on the other hand, if our matrices have roughly the same number of elements in each row,

00:00:28.325 --> 00:00:29.622
which is better?

00:00:29.622 --> 00:00:31.888
Well, now there's really no load imbalance issues,

00:00:31.888 --> 00:00:35.036
and that's the primary disadvantage with the thread per row approach.

00:00:35.036 --> 00:00:38.420
And in this case, where we have a similar number of elements per row,

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:45.345
it turns out that thread per row is roughly 3 times faster than thread per element. How come?

00:00:45.346 --> 00:00:50.003
Well, in thread per row, all of the partial products are accumulated within a single thread,

00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:51.615
so they're going to communicate through registers

00:00:51.615 --> 00:00:54.240
and there's no communication between threads at all.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.966
In thread per element, on the other hand,

00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:59.297
the segmented scan operation requires communicating between threads

00:00:59.297 --> 00:01:02.794
to sum up the partial products. That communication is more expensive.

00:01:02.794 --> 00:01:06.411
So, because we have different performance characteristics here,

00:01:06.411 --> 00:01:08.780
it's kind of a head-scratcher problem.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.649
Which data structure do we choose,

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.044
given that we probably don't know what the structure of the matrix is

00:01:14.044 --> 00:01:15.776
before we need to make this call?
