00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.730
So now, we know that everything we think and do happens because of nerve cells.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.264
As it turns out, nerve cells are not alone. There are actually two main types

00:00:08.264 --> 00:00:12.766
of cells in the central nervous system. The glial cells and the neurons, or the

00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:19.070
nerve cells. The glial cells, as seen here, provide structural support. They

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.247
support the efficient communication between neurons. In addition, they also

00:00:23.247 --> 00:00:28.643
help my removing cellular debris. Glial actually means glue in Greek. It helps

00:00:28.643 --> 00:00:32.508
to hold the central nervous system together. The glial cells also help form the

00:00:32.508 --> 00:00:36.810
blood-brain barrier, and play a role in the control of breathing. The neurons

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.682
are cells that process and transmit information in the nervous system. They

00:00:41.682 --> 00:00:44.898
receive information, they integrate that information, and then they generate

00:00:44.898 --> 00:00:50.281
messages. There are approximately ten billion neurons in the human brain. And

00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:53.336
even though they're located very close together, most of them don't actually

00:00:53.336 --> 00:00:59.225
touch. Each neuron has about ten thousand connections to other neurons. Which

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:03.470
allows for literally trillions and trillions of neural connections. This makes

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.710
the brain one of the most complex structures we know.
