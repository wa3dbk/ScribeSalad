00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.950
Now, of course, using the scaling process here, we kind of allow the algorithm to make errors

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.790
and what I would now like you to think about is what kind of error are we introducing

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.620
by using this scaling method.

00:00:13.620 --> 99:59:59.000
So dividing by that quantity here and then rounding down.
