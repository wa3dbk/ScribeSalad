Jess, you were trying to move all
this code around in the last video.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:05.470
It was really hard for me to follow.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:06.826
What was up with that?

00:00:06.826 --> 00:00:09.859
&gt;&gt; Okay, so with that, I wanted to
create a compact repeatable set of

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:13.111
instructions that could repeat
multiple times, and then take that and

00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:14.700
put it into a loop in Java.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.870
&gt;&gt; Wait, a loop?

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.
So remember,

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.630
the loop allows you to execute
the same instruction over and

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.840
over again, until certain conditions are
met, and then you pop out of the loop.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.567
&gt;&gt; Okay, so the instructions could be,
create a new text field and

00:00:26.567 --> 00:00:30.720
then display this string, and
then add this TextView to the ListView.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.770
&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, so we repeat
that same set of instructions for

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.110
every element in the list.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.730
So for example,

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.930
we start with index zero, take that
value and display it as a TextView.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.170
And then we do index one, take that
value and display it in the TextView.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.260
And then we move up to index two, take
that value and display as a TextView.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.430
&gt;&gt; Okay, I think we got it.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.700
Okay, so then in the end,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.660
you end up with a list of ten TextViews
that show the numbers one through ten.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.170
&gt;&gt; Okay.
