If you've ever bought something online, you know how annoying it is to enter

00:00:03.032 --> 00:00:07.160
all those numbers on a credit card. It's pretty easy to mess up one or two.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.760
It's even more annoying for the people trying to charge the credit card so they

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.860
can sell you things. Luckily, the designers of credit cards back in the day

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.472
thought about this. All credit card numbers have to follow a kind of pattern,

00:00:16.472 --> 00:00:19.370
and there's an algorithm that uses the pattern to figure out if the customer

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.932
has accidentally switched 2 numbers in their credit card. The algorithm has a

00:00:23.932 --> 00:00:27.592
similar structure for the code for calculating the sum of digits. It starts

00:00:27.592 --> 00:00:31.188
with the sum of zero, and a count of zero. And then for each digit, starting

00:00:31.188 --> 00:00:34.248
from the right, we increment the count, and if the count is odd, we add the

00:00:34.248 --> 00:00:39.630
digit to the sum. Else, if the count is not odd, and the digit is less than 5,

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.852
we add twice the digit to the sum. Else, if count is even and the digit is

00:00:45.852 --> 00:00:53.200
greater than 5, we add twice the digit to the sum and subtract 9. And then,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.510
after all of that, if the last digit of the sum is 0, the card number is valid.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.638
How would you write java code for this algorithm? We'll give you the code for

00:01:02.638 --> 00:01:05.725
so many digits so you can adapt it, and also, you have this credit card number

00:01:05.725 --> 00:01:10.999
that you can use to test. And here's a hint: credit card numbers are too big to

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:14.624
fit in an int. This problem is tricky, there are a lot of ways to write code

00:01:14.624 --> 00:01:18.698
which almost works, but not quite. It will be very important to use a tester

00:01:18.698 --> 00:01:22.198
program. Also, you can write print line statements to get an idea of what's

00:01:22.198 --> 00:01:24.578
happening while your code is running.
