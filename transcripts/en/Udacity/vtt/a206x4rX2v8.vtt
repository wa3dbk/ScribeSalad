00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.630
The Reduce operation is pretty clear.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:07.610
So the idea is that, this level,
we have a full resolution, or,

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.140
or whatever level, and then we
want to take the next level down.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.960
So here's a way of thinking about it,
we'll just number these.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.560
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.150
Nine pixels across.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.020
I actually don't have to produce the
pixels that would go under two, four,

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.030
six, and eight.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:25.990
Because I'm just going to,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.890
I only want half the number of
pixels that I had to start with.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.120
So in fact what this does is, it simply
says I'm going to take some location,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.310
here I use the middle, and I'm going to
take what's called a 5-tap Filter.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.519
And here are the filters,
see it's one-sixteenth, four-sixteenth,

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:46.807
six-sixteenth, four-sixteenth,
one-sixteenth.

00:00:46.807 --> 00:00:50.703
And that's, that's what these numbers
are, one-sixteenth, one-fourth,

00:00:50.703 --> 00:00:53.086
three-eighth one-fourth, one-sixteenth.

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:55.367
Okay?
That's the filter that I use to get

00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:58.000
the odd pixel here in the middle.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.180
Now that's just in one scan line.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.130
I'm working with images.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.530
How do I do this?

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.349
Okay.
Go way back in your notes,

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:07.070
because I know you all are taking co,
copious notes.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.040
I almost said y'all.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.360
When I say y'all, Megan's going to
throw that monitor at me.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.920
Okay?

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.220
Nothing against my friends from
the south, but I come from New York,

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.200
went to school in Boston.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.320
If I actually said y'all,
I think I'd get shot by my relatives.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.850
Anyway, You all have seen this before.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.190
We talked about Separable Filters.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.890
Right?
So a separable filter was, instead of

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.210
applying a square filter, to the filter,
I apply one, one dimensional filter

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.310
horizontally and then often it's the
same one dimensional filter vertically.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.040
So go back up and
remember about separable filters.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.920
The reduce operator uses
a separable filter,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.800
a 5-tap separable filter first in
the rows, then in the columns.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.400
All right.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.410
That one was straightforward.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.850
The Expand operator is
a little bit trickier.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.760
And you can tell that by
looking at this awful picture.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.430
In fact I'm going to pull that
awful picture off by itself.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.080
Here's the deal.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:07.280
The idea is that on this picture
only pixels that are, were real.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.470
The question is, how do you make
finer pixels from a coarser levels?

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.130
So here's the coarser level,
here's the finer level.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.920
And it turns out you do
it two different ways.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.460
Okay?
So we're going to start with

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.480
the odd pixels.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.400
All right?

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.740
So the odd pixels occur underneath
pixels that are actually there.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.700
So there are a couple of
ways of thinking about this.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.010
One is we're just going to
assume that we're going to,

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.965
I'm just going to tell you what
the filter is right there.

00:02:34.965 --> 00:02:37.985
It's one-eighth,
three-fourth, one-eighth.

00:02:37.985 --> 00:02:40.430
Okay.
That seems a little bit arbitrary until

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.610
you realize that's just kind
of like if these were zeroes.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:47.320
Okay.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.820
And I took in all the values here, and

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.326
I made it the same 5-tap a four,
but now doubled it.

00:02:53.326 --> 00:02:55.140
So one-eighth, one-half, three-quarters,

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.550
one, these will be in the same ratio of
one, four, six, four, one, as before.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.200
Okay?

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.210
But I'm only pulling
it off the odd pixels.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.820
All right.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.450
And so these points go away and

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.530
I'm only left with one-eighth,
three-quarters, one-eighth.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.560
By the way,
we're going to provide the original

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.460
Burton Edelson paper that
talks about reducing expanse.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.875
You'll be able to, to look at that a,
a little bit more carefully.

00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:20.605
All right.

00:03:20.605 --> 00:03:23.125
That's to reproduced a pixel, it's
actually underneath one that's there.

00:03:24.185 --> 00:03:27.245
Slightly trickier are the even pixels.

00:03:27.245 --> 00:03:31.865
We have a pixel here that's underneath
something that didn't actually exist.

00:03:31.865 --> 00:03:34.830
So if I still do the six, four, one.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:35.881
All right?

00:03:35.881 --> 00:03:39.035
One, four, six, four, one above me.

00:03:39.035 --> 00:03:39.570
Okay?

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.460
Well, when I'm on one of these even
pixels, there's nothing directly above

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.360
me, and there's nothing to my ends,
there's only these two here.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.730
That's this one, and this one.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.650
So looking five above me,
only two of them are really there,

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.760
they're equally distant from me,
what coefficients am I going to use?

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.180
I'm going to use one-half.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.102
So to produce this finer value,
I take one-half of that pixel and

00:04:06.102 --> 00:04:08.230
one-half of the other and
that actually sort of makes sense.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.400
If you think about it,
if I'm blowing up a picture, so

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.700
I'm going to go from say,
seven pixels to, to 14.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.250
I have to get space between
two pixels that were there.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.769
What value should I put in that space?

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.240
Halfway between the ones
that were there before.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.510
The one that's a little trickier to
understand is if I'm blowing it up,

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.420
how come I just don't leave
this original pixel alone.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.490
And you can read in the paper,
this is for the odd pixels,

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.410
you can read in the paper the motivation
in terms of frequency theory.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.250
In terms of how they do that.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.160
All you need to know is that you
now have a reduce operator and

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.270
an expand operator.
