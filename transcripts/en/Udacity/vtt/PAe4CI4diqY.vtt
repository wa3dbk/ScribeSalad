00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.060
Way back in lesson one, we reviewed
some of the problems of U.S. healthcare.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.990
Too many errors is another problem.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.510
In it's landmark 1999 publication,
To Error is Human,

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.800
Building a Safer Health System, the
institute of medicine famously said that

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.830
from 44,000 to 98,000 Americans,
are killed each year in U.S.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.710
hospitals due to entirely
preventable reasons.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.240
Many of those listed,
such as adverse drug events,

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.830
improper transfusions,
wrong side surgery, and

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.780
mistaken patient identities,
have to do with mishandling of data.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.750
This leads to one of
the key arguments for

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.570
adoption of electronic medical records.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.950
However, electronic records themselves,
can be a new source of error.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.960
We now turn to that.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.950
First we need to acknowledge
the magnitude of the challenge.
