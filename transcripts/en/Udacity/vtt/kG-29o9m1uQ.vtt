00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Going through it together, vladimir immediately returns 1,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
so it halts in pretty much 1 step.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So yes, this does not loop forever.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
To figure out the value of nabokov, we call nabokov,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
which causes us to call nabokov, which causes us to call nabokov.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This is one of those infinite loops.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Not my most symmetric infinity symbol ever.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We never actually get a value out of this.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We call ourselves over and over again.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This procedure does not halt.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You might be thinking, "Oh, eventually we will run out of stack space,"

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
or more prosaic concerns like that, but remember here

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I want you to think in the abstract.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We're assuming this mythical halts procedure.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
How about pale? X is 0, while True, x is x + 1.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We actually looked at this before.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This loop does not halt, does not terminate.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
How about fire?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We start out with x is 0 and y is 1000,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and as long as x is less than y, we add 2 to x and we add y to 1.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
After a little bit, this will be 2 and 1001, then this will be 4 and 1002,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
this will be 6 and 1003.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And although it doesn't look like it now, eventually x will catch up to y

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
because x is growing twice as fast.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000
For example, after 1000 steps, x will be 2000 and y will also be 2000,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
at which point we'll break out of this loop.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So fire does in fact halt.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Pale Fire was a 1962 novel by Nabokov.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
He's perhaps more famous for Lolita.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
He was a Russian author who did a lot of writing in English.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
All right. We didn't see anything bad. That all looked fine.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
We could figure out just by staring at things whether they halted or not.

00:01:39.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Why am I predicting doom and gloom? We didn't have any problems.
