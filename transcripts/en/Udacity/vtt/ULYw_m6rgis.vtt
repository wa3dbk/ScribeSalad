&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thinking back to what information we started off with, or what information we

00:00:03.847 --> 00:00:07.764
had after we calculated the slope for this problem. Did using point slope form

00:00:07.764 --> 00:00:11.424
to get us eventually to the slope intercept form of our equation, give us a

00:00:11.424 --> 00:00:15.337
short cut? Or did it actually give us extra work? We know that, in some cases,

00:00:15.337 --> 00:00:17.772
it helps us out. But was that the case this time?
