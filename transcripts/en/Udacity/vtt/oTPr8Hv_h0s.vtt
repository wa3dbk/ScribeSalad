00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.050
And as you might expect, in fact as you
told me offline that you did expect,

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.180
what we're going to do is Vt is defined
using the Bellman update, right,

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.730
the Bellman equation in terms of Vt-1.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.130
So what we're going to do is structure
things around that Bellman equation.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.294
So what I've done here is broken up the
Bellman equation into kind of kind of

00:00:18.294 --> 00:00:19.108
a series of steps.

00:00:19.108 --> 00:00:23.323
Vt(b) if the max over actions of
something, what is that something?

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:29.460
That something is the sum over all
observations of something else.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.600
And what is that something else?

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.700
That turns out to be the sum over all
states of the reward function for

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.790
that state of given that
action times the belief state.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.540
And then normalized by
the number of observations plus

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.110
the discounted expected
value of the next state.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.040
The expectation comes
over the observation z.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.135
And then the value the next state is
Vt-1 of the state estimation of b, a,

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:52.982
z, all right?

00:00:52.982 --> 00:00:54.880
So this is really just
the Bellman equation.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.118
But I kind of unrolled it, I guess,
or kind of un-telescoped it so

00:00:59.118 --> 00:01:03.757
that each of these operations' going to
be easier to build out of vectors.

00:01:03.757 --> 00:01:08.970
&gt;&gt; Okay, so the sum of the s is just for
the thing on the left side of the plus.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.430
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Right, because it's just the reward.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.500
&gt;&gt; Right, and what's going to happen is
this side is also going to have a sum

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.960
over s in it, weighted by b(s).

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.466
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; And

00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:21.066
that's going to allow us to actually
think about this whole thing as a dot

00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:24.069
product of the belief state
with some kind of messy vector.

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:25.696
&gt;&gt; Okay, I like messy vectors.
