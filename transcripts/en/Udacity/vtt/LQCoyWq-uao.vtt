00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.580
Now let me actually talk
a little bit about warping and

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.210
we are going to get into lot more
detail about this in the next lesson.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.880
So here basically,
I'm just showing you two images.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.570
Right, so I have a point here and I
want to generate a larger point which is

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.220
being rotated in the new word image
space where the domain is x prime,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.570
y prime so this may coordinate xs, and
of course, I have my transformation.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.470
So I take this pixel and
I warp it to this location here.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.110
So in essence,

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.740
what we're doing is sending each pixel
from f(x,y) to its corresponding

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.330
location with a transformation
T(x,y) in the second image.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.350
What happens if the new pixel
lands between two pixels?

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.050
Remember, this could be much bigger in
this open space that we coming up with.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.670
In that sense,
we're taking a bigger image and

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.290
filling information from there.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.690
In the forward mapping, what's really
done is that we would distribute

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.770
the color among the neighborhood pixels.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.400
So, if this is the pixel I have there,
and it shows up there, I would kind of

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.730
distribute the color in the ones
around it to generate a new pixel.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.150
And that's what I would actually do.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.502
This is the forward warping process.

00:01:01.502 --> 00:01:05.410
Another well-known process is when we
actually go inwards, backward warping.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.150
Again, I take a pixel from here,
and I want to go and

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.130
figure out the inverse transformation to
find where would it actually end up, and

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.260
what would I do with it.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.880
So again in this, what I will do is take
each pixel from the warped image and

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.510
find its corresponding location, and

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.600
move it to a new image as
long as I know the inverse.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.990
Again, in this case, what happens
if it shows up in between pixels?

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.580
In this case,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.700
what we would do is basically we
will interpolate the color values.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.030
Those where we were redistributing.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.840
Here we would interpolate
the color values and

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.200
fill it in here from the neighbors.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.990
Again, how do we do this interpolation?

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.120
Remember how we did things like
filtering images and stuff like that.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.950
We could use those types of
methods to help us do this.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.570
Just to do a quick comparison,
forward versus inverse warping.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.200
Which one do you think is better?

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.530
Well usually,
inverse mapping is a better map that,

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.210
because it eliminates holes.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.330
We're always going from
something we know how to get to,

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.110
to much more of an original image.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.660
And of course that allows us to
fill in all the color information.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.910
If you sometimes go from one to the
other, we might run into places where we

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.919
don't have,
we'll have to do some sort of hole fill.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.880
I'll talk a little a bit about
that when we talk about morphing.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.350
But, the important part
is to do inverse warping,

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.430
we need an invertible warp function.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.860
Now I want you all to think about how
we would actually create an invertible

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.670
warp function based on what
we've talked about before.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.360
And see that in some instances,
especially for rigid warps and

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.320
stuff like that, that's the easily
computable inverse functions.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.360
Especially when you have rotations and
translations and you're doing scales.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.470
It does get harder when you do
a bunch of other things and

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.740
not all the time especially when
you do have, not a global warp.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.380
It gets harder and
harder to compute those.
