So, another question is which one of these two do we like better. The choices

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.859
are, we like the first one better, the one that uses isinstance, because its

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.316
clearer and easier to understand. The second choice, we like the second one

00:00:10.316 --> 00:00:13.999
better, the one that uses hasattr, since that's more versatile and tastier. And

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:17.627
the third choice is, it doesn't really matter since Dave gets eaten either way.

00:00:17.628 --> 00:00:20.616
This is somewhat subjective but if you think about the way we might use this

00:00:20.616 --> 00:00:22.393
method, I think you can get the right answer.
