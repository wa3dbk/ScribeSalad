00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This one was tricky--you're going to count start on the left and on the right

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and these points over here defined the critical region.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:21.000
If you were to move it inbound, you'd find that 0.022 plus 0.005 becomes larger than 0.025

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
with just half of the confidence that you have to exclude over here.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Now since we know that these must smaller or equal to 2.5% each,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
we have to exclude 3 and 11 from the critical region,

00:00:37.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and 3 shall be fine for these two sample tests.
