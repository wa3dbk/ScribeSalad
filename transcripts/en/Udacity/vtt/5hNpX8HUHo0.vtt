00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.929
After we solve this equation for y, we'll have y equals negative 2x plus 4. Now

00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:09.512
we're ready for substitution. Using substitution, I want you to find the

00:00:09.512 --> 00:00:14.387
solution or the point of intersection for this system of equations, these two

00:00:14.387 --> 00:00:17.900
lines. Enter your numbers here, and here. And good luck.
