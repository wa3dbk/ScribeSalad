A little while ago, you started
this course by grabbing x code, and

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.310
learning a little bit about
the swift programming language.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.970
In lesson two, you created the first
part of the pitch perfect app.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.035
Added labels and buttons, and wired
them up to code in your view controller.

00:00:15.035 --> 00:00:18.905
You even took some time to learn about
the model view controller pattern.

00:00:18.905 --> 00:00:22.765
In this lesson we're going to learn
how to play audio from the app and

00:00:22.765 --> 00:00:26.385
navigate between two
screens in the iOS app.

00:00:26.385 --> 00:00:27.005
Let's get started.
