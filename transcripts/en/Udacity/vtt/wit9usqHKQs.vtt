00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.130
So let's see if we can correctly use MSYNC.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:04.710
Let's say that we have a processor with a

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.010
very relaxed consistency model where all four reorderings are

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.150
allowed. Including reodering writes to different locations on a core.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.760
Let's say that this is the code we are

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.380
executing. We do a load link of lock into R1.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.990
We then do a branch if we didn't get

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.130
the lock, back to checking, we do a store conditional

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.470
trying to now get the lock. We look back, if we didn't get the lock then we

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.870
load the variable incremented and store it. Then we free the lock by writing

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.650
zero to it. So the question for you is where do we need MSYNC if anywhere here?

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.430
Do we need one here? Do we need on here? Do we need on

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.987
here? Here? Here? How bout here? How bout here?

00:00:55.987 --> 00:01:01.790
How bout here? And how bout at the end of everything?
