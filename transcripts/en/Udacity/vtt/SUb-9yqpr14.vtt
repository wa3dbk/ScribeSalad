00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.744
One of the objectives of this lesson is to give you some tools to

00:00:03.744 --> 00:00:08.233
think carefully about dealing with complexed, that is the management of these

00:00:08.233 --> 00:00:13.210
levels of abstraction. So to do that, I am going to introduce notation. Okay,

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.620
this notation is taken from first OR logic. To state property too precisely,

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.280
we are going to need a little of that notation. And throughout the rest of

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.810
this lesson, we are also going to use the term abstract and

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.910
concrete to refer to the upper and lower levels of a refinement. First off,

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.880
we are going to talk about the abstract operations and we are going to use P1,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.940
P2 and so on up to Pn and Pi we'll use to

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.710
indicate a typical abstract operation. We're going to have abstract states.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.010
The set of abstract states is the capital letter S and

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.980
a typical abstract, typical element of the abstract state is the letter s.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.260
And we'll also put an apostrophe after the s if what we're talking about

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.790
is the abstract state after an operation. We have invariants, we use inv

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.110
to indicate invariants and invA will stand for abstract invariants and

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.975
invC will correspond to the concrete invariants. We have pre-conditions and

00:01:16.975 --> 00:01:20.830
post-conditions and we'll just append the word pre and

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.070
post to our Pi's to indicate. Whether it's a pre condition or a post condition,

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.490
and those pre and post conditions can have states associated with them and

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.300
arguments. Finally we'll use symbols like the ampersand to indicate and,

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.940
and the rightward facing arrow to indicate implies.
