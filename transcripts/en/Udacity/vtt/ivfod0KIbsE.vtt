00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720
And there are two correct answers here and that is the second answer and the fourth answer.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.500
And the reason for that is as follows.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.360
If you managed to have a polynomial time reduction from a problem X to a problem Y,

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:20.940
that means that you can take any input to the problem X and then use Y to solve it.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.410
What it does not mean is that you can take very input for Y and use X to solve it.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.910
The reduction is only one way.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.910
But that means if you managed to reduce the problem X to a problem Y,

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:40.290
then solving Y must require at least as much effort or power as solving X.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.070
So that means that Y is at least as hard to solve as X and not the other way around as I just said.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.810
Now on the other hand, since Y is at least as hard to solve as X that means

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.520
if you find a way to solve Y in polynomial time then of course you can also solve X in polynomial time

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.240
because this reduction here takes polynomial time and then solving that problem

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.319
would also take polynomial time.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:10.580
On the other hand, if you can solve X in polynomial time, so this problem here,

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.210
that doesn't really mean anything for Y because as we just said Y is at least as hard to solve as X

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.560
but it doesn't have the same hardness or is easier in any way.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.080
This implication here does not hold true and those two are the only ones that are true.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.720
Now if this quiz confused you a little bit, I find a good way to memorize this

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.040
what the reduction from the X to Y means is that if you have a reduction from X to Y

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:44.800
that basically means that this problem X here must be able to fit into the problem Y

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:52.570
and that is why this problem Y here is in a way larger or harder to solve than X

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.660
so you take this problem X and put it into Y that is what the polynomial time reduction

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.210
can be pictured as and at least from me that's very helpful.

00:02:00.210 --> 99:59:59.000
And of course I do hope that it is for you as well.
