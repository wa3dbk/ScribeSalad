00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.420
Let's look at the answer
to our miss rate quiz.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.790
In a well designed cache, we want
the hit rate to be high as possible and

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.300
the miss rate to be low as
possible because the hit rate

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.730
determines how often do we
have just the hit latency and

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.380
the miss rate is how often we have
to pay the full memory latency.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.310
So, we definitely want the hit rate
to be larger than the miss rate.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.670
We definitely do not want the hit rate
to be smaller than the miss rate.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.220
We don't want them to be equal to each
other, because that means half of

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.580
the time, we are going to memory,
we won't hit much more than that.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.580
We want the hit rate to be
almost 1 because that means that

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.690
almost always we are going
to have a cache hit.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.625
And we definitely do not want the miss
rate to be almost 1 because that means

00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:49.550
that we are almost never
hitting in our cache.
