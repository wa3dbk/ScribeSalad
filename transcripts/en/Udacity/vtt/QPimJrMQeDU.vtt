Let's look at another equation. This time I'd like you to find the roots of y

00:00:05.022 --> 00:00:10.384
plus 10 equals negative 2 times the quantity x minus 3, squared. When you write

00:00:10.384 --> 00:00:15.568
the solutions to this equation, I'd like you to write them as compactly as you

00:00:15.568 --> 00:00:20.275
can, and also to use the standard form for complex numbers, a plus bi.
