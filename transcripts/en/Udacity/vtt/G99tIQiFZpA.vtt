00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.644
The factored form for this expression is 2u plus 5 times u plus 1. And the

00:00:05.644 --> 00:00:10.338
solutions for u are negative 5 halves and negative 1. Now that's some great

00:00:10.338 --> 00:00:15.712
work if you got these two correct. To factor this quadratic, we find factors of

00:00:15.712 --> 00:00:21.459
10 that sum to positive 7. Those factors are 2 and 5. So, we rewrite our middle

00:00:21.459 --> 00:00:26.878
term using these as coefficients. Then, we use factoring by grouping to get 2u

00:00:26.878 --> 00:00:32.334
plus 5 times u plus 1 equals 0. We set each factor equal to 0 and then we solve

00:00:32.334 --> 00:00:40.113
for the variable u. u can equal negative 5 halves or u can equal negative 1.
