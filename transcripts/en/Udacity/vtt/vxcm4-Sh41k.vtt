00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.130
The answer is no.

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:02.340
In its current state,

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.480
the code will break when it hits the line calling amy.move.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.430
That's because the move method is only available on Car.prototype and

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.884
the amy object doesn't delegate to Car.prototype.
