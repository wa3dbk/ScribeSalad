When you look at the world around us, you see many people probably on their

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.470
cell phones or their laptops, somehow incorporating technology in their lives.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.180
I think it's really important for everyone to learn technology or to learn

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.730
programming specifically because so much of our world is based upon it. Not

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.590
everyone is going to become a programmer and that's okay. But it's really

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.640
important for people to understand the basic principles upon which our world is

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.850
built.
