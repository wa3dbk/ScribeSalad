development and testing process.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.070

He'll walk you through several problems,
and

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.750
he'll teach you how to use the right
tools to identify those issues so

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.880
that you can understand
the problem areas in your own app.
