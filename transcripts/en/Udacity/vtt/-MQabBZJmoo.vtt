00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.990
Now what if A is actually fake and
B is real?

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.240
&gt;&gt; But that's not the truth.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.260
&gt;&gt; It could be the truth,
we didn't know that.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.720
&gt;&gt; We went to mechanism
to work either way.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.340
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.860
&gt;&gt; Okay, so all right, so
let's go to the bottom again.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.725
So if B is the real mom, B has
a value of V real which is bigger than

00:00:15.725 --> 00:00:19.478
V fake which is A's value.

00:00:19.478 --> 00:00:26.338
So when B, announces the value,
B probably should announce the V real.

00:00:26.338 --> 00:00:31.470
Because again B is going
to want to spend that or

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.750
wouldn't want to not get the baby.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.010
Having not spend that amount we
would have regret for that, and so

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.430
B is going to basically be truthful
right and say what B's true value is.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.040
Which in this case is V real.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.120
At that point A has a choice.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.895
A can say yes and

00:00:45.895 --> 00:00:49.128
is going to have to pay more for
the baby then the baby's worth to A.

00:00:49.128 --> 00:00:50.906
&gt;&gt; Because V real's bigger than V fake.

00:00:50.906 --> 00:00:54.647
&gt;&gt; Or say no and
walk away having paid the fine but

00:00:54.647 --> 00:00:57.906
B gets the baby but
at a very high price.

00:00:57.906 --> 00:01:01.170
&gt;&gt; But it doesn't matter because
F is still bigger than zero.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.160
&gt;&gt; I see, so now what you're saying is,
so that is a little bit weird and

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.989
asymmetrical, right?

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.420
So B gets the baby for V real.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.960
But if it was A who had the baby,
then A's going to get the baby for

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.290
V fake which is less.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.400
&gt;&gt; Right, but it doesn't matter,
&gt;&gt; Your point is that because of this

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.260
fact, because of the fact that
if A let's it get this far,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.160
knowing that A's not the mom,
it's going to cost A the fine.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.140
&gt;&gt; Right, and A will not get the baby.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.870
So that means A doesn't want
to get this far, which means

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.540
when asked the question, having thought
it all through, A will just say no.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.630
So in fact, by saying this is
the process we're going to go through

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.740
when asked the question
both will be truthful.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.310
&gt;&gt; In fact,
all the questions will be truthful,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.210
all the way up to question one.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.350
&gt;&gt; What?
&gt;&gt; All the questions.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.025
So any question that's asked is going to
be answered truthfully by this design.

00:01:51.025 --> 00:01:52.100
&gt;&gt; That's right, I'm sorry,

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.077
you were saying all the way up to you're
going counting backwards that's right.

00:01:55.077 --> 00:01:56.400
&gt;&gt; Now well up to one.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.970
Yes up the screen to one.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.940
&gt;&gt; Right so that's exactly right.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.820
Without knowing what V real and V fake
are but with everyone understanding that

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.925
the baby is valued more by the real
mother than the fake mother.

00:02:08.925 --> 00:02:13.490
This mechanism set them in such a way
that it makes no sense for the fake

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.690
mother whoever it is to ever let it get
this far ever let it get to step three.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.620
So as a result when forced to ask the
question the fake mother has to bale.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.580
&gt;&gt; Got it.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.310
&gt;&gt; Before it gets to three because
otherwise Fake mom will lose.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.950
&gt;&gt; Clever.
&gt;&gt; Therefore this mechanism

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.850
will in fact elicit the true
values of the baby and

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.020
will allow King Solomon
to know the right thing.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.990
Because of this King Solomon knows
that they will answer truthfully and

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.640
will find out who the real mother is.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.230
And the only person who loses in this
Is the poor person of the sword.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.500
&gt;&gt; Again.
So sorry.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.390
&gt;&gt; And there you go.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.300
So I think that that's a pretty
interesting example of

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.540
how you might kind of
do mechanism design.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.610
&gt;&gt; That is really interesting.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.860
Yeah and so I slipped and called it
a bit at one point because it sort

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.210
of reminds me of what people
do in auction design.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.860
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; When auctions are designed it's

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.270
often the case that you want
to set up an auction so

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.758
that people reveal their true values for
the for the goods that are available and

00:03:21.758 --> 00:03:26.430
that they'll bid their true values and
that the winner the one who valued

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.780
the most will actually end up
winning at the end of the day.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.500
&gt;&gt; Right.
You try to set up a structure so

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.080
that people will basically pay
what it is they really want or

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.030
at least will announce what
it is that they really want.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.980
There are lots of variations on this and
in fact some version

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.730
very similar to this is sort of
what e-bay does but without babies

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.795
the baby in this case is the prize
&gt;&gt; E-baby.

00:03:45.795 --> 00:03:47.150
&gt;&gt; E-baby.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.200
&gt;&gt; Wait a second.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.400
&gt;&gt; We have a website.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.553
Let's go get rich.

00:03:50.553 --> 00:03:56.993
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I think that's illegal.

00:03:56.993 --> 00:03:58.753
&gt;&gt; I think it depends.

00:03:58.753 --> 00:04:02.979
&gt;&gt; But I was just going to say that
if you switch the As to Bs and

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:05.193
the Bs to As then eBay is baby.

00:04:05.193 --> 00:04:07.261
&gt;&gt; I do not understand how
you do stuff like that.

00:04:07.261 --> 00:04:08.153
But I'm impressed.

00:04:08.153 --> 00:04:09.160
&gt;&gt; All right.
&gt;&gt; Okay so

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.230
here we are so yeah auction and by the
way you might think that this would be

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.760
a natural segue to
talking about auctions.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.378
But that'll be our third class
that will never actually do.

00:04:17.378 --> 00:04:19.204
[LAUGH] Seem fair?

00:04:19.204 --> 00:04:21.257
&gt;&gt; At least for being honest
we're getting our true value.

00:04:21.257 --> 00:04:22.560
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; That's true.
