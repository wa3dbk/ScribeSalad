00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.512
So now we have our population parameters and our parameters for the distribution

00:00:05.512 --> 00:00:09.914
of sample means. Do you think that this standard deviation for the population

00:00:09.914 --> 00:00:13.818
and the standard deviation for the distribution of sample means have any

00:00:13.818 --> 00:00:15.483
relationship to each other?
