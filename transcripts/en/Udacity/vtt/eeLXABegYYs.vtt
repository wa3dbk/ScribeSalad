00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.740
Let's study the botnet C&amp;C problem.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.760
The key question here is that
how can the bot master know

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.210
which computers have been infected?

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.120
In other words,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.360
how can the bot master contact
the infected machines and use them?

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.990
Let's think like a bot master for
a moment.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.810
The easiest way to think of,
is to have the victims or

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.610
the compromised computers to contact us.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.310
So, okay, let's do this.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.040
The first step is to create the malware.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.160
We call it vx.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.180
So for example we can download
some example vx code from the web,

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.290
fiddle around it, compile it, okay?

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.510
To make sure that it works.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.630
Then, we can use email to publicate it.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.420
For example, using social engineering to
send it to some people that we know, and

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.230
from there it will spread.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.500
That is, we create a malware,
we spread it through email.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.210
Spreading is the easy part, but

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.140
now what if we want to make
use of these victim computers?
