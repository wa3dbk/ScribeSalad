Now, back in the early 90's, specialty hardware was used to get smooth graphics

00:00:05.098 --> 00:00:11.837
on early machines. Things like the NES, Genesis, and Gameboy had custom hardware

00:00:11.837 --> 00:00:15.279
that was built into the form factor that was allowed you to draw tons and tons

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:20.021
of tiles very quickly on modern screens. Now desktop computers at the time didn't

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:22.775
have that much power, in fact, they didn't have any of that specialty hardware

00:00:22.775 --> 00:00:27.582
at all. Modern desktops around that time running at 33 hertz were considered top

00:00:27.582 --> 00:00:33.366
of the line. Now, one day a young John Carmack made a demo called Dangerous Dave

00:00:33.378 --> 00:00:38.655
in copyright infringement, which actually showed off a Super Mario Brothers 3

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:43.215
level running at full 30 frames a second, on desktop hardware. He showed that

00:00:43.227 --> 00:00:48.335
demo to a young John Romero and that very day ID Software was born. The same

00:00:48.335 --> 00:00:52.140
studio that went on to actually create the first person shooter genre with

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:54.920
titles such as Wolfenstein, Doom and Quake.

00:00:54.925 --> 00:00:59.289
Now, the trick that Carmack realized to get the same performance from the

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:04.157
specialty hardware on the desktop, was actually an optimization. See, these

00:01:04.157 --> 00:01:07.656
early machines weren't too good at actually copying pixels over here to over

00:01:07.656 --> 00:01:10.285
here in memory. It was actually a pretty difficult concept, especially with the

00:01:10.285 --> 00:01:13.561
bitmap colors and everything. But what they were good at was actually just

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:17.847
copying rows of memory from different registers. So what Carmack realized was

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:21.639
that he could use the previous frame and somehow just use meme copies to sort

00:01:21.651 --> 00:01:25.534
of shift it, so that it looks like the scene is actually scrolling. They need to

00:01:25.546 --> 00:01:29.273
be able to only have to update the small portion of the screen that changed as

00:01:29.285 --> 00:01:33.972
your character was moving. Thus was born the concept of "Dirty Rect". Now, this

00:01:33.972 --> 00:01:37.421
is the same concept that's been used today in tons and tons of games. See,

00:01:37.421 --> 00:01:40.803
that's the trick with game industry techniques like this: they never really

00:01:40.815 --> 00:01:44.366
die, they just kind of get rebranded as technology evolves over time.
