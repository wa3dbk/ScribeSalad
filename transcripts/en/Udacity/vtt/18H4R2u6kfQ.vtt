00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.778
Now, we're going to move away from the distance formula and the Pythagorean

00:00:03.778 --> 00:00:08.180
theorem. We'll still use the Pythagorean theorem in this upcoming lesson, but

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.617
we'll use it for circles. We're almost to the end of the course, but before we

00:00:12.617 --> 00:00:18.415
get to that end, let's talk about the end of a string. Here's a string of

00:00:18.415 --> 00:00:22.648
unknown length. Now, I'm not going to tell you what length it is yet. You're

00:00:22.648 --> 00:00:25.934
actually going to calculate that yourself, we're going to take this string and

00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:31.509
place it on a coordinate grid. Notice that I have one end of the string at the

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.778
origin 0, 0. The horizontal distance from the center which is the origin to the

00:00:36.778 --> 00:00:43.518
end of the string is 40 centimeters, that's this distance. And the vertical

00:00:43.518 --> 00:00:49.633
distance from the origin to the end of the string is 30 centimeters. So,

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:53.354
knowing this horizontal distance, and this vertical distance, what x, y

00:00:53.354 --> 00:00:59.244
coordinate can describe the position of the end of this string? Write that

00:00:59.244 --> 00:01:03.307
answer here. Once you've done that, I want you to try and figure out the length

00:01:03.307 --> 00:01:07.610
of the string. How long is this? Write that answer here.
