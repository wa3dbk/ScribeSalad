00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.000
I'd like to take a moment and talk about the design of connectors.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
As with components there is a design step required, particularly if you're

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.870
building your own connector. Starting from the overall architecture, of course

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.540
you determine your components and the required interactions among them. Then for

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.640
each interaction, determine what required services that interaction needs.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.635
Once you've done that you can select a con, connector type that provides that

00:00:26.635 --> 00:00:32.564
service. Each of the connector types has a variant of dimensions, variation

00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:38.210
dimensions, that you can choose which of those variants you would like to have.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.180
And from that, define your connector. And then you need to validate. And we'll

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.150
have one in a minute we'll, we'll describe some of the rules you can use for

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.280
checking whether or not the, the choices you made will work out.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.120
And in doing this you may actually have to define your own connector.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.900
You may not find one in the catalog or in available libraries that you can use.
