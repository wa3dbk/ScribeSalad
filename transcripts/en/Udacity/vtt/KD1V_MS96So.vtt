00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.880
In previous lessons, we covered testing principles and

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.610
techniques. In this lesson, we will discuss a

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.550
type of software process that is heavily based

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.812
on the use of testing. The agile development

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:17.310
process. Also called test-driven development. To do that,

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.290
we will revisit some of the assumptions that

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.490
led to the definition of the more traditional

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.030
software processes. The ones that we discussed so far.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.690
We will see how, when some of these assumptions are

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.210
no longer valid, we can change the way in which we

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.560
look at software processes. And we can change the way

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.120
in which we look at software development in general. We will

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.250
discuss how this changing perspective, let's us rethink software processes

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.520
and make them more agile and better suited for context in

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.120
which changes are the norm and we need to adapt

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.535
fast. In particular, we will discuss two processes that apply the

00:00:50.535 --> 00:00:53.570
principles of agile software development and that are commonly

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.170
used in industry. Extreme programming, also called XP, and Scrum.
