00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In this problem, we have been asked to complete a finite state machine

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
so that it matches exactly the strings that this regular expression matches.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Let's take a moment to look at what this regular expression does.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The first part matches one or more a's or b's in any order.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Then we match 0 or more c's, or together d and e,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and lastly, we have an optional f that we match.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Let's take it one part at a time while simultaneously trying to understand

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
the finite state machine that we have partially built below.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
From the initial state, we go from 1 to 2 via b.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Well, if we look at our regular expression, it's also valid that our first character is an a,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
so this probably means that this transaction is an a.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And here at state 2, we repeat with an a,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
but we can also repeat with a b as well,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and so far, we have the first part of our finite state machine

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
in which we match one or more a's and b's.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The next portion is the c, d, e business,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and we see in our partially finished finite state machine

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
we take an epsilon transition to 3.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
This is 0 or more matches,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and the f is optional, so at this point,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
it is possible to finish in an accepting state.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
However, we can have as many c's as we want and then still finish,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
so this loop right here is probably a c.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
We still haven't dealt with the d and e.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
If we look at the d go down to state 4,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
in order to finish in an accepting state, we need to follow with an e,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and the last part is the optional f.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
There's only 1 f, and if it does match,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
we still finish in an accepting state, which is exactly what happens

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
when we go from state 3 to state 5,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and so these are the portions of the finite state machine that we're missing

00:01:52.000 --> 09:59:59.000
that perfectly match the given regular expression.
