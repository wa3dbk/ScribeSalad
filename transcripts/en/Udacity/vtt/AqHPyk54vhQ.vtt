00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.545
And I'd like to talk about another pattern that's very common when designing

00:00:03.545 --> 00:00:08.635
classes. We'll say that the class has a property if it has a value that one can

00:00:08.635 --> 00:00:16.394
simply get and set. Look at a person, a person has a name. That's a private

00:00:16.394 --> 00:00:20.796
instance variable, so we'll have a getter that returns the name and here we

00:00:20.796 --> 00:00:25.127
have a setter that you can use to set the name to a new name incase the person

00:00:25.127 --> 00:00:32.835
for whatever reason is unhappy with the previous one. It's very very common to

00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:37.175
have this pattern instance variable getter setter there some variations

00:00:37.175 --> 00:00:41.585
sometimes you do some error checking in the setter here we check that the new

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:49.180
name, is not the empty string, cause no one's name should be the empty string.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.120
Or, maybe, in a particular application it just shouldn't be allowed to change

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.470
the name, in that case, there wouldn't be a setter. This is a read only

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.314
property in this example where we just have, the instance variable and the

00:01:03.314 --> 00:01:10.480
corresponding getter. Now, properties, meaning private instance variables with

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.980
getters and maybe setters are very common. But that doesn't mean that you

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.626
should make every instance variable a property with a getter and setter. Only

00:01:20.626 --> 00:01:25.915
use the getters when there is a need for the user of the class. To read the

00:01:25.915 --> 00:01:30.075
instance variable and only supply a setter when there is a need for the user to

00:01:30.075 --> 00:01:36.331
modify it, many instance variables do not have getters and setters. Well let's

00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:40.556
practice that with yet another variation of the car class, this car class has a

00:01:40.556 --> 00:01:44.651
number of instance variables and I'd like you to look it over and add getters

00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:48.876
and setters for those where it's appropriate, and not add them for those where

00:01:48.876 --> 00:01:52.583
it's not.
