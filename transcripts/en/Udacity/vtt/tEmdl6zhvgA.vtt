00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:07.026
So here's our distribution. And we want to find what value is here such that the

00:00:07.026 --> 00:00:13.861
percent here is 5. That's the same as a proportion of 0.05. Well, first, what

00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:21.224
z-score could go here? We'll use the z-table to figure that out. This time we're

00:00:21.224 --> 00:00:29.368
going to look in the center of the z table, and we're looking for 0.05. Here we

00:00:29.368 --> 00:00:36.107
have 0.0505 and 0.495. That corresponds to a z score of negative 1.64 and

00:00:36.107 --> 00:00:42.507
negative 1.65. Since 0.05 is right in the middle of them, then let's use the

00:00:42.507 --> 00:00:48.811
z-score that's right in the middle of those. So negative 1.645. Note that we

00:00:48.811 --> 00:00:55.512
found the z-score that corresponds to 0.05 being less than that. So this z-score

00:00:55.512 --> 00:01:01.190
is just the positive value of this. Positive 1.645. Since the normal

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.019
distribution is symmetric, then 0.05 would be greater than the positive of that

00:01:07.019 --> 00:01:12.518
z-score. So this is the z-score that we want. And now let's convert this to

00:01:12.518 --> 00:01:18.766
karma points. 1.645 equals the number of karma points minus the mean. Divided by

00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:25.168
the standard deviation. And now we can solve for x by multiplying 1.645 by 4.8,

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:31.352
and adding 13. This is about 20.9. So if you've got a non average, 20.9 karma

00:01:31.352 --> 00:01:37.781
points per post. Then you've gotten more karma points per post than 95% of

00:01:37.781 --> 00:01:38.794
students.
