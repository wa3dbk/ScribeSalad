00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.190
Let us examine the relationship
between the method of generate and

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.700
test, and human cognition.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.810
Humans use generate and test as
the problem-solving method all the time.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.090
This is because we do not have complete
or correct knowledge of the world.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.300
We do not have infinite
computational resources.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.390
And we also do not always have
recourse to a method of reasoning

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.530
that is guaranteed to be correct.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.610
When you do not have these things,
then you use your own test method.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.730
You come up with particular solutions to
a problem, you test the solutions out.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.420
Beyond human cognition,

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.514
I'm sure you've come across
the notion of genetic algorithms.

00:00:39.514 --> 00:00:43.920
Genetic algorithms are inspired by
the processes of biological evolution.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.190
Through operations like crossover and
mutation,

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.652
one can generate solutions that can then
be tested against some fitness function.

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:56.230
Genetic algorithm are a good example
of the genetical test method.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.030
First, genetic solutions,
then test them out.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.300
So this method of generating test is
connected not only with human cognition,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.420
but dependently,
also with biological evolution.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.300
It's all over the place.
