00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Can you give me a hint about why Microsoft cares about any of this?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Well, Bing Maps is an obvious example.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Bing Maps computes driving directions.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Once you have the algorithms which are that fast,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
you do other things like taking real-time traffic into account.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Another application is in local search.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The reason it was an efficient way to find the nearest restaurants

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
or the nearest Italian restaurant which is open now and accepts American Express

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and things of this nature that can be very useful in local search.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The latest stat is that we have potentially more jobs than there are graduates

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
with these type of skills.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It's become more and more important to kind of mine the social graph

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
in that we have way more data that we know what to do with,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and we're starting to actually recognize that we have so many networks out there.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now, we're collecting the data more than every.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Being able to now leverage that data into something

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
that can add value to a company is becoming more important.
