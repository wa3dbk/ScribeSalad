The answer is as many times as he wants.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
There's no way when Cathy receives the coin from Bob

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that she can verify he didn't already spend it to someone else.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So in order for these coins to have some value,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
they have to be scarce.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
That has to be the case that you can't spend them multiple times,

00:00:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and you can't just create them.
