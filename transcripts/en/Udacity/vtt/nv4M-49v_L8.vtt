00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now we're done with decorators, and I want to go back to languages.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The first thing I want to say is that our culture is full of stories of wishful thinking.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We have the story of Pinocchio, who wishes to be a real boy,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and the of Dorothy, who wishes to return from Oz to her home in Kansas by clicking her shoes together.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
They find that they have the power within them to fulfill their wishes.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Programming is often like that.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I'm righting the body of the definition of a function, and I wish I had the function "fib" defined already.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
If I just assume that I did, then eventually my wish will come true.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
In this case, it was good while writing the right-hand side to just assume I wish I had the function I want

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and proceed as if you did, and sometimes it's a good idea to say I wish I had the language I want

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and proceed as if you did. Here's an example.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Suppose you had to deal with algebraic expressions

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and not just compute them the way we can type this expression into Python

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and see its value if x is defined but manipulate them.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Have the user type them in, modify them, and treat them as objects

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
rather than as something to be evaluated.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Now, my question for you is it is possible to write a regular expression

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
which could recognize expressions like this that are valid.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Is the answer, yes, it is possible to write that?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
No, it's not possible because our language we're trying to define

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
has the plus and asterisk symbols and those are special within regular expressions?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Or no, we can't parse this language because this language

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
includes parentheses, and we can't do balanced parentheses for the regular expressions.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
If you're not familiar with language theory, this may be a hard question for you,

00:01:43.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but go ahead and give it a shot anyways.
