00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.843
Now that we've figured out the horizontal position of the maximum value of the

00:00:03.843 --> 00:00:07.678
function, in this interval at least, I'd like you to find that maximum value of

00:00:07.678 --> 00:00:12.928
the function that we're looking for. So, find the y coordinate or the f of x

00:00:12.928 --> 00:00:23.708
coordinate of this peak point. Is it about 0, 2.5, 10.243, 15.02, 25.6 or 13.67.
