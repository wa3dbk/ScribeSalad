00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.390
You've just seen how to take a value between zero and 255 and change it to a

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:10.816
value between zero and five, so go ahead and do that. Then multiply by five so,

00:00:10.816 --> 00:00:15.720
you get a value that's one of these six. The reason to multiply by five is, if

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.744
you just left the zero to five in place, then all of the colors would be almost

00:00:18.744 --> 00:00:23.641
black and you wouldn't be able to see them. So, here what we've done is we've

00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:27.417
taken a large color range, turn it into much smaller one and then spread it out

00:00:27.417 --> 00:00:33.224
again into the original range. Now remember you have to do that separately for

00:00:33.224 --> 00:00:38.039
the red value, the green value, and the blue value. So, go ahead and complete

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:38.770
this program.
