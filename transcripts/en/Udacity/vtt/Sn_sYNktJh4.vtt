00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.495
And the answer is no. This is a really great reason, and a really great thing

00:00:03.495 --> 00:00:07.160
to think about. If 6x minus 2 were a factor, then we could rewrite this

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.656
expression as follows. We could write it as 6x minus 2 times a bunch of other

00:00:11.656 --> 00:00:16.556
things. But then, that would mean that we could rewrite it as 2 times 3x minus

00:00:16.556 --> 00:00:21.728
1, times a bunch of other things. Since this expression is not divisible by 2,

00:00:21.728 --> 00:00:24.968
or in other words, since we can't pull factor of 2 out of every single term

00:00:24.968 --> 00:00:29.363
here, that means 6x minus 2 can't be a factor of f of x.
