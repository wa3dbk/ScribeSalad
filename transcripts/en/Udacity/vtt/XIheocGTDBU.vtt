00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.830
Fans like to create content
based on your game.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.700
And by encouraging
them to create content,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.530
you can help promote your game and
make your players feel invested.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.010
As a bonus, you also get to
see their creativity at work.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.270
And invested players will
help your game make money.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.360
Fan art is a great example of this.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.070
And here's an example
from League of Legends.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.950
Another example of player created
content are extended in game

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.110
experiences, which are generally ways
for players to personalize the game and

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.570
create scenarios that
are the most interesting to them.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.090
A great example of this is Minecraft.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.050
It gives users a simple set of tools and

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.040
resources that they can build off of to
create their own challenges and worlds.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.360
They can create dungeons
filled with zombies or

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.940
lava, games that take place in the air
or places made entirely of gold.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.840
Players can even recreate scenarios
from their favorite movies,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.105
like with this superhero character and
stormtrooper.

00:00:56.105 --> 00:00:59.585
In all these scenarios, players
are taking the core of the game and

00:00:59.585 --> 00:01:02.495
customizing it based on
their own interests.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:04.925
The more your game supports
content creators and

00:01:04.925 --> 00:01:09.345
is able to celebrate their creations,
the more invested your players will be

00:01:09.345 --> 00:01:12.485
and the more depth and variety you'll
have in your gaming experience.
