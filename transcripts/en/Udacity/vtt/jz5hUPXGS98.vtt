00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.855
So what does this tell us about the inverse f of x equals 2 to the x? Well,

00:00:05.855 --> 00:00:08.942
let's just pick one of these pairs of values down here to examine a little bit

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:14.335
closer. From the table, we knew that f inverse of 8 equals 3. So for this

00:00:14.335 --> 00:00:19.195
inverse function, which of these statements is true? The output is half the

00:00:19.195 --> 00:00:22.975
input, the output is the square root of the input, the output is the base when

00:00:22.975 --> 00:00:28.463
the exponent is 2, or the output is the exponent when the base is 2.
