00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.918
Now that we know that we can use our area model in a bunch of different cases,

00:00:03.918 --> 00:00:07.799
let's see if we can use it here. We're going to try and square a binomial. When

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.801
we square a binomial, we simply raise a binomial to the second power. And what

00:00:11.801 --> 00:00:15.906
we're wondering here is, is this equal to this? Let's use what we know to figure

00:00:15.906 --> 00:00:19.610
it out. I've drawn out the rectangle for you. Now I want you to fill in the

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.022
products that you would get when you multiply each of the terms. Basically,

00:00:24.022 --> 00:00:28.878
you're finding the area for each of these rectangles. After you find the area of

00:00:28.878 --> 00:00:33.480
each of the rectangles, then write the sum, or the total area, in this box.
