00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.384
Le'ts take a look at the 4-ary trie where

00:00:02.384 --> 00:00:04.840
k equals 2. Suppose we have the same forwarding table

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.970
as before. But now, each node in the trie is

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.200
responsible for resolving two bits. So if we take one

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.650
one, and now we take one star, that's one zero

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.780
and one one. And now we basically have to put

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.819
p1. In two places in the tree. One zero star

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:25.250
results in just one entry. 1010 star results in two

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.796
traversals, and 10101 star again represents two

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:36.755
entries, for 101010 and 101011. Now suppose we

00:00:36.755 --> 00:00:43.010
want to look up 10111. Again, we can spell this out. 101 and

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.220
we can see that we get no further than P2 and again, that we

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.400
match at P2. One thing we can do to save space further is create

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.290
what's called a leaf-pushed trie. In such a

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.630
setting, we can save our self some space.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.450
Instead of having these pointers. We can push

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.840
these entries into the left and right side

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.920
of this note, respectively. So 10 becomes P1 on the left side and 11 becomes P1

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.490
on the right side. There are variety of

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.160
other atomization algorithms. Including one called Lulea and another

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.460
called Patricia. Each of them use the same basic idea

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.280
that we have explored here, except some of them like Lulea

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.180
are a three level trie, and often they use a bitmap

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.960
to compress out repeated entry such as those that exist here.
