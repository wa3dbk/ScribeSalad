00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.476
Here's one way to prove it to yourself that you drop the fraction instead of

00:00:02.476 --> 00:00:07.510
rounding. Try computing the texel location using U V's for a 1 by 1 texture. A

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.622
texture with 1 texel. You know in advance the answer you always want for the

00:00:11.622 --> 00:00:15.650
texture coordinate is the integer 0. A texture coordinate of 0.72 multiplied by

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.582
1 will have its fraction dropped, and you'll get 0. As will every other texel

00:00:20.582 --> 00:00:24.540
coordinate. If you round instead, you would get the wrong answer of 1. I like

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.688
testing with simple cases like this. If the formula doesn't work for a single

00:00:27.688 --> 00:00:31.884
pixel conversion, we can't expect it will work for larger textures. It's

00:00:31.884 --> 00:00:35.524
interesting to note that the upper right hand corner of the texel, which has UV

00:00:35.524 --> 00:00:41.366
of 1.0, 1.0. Would when multiplied by the texture resolution of 16 by 16, then

00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:47.560
have texel coordinates of 16.0, 16.0, a texel that doesn't exist. In practical

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.180
terms, this doesn't matter as the value 15.99999 repeating is the same value as

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.750
16.0. So, there is a valid texel and a valid texel location to sample.
