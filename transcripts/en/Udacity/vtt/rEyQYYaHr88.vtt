00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now let's say Institution B has the same probability, just more rigorous,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and it asks 5 times as many people.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So 55 say A and 45 say B.

00:00:11.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Once again, what is the probability for A using the maximum likelihood estimator?
