00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.670
Let us return to means-ends analysis for just another minute.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.670
Just to see how means-ends analysis, might try to work with this problem, and

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.850
get into difficulties. So this is the goal state, painted ladder and

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.329
painted ceiling. And this is the initial state. Now means-ends analysis may

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.790
enumerate the operators that have to deal with the painted ladder and

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.240
the painted ceiling. Here the operator might be paint ladder.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.405
Here the operator might be paint ceiling, but that requires some

00:00:26.405 --> 00:00:30.520
pre-condition climb up ladder which is not satisfy the initial state.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.330
So maintenance analysis picked the goal painted ladder. And select

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.990
the operator paint ladder, which gets the maintenance owner to this state.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.360
This is the holistic method. Here is the paint-ladder specified at the right,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.640
and you can see the peak conditions of paint-ladder, match the initial state,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.840
and the post conditions match the successive state. Now that means since

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.960
analysis has achieved the first goal of painted ladder it make turn to

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.140
the second goal of painted ceiling. Recall that this is the current state. So,

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.860
mean sense analysis may pick the operator climb-ladder, as a peak condition for

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.530
the operator of painted ceiling. But note what happens,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.460
when precondition of climb ladder, constitutes a postcondition of paint ladder.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.320
So this is not dry ladder, this is quest dry ladder. There is a conflict here.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.190
In a situation like this now, the robot, would need to just wait for

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.590
the ladder to become dry again, before climb ladder is a [UNKNOWN]. So

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.850
it seems as, as if the people who are sometimes hired for working on a home or

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.390
using main sense analysis. The first being the ladder, then the goal weight,

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.690
until the ladder dries up, and then they of course expect me to pay them for

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.092
their time. To summarize, we have a plan for achieving one of the goals,

00:01:40.092 --> 00:01:44.635
Painted Ladder. But this particular plan clobbers achieving the other goal,

00:01:44.635 --> 00:01:49.160
Painted(Ceiling), because it creates a condition, that makes it impossible to

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.800
achieve the other goal. The question now becomes [UNKNOWN] reason about

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.990
the conflict between these codes? How can planning systematically find out,

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.216
how to organize these various operators, so that these conflicts do not occur?

00:02:05.216 --> 00:02:09.250
What we have described here, this goal clobbering, is true for

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.890
all simple planners, sometimes called linear planners. Linear planner,

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.560
does not try to reason about the conflict between these goals. Does not try to

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.149
reason about how the plan for one goal may clobber another goal. Instead it

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:25.660
just goes about making plans as if those goals can be achieved in any order.
