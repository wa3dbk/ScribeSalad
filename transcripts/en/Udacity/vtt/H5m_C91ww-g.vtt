00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.547
Now that we've done some interest problems, let's try a mixture one. Mixture

00:00:03.547 --> 00:00:07.075
problems like this are helpful if you're at home and you want to make lemonade

00:00:07.075 --> 00:00:10.755
or punch. Usually, you're trying to make a different concentration than what you

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:14.187
already have in your fridge. Scientists also use this approach when they're

00:00:14.187 --> 00:00:17.926
trying to make different concentrations of chemical solutions in the laboratory.

00:00:17.926 --> 00:00:21.986
Let's see how it works. Let's use the same approach as before with rates and

00:00:21.986 --> 00:00:26.249
amounts to try and set up equations. The wording is slightly different here

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:30.537
because we're working with volumes and percentages, but I think you'll see a

00:00:30.537 --> 00:00:35.025
pattern. For this problem we have 5 gallons of a punch mix with 65% water. We

00:00:35.025 --> 00:00:39.010
want to mix it with a punch mix that's 80% water. So that way we get a mix

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.345
that's 75% water in the end. The question is, how much of this 80% mixture

00:00:43.345 --> 00:00:47.635
should we use? These are the two equations that we're going to try and set up.

00:00:47.635 --> 00:00:52.075
The first one takes into the account the gallons of water. For example, the

00:00:52.075 --> 00:00:56.662
first volume that I have is 5 gallons of punch mix. This punch mix is 65% water.

00:00:56.662 --> 00:01:00.877
So if I take my percentage of water and multiply it by the gallons of punch,

00:01:00.877 --> 00:01:06.372
I'll get my gallons of water. I change 65% to its decimal, and multiply by 5, to

00:01:06.372 --> 00:01:11.252
get 3.25 or 3 and 25 hundredths. Remember the question can help us identify the

00:01:11.252 --> 00:01:15.569
variable. We don't know how much punch mix we need that's 80%, so I'm going to

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:19.895
let that variable be x. Using x, and the information in the problem, I want you

00:01:19.895 --> 00:01:24.480
to complete our equation. What should go in these boxes? Mixes. Don't worry

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.262
about volume 3. We actually don't know that quantity yet.
