00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.972
iOS now includes a new system for
positioning UI elements on screen,

00:00:03.972 --> 00:00:05.107
called Auto Layout.

00:00:05.107 --> 00:00:09.891
You can think of Auto Layout as a simple
adaptive system to help iOS figure out

00:00:09.891 --> 00:00:14.100
how to size and
position your user interface element.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.620
You can use it to ensure that
your UI elements are sized and

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.840
positioned correctly, from the smallest
iPhone to the largest iPad.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.020
In this course, we're going to go
further in-depth on Auto Layout.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.280
And in particular, constraints.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.189
How to use constraints on user
interface elements and views.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.940
Auto Layout is very powerful.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.430
But it takes a little bit of practice
for it to become second nature.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.320
Right now, you're just starting.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.930
Remember, it's okay to be frustrated and

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.400
not to get it right on
the first few tries.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.300
Keep on it.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.310
And with very little time, you will
become comfortable with this powerful

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.050
and flexible system for
positioning and sizing UI elements.
