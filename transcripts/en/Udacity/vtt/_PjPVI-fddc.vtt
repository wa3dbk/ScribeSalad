00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.561
Some psychologists have suggested the Frustration Aggression Hypothesis. And

00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:07.663
this hypothesis states that we're likely to experience aggression when we're

00:00:07.663 --> 00:00:12.558
frustrated from not being able to meet our goals. Here's a simple example. A

00:00:12.558 --> 00:00:16.714
dog sees a piece of meat fall on the ground. That's his goal. A cat comes along

00:00:16.714 --> 00:00:21.512
and is also tempted to get that piece of meat. That is the frustration, and

00:00:21.512 --> 00:00:25.820
then the dog attacks the cat. That would be the aggression. Although this

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.770
explains some of our behavior, psychologists have suggested that the

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.070
frustration we experience from not being able to meet our goals is what results

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.983
in aggression. And interestingly we see this aggression in other animals. For

00:00:37.983 --> 00:00:41.094
example, if rats are shocked in a laboratory, they will attack just about

00:00:41.094 --> 00:00:44.307
anything in their cage, including another animal, a stuffed doll, or even a

00:00:44.307 --> 00:00:49.679
tennis ball. But let's go to Grey to look at another type of aggression.
