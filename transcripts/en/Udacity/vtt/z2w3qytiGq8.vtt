00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Norvig] So here I have the 2 calls to max.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And when I hit Run, I see the answers are 5 and -5.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So the first call to max, what's the maximum of 3, 4, 5, and 0?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
That's 5. That's the highest number.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The second call to max I'm using the keyword argument which says

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
give me the maximum according to this function,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
so give me the maximum of these numbers

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
according to the absolute value of those numbers.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And the largest absolute value is -5 has the absolute value of 5, so that's the highest,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and so that gives me the highest value.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And so here we see the result -5 is the actual value

00:00:42.000 --> 09:59:59.000
which has the highest according to the absolute function, and so it tells me -5 is the best.
