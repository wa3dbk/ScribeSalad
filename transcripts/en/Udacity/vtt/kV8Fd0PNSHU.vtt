00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.791
The first thing we need to do in order to start simplifying this expression is

00:00:04.803 --> 00:00:09.701
to identify which terms are like terms. Negative 5x squared is the only term in

00:00:09.713 --> 00:00:14.316
this expression that has an x to the 2nd power in it. So, it is not like terms

00:00:14.328 --> 00:00:19.182
of anything else here. However, we have 6x and negative x. At first sight, these

00:00:19.194 --> 00:00:23.889
might both seem related to the x squared term. But remember, the power of the

00:00:23.901 --> 00:00:28.094
term matters. Both of these terms have x to the firsts. Remember, there are

00:00:28.106 --> 00:00:32.274
little invisible ones written when you just have a variable on its own. x is

00:00:32.286 --> 00:00:36.466
just equal to x to the 1st. Anyway, these two terms are like terms. So, I'm

00:00:36.478 --> 00:00:40.906
going to start to rewrite this expression with the like terms next to one

00:00:40.918 --> 00:00:44.866
another. Remember that the sign of the term, it belongs to the term itself, and

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:48.560
moves along with it when we rearrange the order. Then the two terms that we

00:00:48.572 --> 00:00:52.441
haven't written yet are 14 and negative 3. These are just numbers, so they are

00:00:52.453 --> 00:00:56.351
definitely like terms, and we'll keep them next to one another. Now, that we've

00:00:56.363 --> 00:01:00.157
identified which terms are like terms, it's time to combine those like terms.

00:01:00.248 --> 00:01:05.555
So, negative 5x squared stays by itself, since we can't combine it with anything

00:01:05.567 --> 00:01:10.805
else. For the x to the 1st terms, we end up with a new coefficient of 6 minus 1

00:01:10.817 --> 00:01:15.755
or 5, so, plus 5 times the variable, which is x. And then all we have left to

00:01:15.767 --> 00:01:20.630
deal with are the numbers, 14 minus 3 is 11 so we add 11 to the end. Once we've

00:01:20.642 --> 00:01:24.806
written down our final expression, we can check and make sure that none of the

00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:28.703
terms in it are like terms of one another. That is, we only have one term of

00:01:28.715 --> 00:01:32.777
each type in the final expression. This is an x squared term, this is an x to

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.944
the 1st term, and this is a constant term. So, there's nothing more that we can

00:01:36.956 --> 00:01:41.104
combine. That means that we've reached the final stage of our simplification.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Awesome.
