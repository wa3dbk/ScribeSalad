00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.026
We can see that these two rational expressions are equal. If we switch the order

00:00:04.026 --> 00:00:08.954
of the terms in the numerator of this expression, we'll get x plus 9 divided by

00:00:08.954 --> 00:00:13.378
the quantity x minus 9. Now we need to decide between these two expressions. We

00:00:13.378 --> 00:00:16.948
can switch the order of the terms in the numerator and in the denominator. The x

00:00:16.948 --> 00:00:21.522
stays negative here and the 9 stays positive. For this expression, we don't want

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:25.276
to switch the order of the numerator, since it's already x plus 9. It matches

00:00:25.276 --> 00:00:28.605
the other ones. And here's where this negative sign comes in handy. We can

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:33.220
distribute this negative sign to each term in the numerator, or to each term in

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.475
the denominator. I'm going to multiply our denominator by negative 1. Negative 1

00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:43.776
times 9 is negative 9. And negative 1 times negative x is positive x. Finally,

00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:48.562
we commute this edition to get x plus 9, divided by the quantity x minus 9. So

00:00:48.562 --> 00:00:53.677
we know this rational expression is equal to these two. This one is definitely

00:00:53.677 --> 00:00:54.523
different.
