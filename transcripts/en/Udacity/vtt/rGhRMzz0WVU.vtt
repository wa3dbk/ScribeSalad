00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.200
So I want to conclude this lesson by providing a high

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.790
level view of this scrum process. The process is represented here,

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.939
and as you can see it has several components. We're going to

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:09.860
go through all of them one at a time. We're going to

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.110
start with a product backlog. Product backlog is the single source

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.420
of requirements, for the process. They're order by value raised priority

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.110
necessity, so that all of this characteristics can be taken into

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.920
account when selecting which backlog items to consider for the next iteration.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.710
It's a living list in the sense that backlog items

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.020
can be added or removed. And it's not really defined

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.200
as we just said, by the product owner. In the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.260
sprint planning, what happens is that the next increment or

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.180
the next sprint is defined. So basically, the backlog items

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.348
of interest are selected based on the characteristics we just

00:00:43.348 --> 00:00:46.890
mentioned: value, [UNKNOWN], priority, and necessity. And the items are

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.950
converted into tasks and estimated. So the result is this sprint

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.240
backlog, which is the set of backlog items that will

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.650
be completed during the next sprint. The sprint is an actual

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.040
iteration of this scrum process. It's got a main part

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.730
that lasts two to four weeks, and within this main part,

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.150
there are many daily scrums that last 24 hours. So

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.260
let's see how this work. A daily scrum is typically characterized

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.960
by a 50-minute meeting at the beginning of the day

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.220
for the team to sync, and what happens during the meeting

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.010
is that there is a discussion of the accomplishments since

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.210
the last meeting. A to do list for the next

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.210
meeting is produced, and there is also an obstacle analysis.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.690
So if some problem appear, they're discussing the daily scrum, and

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.905
possible solutions are proposed. At the end of the two

00:01:30.905 --> 00:01:34.840
four-week cycle, there is a sprint review and retrospective. The sprint

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.440
review normally consists of a four hour meeting. In the

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.270
meeting, the product owner assesses the accomplishment for the specific sprint,

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.020
and the team discusses issues that were encountered and solved.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.530
There is typically a demo of the deliverable for that

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.810
sprint. And at that point, the product owner will also

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.610
discuss the backlogs. And together with the team they will decide

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.230
what to do next. In the retrospective conversely what happens

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.140
is there is more focus on the process. So the

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.010
goal of that part of the meeting is discussing possible

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.850
process improvements. To identify them

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.140
and if promising improvements are identified

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.810
try to plan how to implement those improvements and use them

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.790
in the next iterations. And something else that might happen at

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.720
the end of a sprint is that if the product increment

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.210
is good enough as it reach the state in which it

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.660
can be actually shipped that will result in a release that

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.730
is not just internal. To show the product owner the progress

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.510
that can also be deployed and actually used in production. So

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.650
one final consideration is that as you can see, XP and scrum

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.340
are fairly similar, and that's because they're both agile development

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.930
processes. So the main thing to keep in mind is that

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.620
they both implement and enforce

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.380
those ideas, values, practices, and characteristics

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.600
that we saw when we discussed agile development process in general.
