00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.930
So far we've been working with user
input by polling for it each frame.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.510
The other approach to user input,
is an event based approach,

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.240
where we ask to be notified
when certain things happen.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.760
To do this in LibGDX, we need to create
an implementation of the input processor

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.670
interface and
tell LibGDX to send events our way.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.250
Let's check out how we've
done that in this demo.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.620
We've now declared our BouncingBall
class to extend InputAdapter.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.244
InputAdapter, just like
ApplicationAdapter and ScreenAdapter,

00:00:31.244 --> 00:00:34.830
is a convenience implementation
of input processor.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.670
One of the call back methods
of InputProcessor is keyDown,

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.070
which is called any
time a key is pressed.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.680
The argument is the keycode of
the key that was just pressed.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.480
In this case, we're just reusing
that randomKick function, and

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.400
we'll fire it any time
the space bar is pressed.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.840
The return value of all InputProcessor
methods is a boolean signifying whether

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.970
the input event was handled.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.480
This becomes relevant when you're
dealing with a more complex game,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.820
where there may be multiple classes
responding to input events.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.110
In this case, this is the only class
that cares about input events, so

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.480
we can go ahead and
say that we dealt with the event.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.400
There's one more thing we need to do
before this works and that is we need to

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.960
tell LibGDX that this class is
interested in receiving input events.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.435
The best place to do that,
is back in BallScreen, where we used

00:01:20.435 --> 00:01:25.410
GDX.input.set.InputProcessor, passing
in our new ball object.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.018
So here's our ball again.

00:01:28.018 --> 00:01:30.422
And we can grow it and shrink it,
just like we could before.

00:01:30.422 --> 00:01:33.340
And we can also move it around,
just like we could before.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.009
But now, if we hit spac ebar, it moves.

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.960
And if we hold down space bar,
it doesn't continue to move.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.680
It only receives that event when
the space bar is initially pressed.
