00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.912
Hi everyone. This week we continued our work with functions, learning how to

00:00:03.912 --> 00:00:08.188
find solutions of higher order polynomials. We also worked on dividing

00:00:08.188 --> 00:00:12.199
polynomials, specifically using long division. You can now find all the

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:16.373
possible real and complex zeros of a function. Let's try a few problems to

00:00:16.373 --> 00:00:18.694
practice what we've learned.
