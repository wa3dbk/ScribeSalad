Based on what we found out in the last quiz, that Grant will make a profit of

00:00:04.244 --> 00:00:08.538
$700 if he sells no cleaning sets. What conclusion should we draw? Does this

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.807
mean that Grant can pull money out of thin air? Does it mean that his initial

00:00:12.818 --> 00:00:17.249
predictions about profit based on the number of cleaning sets that he sold were

00:00:17.261 --> 00:00:21.456
not really very good, or does this mean that Grant will have lost $700 if he

00:00:21.468 --> 00:00:24.490
doesn't sell any cleaning sets?

00:00:24.494 --> 00:00:28.740
Please pick what you think is the best answer.
