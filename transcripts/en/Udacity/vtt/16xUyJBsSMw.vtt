00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.250
So here is a snapshot of our code. Now, we know that when we

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.420
downloaded Twilio, we got, among other things,

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.720
a folder called twilio. And inside that folder

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.129
is a folder called rest. Inside rest, is a python file, which has a

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.645
class called TwilioRestClient. Now, when we say

00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:26.030
rest.TwilioRestClient, with those parentheses after the class name,

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.330
what we are really doing is calling the

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.860
init function defined inside the class. And that creates

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.090
an instance. We call that instance client, and

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.480
then we do a bunch of stuff with that

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.875
instance, like send SMSes. Now, we know that

00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:43.390
TwilioRestClient is a class. And we've seen another class

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.200
before which is class Turtle. Let's figure out

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.660
if there are any similarities between these two classes.
