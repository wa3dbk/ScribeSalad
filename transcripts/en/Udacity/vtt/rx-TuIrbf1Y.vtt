00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.210
Okay, so we've done a little
bit of user research.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.910
We've gotten our
feedback from our users.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.370
And we've pulled out
the bits that are useful.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.380
And we've just now talked about how to
bucket the feedback from multiple users.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.300
The final step is to decide whether
we want to make another low fidelity

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.630
prototype or whether we want to move on
to making a medium fidelity prototype.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.980
There are really two
deciding factors here.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.430
First, did we get feedback that answers
the question we started out with?

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.890
Second, does the feedback overall say
that we're going in the right direction?

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.330
If the answer to both questions is yes,

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.100
we should make a higher
fidelity prototype.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.190
If the answer to either question is no,
we should make another low fidelity

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.030
prototype, incorporating what
feedback we can from this one.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.930
It's vital to note that the second
question is very subjective.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.060
For some prototypers,
it's important to have 90%

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.540
positive feedback to feel like
you're going in the right direction.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.050
For some,
you only need 50 percent positive.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.100
So with all that in mind,

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.230
do you think it's better to move on
to medium fidelity prototypes, or

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.480
do you think it's better to do
another round of low fidelity first?
