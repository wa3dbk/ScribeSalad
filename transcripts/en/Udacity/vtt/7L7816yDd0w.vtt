We know if we use 100%, the company will keep it's 200 pairs of shoes. We want

00:00:04.988 --> 00:00:09.902
to increase this number. So we need to multiply by a number bigger than 100%.

00:00:10.012 --> 00:00:15.024
They want to increase the inventory by 25%. So, we should multiply by 125%. So,

00:00:15.036 --> 00:00:19.945
let's actually see this problem worked out. I want to take 125% of the

00:00:19.957 --> 00:00:26.245
inventory, so I have 125% of is times the inventory, which is 200 pairs of shoes

00:00:26.257 --> 00:00:32.545
from my company. I know percent means divide by 100, so I move the decimal point

00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:38.740
2 places to the left. I have 1.25 times 200. When I multiply, I get 250 pairs of

00:00:38.752 --> 00:00:46.658
shoes. Okay, this is great. And we can actually make sense of this another way.

00:00:46.814 --> 00:00:53.371
We can think of 200 as four 50's. Each 50 is one-quarter, or 25% of 200. If I

00:00:53.383 --> 00:01:00.467
want to increase 200 by 25%, I'm going to add another 50. So I have 50 and 50,

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:05.640
which is 100. I have another 100, which is 200. And 50 more, which is 250. If

00:01:05.652 --> 00:01:11.280
you could reason through percentages like that in your head, that's great. If

00:01:11.292 --> 00:01:14.016
not, you can always rely on the math.
