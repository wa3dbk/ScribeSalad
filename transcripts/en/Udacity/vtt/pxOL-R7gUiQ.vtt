00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.510
Okay, I think we're now ready to
derive a parallel version of BFS.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.410
To summarize,
let's recall the two big ideas.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.050
First, you should carry out a BFS
level by level, not vertex by vertex.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.790
Secondly, you should process
an entire level in parallel, so

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.940
remember, why does this work?

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.770
Essentially you perform the same
action on every vertex of the level so

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.380
the order in which you visit
those vertices shouldn't matter.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.150
So here's a high level pseudocode
that embodies these two big ideas.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.150
Now it looks almost exactly like
the sequential algorithm but

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.620
there are two really
important differences.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.060
First, the algorithm
is level synchronous.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.701
Notice that there's a level counter and

00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:46.240
there are these level-specific
frontiers, F sub L and F sub L+1.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.100
Now since this loop is going level by
level, the span, as defined by the while

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.030
loop anyway, ought to be no more
than the diameter of the graph.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.930
Now to implement the second idea,

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.540
I've hidden everything in this
function called process level.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.250
We're going to have to say more about
how you actually implement this thing.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.720
But essentially what it does is it takes
the graph and the current frontier, and

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.800
it'll produce a new frontier.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.450
It'll also update
the distances of course.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.860
Now to actually make all of this work,

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.810
we have to say, what is the data
structure that we can use for f?

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:20.420
And for that,

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.020
I'm going to tell you about a special
data structure called a bag.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.680
Dun da da da, super bag.
