00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.370
This systematized nomenclature of
medicine SNOMED and SNOMED-CT,

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:12.170
a subset for clinical medicine, began in
NIH and was recently just for pathology.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.120
Interestingly, the original objective
back in the 70s was machine coding

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.420
of a pathologist's free
text dictated note.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.190
It was always in ontology representing
relationships among its concepts.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.520
Today it has expanded to all of
medicine, and is maintained by

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.940
the International Health Terminology
Standards Development Organization.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.330
SNOMED is huge and complex.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.226
Even the SNOMED-CT subset
has 311,000 concepts.

00:00:41.226 --> 00:00:46.590
And represents 1.3 million
relationships among them.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.910
Concepts are a basic component of
SNOMED-CT and have clinical meaning.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.288
They're identified by a unique
nine digit numeric concept ID and

00:00:56.288 --> 00:01:01.120
a unique human-readable
fully specified name.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.880
Concepts can be represented as
a hierarchy based on level of detail

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.810
as shown here where we go

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.970
at least detail from the concept of
a procedure at some site of the body

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.790
all the way to a very specific procedure
done at a very specific location.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.500
This illustration shows other
basic components of SNOMED-CT.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.840
Relationship links, which are expressed
using is a, and attribute relationships,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.250
which are a finding site or
an associated morphology.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.880
So a fracture of the tarsal bone,
is a sub type of a fracture of the foot.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.850
The tarsal bone is part of the foot,
and has a finding site, and

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.400
an associated morphology,
the location of the fracture and

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.900
the fact that it is in fact a fracture.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.630
The ability of SNOMED to
represent medicine and

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.650
medical concepts is illustrated here,
where we see that the patient has

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.590
a particular condition, Acute
Post-Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis,

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.800
a condition I actually
had as a teenager.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.417
It's caused by group
A Beta-hemolytic Streptococcus,

00:02:12.417 --> 00:02:16.562
which is an organism that
affects a body structure,

00:02:16.562 --> 00:02:21.760
the kidneys, and it's a clinical
finding or a medical problem.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.080
Using this hierarchy a computer
could recognize these relationships.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.100
This is actually a simple example
showing only three of the 18

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.620
top level components in the SNOMED
hierarchy, Body Structure,

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.470
Clinical Finding, and Organism.
