00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.029
What are the actions you
would tell me to take?

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:04.000
What are the things you
would tell me to do?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.768
&gt;&gt; There's like eating the dots.

00:00:05.768 --> 00:00:06.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah like that.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.710
So that seems like a reasonable
thing to do eat dot.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.500
&gt;&gt; I guess the little dots versus
the big dots they might be two different

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.880
things because I want to eat a big
dot if I want to turn the tables on

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.120
the ghosts and pursue them.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.080
&gt;&gt; Right, okay, so,
I'll just call the little dot dot.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.930
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.230
And then I feel like it's really
important to have a strategy for

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.428
escaping from the ghosts or pursuing
the ghost depending on the mode.

00:00:31.428 --> 00:00:35.230
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, yeah so,
you might want to eat a ghost and

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.040
you might want to avoid a ghost.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.020
Anything else?

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.390
&gt;&gt; I mean I guess we could come up
with more detailed strategy ideas but

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.320
those feel like the basic things.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah I think that
pretty much covers it.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.050
And if you were, when we go back and

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.910
we listen to the recording later Michael
I think you'll find that this is almost

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.640
exactly what you said when you
explained how the game worked.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.020
You said you need to
eat the little dots.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.538
And you also have to eat the big dots
eventually because you need to clear.

00:01:01.538 --> 00:01:05.950
If the ghost touch you then you die,
so you need to avoid the ghosts.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.440
But if you eat the big dots then
you can actually eat the ghosts.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.250
And that's pretty much how
you describe the game.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.150
&gt;&gt; I see, so,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.280
the way that I kind of thought about the
game to convey it to people, is at this

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.950
sort of high level that kind of makes
sense with respect to options as well.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.730
&gt;&gt; Right, which is what I also think was
true in the in the other grid world.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.600
Now, we could look at this and

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.430
we say well these are options and
maybe we can learn these options, or

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.902
they're given to us and somebody could
code them up for us, I don't know.

00:01:31.902 --> 00:01:34.340
I want to point out a couple of
things about these options though and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.280
this is going to bring us back
to your excellent analogy.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.150
About programming and about computing.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.450
Which is if we think of these things
as functions or procedures to execute.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.370
Which I think is a perfectly
reasonable thing to do.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.880
I want to point out that
what we get from functions,

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.370
procedures is not just the ability
to reason at a high level.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.070
But we also get something
called separation of concerns.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.950
Which allows us to only think
about parts of the world.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.670
So for example if you want
me to multiply two numbers.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.110
I only have to worry
about those two numbers.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.790
I don't have to worry about
the state of the stack or

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.560
whatever else is going
on in this program.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.060
I just need to worry about the two
numbers you're asking me to multiply.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.150
So there's a similar kind of
gain in abstraction that you get

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.190
here by picking options carefully.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.330
So, to illustrate this I'm going to
ask you to do one more thing.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.390
I want you to tell me,
what are the states of this world?

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.160
What are the features that
make up the states in Pac-Man?

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.610
Okay so there's,
well it's definitely different

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.100
if there's any dots left
versus there's no dots left.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.000
&gt;&gt; Right, so-
&gt;&gt; That's an important distinction.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.590
&gt;&gt; So the dots and
where they are on the screen matter.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.360
So there's-
&gt;&gt; You want,

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.880
okay so not an abstraction of the state.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.850
You actually want literally
the things that make up the state.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.280
&gt;&gt; Well which I claim as an abstraction
of the state, almost by definition.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.300
So, I think what you said before
works in either case, right?

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.350
So there're dots,
there're dots on the screen.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.340
I need to know where all the dots are,
and so there's some set of features,

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.880
the make of the state that
tell me where dots are.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.510
&gt;&gt; Right, okay, so
then there's where the Pac-Man is.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.060
The location of the little dots,
location of the big dots,

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.280
location of the Pac-Man,
location of the ghosts.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.360
And I guess the walls aren't
really part of the state.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.540
In the sense that they
don't really change.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.680
Though I guess if we were talking about
multiple levels of the game we might

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.075
have to also say where the walls are.

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:34.520
&gt;&gt; True, I'm going to claim that you
don't have to do that because it's all

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.980
going to be taken care of by the, you
could and there's nothing wrong with it.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.630
But it's actually all going to be taken
care of by the transition function.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.198
Right there's, you can't enter wall.

00:03:41.198 --> 00:03:44.140
So you can't from a state go
into where a wall happens to be.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.220
&gt;&gt; Okay, and whether the ghosts are in,

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.270
I don't know what to call it,
but power pellet mode.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.740
Whether the ghosts are fleeing from us,
or whether they're attacking us.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.158
&gt;&gt; Right, so
we talk about scared ghosts.

00:03:58.158 --> 00:04:01.080
&gt;&gt; Scared,
whether the ghosts are scared, I see.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.390
They always look a little
scared with their bulging eyes.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.170
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.680
Not when they're coming
after you they don't.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.570
But when they start blinking purple and
they're running away from you and

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:09.610
screaming, aah!

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.785
Then they seem a little scared to me.

00:04:10.785 --> 00:04:12.104
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Maybe that's just my

00:04:12.104 --> 00:04:13.200
version of Pac-Man.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.010
Anyway.
So here's a bunch of features.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.800
And the details here matter
in implementation, but

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.070
I think for
what we're talking about don't, right?

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.250
And we talk about where the dots are.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.660
It doesn't have to be
where the dots are,

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.490
it could be where
the closest dot is to you.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.420
Or where the farthest dot is to you,
or it could be every single dot and

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.740
whether it's on or off.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.194
Same true for the big dots.

00:04:32.194 --> 00:04:35.930
Pac-Man, you have to
know where Pac-Man is.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.950
You need to know where ghosts are maybe
just need to care about where the closes

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.070
ghost is whatever.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.690
It does matter whether they're scared or
not.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.890
In the same way that we don't have
to keep track of the walls or

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.650
other things here we might
not have to keep track of.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.380
But, whatever it is we're going to do in
the detail I think to solve the game,

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.020
I think your reasoning is right.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.080
You need to know where the dots are of
various flavors we need to know where

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.630
the ghost and

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.150
where we are and we need to know
whether we can eat the ghost or not.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.430
And these features however they're
exactly expressed, are important for

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.390
solving and planning in the game.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.700
Now, here's the observation
I'm going to make,

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.960
just like when I ask you to multiply two
numbers I don't need to know everything

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.760
else that's going on in your program.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.910
I suspect that is the case that,
even though I need all of these features

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.840
to effectively and
efficiently solve a Pac-Man board.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.770
My options do not necessarily
need to know all of these things.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.140
So, for example if you
told me to avoid the ghost

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.044
ask yourself whether it matters
whether the ghosts are scared or not.

00:05:33.044 --> 00:05:35.160
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Interesting, okay.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.850
Yeah, I guess if I'm if I
am avoiding the ghosts.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.960
Well, yeah, it changes their behavior,
so it may depend on that, sure.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.140
&gt;&gt; Right, so I think we should delve
into this a little more deeply.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.390
And the way I want to
do that is with a quiz.
