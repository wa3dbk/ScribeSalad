00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:02.105
So let's say we have 32 threads,

00:00:02.105 --> 00:00:04.842
each of which has a different item to look up in a hash table.

00:00:04.842 --> 00:00:07.510
Let's say all those threads map to the same bucket,

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.852
and there's 32 items in that bucket,

00:00:09.852 --> 00:00:12.048
each of which will be the target of one of the lookups.

00:00:12.048 --> 00:00:17.076
So all 32 threads will loop through the chain until all 32 threads have found their item.

00:00:17.076 --> 00:00:20.758
If we consider the fundamental unit of work here, the thread iterations,

00:00:20.758 --> 00:00:24.823
what fraction of thread iterations here actually do useful work?
