00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.290
Now, that we are armed with the knowledge of how d3 binds data and

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.450
how to work with enter selection, let us recreate the dimple JS chart in d3,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.530
and then extend it to add further context.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.200
Here we are back in the terminal.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.010
And before we can see our chart, we have to run a HTTP server.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:28.840
Again, I'm going to be using the python built in, simple HTTP server.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.159
And we can see here, it's serving up our current folder.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.044
Local host port 8000.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.630
And as you can see here.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.070
We have our world cup attendance scatter and line plot that we created in lesson

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.220
two where attendance is on the y-axis, and the year is on the x axis.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.030
And each of these circles accurately represents the total attendance for

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.450
the World Cup held in that year.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.720
Going back to our Sublime text window,

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.880
I want to step through the Dimple.js chart creation code here, and replace,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.480
line by line, what Dimple.js does for us with native D3 itself.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.250
One thing you'll notice is that even simple things, such as creating the chart

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:24.120
object or adding a y axis in D3, will end up being much more verbose.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.380
Then there are in Dimple.js, but we'll have much more flexibility on what our

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.300
chart looks like and how to customize it.
