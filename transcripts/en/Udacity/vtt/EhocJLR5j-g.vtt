00:00:00.482 --> 00:00:06.041
Knowledge based is a dominate field with a very active research program. There

00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:11.200
are number of exiting projects going on right now. Here is a small list of them.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.390
CALO is a project, in which cognitive assistant learns and organizes knowledge.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:21.250
CALO, in fact was a pick cursor for the CD program of Apple. Cyc and OMCS.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.690
OMCS stands for Open Mind Common Sense. Cyc and OMCS are two large knowledge

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.119
bases to support everyday common sense of reasoning. Wolfram Alpha is a new kind

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.430
of search engine that uses some of the same kind of pilot structures we have

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.460
considered in this particular class, different from many of the search engines.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.930
The three projects in the right column are projects here at Georgia Tech. VITA

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.270
is a computational model of visual thinking in autism. And particular it solves

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.250
problems in the real world raven's progressive matrices test using only visual

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.680
spacial representations. Dramatis is a computational model suspense in drama and

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.260
stories. Recall that in this class we talked about the theory of humor and

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.890
surprise. Dramatis tries to do the same thing for suspense. DANE is a system for

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.710
supporting design based on analogies to natural systems. We've come across this

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.720
idea of biologically inspired design earlier in the class and DANE supports that

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.210
kind of biologically inspired design. We have provided references for

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.070
these and many other knowledge based AI projects in the class notes.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.360
Your welcome to explore depending on your inquests.
