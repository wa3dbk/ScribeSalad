00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.590
For the next quizzes,
we'll be analyzing this layout.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.939
Let's see how it looks,
when it gets larger.

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.000
Go ahead and pull this out,
and there we go.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.420
We can see that we have a breakpoint.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.440
And this is our desktop layout.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.890
For this quiz and the next one,
type in the widths of each element as

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.490
percentages, into
the boxes you see here.
