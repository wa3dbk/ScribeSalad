00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.828
Again since we have the logarithm of one amount on one side, and the logarithm

00:00:03.828 --> 00:00:08.887
with base 3 of another amount on the other side. We can set these amounts equal

00:00:08.887 --> 00:00:13.835
to one another. Now this property only holds true if the bases are the same,

00:00:13.835 --> 00:00:20.010
and we have one log on the left, and one log on the right. This means we have

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.723
three x minus 2 equal to x minus 4. Solving for x, I'll subtract x from both

00:00:25.723 --> 00:00:30.908
sides to get 2 x minus 2 equals negative 4. We'll add 2 to both sides in order

00:00:30.908 --> 00:00:36.314
to isolate the 2x. And finally, we'll divide both sides by positive 2 to get x

00:00:36.314 --> 00:00:41.805
is equal to negative 1. But here's where we want to be careful. If we plug in a

00:00:41.805 --> 00:00:48.258
negative 1 in for x, we'll have log base 3 of negative 5. The same would be

00:00:48.258 --> 00:00:52.721
true on the right-hand side. If I plug in a negative 1 here, I'll have log base

00:00:52.721 --> 00:00:58.372
3 of negative 5. But here's the question. Can we really take the log base 3 of

00:00:58.372 --> 00:01:02.730
negative 5? What would that equal? Well, we'd be saying 3 raised to some

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.102
unknown power, equals negative 5. There's no power that we could raise the base

00:01:08.102 --> 00:01:13.834
3 to that would make it equal to negative 5. So this we can't do. Remember that

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:19.662
we can't take the log of negative numbers, this number must be greater than

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:29.062
zero. This means x equals negative 1 isn't a solution so we have no solution.
