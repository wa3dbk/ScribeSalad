00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.650
If you checked all three of them, you're

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.920
exactly on the right track. Let's talk about

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.400
it. First of all, you know that with

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.270
this, with the naive implementation there is going to

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.760
be too much contention for the lock when

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.000
the lock is released. Because everybody, both t2

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.260
and t3 in the previous example, jumped in

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.000
and started looking at the test and set instruction,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.520
trying to acquire the lock. And there are thousands

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.232
of processes, everybody is going to be executing this

00:00:31.232 --> 00:00:33.240
test and set instruction, so there is going to

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.380
be plenty of contention on the network, in order to

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.640
get to that shared variable, that's the first problem.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.700
Now, let's talk abolut why the second answer is

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.610
also the right answer. You know from the previous

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.520
lesson that a shared memory multiprocessor has private caches associated

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.420
with every one of the processors. And it is

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.870
often the case that the caches may be kept

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.570
coherent by the hardware. Now if the private caches

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.950
associated with every processor and if a value from

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.600
memory can be cached in that, there is an

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.260
issue with test and set instruction. And that is,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.910
test and set instruction cannot use the cached value,

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.590
because it has to make sure that the memory

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.180
value is modified atomically when, when it is inspecting

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.510
the memory. And therefore. By definition, a test and set

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.370
of instruction, is not going to exploit caches, it is

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.060
going to bypass the cache and go to memory, in

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.880
order to do the test and set operation. And therefore

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.722
yes, this is also true, that the spin algorithm that

00:01:36.722 --> 00:01:38.870
I gave you, spin on test and set, is not

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.628
going to be able to exploit the caches. The third

00:01:41.628 --> 00:01:44.706
problem is, is the fact that it might disrupt

00:01:44.706 --> 00:01:47.430
useful work. And it's also a good answer and

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.750
the reason is because, when a processor releases the

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.310
lock. After releasing the lock, that processor wants to

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.660
go on and do some useful work. And similarly.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.940
If, let's say there are four processors trying to

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.910
acquire the lock. Only one of them is going

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.650
to get it, and the others are going to have to

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.449
back off, because they're not going to have the lock.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.570
Now the one, one guy that did get the

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.730
lock has useful work to do. But, because of

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.960
the fact that there's a lot of contention, the

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.360
guy that can actually do useful work is being

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.880
impeded from doing useful work because the contention that

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.140
is there. In all the other processors trying to

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.720
go and get the lock when it is not available.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.889
So, this is really the problem, that the test

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:37.420
and set instructions, because it is bypassing the caches,

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.630
it's first of all causing a lot of contention

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.200
on the network and it is also impeding some

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.580
of the useful processor from carrying on with its

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.910
work. Which may advance the cause of the parallel

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.970
program. So all of these are good answers in

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.160
terms of the problems with this, with this naive spinlock.
