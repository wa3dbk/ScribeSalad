No our calculator has two log buttons. It has the plain log, which means log

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.600
base 10, and it has an LN button for a natural log button, base E. That means

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.200
that converting to natural log is also really useful to us, if we're going to

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.590
change bases. Converting to base E is just as useful as converting to base 10,

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.620
since we can also plug this in on our calculator. So converting from base five

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.830
to base e, or in other words, converting to natural logs, what numbers belong

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.970
in these spots right here. And when you use a calculator, what number does this

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.370
expression evaluate to? Note that all I'm changing from this step to this step

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.539
is I'm rewriting log base e as ln.
