00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.360
So now, we're ready to finish the heart of our crawler. Let

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.680
me put the last statement in, so you know there's nothing else missing

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.580
and you'll be able to test this. And the last thing we

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.710
want to do is return the result in crawled. When we finished the

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.760
while loop, we're ready to return crawled, which is the list of

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.060
pages we found. What we have left to do is to figure out

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.520
what we do to crawl each page. This is going to be a

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.930
pretty tough quiz, I think you'll need at least two lines of code.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.540
If you think about using all the procedures that you've

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.700
learned about and the ones that you've defined in earlier quizzes,

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.320
you shouldn't need more than two lines. And the two

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.750
things that you need to do are update the value of

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.500
to crawl to reflect all the new links that are

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.100
found on page And update the value of crawled, to keep

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.150
track of the pages that have been crawled. See if

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.480
you can figure out how to finish the crawl web procedure.
