00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.480
Now let's discuss the internet
key exchange protocol.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.210
When A and B require IPsec for
traffic between them for the first time.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.470
We do not yet have an SA.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.390
In other words, they have not yet
agreed upon the security parameters.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.970
Such as inclusion and
authentication algorithms and keys.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.180
They need to negotiate these
parameters and store them in an SA.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.430
The Internet Key Exchange Protocol
is for this purpose.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.690
The protocol works in two phases.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.870
The first is to establish an IKE SA.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.270
Because the negotiation of an SA
should itself be protected.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.460
Then this SA is used to protect
the negotiations of multiple IPSec SAs.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.830
The ISA is bi-directional.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.130
That is, it protects the SA
negotiation traffic from both sides.
