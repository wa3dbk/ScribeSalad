00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.269
The other type of reasoning is inductive reasoning, and this is when we draw

00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:09.019
general conclusions from specific information. Now this is different than

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.629
deductive reasoning where we can make certain and necessary correct

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.239
conclusions. With inductive reasoning, we can only rely on highly likely

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:20.620
outcomes. For example, you may say that all cats you've known have been

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.004
friendly; therefore, all cats are friendly. And that may be the case for your

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:29.354
experiences. But for me, I've known some friendly cats, but I was also attacked

00:00:29.354 --> 00:00:33.745
by a pack of feral cats when I was a little girl. Therefore, your inductive

00:00:33.745 --> 00:00:36.930
reasoning is different than my inductive reasoning, and we can't be sure that

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.164
we've come to the correct conclusion. But let's go to Greg now and he's going

00:00:41.164 --> 00:00:44.380
to discuss inductive reasoning in a little more detail.
