00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.260
Let's do a quick exercise on this
high school linear programming.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.760
Here's the problem.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.039
A movie actor is
developing a workout plan.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:13.040
He will burn 12 calories for
every minute of step aerobics he does,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.600
and 4 calories for
every minute of stretching he does.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.250
The workout must include 5 minutes
of stretching for warmup and

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.820
cannot last more than 40 minutes total.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.130
The actor wants to burn as
many calories as possible.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.860
We'll let x be the minutes
spent on step-aerobics.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.850
And we'll let y be the minutes
spent on stretching.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.140
And I want you to express this actor's
problem as a linear program and

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.000
give the optimum values for
x and y here.
