00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Okay, so here we are in our editor, and we've got our form handling code,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and right now, it just prints, thanks, everytime.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's actually use our new verification functions.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So I've added a line here. I'm calling the valid_month function that we just wrote.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I'm sending in as the first argument to that function the 'month' parameter

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that was included in our request.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So this will indicate whether our response was valid or not.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I'm going to go ahead and add this for the day and the year as well.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Okay, so we've got these 3 variables, and now let's actually check them.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
If not (user<u>month and user</u>day and user_year),

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
we're going to rerender the form again.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
If all 3 of these aren't true, we're going to render our form.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Else if they are all true, we're going to say, thanks,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
which we have down here.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So to recap, we're getting our 3 parameters from the request.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We're running them through our valid_month, day, and year functions,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and if they are not all true, we rewrite the form,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and if they are all true, we say, "Thanks! That's a totally valid day!"

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Alright, let's give this a shot in our browser.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Okay, so here we are on our browser. I'm going to type in a day again.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Okay, so I typed in what I think is a valid month, day, and year,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and when I hit submit, our browser says, "Thanks! That's a totally valid day!"

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Let's go to the form again, and this time, we're going to type in something invalid.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Okay, now I've got an invalid month and normal day and year,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and when I click submit, the form just clears because we sent back the form again.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
We can improve this a little bit, and let's start doing that now.
