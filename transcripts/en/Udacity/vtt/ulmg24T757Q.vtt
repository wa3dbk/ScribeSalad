The answer is add friend, though we will need to do some extra work elsewhere

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:07.520
to make this happen. Until the add a friend, there's no way to know which line

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.885
to draw. And we want to draw the line as soon as we know which friends to

00:00:11.885 --> 00:00:16.219
connect. Which is when the add friend method is called.
