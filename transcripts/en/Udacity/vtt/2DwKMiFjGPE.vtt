00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.640
For this programming exercise, you just needed to add a

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.070
new layer onto our code, and that was the cord translayer.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.130
I'll pass at the y variable, and I'll set that

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.790
y equal to square root, which is the function we'll use

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.390
to transform the y axis. With this plot, it's much

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.170
easier to see the distribution of friend count, conditional, and age.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.130
For example, we can see thresholds of friend count above

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.370
which there are very few users. Now, you might have noticed

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.770
I went back from geom_jitter to geom_point. If we wanted to

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.610
also add jitter to the points, we'd have to use a bit

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.840
more elaborate syntax to specify that we only want to jitter the

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.150
ages. We also need to be careful since some people have a

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.690
friend count of 0. If we add noise to 0 friend counts,

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.260
we might end up with negative numbers for some of our friend

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
counts and those square roots would be imaginary, okay. So to make

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.420
this adjustment I'm going to set the position parameter equal to position

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.560
jitter and then I'll pass it a minimum height of 0. This

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.570
is a bit more advanced in terms of syntax but it prevents us

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.090
from having that warning message and

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.970
getting negative friend counts over here. Remember

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.220
that jitter can add positive or negative noise to each of our points.
