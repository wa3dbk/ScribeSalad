00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.790
Callbacks are the default JavaScript
technique for asynchronous work.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.730
Pass the function to another function,
and then call

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.440
the callback function at some later
time when some conditions have been met.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.870
This works well but there are some
questions without obvious answers.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.110
For instance, how do you handle errors?

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.070
It's best practice to assume that any
operation could fail at any time.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.510
It's doubly important to assume so
with network requests.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.200
If an error occurs here,
should you still execute the call back?

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.200
If so, what value should it receive?

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.210
If not, then what should happen?

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.060
What if it's a JavaScript error?

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.750
Should that be handled any
differently than a network error?

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.355
There's no clear answer.

00:00:46.355 --> 00:00:49.750
Node basically makes error
first callbacks mandatory but

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.780
that doesn't really solve the problem.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.120
It's still basically your job to define,
and

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.750
implement an error handling strategy.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.850
Assume that everything happened
just fine, no errors and

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.880
then this callback runs when
the onload handler gets called.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.830
Great.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.300
Now you've chained together
two pieces of work, but

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.990
what if this callback is also
an asynchronous operation and

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.790
you need something else
to happen afterwards?

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.430
Do you pass another function
with another callback here?

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.780
This is one scenario that leads to
something called the Pyramid of Doom.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.440
A dreadful situation
where there are nasty,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.300
nasty nested callbacks within
call backs, within callbacks.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.830
This looks ugly and
it's hard to write, but

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.980
the real sin is that it is
incredibly frustrating to debug.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.650
This is the same kind of code, but

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.580
written with promises,
and my, it looks nicer.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.250
You'll be learning all about the beauty
of .then later in this course.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.280
For now, just read this and appreciate
the fact that you can figure out what's

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.010
happening here, despite the fact that
you haven't even finished this course.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.770
That's pretty awesome.
