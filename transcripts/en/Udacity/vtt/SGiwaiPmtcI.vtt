In addition to studying false memory, psychologists also study forgetting and

00:00:03.952 --> 00:00:09.249
memory loss. Now, forgetting and memory loss are suggestive and reconstructive

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:15.128
processes. Sometimes it's easy to think of our memory as an objective recorder.

00:00:15.128 --> 00:00:18.898
When, in fact, we see that our memories are affected by how we distort, select,

00:00:18.898 --> 00:00:24.390
or even bias memory of events. So forgetting is the weakening of memories over

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.615
time and I'm going to share a personal example of that with you next. When we

00:00:28.615 --> 00:00:32.455
think about forgetting, we think about things we may have learned in school,

00:00:32.455 --> 00:00:37.499
such as definitions, equations or formulas. But we can also forget personal

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:43.869
episodic memories. For example, my Dad died when I was only 14 years old. And

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:47.314
for sometime after that I had lots of memories of everyday activities, things

00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:52.244
such as eating dinner, going for ice cream or even watching TV. However, one

00:00:52.244 --> 00:00:56.148
day when I was about 16 years old I realized that I had forgotten what my dad

00:00:56.148 --> 00:01:01.790
sounded like. Now in those days we didn't have video cameras or phones with

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.716
cameras on them so I had no film of my dad talking. When I remember this, I was

00:01:07.716 --> 00:01:12.686
so angry and upset with myself. I was beside myself. I thought how could you

00:01:12.686 --> 00:01:15.770
forget what your own father sounds like? What kind of a daughter am I if I

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.640
can't even remember what my dad sounded like? Now I have since learned not to

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.402
be so hard on myself for forgetting those things, because I hadn't been exposed

00:01:23.402 --> 00:01:29.188
to it in such a long time. However, I do try to actively recall and remember

00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:34.347
more memories so I don't lose those. Now as an example of just how subjective

00:01:34.347 --> 00:01:37.900
memory can be. My brother and a friend of ours recently got together, who we

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.784
hadn't seen in 20 years. And we were talking about this time that we all went

00:01:41.784 --> 00:01:46.389
down to this stream and we caught a carp. We brought it back to my mom. Each of

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:52.310
us had a different memory of what our mom said and did when she saw that fish.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.337
So we can see just how individual and subjective our memories can be. Perhaps

00:01:57.337 --> 00:01:59.756
you can talk to your parents or siblings, and see if you can come up with a

00:01:59.756 --> 00:02:03.580
memory, and whether or not you all agree on that's what really happened.
