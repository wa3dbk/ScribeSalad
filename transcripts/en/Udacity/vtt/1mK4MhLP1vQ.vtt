00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.110
Welcome back.

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.860
Now I know we've talked a bunch
about control flow already, but

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.980
we're still missing a big
piece of the puzzle.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.815
Sometimes we need the ability to
run our code multiple times or

00:00:08.815 --> 00:00:11.009
even run forever until
some condition's met.

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.220
And to do that, we need the loops.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.180
And that's what this
session's all about.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.790
Let's get started.
