00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.010
The single most important predictor of a successful software design effort

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.230
is the extent to which the development team,

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.760
staff, have experience on similar problems.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.770
Because we all want to participate in successful projects,

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.020
access to that experience is crucial.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.930
One key source of such experience is familiarity with

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.920
applicable design solutions.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.970
A design pattern is just that.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.000
A description of a solution to a problem in context.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.520
What this means is that for a given problem, a design pattern provides a way of

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.890
solving it, including a description of the issues and tradeoffs involved.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.130
Situations where the solution applies, options that you as a designer have,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.458
consequences of using a solution, and any implementation issues.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:46.760
Thus, design patterns are reusable design experience.
