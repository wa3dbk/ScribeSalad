00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.360
For more complex validation,

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.070
you've got the constraint
validation API which allow you

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.550
to harness the power of JavaScript
to validate inputs on the fly.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.330
Here let me show you how it works.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.830
The core of the constraint validation
API is this function, setCustomValidity.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.915
And as you could see,
it's getting a string.

00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:25.955
setCustomValidity makes
the assumption that if you

00:00:25.955 --> 00:00:30.096
pass a none empty string to it,
the input is invalid.

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:33.470
So it displays an error message.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.290
That means that the opposite is true.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.620
If you pass an empty string to it,
then the input is valid.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.590
In practice, simply set a callback on an
inputs, on input event like we did here.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.160
And at the end of the callback,
call setCustomValidity on the input.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.110
If we type in something like that,
we will get the error message.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.600
And if we are typing correctly,
we're passing the test.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.130
Good job.
