00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
A visualization of our Standford racing car, Junior,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
in action, applying that exact same algorithm for actual driving.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
You can see here that a right turn is being executed, followed by a lane shift.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
These are discrete actions, and the car actually performs those

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to reach a goal location at the orange circle.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
But if we make a lane shift prohibitively expensive,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
just as we made a left turn expensive before,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
then the car chooses a different path.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It goes straight, then takes a left turn, which right now isn't that expensive.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It takes a left turn and a left turn again to find itself

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
in the lane where the goal location is located.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
That is a result of modifying cost functions in our dynamic programming algorithm

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
in the same 3D regime we just studied and that you just programmed.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Your program could effectively drive this car, and by changing these cost function,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
as you can see over here, the car would be able to attain its goal

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
in the optimal way, relative to the cost that you have given him.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Congratulations. You made it through my first motion class.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Today we assumed that the world is discrete,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and we looked at 2 planning algorithms--A-star, which uses a heuristic to find a path,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and dynamic programming, which finds an entire policy that has a plan for every location.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
We implemented both of them.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
In fact, in the policy case, even in 3D, which is quite an achievement.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I want to congratulate you to get here.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
You really now understand two of the main paradigms

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
by which our robots make motion decisions,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and they are are also some very major paradigms for artificial intelligence in general.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
In the next class we talk about how to turn this into actual robot motion.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
We'll talk about continuous state spaces, and we'll talk about what's called "control,"

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
in which we make a robot move. I'll see you next week.
