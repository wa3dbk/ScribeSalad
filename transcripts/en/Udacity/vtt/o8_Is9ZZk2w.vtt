00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.410
So today we've covered some of the most advanced and

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.900
cutting edge topics in knowledge-based AI. If anything we've talked about today

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.720
has really caught your eye, we invite you to check out the course materials,

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.980
where we've provided several readings about each topic. As we said at

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.060
the beginning, many of the things we've talked about today are open issues that

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.770
the community is wrestling with right now, so we encourage you to

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.970
take up the discussion over on the forums. We'll be there participating as well.
