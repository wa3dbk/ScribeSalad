00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
To compute this, recall that b equals the sum of the product

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
of the difference of the x's from the mean and the y's from the mean

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
divided by the square difference between x and the mean

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So, the mean of the x's is 104, and the mean of the y's is 100.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now let's write out deviations for each term.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now for the differences of the y's.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If we add up the product of these, we get a fairly large number--896,000.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The denominator is equal to 892,100.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Taking the ratio of these two things gives us our answer of 1.004.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This is interesting, because it suggests when we have data like this

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
but add one single point all the way over here,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000
our best fit line goes from being this to being this.

00:01:07.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Now, note this isn't quite to scale. This point would really be all the way over here.
