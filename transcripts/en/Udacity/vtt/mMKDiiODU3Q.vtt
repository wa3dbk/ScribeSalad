00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.950
So to understand query world a bit more, you going to

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.420
add another filter to the query in your query playground

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.280
method. So now here we get all the conferences, sorted

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.390
by name, filter on the city is London, e filter on

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.810
topics is medical innovations, filter on month is six. But

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.530
now I'm going to add one more filter, I want to filter

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.970
on max attendees greater than ten. Now I'm going to run

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.345
this query on localhost. I'm going to try it out in the

00:00:25.345 --> 00:00:30.080
APIs Explorer. Oops. Got an error. How did that happen?

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.260
But look, it's got some good information in here. If

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.700
you get an error, read it carefully. Remember, you can

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.100
copy and paste it into an editor that renders HTML

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.110
to make it easier to read. So it's now your

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.440
turn to add an inequality filter. Add a filter for

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.580
max attendees greater than ten, and then go ahead and

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.540
try the query on localhost. And test it out using

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.290
the APIs Explorer. I'm guessing that you're

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.260
going to get an error. But what caused

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.710
the error? Is it because the first sort order is a name, but the

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.400
inequality filter is on max attendees? Or is it because the composite index does

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.580
not exist? Or is it because you have too many inequality filters in one query?
