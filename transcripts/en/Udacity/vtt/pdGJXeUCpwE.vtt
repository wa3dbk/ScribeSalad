00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.680
As an example, the simplest connector I can think of is a procedure call and

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.900
return. This is a pair of messages. The first one you're calling some method,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.780
and second you're getting every turn value passed back.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.510
This is an asymmetric relationship, okay, that is the caller,

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.190
okay? One of the two roles for the, for the connector is caller and the other's

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:30.150
callee. The caller waits, once he's issued the call, for the callee to re,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.300
return. Okay? It's a synchronous relationship because the caller blocks or.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.120
Stops any further computation. The connector also allows for

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.200
the passing of information in terms of typed parameters and

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.850
the second message may include a return value, also a typed value.
