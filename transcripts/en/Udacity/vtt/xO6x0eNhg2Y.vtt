00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:02.360
Here's our food router, and

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.190
here's the call to start
monitoring the app's history.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.670
Inside food router is
the list of routes and

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.260
the functions to call when
those routes are visited.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.160
When the URL changes to /clear,
call the clear function.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.430
Let's add a breakpoint where we
create the new foodRouter router,

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.760
then refresh the page, which will
pause right at the breakpoint.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.210
Let's step through how
everything gets set up.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.798
This calls the parent Router class,
sets up some options,

00:00:26.798 --> 00:00:28.465
and then binds the routes.

00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:31.900
_bindRoutes is the important
function in all of this.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.450
It gets the route from the foodRouter
router and starts cycling through them.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.720
It takes the last route, passes it and
its callback to the route function.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.540
The route function takes the route and
converts it into a regular expression.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.630
This regular expression will be used
later when matching the browser's URL.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.290
If the callback is a string and

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.530
not a function itself, it gets
the function from the foodRouter object.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.250
It then calls Backbone.history.route,
passing it the route and

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.860
a callback function.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.019
This function will be called later, but
see here that our original callback

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.080
function will be executed
when this function gets run.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.901
Backbone.history.route adds
the route and

00:01:10.901 --> 00:01:13.730
the callback to its list of handlers.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.990
Then we just work our way back to bind
routes, and do all that again for

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.585
the next route.
