00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The correct answer is an error was displayed.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let me try that in my browser.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So--we have our text, we click submit,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and we get this error 405--method not allowed.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Now--remember--this is a status code--

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
we talked about status codes in the previous unit

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and in this particular case, 405 means method not allowed.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And if you recall, status codes that start with the number 4

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
are considered errors on our side, or on the browser's side.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So in this case, our application is saying,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the method POST is not allowed for this resource.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Resource is referring to slash test form.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Let's take a look at our code.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
What we changed in our code is we changed

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
our method from the default get to post,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
but our test handler down here,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
which handles requests for slash test form

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
is only configured to use get.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So, let's change this function to the word post.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
What the Google framework allows us to do is

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
have a different function for each type of method request.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So until now we've been using get,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
but now that we're doing a post request,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
because our form method is post,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
we need to have that function implemented.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Okay--so we change this to post,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and we go to our browser and we try it again.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Okay--here we are in our browser,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
we type some words.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And we hit submit--

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
ah--it's behaving just like it was before,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
except this time our q parameter isn't in the URL.
