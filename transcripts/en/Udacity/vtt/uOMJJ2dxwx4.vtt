Something interesting happened and I believe it was not too long after about 2000

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is that the term fuzzing took on another connotation and in this connotation,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
fuzzing basically penetration testing, and what I mean by that is fuzzing is used for very specific

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
purpose which is finding security vulnerabilities in applications.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And usually the connotation is--is that the fuzzing is being done

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
on applications that the person doing the fuzzing didn't write.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So for example what we might do is find some sort of a machine on the Internet that offers a service

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and we'll do random testing over the Internet of that service with the goal of finding bugs in the

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
service that are going to let us mount an attack such as a denial of service or some sort of an

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
exploitable vulnerability that will let us mount an intrusion on that Internet service.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The sort of an interesting thing about this newer connotation of fuzzing is really gotten rather big.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So for an example, plenty of special purpose tools are available both commercial

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and open source for performing fuzzing over the network.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The best of these contains a lot of canned knowledge about protocols due to a lot of

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
relatively unskilled user to find bugs in services that are available over the network.
