[Evans] The last thing we'll do this unit is look at an application

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that combines many of the things we've seen so far.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Our goal is to figure out how to use passwords to do authentication.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We're going to assume that we have some file or database to keep track of users.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And for each user we want to keep track of something

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that will allow us to authenticate that user.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
In UNIX, this file is stored in /etc/passwd.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So our goal is that even if some malicious insider

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
or someone who can compromise our system can get access to the database

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
or the password file, they won't be able to impersonate users.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
They won't be able to log in by just being able to read this file.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
If they can modify this file, that's another story.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But let's assume that they can't modify it, they can just read it.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This is not a completely unrealistic model.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This is actually the model that motivated the design of the UNIX password system.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
There are lots of people that need to read this password file

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
but only very privileged applications that need to write to it.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So the really bad idea number 1 is to just keep the passwords in clear text.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
There actually are web applications that do that.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Any web application that actually does that is doing some things very, very wrong.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
First of all, it's wrong to send a password in email,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
especially one that was created by a user,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
but it also means that they're actually storing your password

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
in a way that they can recover it.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And that probably means that anyone else who has access to their database

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
can also recover it. So we want to do something better.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We want to provide this property that even if someone can get access to the database

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and read all the user and password information,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
they can't break into your account.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So that was really bad idea number 0: keeping the passwords in clear text.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Now we're going to move on to really bad idea number 1,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
which sounds a little bit more plausible but is not a good way to store passwords.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So here is the plan.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The server operator will generate some key.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Let's assume the server can generate a good random key.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And for each password we're going to store the encrypted value of that password,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
encrypting using the key using CFB mode.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
That's cipher feedback mode with message block size 8,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
so that will allow us to use this for any size string.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
8 is the number of bits per character.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
That could be 7 or 8 depending on how we encode the characters.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The question is, why is this a really bad idea?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Here are all the possible choices.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Select all the ones that apply.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
That it reveals the length of the password;

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
that the encrypted text reveals when 2 users have the same password;

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
that it requires use of E, an encryption function, which is slower than using a hash function;

00:02:33.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that if the key is compromised, that reveals all of the passwords.
