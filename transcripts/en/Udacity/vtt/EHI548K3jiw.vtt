00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.970
In the tree world, a balanced tree has
nodes condensed to only a few levels,

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.290
while an unbalanced tree has nodes
spread out among many levels.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.450
The most extreme type of unbalanced
tree is really just a linked list,

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.189
where every node has only one child.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.250
By that definition,
a self-balancing tree

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.200
is one that tries to minimize
the number of levels that it uses.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.900
It does some algorithm during insertion
and deletion to keep itself balanced,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.270
and the nodes themselves might
have some additional properties.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.200
The most common example
is a red-black tree,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.100
which is an extension of
a binary search tree.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.650
As is painfully common
in computer science,

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.290
the name turns out to be
very straightforward.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.570
In this type of tree, nodes are assigned
an additional color property

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.540
where the values must be either red or
black.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.750
The use of color as red or
black is just a convention.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.100
You really just need a way to
distinguish between two different types

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.330
of nodes.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.420
The second property of a red-black tree
is the existence of null leaf nodes.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.800
Every node in your tree that
doesn't otherwise have two leaves

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.600
must have null children.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.830
As you can see, all null leaf
nodes must be colored black.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.140
Next, if a node is red,
both of its children must be black.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.000
There's an additional optional rule,
the root node must be black.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.170
Lastly, for the rule that makes these
trees actually useful, every path from

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.110
a node to its descendant null nodes must
contain the same number of black nodes.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.860
We'll see these rules in action
when we talk about inserting.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.110
For now, know that these rules and

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.280
the last one in particular assure that
the tree never gets too unbalanced.
