00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.890
Some of the questions you might want to be asking as you're outside the building now

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.260
talking to customers is competition.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.550
Competition kind of exists outside the business model canvas.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.700
Think of the canvas now floating in a world

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.550
where other people's business model canvases are floating as well.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.350
And so just kind of take a step back and go,

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.590
"Well, who else is out there and what are they doing?"

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.540
The next thing you want to be asking, again outside the canvas,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:31.270
why is this problem so hard to solve, or why is this service not being done by other people?

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.870
It might be that, hopefully, you really do have an insight or breakthrough.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.100
Or it might be you're hallucinating.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.820
And so you really do need to keep asking that question

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.130
not only to yourself; go ask it to the people you're talking to.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.980
Ask them, "Has anybody done this?" and if they go, "Yeah, we've never seen this,"

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.270
ask them why. "Why do you think?"

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.150
You might get some insight, like, "Oh yeah, there have been 9 vendors

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.740
"in the last 3½ years who tried this, and they all failed."

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.500
Warning: You might want to investigate why that happened.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.660
Hopefully you have a different approach or different insight than anybody else.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.980
As we kept talking about earlier, market size.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.680
We're going to be talking about how to size the market at the end of this lecture.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.040
But you really do want to understand how big is this problem,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.720
and is this what we want to spend our next couple years doing?

00:01:19.720 --> 99:59:59.000
And then finally, as we said, how do you do it once you understand the customer needs?
