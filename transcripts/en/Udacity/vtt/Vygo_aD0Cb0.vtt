00:00:00.071 --> 00:00:05.409
We would expect the assignment of local variables to be the very fastest.

00:00:05.409 --> 00:00:07.309
Shared memory is also very fast.

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:11.515
A and b are both shared memory variables, so you would expect that to be fast.

00:00:11.515 --> 00:00:15.784
Global variables are all the way out in global memory, so they're going to be the slowest.

00:00:15.784 --> 00:00:20.992
We would expect that this assignment of the contents of y to the contents of z

00:00:20.992 --> 00:00:22.960
is probably the slowest operation.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.535
And this one, which is moving a piece of data from global memory into shared memory,

00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:29.999
is probably the second slowest.

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.421
By the way, if you know anything about compilers, you realize that this is an oversimplification.

00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:37.222
Right? It's quite possible that many of these values will be promoted into registers.

00:00:37.222 --> 00:00:41.124
An optimizing compiler might rearrange accesses and so forth.

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:44.929
But the point is simply to get across the relative speeds of memories.
