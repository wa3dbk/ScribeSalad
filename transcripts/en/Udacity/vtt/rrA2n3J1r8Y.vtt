00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.467
Negative 5 is smaller than negative 1. It's the left of negative 1 on the number

00:00:04.467 --> 00:00:08.942
line, so we should pick negative 5 is less than negative 1. However, it's also

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:13.352
true then, that negative 1 is greater than negative 5, since negative 1 is to

00:00:13.352 --> 00:00:18.005
the right of the number line from negative 5. So these are both correct answers.
