The three functions we see graphed here, to make up our single piecewise

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.230
function are f of x equals 2.75, for 0 is less than or equal to x is less than

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:15.768
10. f of x equals 5 for 10 is less than or equal to x is less than 50. And f of

00:00:15.768 --> 00:00:20.470
x equals 0 for 50 is less than or equal to x. These correspond directly to the

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.650
different postages depending on how much our orders cost.
