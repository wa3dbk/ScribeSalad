00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.870
So let's say that there are missing values

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.110
in your data and they're distributed at random. What

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.920
do we do? There are two approaches that I

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.660
want to discuss here, partial deletion and impution. Partial

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.580
deletion is exactly what it sounds like, limiting our

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.710
data set for analysis to the data that we

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.450
have available to us. Let's discuss partial deletion further.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.790
For the following discussion let's use the Sean Lawman

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.050
database of baseball players. There are a number of

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.119
players for whom many values are missing. Now let's

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.780
say that we wanted to ask a couple of

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.300
different questions. For example what are the average life span

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.800
and average height of baseball players? There are many

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.050
players that we can't include in the analysis, either because

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.620
their birth date or death date is missing, or

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.800
because they're still alive. In this case, we may want

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.560
to perform partial deletion. One method we could

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.000
use is called Listwise Deletion. In the case

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.080
where we perform Listwise Deletion, we'd exclude a

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.120
particular data point from all analyses even if

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.070
some useful values were present. So if using

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.160
Listwise Deletion, Barry Bonds, who has a listed

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.460
height, but not death date, would not be

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.850
included in either analysis, even if we were calculating

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.590
the average height of players. On the other hand,

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.149
in the case where we might perform Pairwise Deletion,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.840
we would exclude a particular case from the analysis

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.030
for tasks which are not possible with the data

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.170
at hand. So we wouldn't include Barry Bonds in

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.940
our sample when calculating life span since there's no

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.500
death date, but we would still use his height

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.984
when calculating the average height of all baseball players.
