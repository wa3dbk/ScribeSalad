00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.540
Here's the Syntax. There's only one statement in the language.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.500
It's a statement which is a constraint. The constraint has a couple of

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.030
keywords in it, and a couple of expressions. The first keyword is context.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.170
And it's followed by an identifier. That identifier gives a name to the context.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.030
The context is where you are in a diagram. Usually this means a class, so

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.770
it's the name of a class. It might be the name of a particular method in

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.860
a class. Then there comes another keyword which is the kind of constraint, and

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.159
we'll see that there's three kinds of constraints. One is invariance,

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:42.550
one is pre, preconditions, and one is post conditions. And then comes a Boolean

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.720
expression, which is the actual constraint that the statement is expressing.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.790
&gt;From what I've just said you can infer correctly that OCL constraints

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.940
are inherently connected with UML class model diagrams, and

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.590
you probably will have already developed the class model diagram. And

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.389
then gone into details by specifying the details with the OCL constraints
