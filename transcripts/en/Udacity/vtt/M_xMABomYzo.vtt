Let's say we have f of x equals log based 10 of x and f inverse of x equals 10

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.516
to the x. But what happens if we take the composition of these functions? What

00:00:10.516 --> 00:00:14.720
does f inverse of f of x look like? Now, since these functions are inverses,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.279
you should already know what goes in this final box.
