00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.319
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This first inequality here, negative 2 is less than or equal to x and x is

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.883
less than 6 is choice c. This is the one we already talked about. We know that

00:00:08.883 --> 00:00:13.491
the area shared by the two inequalities here is the one that needs to be shaded

00:00:13.491 --> 00:00:18.146
in, which is just this area. Now let's try an or. Negative 2 is less than x, or

00:00:18.146 --> 00:00:22.203
x is less than 6. This is definitely tricky. The way that I like to try to graph

00:00:22.203 --> 00:00:26.298
these, is to start by putting the proper parentheses or brackets at the proper

00:00:26.298 --> 00:00:30.426
places, and facing the proper direction. So, first we have negative 2 is less

00:00:30.426 --> 00:00:34.133
than or equal to x. I come down to negative 2, and I know this needs to be a

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:38.329
square bracket because of the less than or equal to. And I know that values of x

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.550
are going to lie to the right of negative 2 and including negative 2, so I put a

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.831
square bracket facing to the right. Now, we have this or x is less than 6. So I

00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:50.911
come over to 6, and I put a round bracket facing to the left, since x is less

00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:55.220
than 6. Now, or means that all acceptable values of x will either fulfill this

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.778
criteria, or this criteria. So that means that, they'll either be in this range,

00:00:59.778 --> 00:01:04.096
anything greater than or equal to 2, or they'll either be in this range. And of

00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:08.186
course anything in the middle is fine, too. So this is the entire number line

00:01:08.186 --> 00:01:12.324
shaded in. That's choice A. Probably not what we would've expected when we just

00:01:12.324 --> 00:01:16.262
looked at this. You can see what a huge difference there is when we switched

00:01:16.262 --> 00:01:19.834
from and to or. Nagative 2 is less than or equal to x and x is greater than 6.

00:01:19.835 --> 00:01:24.031
Start with a square bracket pointing to the right at negative 2. And this area

00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:28.243
needs to overlap with some area that's graphed by the x is greater than 6 line.

00:01:28.243 --> 00:01:32.093
We know that if we graph this first inequality, it's going to be everything

00:01:32.093 --> 00:01:36.233
greater than or equal to negative 2. And the second inequality is going to share

00:01:36.233 --> 00:01:40.384
everything that's shaded by that line that's greater than 6. So, the only thing

00:01:40.384 --> 00:01:44.960
we actually need to shade is this section, the greater than 6 part. So that's

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.771
choice D. And, finally, our last one. Well, we know the answer must be B,

00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:52.766
because that's the only one that's left, but let's graph it anyway. Negative 2

00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:56.626
is less than or equal to x. So as before, square bracket at negative 2 pointing

00:01:56.626 --> 00:02:00.484
to the right. Or, x is greater than 6, so that give us this. That means that we

00:02:00.484 --> 00:02:03.961
need all of these values that are greater than or equal to 2 to be filled in,

00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:07.640
because we need to include all the values that fit either of these things.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.298
Everything that's greater than 6 is also greater than or equal to negative 2. So

00:02:13.298 --> 00:02:18.116
the number line for this looks exactly like the number line for this inequality

00:02:18.116 --> 00:02:20.195
alone would look. That's choice B.
