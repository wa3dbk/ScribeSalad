Eric Gonzales I work on
Android apps at Udacity.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.840
I start working on the Udacity app for

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.240
a deadline we had of shipping
the app the day of Google IO.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.360
And so I joined the company about five
weeks or so before we had to ship and

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.580
so moved Mountain View and work late and
shipped with a small team.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.850
The way I familiarize
myself the code base, was

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.265
really more getting acquainted with the
Udacity APIs more than the entry code.

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:31.830
Most of the entry code is
pretty straightforward

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.070
in terms of Android development, but the
way in which you fetch data from Udacity

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.210
was quite different and so that's where
there was a bit of a learning curve.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.970
The activities in the Udacity
app are pretty straightforward.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.660
They're grouped of course logically by
the activity you normally do on the site

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.420
or in the classroom.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.970
So we have the notion of a catalog for
instance.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.820
We have individual details for courses
and those are their own activities.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.580
Same thing for authentication, you
have activities for authentication or

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.940
viewing your enrollments, pretty much
everything you can map to an activity

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.850
that you do in the Udacity classroom,
maps to an activity in Udacity app.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.090
So we use intense throughout
the app pretty much everywhere.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.780
So whenever you transition between like
let's say, logging into the catalog or

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.910
to your enrollments.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.090
Those are all using explicit intent.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.050
So it's same specifically I know
I want to transition from this

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.930
activity to the next one, and
these are maybe arguments or

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.450
the different primers can be useful
when loading that new state.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.940
So we use very few implicit intensity
in the app just because of the nature

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.600
of it, we don't really have a lot of
dependencies on like I don't have to

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.990
scan a bar code or

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.970
take a picture or things that would
have a dependency outside of myself.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.020
There is one place so
that we use implicit intent and it's for

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.970
sending support emails.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.700
So if you're having
an issue with the app or

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.490
you have an issue with your account or
app,

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.260
of course, what email client you use or
how to send an email,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.450
we use an implicit intent
to generate that response.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.610
So you can send a support ticket.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.010
When I want to make a button
interactive for my layout.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.440
Of course when you
have in your activity,

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.640
I would have to find the view
that maps to that button.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.910
And then once I find it,
I can set a listener.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.220
A click listener on it.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.420
So that I can take a specific
action on it, if I want to.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.160
So that could be firing
maybe a new activity.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.970
Or that could be
performing a network call.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.330
Like enrolling a student in a course.
