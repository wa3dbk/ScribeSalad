00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.212
Here is the method that you were asked to complete. We have an array of objects

00:00:04.212 --> 00:00:08.140
that are measurable. And we now should sum up all of the measures and then take

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.802
the average. So over here, objects is an array of measurables. We need to give

00:00:13.802 --> 00:00:17.842
a type for each of its elements. While that type is measurable. Next we need to

00:00:17.842 --> 00:00:22.448
compute the sum of the measures. What method should we call an obj? We only

00:00:22.448 --> 00:00:26.561
have one choice. Obj is a measurable, and a measurable has only a single method

00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:31.705
called get measure. So let's call it. And here it is, our universal algorithm

00:00:31.705 --> 00:00:36.071
for computing averages. You'll never again have to write it, provided, of

00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:39.233
course, that the classes that you want to put in are willing to implement the

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:41.540
measurable interfaces.
