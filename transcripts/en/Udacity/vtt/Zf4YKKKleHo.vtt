Alright, so we know we need to change fifths and tenths into tenths. So to

00:00:04.157 --> 00:00:08.501
change fifths into tenths I need to multiply by 2 over 2. And then for 3 10ths

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.857
it's already tenths. So I don't need to change it. So let's see what happens

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:17.275
when I change 2 5ths into tenths. I know if I multiply my fractions I'll get 4

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.575
10ths. Here is what that would look like, this would be 4 10ths of a kilometer.

00:00:22.687 --> 00:00:27.775
Remember I doubled the number of pieces that I had, I went from 5 pieces to 10

00:00:27.787 --> 00:00:32.868
and I doubled the number of pieces thatI had. I had 2 5ths originally And now I

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.004
have 2 times 2, which is 4 or 4 10ths. Visually we can see that 2 5ths of 1

00:00:38.016 --> 00:00:43.514
kilometer bar is the same as 4 10ths of 1 kilometer bar. They really represent

00:00:43.526 --> 00:00:49.153
the same length. My 3 10ths of a kilometer doesn't change, I'm just adding it to

00:00:49.165 --> 00:00:49.993
the 4 10ths.
