00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.660
Since we're dividing by x minus 2 over here, and that's the only thing that's

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.668
keeping the cubic polynomial from being by itself. We just need to multiply it

00:00:08.668 --> 00:00:12.888
by both sides of the equation by the quantity x minus 2. On the left-hand side,

00:00:12.888 --> 00:00:17.490
we'll be left with what we're trying to look for. And on the right-hand side,

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.964
we'll have x minus 2 times x squared minus 2x minus 3.
