00:00:06.093 --> 00:00:09.720
Congratulations, you've made it
through the lessons on pitch perfect.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.010
You added to your knowledge of UIkit and

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.910
view controllers by getting
comfortable with stack views.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.089
You even got to see how iOS can play
back audio, including changes to pitch.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.490
This is just the beginning
of your journey,

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.550
in the next set of lessons you learn
more about swift, UIkit, networking,

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.410
concurrency and even persistence.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.396
Before jumping ahead,

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:32.959
it's good to reflect on what
you've learned in these lessons.
