00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.733
We'll start with a brief discussion on Sigmund Freud, whose ideas are at the

00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:09.092
center of psychoanalytic theory. Now psychoanalytic therapy is the original

00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:14.520
form of talk therapy. It's oriented towards major personality change with a

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.745
focus on uncovering unconscious sexual and aggressive motives, especially

00:00:18.745 --> 00:00:24.267
through dream interpretation. He believed that each dream was an attempt to

00:00:24.267 --> 00:00:28.427
fulfill unacceptable desires or satisfy unconscious impulses, thoughts,

00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:33.895
feelings, and drives. Freud believed that dreams were the royal road to the

00:00:33.895 --> 00:00:39.105
unconscious. A key technique developed by Freud for interpreting dreams and

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:44.132
getting at the unconscious motives was free association. This is when a patient

00:00:44.132 --> 00:00:48.794
says absolutely every association he or she has about an image in a dream, no

00:00:48.794 --> 00:00:54.304
editing allowed. Then the therapist helps interpret the dream through the

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:59.140
symbolic meaning the associations have. When effective, dream interpretation

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.860
uncovers unconscious conflicts, and this in turn can alleviate neurotic

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.349
symptoms.
