00:00:00.236 --> 00:00:02.818
Now the tricky part starts at n equals two and

00:00:02.818 --> 00:00:04.894
I will construct this for you, you can take over

00:00:04.894 --> 00:00:07.721
for three and four. For the one of the left

00:00:07.721 --> 00:00:10.361
to have the sum equal to one, we stay at one,

00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:13.274
which is we add up the value above and the two

00:00:13.274 --> 00:00:15.247
on the left because there’s no three outcomes.

00:00:15.247 --> 00:00:18.836
This guy over here is two, it’s the one above

00:00:18.836 --> 00:00:20.372
and the two in the left, there’s nothing over

00:00:20.372 --> 00:00:22.195
here but there is something over here.

00:00:22.195 --> 00:00:24.863
This guy here is three, it’s a sum over the one

00:00:24.863 --> 00:00:27.668
above and the two on the left gives us three.

00:00:27.668 --> 00:00:30.111
We go down to two, which is a one above zero

00:00:30.111 --> 00:00:32.731
and the two on the left, all the way back to one.

00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:34.979
And this already looks very much like the

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:38.979
type distribution we talked about like this.
