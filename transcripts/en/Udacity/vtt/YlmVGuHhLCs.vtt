If you are able to figure this out on your own, great. You really don't need to

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.707
understand any more about how this works to start developing code and doing more

00:00:06.707 --> 00:00:09.933
interesting things when queries come in. But I do want to explain a bit more

00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:14.583
about what's going on here. So, the important thing the web application does is

00:00:14.583 --> 00:00:19.670
map requests. So, here's the URL that came from the browser, that means the

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.935
browser is sending a request to the service running on port 8080 on localhost,

00:00:24.935 --> 00:00:28.909
containing this is the request. So, that message will come from the browser. And

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:32.301
this could be a browser running on your own machine if it's a localhost, but it

00:00:32.301 --> 00:00:36.196
could be a browser running anywhere in the world. And the request that comes in

00:00:36.196 --> 00:00:40.316
will be to get the slash followed by Hummus. That request will come into the

00:00:40.316 --> 00:00:44.658
machine and look for the process that's running on port 8080. We don't have a

00:00:44.658 --> 00:00:47.941
physical port that corresponds to this, but the operating system keeps track of

00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:51.302
what process is running where. And that's the process that started when we

00:00:51.302 --> 00:00:55.294
started running that web application. And what happened when that code started

00:00:55.294 --> 00:00:59.381
running the web application, is it started listening in on that port so requests

00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:03.614
would be directed to this web application. And what the application server will

00:01:03.614 --> 00:01:07.454
do is call the GET method of LuckySearch passing in as the query the value

00:01:07.454 --> 00:01:11.650
Hummus that came as the query in the GET request. And the key line is this one.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.928
This creates an instance of the application class in the web module and the

00:01:15.928 --> 00:01:20.206
first input here, provides a way of mapping requests to the class with a GET

00:01:20.206 --> 00:01:24.626
method that will handle that and we'll talk more about that in a second. When

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:29.603
the GET method gets called, it returns the string that goes back through the

00:01:29.603 --> 00:01:34.659
application class which adds some extra headers around it to make it work as a

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.478
response and that gets sent back to the browser which renders it, as we see

00:01:39.478 --> 00:01:43.773
here. So, what is going on with this mysterious input that tells the

00:01:43.773 --> 00:01:48.213
web.application how to map request to class. That's what we'll talk about next.
