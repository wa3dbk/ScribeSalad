This answer choice is correct. There are 2 groups of people, and so that way

00:00:04.438 --> 00:00:09.239
researchers can compare how well the active pill helped people sleep compared to

00:00:09.251 --> 00:00:13.945
the inactive pill. In this particular experiment, we can't really test for side

00:00:13.957 --> 00:00:18.228
effects of the active pill, and also in this experiment, researchers aren't

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.431
really concerned if the inactive pill can help people sleep. To figure this out

00:00:22.443 --> 00:00:26.493
they would have to compare the effects of the inactive pill to something else.

00:00:26.588 --> 00:00:30.630
But the purpose is to find out how well the active pill will help people sleep.
