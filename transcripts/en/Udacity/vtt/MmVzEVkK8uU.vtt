00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.770
For children experience is based on a single feature. For example height, not

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.828
necessarily height, weight, length, altogether. Children can't conserve,

00:00:09.828 --> 00:00:13.604
meaning they don't release even if the shape changes, the volume the size and

00:00:13.604 --> 00:00:19.430
the amount can stay the same. The classic example here is liquid. If one takes

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.021
two identical glasses and pour the exact same amount of liquid in each, then

00:00:23.021 --> 00:00:27.000
ask them which one has more liquid. They're going to tell you they have the

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.858
same amount. But, if you take a short, fat glass like this and have them pour

00:00:30.858 --> 00:00:34.638
it onto a tall, thin glass like this, and then ask them which one has more,

00:00:34.638 --> 00:00:41.640
they're going to tell you that the tall, thin glass has more of the liquid.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.534
Because the liquid comes up higher. This is a perfect example of them only

00:00:45.534 --> 00:00:50.042
focusing on one feature, height. Older children and adults know that what we

00:00:50.042 --> 00:00:53.760
gain in height, we lose in width. So, it's the exact same amount of liquid,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.029
they're conserved. But younger children usually under the age of six, can't do

00:00:58.029 --> 00:01:01.330
this mental calculation. They can be fooled by appearance.
