Now let's see if we can maybe break Python. I don't think I can, but I'll give it a shot.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.390
And I'm going to try and break Python by taking out this assignment,

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.900
so now only the y assignment is made inside the function add_nums.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.810
And I'm going to ask you a little quiz here.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:18.080
In my quick run, am I going to get 8, 5, or name error.
