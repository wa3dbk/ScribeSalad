00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.990
So here's Chris, with more friends than approximately 99% of people, 2.5

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:12.463
standard deviations above the mean. Well if the standard deviation is 36, then

00:00:12.463 --> 00:00:19.051
what's 2.5 standard deviations? 2.5 Standard deviations, is just 36 times 2.5.

00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:26.384
Which is 90, so Chris has 90 more friends than the mean, and the mean is 190. So

00:00:26.384 --> 00:00:33.768
190 plus 90 is 280. So Chris has 280 Facebook friends. Another way to look at it

00:00:33.768 --> 00:00:40.516
is to use the equation. You know that the z score, which for Chris is 2.5, is

00:00:40.516 --> 00:00:47.289
the original value Minus the mean divide by the standard deviation. So if we

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:52.721
plug in the values that we know, 2 point 5 which is z is x, his number of

00:00:52.721 --> 00:00:59.150
Facebook friends, minus the mean divided by the standard deviation. And if you

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:05.678
solve algebraically by cross multiplying and then adding 190, you get the number

00:01:05.678 --> 00:01:11.978
of friends that Chris has, denoted by x. Which is again, 280. So this time,

00:01:11.978 --> 00:01:18.550
instead of converting a value to its z score, we converted the z score to the

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.225
real world value.
