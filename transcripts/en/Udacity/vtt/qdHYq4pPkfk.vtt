To motivate the algorithms that we're going to talk about in this unit.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's go back to the Marvel data again. So here's three superheroes.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We're going to call them Black Widow, Spider Man, and the Hulk.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Remember that they're connected in the graph, in the original graph by an edge,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
if the comic book character is in a particular comic book.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This is a set of comic book characters and a set of comic books,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and we add links like so depending on which comic book characters are in which comic books.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Now, we're often interested in connections between the individual characters.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Up to now, we said that there's an edge linking, say Black Widow and Spider-Man,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
in and only if there exists a comic book such that Black Widow and Spider Man

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
both appear in that comic book in the original data set.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
There's really two different graphs that we're working with here.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
There's the graph between comic book characters and then there's the bipartite graph

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
between comic book characters and comic books.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Now this edge appeared, as long as there's at least one book they had in common,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
even if that book had a zillion comic book characters in it

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and it was the only book that they were in together as opposed to, let's say,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
it's like Batman and Robin which is probably not Marvel.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
But anyway, two comic book characters that appear together very often,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
they would also just get a link between them and that doesn't seem quite right.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
What we'd like to do is put a weight on this edge

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
where the weight equals the number of books they co-appear in.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
All right, so what you need to do is compute connection strength.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Write a Python program to read the Marvel graph and put a strength value on each link.
