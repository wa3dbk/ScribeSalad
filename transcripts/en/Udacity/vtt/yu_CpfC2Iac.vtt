00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
Welcome to problem set three, let's dive right in.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.300
In the unit, we talked about a problem called k-coloring,

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.210
and just in case you don't remember it, let's go over real quick.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.420
Let's say we had a graph and let's say we want to give all the vertices different colors.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.110
Well, not different colors,

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.330
but we want to give them colors so that neighboring vertices never have the same color

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.470
like keyword on a map for instance.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.820
Let's go ahead and start, I would green color this one.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.430
That means if we want to move to another color, we can color the adjacent ones a different color

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.440
but we can't color any of these green because this is connected to all the vertices.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.900
So, let's start off this one and color that red but that means we can't color that red.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.390
We can color one of these red, so let's go ahead and do that too.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.980
Let's color this one red. That means this one can no longer be colored red either.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.820
Neither of this can be colored red or green, so let's color them purple.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.480
And now, we completely colored this graph with three colors,

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:12.530
and at least for k&gt;2, whether a graph can be colored and k many colors,

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.890
is an NP complete problem.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.640
Now, in order to show the k-coloring is complete,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.250
really what we can do is simply reduce clique to k-coloring,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.260
and there are two basic facts that help us to do this.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.020
The first question we need to answer is that if a graph contains a clique of size k,

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.910
then how many colors are needed to color the graph at minimum?

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.170
And the second question is, conversely if a graph can be colored with at most k colors,

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.020
how big can the largest clique in the graph be?

00:01:47.020 --> 99:59:59.000
