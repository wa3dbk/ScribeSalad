00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:06.010
We would get 5x plus 6 equals 6x squared. Great algebra work for getting that

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.972
one correct. The LCD, or the lowest common denominator, is x squared here. We

00:00:10.972 --> 00:00:15.836
only need to look at these two denominators, and since x is already a factor of

00:00:15.836 --> 00:00:20.965
x squared, we use this as the LCD. Multiplying each term by the LCD, we would

00:00:20.965 --> 00:00:26.410
get 5x for the first term, 6 for the second term and 6x squared for this term.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.229
We get 5x here since we will have one more x in the numerator than we would in

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:37.495
the denominator. This one power of x cancels leaving us with 5 times x, or 5x.

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:41.940
Here, the x squared's reduced to 1, so we're left with positive 6. And here, we

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.854
just multiply these two expressions together to get 6x squared.
