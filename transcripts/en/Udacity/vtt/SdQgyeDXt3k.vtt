00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:01.400
Thanks, Amir.

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.240
Let's drill down into different types
of ideas that you could dream up.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.320
The first type of idea
is a simplify idea.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.140
With these types of ideas,
you're trying to make a process or

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.430
a task much easier for your user.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.370
Instagram did this by simplifying
the process for combining images.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.350
They have an app called Layout which
allows you to combine photos from your

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.540
camera phone into customized layouts.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.510
Another type of an idea
is a Me Too idea.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.765
It's where you take a current idea and
you bring it to a new market.

00:00:29.765 --> 00:00:31.895
Flipkart is a Me Too idea.

00:00:31.895 --> 00:00:35.305
Similar to Amazon, the company
leverage market insights in India

00:00:35.305 --> 00:00:37.965
to pioneer concepts such
as cash on delivery.

00:00:37.965 --> 00:00:41.575
Flipkart also partnered with other
companies to provide exclusive sales on

00:00:41.575 --> 00:00:45.315
its website, since it had such
a deep understanding of India, and

00:00:45.315 --> 00:00:47.115
its user's needs.

00:00:47.115 --> 00:00:49.610
Virtualize is another type of idea.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.830
It involves moving an activity
to the online space.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.420
Need to do your taxes?

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.050
Turbo tax allows you to send off
your tax forms electronically.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.630
You can even do them from
your mobile phone or tablet.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.820
Need to hail a cab?

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.310
Lyft makes this process
also really seamless,

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.760
you can do it right
from your mobile phone.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.020
For this type of idea, it's important
to think about how you can leverage

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.890
existing technologies or
build upon new technologies.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.330
For example, Lyft used the fact
that everyone had cell phones and

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.790
GPS locations to provide cab
service to people on demand.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.030
You might also try to remix or
combine two or more ideas.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.530
Slack, an online messaging tool is
one great example of a remix idea.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.330
Slack is a team communication tool
that streamlines e-mail, chat, and

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.290
private group messaging while
making all content searchable.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.890
I can chat up my fellow course
developers or I can put in an order for

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:42.550
some late night food.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.880
Finally, there are types of ideas that
seem impossible or almost impossible.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.870
These types of ideas are just
like Google's project Loon.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.230
Project Loon attempts to bring
internet to the rural and

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.089
remote areas of the world
using helium balloons.
