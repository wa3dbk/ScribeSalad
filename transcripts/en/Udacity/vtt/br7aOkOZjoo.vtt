00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.630
And the answer is 0.78. And the way I got this, you might have picked point C1.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:14.620
That happens with 0.3 probability, and then we have a 0.5 chance to find heads.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.322
Or we might have picked coin two, which has a probability of 1 minus 0.3, 0.7,

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:25.804
and then chance of seeing head is 0.9. We work this all out, we get 0.78.
