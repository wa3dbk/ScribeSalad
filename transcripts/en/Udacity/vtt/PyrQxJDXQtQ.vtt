00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.550
We're going to switch gears for
just a minute and

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.620
focus on what a Swift file
looks like in context.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.730
Here's a very simple Xcode project
from the UI Kit Fundamentals course.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.280
Ignore the code for now.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.870
I just want you to notice the files
over here in the project navigator.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.137
You can see here that there's
a .swift file for the AppDelegate,

00:00:18.137 --> 00:00:20.763
there's a .swift file for
the ViewController, and

00:00:20.763 --> 00:00:24.620
here in the center you see
the ViewController.swift file opened.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.840
Now, if you're accustomed to
writing code in Java or C,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.800
you might be wondering
where is the header file?

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.720
The implementation files and interface
files are not separated in Swift.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.439
There's just one .swift file
in which a class is defined.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.120
You might be wondering, if there's
not a separate interface file,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.320
then how do you know which objects
are public and which are private?

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.060
In Swift the default access
control is internal.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.400
Which is similar to protected in Java.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.460
In general, with simple apps, you can
use an object with internal access from

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.520
anywhere in the app, but
not outside the app.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.230
Practically speaking, this means that
sometimes we'll need to specify a class

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.700
as private, but rarely will we
need to specify a class as public.
