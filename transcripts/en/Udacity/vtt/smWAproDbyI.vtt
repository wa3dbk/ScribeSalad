00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.149
So, we still have x squared and x cubed functions graphed over here on this

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:10.044
coordinate plane. And here, I have y equals x to the 4th graphed as well. I'd

00:00:10.044 --> 00:00:14.260
like you to take a second and compare the overall behavior of x to the 4th to x

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.394
squared. I know that all three of these graphs actually go through the origin.

00:00:18.395 --> 00:00:21.852
Which makes sense, because zero taken to any power is just equal to zero. So we

00:00:21.852 --> 00:00:25.916
plug in zero for x, and any of them, the y value is going to be zero as well.

00:00:25.916 --> 00:00:29.578
However, both of the graphs that have even powers have that property that I

00:00:29.578 --> 00:00:33.702
talked about in the previous answer video. Either end of the graph is going to

00:00:33.702 --> 00:00:38.950
point in the same direction. Either going to have a sort of U-shape overall or

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.520
sort of upside down U-shape. The U for x to the 4th just happens to be a bit

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.400
steeper than it does for x squared. So, let's see if this pattern continues as

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.185
we move even higher in degree with our polynomial functions. Yet again, I've

00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:55.335
added more graphs. One of these is the graph of y equals x to the 5th, and one

00:00:55.335 --> 00:00:59.323
of them is the graph of y equals x to the 6th. So, thinking about the patterns

00:00:59.323 --> 00:01:03.544
that you noticed over here with our first three graphs that you're considering,

00:01:03.544 --> 00:01:07.513
what do you think the overall behavior of this 5th degree function will look

00:01:07.513 --> 00:01:09.573
like versus the 6th degree function?
