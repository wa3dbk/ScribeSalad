00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And my answer is quite simple--again, it runs my experiment a 1000 times using the for x in range

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
it summons a new list and this on the list is the mean of the list produced by flip.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Flip itself every single time I run it will give me a 1000 0s or 1s or truths or false

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and using the function mean, I compute the mean of that.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
But now I have an outer loop where I do this calculation of the mean a 1000 times.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It summed them into a new list and that's my new list and that list is continuous valued.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
These are printed out by saying print outcomes after generating it.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
What I see is a list of 1000 numbers--it all have around some by 0.5,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
some of it is 0.046, some is 0.515.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
These are the empirical means for these sequences of a 1000 coin flips.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
See how it flip effectively 1,000,000 coins here, and this is the corresponding histogram

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
plotting the frequency of the coins.

00:01:01.000 --> 99:59:59.000
