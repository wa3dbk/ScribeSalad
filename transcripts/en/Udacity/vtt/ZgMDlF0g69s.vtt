00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
So our three problems are so closely related that either all of them lie here in NP but not in P

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.900
or all of them lie in P.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.850
We don't know which one it is but it can't be the case that,

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.980
for example, we have just vertex cover in P and the other two problems here in NP.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.800
And how did we show that in the last unit?

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.860
For clique and independent set, we showed that there was a polynomial time algorithm

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.010
that could take a graph that was an input to independent set

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.229
and transform that into a graph that we can use as an input for clique,

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.440
and once we have solved the clique problem on the transformed graph,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.240
that same solution is also the best possible solution to independent set.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.480
So we have a polynomial time algorithm, so the algorithm transforms the input of one problem,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.060
say X, into an input of another problem, Y.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:55.330
So, for example, we take independent set and transform that graph into an input for clique

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.380
and now you'll see one of the advantages of working with decision problems

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.880
because the third condition is rather easy to state because we can now simply say that

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.770
solving the problem Y on the transformed input yields the same answer

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.950
as solving the original problem on the original input.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.590
So these three statements here are the same thing that you have seen in the last unit.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.720
So, we took an input which was a graph to independent set

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.410
then transformed it into an input for clique and we found out that if we solve clique on that new input,

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.980
then we would get the same answer that we would've gotten

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.670
if we had solved independent set directly on the original input.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.580
And of course we also saw that the transformation works in the other way,

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.540
so we could transform an input to clique into an input of independent set

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.430
and now for a vertex cover and independent set, it was even easier

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.920
because we didn't even have to transform the input, so basically the transformation was,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.260
we could keep the input as it is, the only thing is if we're working with the decision problem,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.930
of course, the answer will be a little bit different, so if we have a vertex cover of size k

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.880
for a graph with N vertices, then for independent set,

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.260
we must ask if we have an independent set of size n-k.

00:02:06.260 --> 99:59:59.000
But other than that, the transformation here is very easy.
