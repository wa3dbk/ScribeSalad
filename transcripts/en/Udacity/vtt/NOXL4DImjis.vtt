00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Evans] Here's 1 way to define find_element using index.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In the case where the element does exist in p,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
index gives us exactly the result we want.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So we can use an if statement, check that t is in p using t in p,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and then if it is, the block for the if returns that value.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It returns p.index(t).

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
For the else clause the element did not exist in p,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
so we return -1.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Here's another way we might define find_element using index.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Instead of checking if t is in p this time, we'll check if t is not in p.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If t is not in p, then we know the result is -1.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We can return -1 right away.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
If we reach the next statement, then we know that t is in p

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and we can return the result of p.index, passing in t.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So we've seen 4 different ways to define the find_element method.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
They all have the same behavior, but we've defined it once with a while loop,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
once with a for-loop, and 2 different ways using the index method.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
When we use index, we need to use an if statement as well

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
to make sure that we produce the right result for the case where the element is not in p.
