00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.830
Let's look at an absolute value problem with an unknown in it. In fact, an

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.136
unknown and an inequality. How do you translate this inequality that's written

00:00:10.136 --> 00:00:15.374
mathematically right now, into English? The distance between what and what is

00:00:15.374 --> 00:00:17.999
either less or greater than something.
