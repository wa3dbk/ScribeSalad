00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
So, what was interesting was number 1, shared economics.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.330
Well, that was right. You both have an economic reason to want a partner.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.330
But you know what?

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.140
Number 2 is right as well, economies of scale.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.470
You partnering with a much larger company

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.160
means you could take advantage of their supply chain

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.890
or their volume discounts or the massive sales force they have.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.070
But you know, number 3 is right as well.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.840
Large companies, just by definition because they're larger,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.550
have more of everything than you do.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.170
Wouldn't it be great if you could get your hands on some of it somehow?

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.510
And number 4. Access to customers.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.260
Well, we have 3 million customers, and today you have 3.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.580
That's a good idea too.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.560
Finally, access to their marketing or their brand.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.430
Wouldn't it be great to have the General Electric label

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.630
or the Intel label or be a Facebook partner next to yours?

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.630
And so the answer is: they all apply.
