00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.458
So let's look at an example of how we use try. So here we've created a try block

00:00:04.458 --> 00:00:08.746
and everything inside this block will execute and it'll execute normally until

00:00:08.746 --> 00:00:12.349
there's an exception raised. If there's an exception raised, it will jump to

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.610
look for an exception handler. And in this case we have an exception handler for

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.509
the IO error exception. So if that's raised, it'll be handled here. And then

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:25.255
after the tri block finishes we'll continue with the print. Note there's a few

00:00:25.255 --> 00:00:28.174
things in this code you might now have seen yet. You should be starting to get

00:00:28.174 --> 00:00:33.121
comfortable with that. If you are confused by things like, for example this line

00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:36.570
here. You can probably figure out on your what it does. Either looking through

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.181
the documentation or trying it in the interpreter. So, let's try running this

00:00:40.181 --> 00:00:44.469
code, and I'm trying it in a directory that does not have Any trippy file and we

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.891
can see what happens when this line executed, the exception was thrown it was an

00:00:48.891 --> 00:00:53.112
I O error exception that got bound to the variable E and then when we print out

00:00:53.112 --> 00:00:57.467
there, we can see error reading file, the message that came with the exception

00:00:57.467 --> 00:01:01.889
and then after that it doesn't return here, execution continues following the

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:06.803
try block. The print statement. One of the things exceptions do, is make it much

00:01:06.803 --> 00:01:11.020
harder to follow the flow of execution of a program. Code can jump all around.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.253
It's different from procedures, which do make code jump around. But when we call

00:01:15.253 --> 00:01:18.517
a procedure normally and it returns normally, we know it's always going to come

00:01:18.517 --> 00:01:22.625
back to the same point. With exceptions, anywhere in here can jump to another

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:28.590
place. So now, I've created a file called trippy, but I've made it unreadable.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.558
Don't worry if you don't understand these commands, these are just ways to

00:01:32.558 --> 00:01:37.391
create and file make it unreadable. And now, I am going to try again and we see,

00:01:37.391 --> 00:01:42.620
we still got the IO error exception but the message is different, Now we got a

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.107
permission failure. Because we don't have permission to read the file that

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:52.587
exists there. Let's make the file readable and try again. Now, we get something

00:01:52.587 --> 00:01:57.193
different. So now the open succeeded. We got to the next line. The next line

00:01:57.193 --> 00:02:02.727
does a read line. That succeeded. We read in the line, what a trip. And then we

00:02:02.727 --> 00:02:07.253
got to the next line which tries to convert that line, to a number, using the

00:02:07.253 --> 00:02:11.581
int constructer. That's through a Value Error exception. And so when an

00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:15.694
exception is raised inside a triblock, it jumps to the exception handlers. The

00:02:15.694 --> 00:02:20.025
IOError exception handler doesn't match the Value Error. So it doesn't handle

00:02:20.025 --> 00:02:24.306
it. There's no exception handler that does handle value error. So, that

00:02:24.306 --> 00:02:29.230
exception gets raised to the next level. In this case, causing the program to

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.560
crash, and that's why instead of ever getting to continuing, we got this error

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.293
when we ran the program.
