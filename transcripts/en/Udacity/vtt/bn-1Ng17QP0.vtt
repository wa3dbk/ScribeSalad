00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's how we can solve this.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We have our cipher text c.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We have our public key component e.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The key point here is that when m is small, if m^e is less than n,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
then we never wrapped around the modulus.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
That means decryption is as easy as finding these eth of the cipher text.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What we're looking for is the eth root of c.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We can compute that in Python using the pow function.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So 1 divided by 17 will give us the 17th root of c.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We get the message was 7.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This means decrypting is very easy if m^e is less than n.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This is also true if m^e is less than some multiple of n.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We can try just adding n to the cipher text and taking the eth root.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
If we ever get an integer result, that's a good indication that that was the message.
