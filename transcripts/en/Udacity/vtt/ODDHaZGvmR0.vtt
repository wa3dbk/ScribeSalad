Alright, enough about bears. Now, I'm going to get back to the

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.630
question that we started this unit with and ended the previous

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.820
unit with, which is where those mysterious magic methods came from

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.660
when we didn't define them. Recall that we defined our restaurant

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.610
class like this and for now, we don't need any other

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.130
definitions. Because we saw before we even had any methods that

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.680
we got some behaviors, we got initialization and we got printing

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.178
using the magical --str-- method. So, the question is, what's going on?

00:00:25.178 --> 00:00:27.184
So, the choices are something magical and,

00:00:27.184 --> 00:00:29.850
and mysterious, and I'll tell you not to

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.175
select this one. Restaurant is inheriting this

00:00:33.175 --> 00:00:35.460
--str-- method from object and it's being called,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.700
when we do the print, with a

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.970
restaurant instance and restaurant inherits the --str-- method

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.290
from object, and it's being called with

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.690
an object instance. Check all the true answers.
