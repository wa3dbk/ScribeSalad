So we know that web application
code gets the information that it

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.870
needs to create websites by performing
CRUD operations on the database.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.390
But how do we get an application and a
database to communicate with each other?

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.690
You already know that SQL
is the popular language for

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.420
communicating with databases.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.570
&gt;From our application code,
we can create SQL commands and

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.140
decipher the results to integrate
back into our application.
