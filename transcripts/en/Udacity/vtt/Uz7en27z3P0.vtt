00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.550
This first graph represents f minus g of x, and this last graph represents g

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.212
minus f of x. For f minus g here, we see something very similar to what

00:00:09.212 --> 00:00:13.732
happened when we added f and g together. Since we're just subtracting a

00:00:13.732 --> 00:00:17.380
constant function from this linear one, we end up with the same exact graph as

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.790
f. We can see that this line is parallel to this one, except this one is

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:27.491
shifted down three units. G minus f is a bit more complicated. In this case,

00:00:27.491 --> 00:00:31.390
we're subtracting our linear function from our constant one. This means that

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.800
the resulting graph isn't just going to be a shift of f. Instead, for each

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.535
value of x. [INAUDIBLE]. We measure from the x axis to the line of f. Then, we

00:00:41.535 --> 00:00:45.462
look at the graph of g. And we move it down by the positive distances between

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:50.855
the x axis and f, shown by these lines right here. And up by those distances

00:00:50.855 --> 00:00:56.215
between the x axis and the part of f that lay below it. We're adding this

00:00:56.215 --> 00:00:59.438
positive distance because we were subtracting a negative one before. If we

00:00:59.438 --> 00:01:02.000
connect the tops of all these lines together, we can see that we will end up

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.820
with a graph that looks just like this one, to the far right. What's

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.436
interesting, is that now our slope is negative. It's not positive or zero, like

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:13.274
either of our two original functions.
