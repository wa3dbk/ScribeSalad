The answer is a blue rectangle appears. Let's try it out. Here's the blue

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:14.840
rectangle it prints. This is because we made a rectangle. And then, we made a

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.631
variable box. And in that variable, we put a reference to the rectangle we

00:00:20.631 --> 00:00:26.518
made. Then, we made another variable, box2. And we copied the value from box in

00:00:26.518 --> 00:00:32.134
the box2. So, we copied the reference. So now, box2 also refers to the same

00:00:32.134 --> 00:00:38.913
rectangle. Now, we've set the color of the thing in the box to red. And then,

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:44.545
set the color of the thing in the box2 to blue. And then, we draw or fill the

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:48.153
thing in box, which has the color blue.
