00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.990
The way to avoid stupid choices in the algorithm and actually we can make Alice

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.700
a little bit more happy because we're soon going to show her that we're not going to make her

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.770
totally happy but at least neutral because we're now going to show her

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.400
a better technique than brute force.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.200
And that better technique is known as a search tree and you would soon see why it's called a tree.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.860
If you were solving vertex cover by yourself, you would probably take the following approach.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.270
You would not see for all vertices together if they are in the vertex cover or not

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.439
but rather you would look at a single vertex, say this one here, and then split it into two possibilities.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.790
One, you're going to say, "Yes, let's make this vertex part of the vertex cover."

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.010
And the other one, you would say, "No, I do not want this vertex to be part of the vertex cover."

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.660
And then, you're going to split down further so on this side here and on this side here.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.870
Let's look at this vertex here next.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.260
We're just going to draw it a little bit smaller so that we don't run out of space.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.060
We already know that this vertex here is in the vertex cover

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.630
and we're now deciding for this vertex here on the left.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.110
So we'll have one case where we do put it into the vertex cover and another one where

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.130
we don't put it into the vertex cover.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.780
And then for each of these cases again we can split into two possibilities.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.380
And this time we're going to look at the vertex down here. Same here.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.050
One case where we put it into the vertex cover and another case where we don't.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.180
Now here for this case already, we can stop. We have found a solution of size 3.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.450
All edges are covered. We do not even need to consider the possibilities for this vertex here.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.680
Over here, we still have to consider two possibilities so we still need to make a decision

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.770
here on the right side so we can either put it into the vertex cover or not put it into the vertex cover.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.570
And so this solution here or it's not solution because it's not valid.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.610
And here again we have found a solution of size 3 or a vertex cover of size 3.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.180
So I'm just going to leave this check mark here and have this account for both.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.320
So now we still have to continue here for these four points where we left off earlier

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.020
and again we're going to do the same thing so we're going to consider one possibility where

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.470
this vertex down here is not in the vertex cover and again we see.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.650
Oops! This is invalid so we do not need to continue any further.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.199
The next time we're going to put this vertex into the vertex cover.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.990
And yes, we have a valid solution of size 2.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.590
Continuing over here. We're going to consider this vertex here again.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.210
So one possibility would be to not put it into the vertex cover but that is already invalid.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.220
And another one would be to put it into the vertex cover, which again leads us to further

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.970
possibilities to check and we're going to check them for this one down here.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.050
So same game. Invalid solution over here. Still valid over here.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.450
And we need to consider two more cases.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.460
And you already know that this case here is going to be invalid.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.760
And over here we're finding a solution of size 3. So that's all that.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.960
Originally, we had with brute force 16 assignments of 0 and 1 to the vertices that we needed to check

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.990
and now this algorithm here only considered 9 assignments.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.640
So I told you at the beginning of this course that constant factor speedups

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.580
probably don't matter that much when we're dealing with exponential time algorithms.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.990
So we will have to do some further analysis on this one.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.950
And you also noticed that there could be certain other techniques that we can use for speedups.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.490
So for example here, we had already found a solution of size 2.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.760
So we probably could've even stopped our algorithm a little bit earlier

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.550
over here but we're going to get into this.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.460
The main thing that I would like you to understand is the technique of the search tree

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.800
and we're now going to analyze this search tree further and try to improve it.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.980
And of course, I should also tell you why it is called a search tree.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.370
And to show you this, draw lines along where the algorithm was searching

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.790
and then we're going to rotate this picture by 180 degrees and now here you can see

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.550
a beautiful tree with the solution as the leaves or the fruit or whatever you will.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.180
But this is why it's called a search tree.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.760
It's basically a tree that hangs upside down.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.540
I don't know what the terminology tells you about computer scientists

00:03:58.540 --> 99:59:59.000
but that's not my concern here.
