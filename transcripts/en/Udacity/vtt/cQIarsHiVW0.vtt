00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.990
So here is a virtual memory manager and it

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:06.030
is responsible for an address space that it is governing

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.220
and this is the guy that is going to worry

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.740
about breaking a linear address space into regions and mapping

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.468
those regions to specific memory objects. For a particular

00:00:15.468 --> 00:00:18.349
process that is living in an address space to access

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.620
a particular memory object. Obviously, this memory object has

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.380
to be brought into DRAM and that is what a

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.750
pager object is going to do. Which is equivalent to the idea of what is called

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.070
external pages in other systems, such as Mark.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.330
A pager object is responsible for making or

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.660
establishing the connection between virtual memory and physical

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.690
memory. And a portion of the virtual memory

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.640
that is a region of the linear address

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.600
space has been mapped to this memory object,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.610
and it is the responsibility of this pager

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.740
object to make sure that this memory object

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.930
has the representation in the physical memory when

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.740
the process wants to access that portion of

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.980
the address space range that corresponds to this

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.510
memory object. So this pager object creates what

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.960
is called a cached object representation for the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.780
memory object in the DRAM. So now, the portion

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.750
of the address piece, that is the region

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.320
of the address piece That this virtual memory

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.400
manager mapped to this memory object one becomes

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.960
available for the process to address in its DRAM

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.780
because of the work done by this pager

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.940
object in mapping this memory object into this DRAM.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.720
Similarly, a different virtual memory manager object. Managing

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.930
a different address space can similarly map another memory

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.680
object and clear a cache representation for

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.310
this address space to map a region of

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.770
its address space to this memory object

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.020
using this pager object. I mentioned that the

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.910
address space manager can make any number

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.100
of such mapping between regions of the linear

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.580
address space and memory objects. For instance, there's

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.960
another region of the linear address space that

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.780
is mapped to this memory object, too, and

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.100
there may be a pager object that governs the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.730
paging of this object into a DRAM representation.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.660
So there's a cached object representation for this memory

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.930
object which is part of the region Of

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.240
the linear address space of a particular process managed

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.360
by this VMM1. So in this example, this

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.090
pager one is a pager for two distinct memory

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.210
objects, memory object one and memory object two, and which

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.610
are cached by VMM1 on behalf of a process. So

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.080
there are two pager objects. One for each one of

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.440
these things. So the important point I want to get

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.080
across is that there's not a single paging mechanism that

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.300
needs to be used for all the memory objects. So

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.750
it gives you an ability to have different regions of

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.710
the linear address space of a given process by associating

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.410
different pager objects with each of the regions

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.750
that correspond to a particular memory object. And

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.400
all of these associations between regions and memory

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.330
objects can be dynamically created. So for instance, this

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.970
address space manager may decide to associate a

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.630
region in this linear address space to this memory

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.210
object. If it does that, then there is

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.130
a new pager object that. Is going to manage their

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.720
association between the region of the virtual address

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.610
space that is mapped to this memory object

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.520
three and the cached object representation is the

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.780
DRAM representation of this memory object created by a

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.800
pager object that is managing the relationship between

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.010
this region. And this particular memory object three. Now

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.560
this is an interesting situation, because you have

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.760
a memory object that is shared by two different

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.870
address spaces. And there are two distinct pager

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.360
objects associated with managing The region of the

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.430
address space in VMM 1 that maps to this memory object, and the region of the

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.810
address space in VMM 2 that maps to the same memory object. Now what about the

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.020
coherence of the cache representation of this object

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.770
that exists over here? And the cached representation

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.210
of this object that exists over here. Who manages

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.814
that? Well it's entirely up to the pager object [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:18.814 --> 00:04:22.580
instantiated. In order to manage the mapping between this

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.360
memory object and the cached object. So if coherence is

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.600
needed. For the cache representation of this memory object

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.030
in the DRAM of this address space and this address

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.220
space, then it is a responsibility of these two

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.045
pager objects to coordinate that. So it's not something that

00:04:38.045 --> 00:04:40.370
string system is responsible for, but it

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.730
provides the basic mechanisms through which these

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.470
entities can manage the regions that they

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.080
are mapping. In terms of the memory objects

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.840
and the DRAM representation of those objects.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.700
So in other words, external pagers establish

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.040
the mapping between virtual memory, which is

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.400
indicated by these memory objects, and physical memory,

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.900
which is represented by the cached objects. So

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.950
in summary, the way memory management works in the

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.460
spring system is, the address space managers. Are

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.600
responsible for managing the linear address space of a

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.910
process, and they do the mapping of the

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.670
linear address space of a process by carving them

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.830
up into regions. And associating the regions with different

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.630
memory objects, and these memory objects maybe swap space

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.390
on the disk. Or it could be files that

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.710
are being mapped into specific regions of the linear

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.720
address space. Entirely up to the application, what they

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.210
want to do with it, but these abstractions are powerful

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.410
for facilitating whatever may be the intent of the

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:47.300
user. And mapping the memory objects to the cache representation,

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.640
which lives in DRAM, is the responsibility of pager

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.260
objects. And you can have any number of external pages

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.940
that manage this mapping. And in particular, through this example I've shown you

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.230
that you can have, for a single

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.170
linear address space, multiple pager objects that

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.980
are managing different regions of that same

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.070
address space. And that's the flexibility and

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.100
power that's available in the structure, of

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.605
the spring system, using the object technology.
