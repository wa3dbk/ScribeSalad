00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.824
let's start with the most interesting method, in the checkAnswer method, I am

00:00:03.824 --> 00:00:07.128
given the response which is a string, I convert it to a number by calling

00:00:07.128 --> 00:00:10.712
DoubleparseDouble and now I check whether that number is close enough to the

00:00:10.712 --> 00:00:13.960
actual answer, we've learned in lesson four how to do that, we take the

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.376
difference of the two numbers that you want to compare, take the absolute

00:00:17.376 --> 00:00:24.962
value. And check whether that's most the given tolerance. Now, there's just one

00:00:24.962 --> 00:00:28.524
catch. What's this answer here? Well, it's whatever was supplied in the set

00:00:28.524 --> 00:00:33.101
answer method. Interestingly, the set answer method here takes a double, so

00:00:33.101 --> 00:00:36.871
it's not a string. And that means it's different from the set answer method

00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:40.892
that was defined in the question class. That method took a string. Now I

00:00:40.892 --> 00:00:44.125
could've converted this number into a string, and then passed it on to the

00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:47.358
setAnswer method of the question class, and let the question store it as a

00:00:47.358 --> 00:00:50.538
string, and then I could've converted it back from a string to a number, I

00:00:50.538 --> 00:00:53.930
suppose, except when I tried that it didn't work, because the question class

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:01.546
has no way of giving me back the answer. It's used inside it's own check answer

00:01:01.546 --> 00:01:05.025
method. But that one is worthless to me, because it doesn't take the tolerance

00:01:05.025 --> 00:01:10.510
into account. So instead, I just store the answer as a double in the numeric

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.401
question.
