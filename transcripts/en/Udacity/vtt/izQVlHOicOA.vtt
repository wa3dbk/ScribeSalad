00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.555
The simplest form of input
is just key presses.

00:00:03.555 --> 00:00:07.270
They offer the user the tightest
control over the game.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.120
And even if you're building a mobile
game where key presses aren't relevant,

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.790
they're still incredibly convenient for
debugging.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.180
There are a couple different things you
might want to know about a key press.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.330
Say you're building a platformer,
and you want to control the left or

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.480
right movement of your
character using the arrow keys.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.620
Each frame, you check if the left or
the right key is pressed, and

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.070
then move the character in
the appropriate direction.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.830
On the other hand, say you want
the character to fire a grappling hook

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.940
when the space bar is pressed.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.200
In this case, you don't actually want to
check the state of the space bar every

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.130
frame, you're only interested in
the moment the key is pressed.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.810
If the user holds down the space bar,
you don't care.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.410
We have two different approaches,

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.795
one where we want to know the state
of the inputs every frame, and

00:00:52.795 --> 00:00:55.815
one where we want to be notified
when certain things happen.

00:00:55.815 --> 00:00:57.715
The former approach
is called pulling and

00:00:57.715 --> 00:01:00.705
the latter approach is
known as event based input.

00:01:00.705 --> 00:01:03.045
We'll start with pulling
as it's a bit simpler but

00:01:03.045 --> 00:01:05.045
we'll get to even based
input later on in the level.
