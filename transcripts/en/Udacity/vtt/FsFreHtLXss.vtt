00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.520
What's kind of cool about mean-shift,
a bunch of things,

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.986
is under some reasonable
assumptions like the,

00:00:04.986 --> 00:00:08.850
the shape of the thing that you put
down which is a kernel kind of thing,

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.090
you can prove that, in most
circumstances, this thing will converge.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.580
So, it'll actually find those modes.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.210
And that's really cool.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.160
So what does this have to do
with tracking, you might ask.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.238
&gt;&gt; What does this have
to do with tracking?

00:00:23.238 --> 00:00:28.240
&gt;&gt; So basically,
mean-shift tracking is, instead of just

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.070
tracking the mean of a distribution,
we're going to try to track,

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.510
essentially, a, something about
a distribution of a region.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.850
I'll, I'll make that clear.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.200
But our methodology is
pretty similar to before.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.090
We have some position that
we start with, right?

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.190
And here, by the way, our initial
model is not just a location.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.500
But it's this region and
the size of that region.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.140
And what we have to do is we search.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.140
We're going to search in
a neighborhood in the next frame for

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.940
that same description.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.690
Okay?
And when we do the search,

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.150
we're going to move around at x y.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.520
We also might do things like
change the scale, all right?

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.500
And what we want to do is, we want to
find the lo, the new location,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.370
maybe scale,
maybe some other ch, change.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.710
Maybe an orientation thing.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.740
That maximizes some similarity function.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.310
All right?
And then we just, iterate.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.500
We connect the dots.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.380
And we repeat the process and we get
this beautiful animation that says,

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.820
okay, the new maximum becomes
the start for the next frame.
