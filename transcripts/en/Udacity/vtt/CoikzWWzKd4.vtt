00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.705
Now, Javascript at first glance really doesn't resemble the same sort of object

00:00:04.717 --> 00:00:08.833
oriented programming languages that you see in C and C++ code.

00:00:08.837 --> 00:00:13.515
Now these are typically the languages that games are written in, NES, Super NES,

00:00:13.617 --> 00:00:18.165
XBox 360, PS3, all had some resemblance of this. Now Javascript provides a way

00:00:18.177 --> 00:00:22.700
that you can define a set of variables as well as functions encapsulated as an

00:00:22.712 --> 00:00:26.642
object called a prototype. But for game dev, we're really missing the

00:00:26.654 --> 00:00:30.253
inheritance factor, that is the ability to define that prototype and have

00:00:30.265 --> 00:00:34.126
another one inherent from it. Luckily, we can duct tape JavaScript just enough

00:00:34.138 --> 00:00:38.588
to make it look like we're getting classes and structure definitions. Now this

00:00:38.604 --> 00:00:42.673
type of setup is actually the backbone of how everything works inside of grids.

00:00:42.673 --> 00:00:46.845
So, before we move on, make sure that you're very, very familiar with this type of programming model.
