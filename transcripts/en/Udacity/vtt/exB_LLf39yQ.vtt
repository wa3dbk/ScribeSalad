00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.708
Okay. For homework two, we asked you to modify

00:00:03.708 --> 00:00:08.513
the interpret function so that JavaScript elements are

00:00:08.513 --> 00:00:13.147
– the output of the JavaScript reinterpreted and run

00:00:13.147 --> 00:00:17.022
through the HTML interpreter. So instead of just

00:00:17.022 --> 00:00:19.848
basic JavaScript output, we can actually output

00:00:19.848 --> 00:00:24.231
further HTML making our JavaScript quite a bit more powerful.

00:00:24.231 --> 00:00:27.983
So how do we change this, so that we can do that?

00:00:27.983 --> 00:00:30.506
Well, first off we can see that we’re not really

00:00:30.506 --> 00:00:34.830
concerned with these two branches of this if statement.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.445
We’re not concerned with word elements or tag

00:00:36.445 --> 00:00:39.457
elements, we care about JavaScript elements. So we

00:00:39.457 --> 00:00:42.514
already know that we don’t really need to

00:00:42.514 --> 00:00:43.980
do anything right in here. We need to do

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.173
something to modify how we interpret JavaScript.

00:00:47.173 --> 00:00:50.075
So we go down here and the two lines I added are

00:00:50.075 --> 00:00:53.739
right here. Now instead of just outputting the results

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.002
of the JavaScript interpreter’s abstract syntax tree

00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:01.915
output. What I’m doing is I’m running the result of

00:01:01.915 --> 00:01:04.468
the JavaScript interpreter back through the HTML

00:01:04.468 --> 00:01:08.197
parser, the parse function. And outputting that

00:01:08.197 --> 00:01:10.852
abstract syntax for you, which this is HTML now and

00:01:10.852 --> 00:01:15.316
then we run that back through this function itself so

00:01:15.316 --> 00:01:17.970
that we can further interpret the syntax tree. Now

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.400
after we’ve done that, we don’t really need this last

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.888
graphics doubt word resolved. We don’t need to

00:01:23.888 --> 00:01:27.428
further interpret result. We’ve already done that. So

00:01:27.428 --> 00:01:30.390
we can just get rid of this and to check whether this

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.618
works, we click run and we see below that we do

00:01:34.618 --> 00:01:41.735
indeed get our page output, but okay. So we’ve got

00:01:41.735 --> 00:01:45.226
this JavaScript output, but you can see that the odd

00:01:45.226 --> 00:01:49.465
numbers are bold and the even numbers are italicized

00:01:49.465 --> 00:01:55.298
which if you check, the web page that we gave you as

00:01:55.298 --> 00:01:57.669
an example, is exactly what we’ve done. We’ve

00:01:57.669 --> 00:02:01.730
wrapped the even and odd numbers or the odd and

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.848
even numbers respectively in bold and italic text,

00:02:05.848 --> 00:02:09.066
which is what you see down here. So this gives us a

00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:11.384
lot more power in our JavaScript interpreter because

00:02:11.384 --> 00:02:14.214
we can use our JavaScript to now output

00:02:14.214 --> 00:02:17.712
further HTML that we can run on the fly.

00:02:17.712 --> 00:02:21.435
And that is going to be very, very important.
