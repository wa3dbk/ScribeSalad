00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.360
So Shoke, I tend to think of the difference between the incremental concept

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.820
learning we've talked about in the past and version spaces in terms of

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.240
a bit of a visualization. We can imagine a spectrum that runs from

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.860
a very specific model of a concept to a very general model of a concept.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.420
And we can imagine that this circle represents where our model currently is.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.120
If receive a new positive example that's not currently assumed bar concept,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.480
we then generalize it a bit to move it to the right.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.170
If we receive a negative example that is currently included in our concept,

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.788
we're going to move it to the left and specialize. As more and

00:00:30.788 --> 00:00:35.556
more examples come in, we start to see that our concept keeps moving around.

00:00:35.556 --> 00:00:39.210
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.470
&gt;&gt; Notice that they would use it a model to refer to a concept. In fact,

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.700
they use in concert with models almost interchangeably. This is actually quite

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.365
common for certain kinds of concepts. We have discussed earlier prototypical

00:02:33.365 --> 00:02:38.730
concepts when we were discussing classification. But prototypical concepts,

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.560
concepts are like models. What is a model, a model is the representation of

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.160
the world. Such that there is a one-to-one correspondence what is

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.230
being represented to the world and the representation itself. As an example,

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.240
in the world of those blocks that made arches, I can actually make an arch in

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.320
the world, and then I can build a representation of that particular arch.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.270
That's a model of the world, so the concept of an arch and

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.070
the model of an arch in this particular case can be used interchangeably.
