00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.070
So far, we've assumed that polynomials
are represented by their coefficients.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:13.270
For example, A is equal to -x +
1x,+ 1x squared, for example.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.409
If you've ever worked with polynomial
interpolation or fitting before,

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:21.810
however, you will know that an order n
polynomial is uniquely characterized by

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.540
its values at any n distinct points.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.970
The order of a polynomial by the way
is the number of coefficients used to

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.010
define it or the degree plus one.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.740
Hence we might just as well
represent a polynomial

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.220
by it's values at a sequence of
inputs as by it's coefficients.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.498
For example, that same polynomial could
be represented by saying that A (-1)

00:00:43.498 --> 00:00:48.360
= -2, A(0) = -2, and A(1) = 0.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.720
Going from the coefficient
representation to the value

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.010
representation can be though
of as matrix multiplication.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.080
To calculate A of some value, I take
the dot product of the corresponding

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.930
row of the matrix consisting of
the powers of the argument X

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.360
with this column consisting of
the coefficients of the polynomial a.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.470
This matrix is important enough
that it gets its own name and

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.070
it's called the Vandermonde matrix.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.000
Its determinant is the product of
the differences of all the values of x.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.110
So as long as these are distinct
the determinant will be non-zero and

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.250
that means the matrix is invertible.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.800
So given the values then, we should
be able to recover the coefficient.
