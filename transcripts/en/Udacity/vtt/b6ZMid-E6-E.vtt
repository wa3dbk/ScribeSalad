00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.530
So 1.1⁵⁰ is about 117 which again is a speedup of over a trillion, so what we now have found

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:15.300
is a second loophole, where the first loophole was sub-exponential time and the second loophole

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.920
is small bases for the exponent.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.070
Not having a 2 here but a 1.1 or maybe a 1.2, so now of course the question is--

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.610
can we actually exposed those loopholes, so can we find algorithms

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.260
that have these running times here.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.380
The answer is--yes, we can, and that is exactly the point of using

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.890
intelligent force versus brute force, and I'm actually going to show you how this loophole here works.

00:00:39.890 --> 99:59:59.000
And the problem for which we're going to show this is vertex cover.
