00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here again is a remove html markup program.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here's the input which normally passes.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If I click on run, what I get is just a single quote.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
That is, the opening tag was probably stripped,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and of course, the assertion didn't fire.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I am now setting up a trace function,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which specifically monitors for the moment.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The loop head here in line 8 is hit for the second time.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
That's when I'm setting the quote variable to true

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
as found in the failing run.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So the question is whether by setting the quote variable

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
to the value found in the in the failing run at this moment,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
we can already turn the previously passing run into failing run.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We figure this out by clicking on run.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
As you can see, simply by setting the quote variable to true,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
we now have triggered the assertion.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
What this means is that simply setting the quote variable to true

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
is sufficient to make the passing run now fail.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We thus have identified quote as a cause for the failure.
