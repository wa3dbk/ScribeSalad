00:00:00.101 --> 00:00:02.168
Well, this time you're going to get similar answers.

00:00:02.168 --> 00:00:06.810
The big difference is that the maximum number of threads per SM is now 1536.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.136
All these other numbers are the same. The maximum number of registers per SM is still 64K.

00:00:11.136 --> 00:00:14.653
The maximum amount of shared memory per SM is still 48K.

00:00:14.653 --> 00:00:18.186
The maximum number of thread blocks per SM is 8.

00:00:18.186 --> 00:00:22.224
So we have the same limiting factor, which is the maximum of threads per SM,

00:00:22.224 --> 00:00:27.697
but now the answer is a little different. Now we can only run a single thread block per SM,

00:00:27.697 --> 00:00:33.267
and that means our total number of threads per SM will be 1024.
