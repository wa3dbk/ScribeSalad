As before we need to make sure we apply whatever operation is acting on x to the

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.798
entire quantity x squared. So I start by putting that in parentheses and then

00:00:09.798 --> 00:00:14.725
raising the x squared to the 2nd power again. Then we subtract x squared and

00:00:14.725 --> 00:00:19.745
then we keep that added 2. This gives us a final answer of x to the 4th minus x

00:00:19.745 --> 00:00:20.850
squared plus 2.
