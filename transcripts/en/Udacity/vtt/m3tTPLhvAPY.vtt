00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.490
To illustrate learning by correcting mistakes,

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.470
let's go back to an earlier example.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.180
We encountered this example when we were discussing explanation-based learning.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.110
So imagine again that you have bought a robot from the Acme hardware store, and

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.108
in the morning, you told your robot, go get me a cup of coffee. Now the robot

00:00:17.108 --> 00:00:20.030
already is bootstrapped with knowledge about the definition of the cup.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.220
A cup is an object that is stable and enables drinking. The robot goes into your

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.940
kitchen and can't find a single clean cup. So it looks around.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.450
This is a creative robot and it finds in the kitchen a number of other objects.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.600
One particular object has this description. The object is light and it's made of

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.280
porcelain. It has decorations and it has concavity and a handle. And the bottom

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.570
of this object is flat. Now the robot decides to use this object as a cup,

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.150
because it can prove to itself that this object is an instance of a cup.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.450
It does so, by constructing an explanation. The explanation is based on the fact

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.710
that the bottom is flat, that it has a handle, that the object is concave, and

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.410
that it is light. Let us do an exercise together that will illustrate the need

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.500
for learning by correcting mistakes. So shown here are six objects. And there're

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.670
two questions here. The first question is, which of these objects do you think

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.140
is a cup? Mark the button on the top left if you think that a particular object

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.290
is a cup. The second question deals with the definition of a cup that we had in

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.190
the previous screen. So mark the button on the right as solid, if you think that

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.570
that particular object meets the definition of the cup in the previous screen.
