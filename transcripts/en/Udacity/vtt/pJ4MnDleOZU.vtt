00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.522
Let's get back to trying to solve our quadratic equation. We know either this

00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:09.755
first number can equal 0 or the second number could equal 0. So, we can set each

00:00:09.755 --> 00:00:15.490
factor equal to 0. We solve each equation and we know x could equal negative 2

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.453
or x could equal negative 3.
