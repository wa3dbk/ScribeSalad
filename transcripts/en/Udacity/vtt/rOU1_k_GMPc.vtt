00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.810
The answer is no. This should definitely not be your next step. Why, you might

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.576
ask? Well, in order to get from this inequality to either one of these, we need

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:14.460
to effectively divide both sides by the factor that we're not using in the final

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.437
inequality we're looking at. Let's say that we wanted to get from this quadratic

00:00:19.437 --> 00:00:24.272
inequality to looking at this linear one, x plus 4 is greater than zero. Well to

00:00:24.272 --> 00:00:28.237
get x plus 4 by itself on the left side you would have to divide both sides of

00:00:28.237 --> 00:00:32.397
the inequality by the quantity x minus 4, however we don't know what x is equal

00:00:32.397 --> 00:00:36.622
to here and because of that we don't know what number we are dividing both sides

00:00:36.622 --> 00:00:41.110
by, that means this variable could be a negative number and if that's the case.

00:00:41.111 --> 00:00:45.102
We don't know which direction the final sign for x plus 4 is greater than 0

00:00:45.102 --> 00:00:49.480
should actually point. So bottom line, this is not the approach we need to take.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.360
We need to do something different.
