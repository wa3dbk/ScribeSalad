00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.735
So, here's how far we've gotten. We have
our first polynomial factor, x+5, treated as

00:00:04.747 --> 00:00:09.459
a block, and it is multiplying each of the
terms inside the second set of

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:13.215
parentheses. The next step is to apply the
distributive property, once again. You

00:00:13.227 --> 00:00:19.172
know that we would rearrange each of these
terms so that the factor x+5 comes after

00:00:19.172 --> 00:00:23.258
the factors that only have one term inside
them. And then once we got here we would

00:00:23.258 --> 00:00:27.638
use the distributive property again, to
simplify for each of these terms. So let's

00:00:27.638 --> 00:00:30.905
take a second and compare what we're doing
in this step of the problem to what we did

00:00:30.917 --> 00:00:35.015
in the very first step. In both cases,
we're using the distributive property. We

00:00:35.027 --> 00:00:38.930
used it the first time, so that we could
set ourselves up to do it again. Notice

00:00:38.942 --> 00:00:43.671
though, which numbers and variables are
written here. We have an x and a -2 and

00:00:43.683 --> 00:00:48.965
then we have an x and a +5. And those are
just the same terms that are in the two

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:54.655
polynomials up here. The things that we're
multiplying together are x and x, x and x,

00:00:54.655 --> 00:01:03.690
x and 5, x and 5, -2 and x, -2 and x, and
5 and -2. What we've done here, using the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.038
distributive property, is just make sure
that every term in the first polynomial is

00:01:10.038 --> 00:01:15.332
multiplied by every term in the second
polynomial. Here we've reach another point

00:01:15.332 --> 00:01:19.027
where we can use a sort of shortcut, so we
don't have to do quite as many steps in

00:01:19.027 --> 00:01:19.996
the problem.
