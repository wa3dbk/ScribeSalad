00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.420
In lesson one we introduced the
disconnect between what is required to

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.430
successfully manage the chronic diseases
that drive most health care costs, and

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.370
the structure of the US
healthcare system.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.120
We also suggested that health
IT could be a key tool, for

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.440
restructuring healthcare to
help address these issues.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.860
We'll review that in this lesson before
turning to the new US federal policies

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.580
to encourage adoption of health
information technology, and

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.340
new models of patient centered care.
