00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.670
So far we've seen how to get
the app shell into the cache.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.790
But how do we get it out so that on
a slow network or even no network,

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.070
we're still able to get the resources
required to run our app.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.150
For that we'll need to intercept
all the network requests

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.250
by handling the fetch event
in the service worker.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.520
And serving the requested
resource from the cache.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.940
Stepping from inside out
caches.match evaluates the request

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.030
that triggered the fetch, and checks
to see if it's available in the cache.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.950
It then either responds
with the cached version, or

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.620
uses fetch to get a copy
from the network.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.009
The response is then passed back
to the webpage with e.respondWith
