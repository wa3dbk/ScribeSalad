00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:01.975
Alright, you're done.

00:00:02.625 --> 00:00:05.452
Let's start by uncommenting out that text.

00:00:05.452 --> 00:00:07.470
As you can see, you need 
that forecast string

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.870
to pass on to our DetailActivity.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.700
So what do we use 
to get that forecast string?

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.720
Well we're lucky here, 
because we actually

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.130
get the adapterView passed in.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.540
All we have to do is cast at
a SimpleCursorAdapter

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.760
and then we can get the cursor.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.360
We can move it to our position,
then we can use string.format,

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.670
to get a formatted string 
based upon the values

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.900
of our columns.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.976
Note once again, the nice use
of our column indices.

00:00:31.992 --> 00:00:35.524
One ending curly brace ( } ),
and let's move that intent stuff

00:00:35.524 --> 00:00:36.996
inside of there.

00:00:37.806 --> 00:00:39.140
And that's it.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.600
Now we'll be able to click on it again

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.130
and it'll actually go 
to our normal DetailView.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.640
Let's try it out.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.800
So here we are, 
there's our list View,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.732
we can go right into details.

00:00:51.052 --> 00:00:52.304
Pretty cool.

00:00:52.884 --> 00:00:55.002
However, if we change 
our temperature units

00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:57.050
to imperial here,

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.193
it doesn't actually update.

00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:01.336
It would be nice if that View 
was based on the same kind

00:01:01.336 --> 00:01:03.480
of cursor model we have here.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.597
Something that was observing 
with the content observer,

00:01:05.597 --> 00:01:07.601
and would actually update,

00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:11.390
when we changed our setting.
