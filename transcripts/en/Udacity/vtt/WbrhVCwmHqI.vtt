00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.375
For this skills check, I want you to determine if each pair of lines is

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:06.977
perpendicular, parallel, or neither. So, if you think these 2 lines are

00:00:06.977 --> 00:00:10.811
perpendicular, you would write a in this box. If you think they're parallel,

00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:14.574
write b. And if you think they're neither, write c. Give these problems some

00:00:14.574 --> 00:00:18.283
thought, and make sure you think about what you're looking for. What does it

00:00:18.283 --> 00:00:22.244
mean to be perpendicular? What does it mean for lines to be parallel? Good luck.
