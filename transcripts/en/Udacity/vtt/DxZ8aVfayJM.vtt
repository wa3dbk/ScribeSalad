00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
Now, let's do a little quiz just to see that you can easily make the distinction

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.750
between the polynomial and exponential running time.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.340
So I'm going to give you a couple of running times and I want you to tell me if this is

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.510
a polynomial running time or an exponential running time.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:31.130
So we have O(2n&lt;i&gt;log(n)), O(2log(n)), O(1.00001n), n¹⁰⁰⁰, and then Alice's algorithm,&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.900
which you'll recall had a running time of O(2n&lt;i&gt;n²).&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.790
So please for each of these functions is that the function for a polynomial running time

00:00:40.790 --> 99:59:59.000
or for an exponential running time.
