00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.120
Let's say that we wanted to compare the batting averages

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.880
of left handed and right handed hitters in major league baseball.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.150
So we're curious in answering the question, is there any difference

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.770
between the batting averages of lefties and righties? We could just

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.950
look at the data and try to answer this question without

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.990
a significance test. But then we really couldn't trust our answer

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.140
very much. It's a much better idea to answer this question

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.070
using a statistical test. Many statistical tests that you might use

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.190
to analyze data make an assumption about the probability distribution

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.570
that your data will follow. There are many different probability distributions

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.860
out there, but one of the most common and the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.030
one that I want to discuss is the normal distribution, which

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.100
is also sometimes referred to as the Gaussian distribution or

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.050
a Bell curve. If you've taken an introduction to statistics course,

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.430
the normal distribution should be familiar. Which of the images below

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.720
depicts a normal distribution? Check the box below the correct one.
