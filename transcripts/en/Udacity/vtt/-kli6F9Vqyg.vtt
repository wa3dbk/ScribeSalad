00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.500
I mentioned in the last video that
gross versus net are two of the most

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.540
easily confused terms for
those new to finance.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.700
So, just to drill this difference
into your brain a bit more,

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.230
I've got another quick quiz for you.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.890
Now, another way to think of profits is
in terms of margins or the percentage of

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.090
funds that your business retains, or
loses, depending on your situation.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.079
So just like before,
take a look at these definitions and

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.897
using the letters, match with
the correct terms in the provided boxes.
