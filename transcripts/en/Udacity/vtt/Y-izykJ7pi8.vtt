00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.550
To help you visualize this a bit better,

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.320
I've created a small app to show
you how you can manipulate images.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.240
Here we have an image inside a card view
with a label composed of a couple of

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.560
text views.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.590
Below the card view
are a series of radio buttons

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.850
with different transformations and scale
types you can apply to the above image.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.130
The default scale type for
an image Is FIT_CENTER.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.770
It scales the images to fit inside
the view will keeping the aspect ratio.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.230
If the axes don't match,
the empty space is distributed

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.766
on both sides of the image, either the
top and bottom or the left and right.

00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:45.130
FIT_START and FIT_END also scale
the image to fit inside the view but

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.960
they align the image so that the unused
space appears before or after the image.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.710
FIT_XY scales the image to use
all the space in the view,

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.690
even if the aspect ratio changes.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.180
In other words, unless your image has an
aspect ratio that closely matches your

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.060
view, using FIT_XY might be a bad idea.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.260
We have three center options, center,
center crop, and center inside.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.320
Center displays the image centered
in the view with no scaling at all.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.990
In this case,
the image is larger than our view so

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.730
we only see a small portion of it.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.340
Center inside attempts to center
the image in the view and

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.090
will scale it down to fit.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.270
If the image is smaller than the view,
it won't scale it up and

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.320
the extra space will be evenly
distributed around the image.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.660
If the image is larger than the view,

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.770
center inside will look similar
to the results of fit center.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.740
Center crop scales the image so
that both the width and

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.415
the height exceed
the dimensions of the view.

00:01:53.415 --> 00:01:57.835
It centers the image and then crops
everything that was left around it but

00:01:57.835 --> 00:01:59.045
not in view.

00:01:59.045 --> 00:02:02.855
It can make an already
great image more impactful.

00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:07.510
If none of those options fit your needs,
you can select matrix and

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.525
a matrix composed of translations,
scaling, and rotation.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.930
For this matrix, I scaled the x and

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.730
the y axes in half and translated
a 100 pixels in each direction.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.530
Last but not least,
there's this radial button here.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.270
There isn't a no scale type.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.010
This is my not so vague way of saying
don't use ill sized images for

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.630
your views or add large paddings.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.000
It makes your images look lower quality.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.310
Whatever you choose, play around
with images of similar quality and

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.200
size to what you'll use in your
production app to see what works best.
