00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.390
In this lesson we will talk about traffic

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.830
classification and shaping. We'll first talk about different ways

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.650
to classify traffic, then we'll talk about different traffic

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.980
shaping approaches. Then we'll talk about a traffic shaper

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.000
called a leaky bucket traffic shaper, then we'll

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.700
talk about an rT traffic shaper. Then we'll talk

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.530
about a token bucket traffic shape. And finally, we'll

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.540
talk about how to combine a token bucket shaper

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.590
with a leaky bucket shaper to build

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.540
what's called a composite shaper. The motivation here

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.790
is to control network resources and ensure that

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.428
no traffic flow exceeds a particular pre-specified rate.
