00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.990
Now that we've seen some of the most common types of charts and

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.880
learned about how the grammar of graphics helps us separate data from our

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.960
visual representation of that data.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.684
I want to show you to how to put this theory into practice using D-3 and

00:00:13.684 --> 00:00:15.710
Associate Technologies.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.580
As covered in Lesson One.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.300
The visualization stack for different technologies can go pretty deep.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.040
At the top of this spectrum, we have graphical tools such as RAW or Excel.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.390
They let us very quickly and easily create predefined charts for

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.380
our data, but lack flexibility.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.290
At the low end of the spectrum are technologies like Canvas, WebGL, and

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.190
SVG itself.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.590
These low level tools at the bottom of the spectrum are the most flexible but

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.740
give you an interface similar to a painter.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.110
You must specify pixels and

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.610
colors to do something even as simple as drawing a line.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.190
And just forget about making dynamic charts and binding data.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.570
Since we will be working somewhere in the middle of this spectrum when working

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.310
with charts, I do not yet want to deal with all the complexities of raw D3.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.740
D3 is often confused for a charting library, when in fact

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.910
they exist at one level lower and also one level below the grammar of graphics.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.840
And think of D3 as the building blocks that someone might use if they want to

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.480
create a charting library with Excel-like plotting functionality.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.220
And that is exactly what many people have done.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.310
We will be using a library called Dimple.js for the slide coding example.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.100
It's implemented on top of D3,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.740
which in turn is implemented on top of SVG, JavaScript, and HTML.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.050
And provides us a very nice abstraction for building charts, and allows us to

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.160
think in the way that we might want to when concerning the grammar of graphics.
