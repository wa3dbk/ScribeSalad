00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer lies in the numbers I just wiped out.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
If A got 7/12 in total, we know that 1/12 is 20,000.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So A got 140,000, which is 7 times 20,000.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Party B got 2/12 or a 6th, which is 40,000.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Party C--a disappointing 20,000.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And party D the same as party B.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
If we look at the diagram, it tell you nothing about the absolute numbers.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
In fact, I can change the absolute numbers.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
As long as the relative percentages stay the same, it does however tell you a lot about

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
the distribution of the data.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It shows you that A is the dominant party that got more than 50% of the outcome

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
whereas B, C, and D occupies smaller slices with a slice for C

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
being half the size of B or D, respectively.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Again, this is called a pie chart.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Pie charts are really, really powerful to represent things like election outcomes.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
In any data set we just care about the relative outcomes

00:01:07.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and perhaps have more than just 2 classes.
