00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260
Welcome to your final exam.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:07.420
First we're going to talk about a new version of the SIR model--one that includes births.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.688
Now, when we include birth, which means births of not immunized

00:00:11.688 --> 00:00:16.689
or susceptible children in immunological model new effects appear.

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.839
Here we're going to try that out in the SEIR model.

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:22.228
You might remember this in the earlier unit.

00:00:22.228 --> 00:00:28.919
This is just the SIR model with an added stage of being exposed to disease but not yet infectious.

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.678
In other words, a person who is in the e category here is infected

00:00:33.678 --> 00:00:35.839
but can't yet spread the disease to other people.

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:38.789
Now, eventually we use the birth rate which means adding people

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:42.770
into the susceptible part in the mortality rate.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.629
All compartments S-E-I-R have the same mortality rate, however.

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.790
So this means that the disease isn't life threatening since people across the world

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.809
regardless of whether or not they are infected die at the same rate.

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.719
This is a model that does have immunity.

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.799
So that means we don't have the cycle as we did in similar other examples.

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:05.028
Instead we just have a straight shot from S to E to I to R.

00:01:05.028 --> 00:01:10.699
Now as we did before, we call our total population N but in this case N is not a constant,

00:01:10.699 --> 00:01:12.779
rather N is a function of time.

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:18.179
It's still equals the sum of S, E, I and R, but the sum is going to change overtime.

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:21.290
Now since N has no other constant, we need to make sure that we compute

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.699
the number of infections per day correctly.

00:01:23.699 --> 00:01:27.829
It isn't just going to be some constant times I times S anywhere.

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:29.829
Let's build up the equation together.

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.689
So we're going to start with the number of times

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.719
any person comes into contact with any other people per day.

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:38.709
So that's just equal to contacts per day.

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:43.480
Then in order to get the number of contacts per day of a person with susceptible people

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:50.629
not just any people, we modify this by multiplying by a factor of S/N.

00:01:50.629 --> 00:01:53.679
So this is just a fraction of the total population that is susceptible

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.429
and of course, this is a function of time as well.

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.160
Then if you want to change the expression to equal the number of infection spread

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.909
by each infectious person per day, they multiply all these by the transmission probability.

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.619
Now, lastly, to get the total number of infections per day,

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.559
we multiply this by I, the number of infectious people.

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:16.699
Now what we want you to do in the code is to implement

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:20.089
the SEIR model using the forward Euler method.

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:23.088
As always, we've given you the important constants that you'll need to use

00:02:23.088 --> 00:02:28.959
including the birth rate and the mortality rate, and of course, a set of initial values as well.

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.639
And down here in the for loop, we've included the standard equations for the SEIR model,

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:38.709
but we haven't taken into account births and deaths yet so that's your job.

00:02:38.709 --> 09:59:59.000
Good luck on the first problem of your final.
