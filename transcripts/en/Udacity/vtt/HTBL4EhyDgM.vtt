00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.940
So, let's see if we understood
the relationship between refreshes and

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.130
reads.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:12.360
Suppose we have a memory array that
has 4,096 rows and 2,048 columns and

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.940
suppose that the refresh period for
this array is 500 micro-second.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.250
Every cell needs to be refreshed within
this time, otherwise it will lose data.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.190
Now suppose that the timing for
reads for this memory is as follows.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.820
It takes us four nanoseconds
to select a row.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.730
Once we activate the row,
ten nanoseconds are needed for

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.392
the sense amplifier to get
the bit values from that row.

00:00:38.392 --> 00:00:43.497
Two nanoseconds are needed to put
that data in the row buffer and

00:00:43.497 --> 00:00:47.870
four nanoseconds are needed for
the column decoder

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.110
to actually figure out which bit
from the row buffer we need.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.030
While this is happening, we are writing
the data back from the sense

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.540
amplifier to the memory row, and
it takes us 11 nanoseconds to do that.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.450
So this part overlaps with these two.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.000
So the question for
you is how many data, or

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.090
nonrefresh reads per second
can this memory support?

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.100
Put your answer here.
