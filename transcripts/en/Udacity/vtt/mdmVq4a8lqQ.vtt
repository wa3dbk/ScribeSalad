As a quick quiz, suppose we wanted to
look up the IP address 130.207.97.11.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.059
What is the corresponding
in-addr.arpa domain name?

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.954
Is it 130.207.97.11?

00:00:15.954 --> 00:00:22.491
Is it 130.207.97.11.in-addr.arpa?

00:00:22.491 --> 00:00:29.200
Is it in-addr.arpa.130.207.97.11,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:36.194
