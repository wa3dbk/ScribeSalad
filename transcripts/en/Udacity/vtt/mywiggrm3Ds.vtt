00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.508
Now that we've found out how many gallons of cleaning solution Grant's going to

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.003
buy, we can look back to our equations that dealt with the amount that cleaning

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:13.676
solution would cost for him, depending on which brand he decided to go with. And

00:00:13.688 --> 00:00:18.322
each do a little bit of variable switch up though. To get back in the paradigm

00:00:18.334 --> 00:00:22.717
that these equations were written in, I'll remind you of what each of the

00:00:22.729 --> 00:00:27.380
variables stood for, x here stood for the number of solution that Grant would

00:00:27.392 --> 00:00:31.959
buy, and y was equal to the total cost of Grant's order, taking into account

00:00:31.971 --> 00:00:37.769
both the solution that he bought in the rush order fee for each company. Setting

00:00:37.781 --> 00:00:43.164
up our coordinate plane with a scale of 10 on the x axis and 100 on the y axis,

00:00:43.283 --> 00:00:48.698
I'm going to graph these 3 lines again. To make this graph easier for you to

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.669
read and understand, I've color coded the lines again just like we did before,

00:00:53.775 --> 00:00:58.479
and then written their corresponding equations in the proper colors. We've

00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:03.295
talked a ton in the past about how we can find values of variables that satisfy

00:01:03.307 --> 00:01:08.230
equations but we can also do this graphically. Think for a second, if I wanted

00:01:08.242 --> 00:01:13.842
to find out how much 75 gallons of solution will cost for each brand that Grant

00:01:13.854 --> 00:01:20.281
might buy from, what extra line should I add to this graph? Please write the

00:01:20.293 --> 00:01:23.488
equation for that new line in this box.
