00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.562
Well, if the product is negative then one of the factors must be negative, that

00:00:04.562 --> 00:00:08.966
would be this case. If the product is positive then that means that both the

00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:13.568
factors can be negative, that's this case, but we want to be careful over here.

00:00:13.568 --> 00:00:18.060
We could have made another number puzzle where the product was positive 45 and

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.492
the sum was positive 14. In this case both of the factors would have been

00:00:22.492 --> 00:00:27.015
positive. This case could also be true. So we have to have one negative factor

00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:31.480
if our product is negative. And we can either have two positive factors or two

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.145
negative factors if our product is positive.
