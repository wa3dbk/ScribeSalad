00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.220
In the previous algorithm you've seen how many elements match a condition but

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.920
we didn't get to see any of the elements that match. Let's start modestly and

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.724
say we want to see the first one. That's a match. So here in our series of

00:00:10.724 --> 00:00:13.530
pictures we just want to find the first one that is a portrait which I guess

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.362
here just happens to be this one. The difficulty with this algorithm is that we

00:00:18.362 --> 00:00:22.020
don't really want to look at all of the elements, we want to stop as soon as we

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.155
have found one. Let's set a Boolean variable. We'll keep looking while we

00:00:28.155 --> 00:00:33.250
haven't found a match. If the ith element matches, then we set found to true,

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.876
and otherwise, we increment i. We still need to be clear about what i is. i

00:00:39.876 --> 00:00:44.696
should start at zero, and of course i shouldn't get too large. It needs to be

00:00:44.696 --> 00:00:48.328
less than the size of the collection. Now when we terminated this loop there

00:00:48.328 --> 00:00:52.394
are two possibilities. Maybe there wasn't any match in there at all. You could

00:00:52.394 --> 00:00:56.824
imagine a picture gallery only with landscapes. But if there was at least one

00:00:56.824 --> 00:01:03.386
match, then i is the index of that match. Once again it's your turn. Draw the

00:01:03.386 --> 00:01:05.889
first portrait in the gallery.
