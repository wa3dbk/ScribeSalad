00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.840
So now that we know the different types of neurons, sensory, motor and

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.140
interneurons, and how electrical impulses result in action potentials. Let's

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.026
see what happens after the action potential occurs. Remember once again that

00:00:13.026 --> 00:00:17.184
the signal starts from the dendrites and moves down the axon to the terminal

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:22.836
buttons. In Lauren's depiction here at the Terminal button, we have synaptic

00:00:22.836 --> 00:00:28.588
vesicles that are holding neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are then

00:00:28.588 --> 00:00:34.172
released into the synaptic cleft. And if those neurotransmitters attach to the

00:00:34.172 --> 00:00:39.874
receptors on the opposite neuron, the message will continue along. Think of

00:00:39.874 --> 00:00:46.139
receptors as a lock and the neurotransmitters as a key. If the neurotransmitter

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:50.939
attaches to the receptor site, the message will continue along, through the

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:53.021
next neuron.
