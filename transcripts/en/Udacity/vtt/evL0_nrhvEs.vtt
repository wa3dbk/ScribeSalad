00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.820
So far in this course we have been primarily concerned with top-down design.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.570
That is, when given a set of requirements come up with a set of pieces,

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.940
connect them together and refine.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.840
In this lesson we will go the other way.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.600
Start with self contained pieces called components and

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.250
put them together to build systems.
