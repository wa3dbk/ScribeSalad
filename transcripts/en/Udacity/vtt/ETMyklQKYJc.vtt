00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I wrote some code to read in the marvel data as a barpartate graph and then to build the character

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
by character graph and then find the top k strength

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and I just reuse the heap code from the last unit to do that.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The new part to focus on is right here. So it goes like this.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
What we do is we look through all the different characters in the list of characters

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and for each character look at the different books for that character appears

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
then look at all the characters appearing in those books and for each of those triples, right.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So this is a character, the books for that character and the characters for that book

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
including the character itself by the way.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It's going to make a link from the first character to the second character.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This make a link. I modified this made link so that if you make a link twice it just keep it count.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And so that's going to keep a measure of the total strength between character one and character two.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Really, if you think about what it's doing here.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It's actually for each pair character one and character two, it's going to add one

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
each time there's a book they have in common.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Its count up the number of books in common between character one and character two,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
which is really just what we wanted, but it's done in terms of a triple nested loop here.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The running time here has to do with the number of edges right.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It's not actually that the product of the nodes times the nodes times the nodes.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Though if it's a completely connected graph it will be, but if it's a sparse graph for each character,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
we're only going to list the edges that come out of that.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
When I actually execute this, one other things we see is that this computer is faster than my laptop

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
by about a factor of 2, so it took me 0.5 to read the graph, but anyway, it reached the graph pretty quickly.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
It computes all those strengths, which is the part that we're focusing on here

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
in just a couple of seconds and then it run through the characters

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
that are connected to other characters and finds the top 10 and I'm not a comic book expert,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
but I know enough to actually recognize a couple of the things

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that are going on here just the recent movies.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You can see that there a very strong connection between the human torch and the thing.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
These are both members of the fantastic four.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I'm going to say half of the members that fit fantastic four.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Here's another one, Mr. Fantastic, and I think the invisible woman is the other one.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
What we see here is that books that have the human torch

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
will often also have the thing in them and so forth.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
All the different pairings of the fantastic four end up having very high weight.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
They have a lot of books where they all appear together.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Similarly spiderman appears very often with, I'm pretty sure that's his grandmother,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and also with his editor cause Peter Parker is a reporter,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
so his editor J. Jonah Jameson shows up in a lot books with him.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Captain America shows up with Tony Stark and I don't think I would know that at all

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
except there's a current movie out that has them together

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and I think it's because they're both Avengers.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
They're individual characters but they also appear together often

00:02:35.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and I have no idea who Vision and Scarlet Witch are, but I'm sure they're awesome.
