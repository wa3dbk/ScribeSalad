00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:03.678
The basic functionality
of GCD is as follows.

00:00:03.678 --> 00:00:07.559
We need to be able to create a queue,
either from scratch or

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:09.152
reuse an existing one.

00:00:09.152 --> 00:00:14.413
Get the main queue and
also add a closure to an existing queue.

00:00:14.413 --> 00:00:17.545
Grand Central Dispatch was
not written in SWF, but see.

00:00:17.545 --> 00:00:20.771
Unlike SWF, C has no classes or objects.

00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:23.563
So, Grand Central Dispatch
is made of functions and

00:00:23.563 --> 00:00:25.664
types instead of classes and methods.

00:00:25.664 --> 00:00:30.089
These functions and types have different
naming conventions than those used in

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.135
SWF, but they behave exactly
as if they were SWFcode.

00:00:33.135 --> 00:00:35.585
First of all,
we need a type to represent queues.

00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:38.130
That's dispatch_queue_t,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.848
then we will need a function to
create a queue from scratch.

00:00:42.848 --> 00:00:44.792
Dispatch_queue_create.

00:00:44.792 --> 00:00:49.750
It takes two parameters, a name and the
type of the queue, serial or concurrent.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.380
To specify serial,
just pass dispatch_queue_serial or nill.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.361
IOS always gives each app four extra
queues on top of the name one.

00:00:59.361 --> 00:01:01.648
These are called global queues.

00:01:01.648 --> 00:01:06.867
We access those global queues with
a function, dispatch_get_global_queue.

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:10.755
The only difference between those
four queues is the priority or

00:01:10.755 --> 00:01:13.500
how fast it will get
the attention of the CBU.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.518
It's a good practice to avoid creating
queues when using an existing one is

00:01:17.518 --> 00:01:18.038
enough.

00:01:18.038 --> 00:01:21.612
We will use dispatch_get_
global_queue for that.

00:01:21.612 --> 00:01:24.434
We also need a way to
obtain the main queue.

00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:27.355
This is the queue that runs all your UI.

00:01:27.355 --> 00:01:31.208
We will use the dispatch_get_main_queue
function for this.

00:01:31.208 --> 00:01:34.580
Why we need this might not
be obvious right now, but

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.200
it will be as soon as we get
started with the sample app.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.494
Last but not least, we need a way
of adding closures to the queue,

00:01:42.494 --> 00:01:45.318
that's where dispatch_async comes in.

00:01:45.318 --> 00:01:47.221
This function takes a queue and

00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:51.916
a closure, it adds this closure to
the queue and then returns immediately.

00:01:51.916 --> 00:01:55.647
The code inside the queue will run
sometime in the immediate future,

00:01:55.647 --> 00:01:58.606
the exact time will depend
on how many closures already

00:01:58.606 --> 00:02:01.390
waiting in the queue and
the priority of the queue.
