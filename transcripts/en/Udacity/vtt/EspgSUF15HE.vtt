This problem was a little harder than the others. If you wrote ns or no

00:00:04.117 --> 00:00:08.470
solution, that's great. Let's see why the answer is no solution. When I'm

00:00:08.482 --> 00:00:13.005
solving an absolute value inequality, the first thing I need to do is make sure

00:00:13.017 --> 00:00:17.345
I isolate the absolute value. To isolate the absolute value, in this case, I

00:00:17.357 --> 00:00:22.215
have to divide both sides by negative 3. To isolate the absolute value, I have

00:00:22.227 --> 00:00:27.017
to divide both sides of the inequality by negative 3. When I divide the left

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.036
side by negative 3, negative 3 over negative 3 is 1, so I'm simply left with the

00:00:32.048 --> 00:00:36.650
absolute of x minus 4. Now, since I divided both sides of this equation by

00:00:36.662 --> 00:00:42.280
negative 3, we have to remember to switch the direction of the inequality. And 6

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:47.825
divided by negative 3 is negative 2. Now, let's think about this problem. The

00:00:47.837 --> 00:00:53.025
absolute value of x minus 4 is less than negative 2. We know that absolute

00:00:53.037 --> 00:00:58.511
values are always positive so can the absolute value of x minus 4 ever be a

00:00:58.523 --> 00:01:03.928
negative number or much less, less that negative 2? No, this can never happen.

00:01:04.043 --> 00:01:09.607
Since the absolute value can never be negative, this inequality has no solution.

00:01:09.722 --> 00:01:13.935
Let's go on to Chapter 3, where we're going to learn about lines.
