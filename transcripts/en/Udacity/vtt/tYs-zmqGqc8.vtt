So, how do neurons communicate? Well, there's two major things you need to

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.955
know. First, information travels through a neuron using an electrical signal

00:00:07.955 --> 00:00:13.308
called an action potential. And second, information travels between neurons by

00:00:13.308 --> 00:00:18.580
way of chemicals. And those are called neurotransmitters. Let's go and take a

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.450
closer look at these two processes.
