00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.620
Okay, so here I am on the Twilio signup page. Oh, by the way,

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.610
this link, its also available in the instructor notes. Here I will signup for

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.740
free. Twilio also wants my phone number,

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.160
which I will provide. Now, I'm currently

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.260
located in the United States. Make sure

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.940
you select the country where you are located.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.230
Then Twilio sends me a verification code on the phone that

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.170
I had previously registered, you will get one on your phone

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.590
too. I will enter that code in this box here. Okay,

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.490
so they're giving me a phone number, I'm not quite sure

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.680
I understand that just yet, but I will go ahead and

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.810
continue. Alright, it seems like I can do a bunch of

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.850
things here with my account, but I'm really looking for my

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.030
authorization token. Where is that? Hm? Let me just go to

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.350
my account. ha! Here they are. Here's the Account SID, and here in the

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.750
Authorization Token. Now, I'm going to copy

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.030
and paste both of these into my program.
