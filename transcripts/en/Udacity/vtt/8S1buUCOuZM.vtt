00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.410
Maybe your product requires a physical distribution channel.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.010
Let's take a look at all the choices that you might have when you start a company.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:16.710
The first one is you might be an OEM. OEM stands for original equipment manufacturer.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.960
You might have a component. Let's say a graphics chip that goes inside of someone else's laptop.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.740
So you might be a graphics supplier to Apple or Hewlett-Packard.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.500
But it's Apple's and HP's name and their brand that shows up on the outside of the box.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.530
And so while you're making money, it is their marketing and brand.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.320
So for a system integrator, you might be selling to a company. Let's say you're Cisco.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.100
But you're selling to somebody who's building an entire telephone switching network

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.440
and this system integrator would take your component, your switches and routers,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.430
and actually build out a system that includes devices from other companies and they add some

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.430
value-added software and additional hardware and create an entire system for an end user.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:10.030
A value-added reseller might take a computer system and other pre-packaged softwares

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.160
from other third-party vendors and maybe some utilities of their own

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.820
and sell a turnkey solution to an end user and so they build less complex systems

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.250
with less value added than system integrators but they could be great partners.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.240
In a physical channel, a direct sales force are sales people that work for you directly

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.030
and typically sell directly to the end user.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.100
Now if you're delivering a physical product, one of the alternate channels that you might

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.140
want to consider is the web or online sales as well.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.410
So for some industries, distributors play a pivotal role in the distribution of the product.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.100
They provide wholesale and warehousing.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.320
They provide distribution and accounting, bill collection, etc.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.490
And distributors might sell to dealers. Most dealers are just simply storefronts.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.430
Some of them might actually add some service or support but they're essentially an extension

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.310
of the distribution channel, and they talk to the end users.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.900
So dealers might not have a physical storefront for end-user customers,

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.400
but retailers are all about main street and talking to your customers.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.440
Another form of retailer are mass merchants.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.940
So instead of just small storefronts, they aggregate tens or hundreds of thousands

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.930
of products under one roof.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.100
Retailers and mass merchants often, though not always,

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.341
get their products supplied through distributors.
