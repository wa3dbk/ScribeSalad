Now we know there are mental representations can create categories to help us

00:00:03.545 --> 00:00:08.248
make sense of our world. But how do we use them to reason? Not one area that

00:00:08.248 --> 00:00:14.590
psychologists study. Reasoning. Reasoning is a process of drawing inferences or

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.410
conclusions from principles and evidence. We have different types of reasoning,

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.754
and those are deductive reasoning and inductive reasoing. Deductive reasoning

00:00:23.754 --> 00:00:29.690
is reason from. The general to the particular. So from general statements to

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.279
specific conclusions. Here we see that the specific conclusions are always

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:39.204
correct, if the general statement is true.
