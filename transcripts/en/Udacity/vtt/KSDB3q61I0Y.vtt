00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.490
Let's go with that, I mean I don't
see anything better than this.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.760
But if you think you can out
Solomon Solomon, more power to you.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.110
&gt;&gt; Well, I believe that there
is a way out Solomon Solomon and

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.250
it really boils down to noting
what Solomon was trying to do.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.860
What was Solomon trying to do?

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.338
&gt;&gt; Solomon was trying, they had private
knowledge of whether they were moms or

00:00:18.338 --> 00:00:20.260
not, she was just trying to
get them to tell the truth.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.280
&gt;&gt; Right, and
what he was trying to elicit

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.550
in this particular mechanism was
what their preferences were.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.800
So, this sort of private notion of
whether they were the mom or not,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.976
what was happening with what
King Solomon was doing was this kind of

00:00:34.976 --> 00:00:40.110
assumption that each mom held the baby
and sort of with some kind of value.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.065
So mom A in this case,
woman A in this case, loves the baby and

00:00:46.065 --> 00:00:49.660
assigns some kind of value or
utility to having the baby around.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.880
And woman B also has a value or
utility for

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.301
having the baby around versus having
the baby end up with the other woman.

00:00:59.301 --> 00:00:59.980
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.280
&gt;&gt; And in particular, there's a value
of the baby to the true mother that is

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.020
higher than the value of
the baby to the fake mother.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.090
&gt;&gt; Maybe, okay.
&gt;&gt; And in this case,

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.650
that better be what
King Solomon thought.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.050
Because otherwise why would the fake
mother be okay with cutting

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.000
the baby in half?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.330
&gt;&gt; Again, not necessarily okay,
just not as horrified.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.250
&gt;&gt; Right, well,
that means there's a lower value there.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.090
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So there's

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.070
two values that are that
are actually going on and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.580
let's say there's a value of
the baby for the real mother.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.220
And there's a value of the baby for
the fake mother.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.568
And really the only thing that we have
to sort of assume here is that the value

00:01:35.568 --> 00:01:39.379
of the baby to the real mother is
greater than the value of the baby to

00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:40.421
the fake mother.

00:01:40.421 --> 00:01:44.910
&gt;&gt; Okay, which is also not so
clearly a good assumption?

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.317
&gt;&gt; Sure, but it certainly drives what's
going on with King Solomon here.

00:01:48.317 --> 00:01:52.435
&gt;&gt; If value is like willingness to pay,
it could be that B is really rich but

00:01:52.435 --> 00:01:55.880
isn't the mom and A is poor and
can't really pay very much.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.360
But okay, all right,
let's just go with it, so.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.360
&gt;&gt; I mean if-
&gt;&gt; We

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.220
want to know who wants the baby more.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.170
&gt;&gt; Right, who wants the baby more,

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.140
sort of the intrinsic value of
the baby to each of the women.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.088
And if you assume that the true
mother cares more about the baby,

00:02:09.088 --> 00:02:10.847
that is has the baby at a higher value.

00:02:10.847 --> 00:02:14.800
Then the fake mother then believing
this to be true makes sense.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.990
&gt;&gt; Okay, I'll take it, sure.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.830
&gt;&gt; And if that's not the case,
then you're kind of lost anyway.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.260
So we might as well go ahead and
just sort of assume that this is true.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.120
Anyway, if the fake mom had that
much money, she'll just buy a baby.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.387
&gt;&gt; But
that's what she's trying to do [LAUGH].

00:02:24.387 --> 00:02:26.140
&gt;&gt; No, she stole the baby.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.220
&gt;&gt; Good point.
&gt;&gt; Okay, good.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.250
So let's assume that we really believe
that there is a value to the baby to

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.090
the real mom and it's greater than the
value of the baby to the fake mom, okay?

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.350
So I'm just going to

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.440
assert another kind of mechanism
that King Solomon may have used.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.160
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; And I want you to walk me through it

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.630
and see if you believe
that this is good,

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.880
bad or the same as what King Solomon
actually did in the story.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.530
Okay?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.600
&gt;&gt; All right, so let me write that out.
