00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.197
Now we want to figure out how many columns there are in each row, and the land

00:00:03.197 --> 00:00:07.112
is 1900 meters wide. But it looks like depending on where we cut this off, some

00:00:07.112 --> 00:00:11.385
of the rows might have different lengths than others. I've done a little math

00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:15.977
for you here. This first field in the second row starts 400 meters away from

00:00:15.977 --> 00:00:20.655
this edge. Let's give names to these two different kinds of rows. The first and

00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:25.379
third are odd rows. The second and fourth and so on would be even rows. How

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:29.729
many columns are in each odd row? How many columns are in each even row?
