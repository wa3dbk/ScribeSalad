00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.200
So, I'm going to provide a start on this code and now

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.310
we'll leave the crucial part of it for you to do as

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.270
a quiz. You should feel free at any point to stop

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.230
and try to figure out more of the code on your own.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.810
There are lots of different ways to do this and we'll

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.500
show you one. And you'll finish that as a quiz. So, the

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.740
first thing we're going to do is define two constants. So, we're

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.540
going to use d as the damping factor. And I'll use 0.8 as

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.740
my damping factor. That's the probability, thinking about

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.090
our random web surfer, that she selects the link

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.540
on the current page, rather than starting over with

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.100
a new random page. The other constant I'm going to

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.830
define here we'll call numloops. That's the number of

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.460
times we're going to go through the relaxation. What we're

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.570
computing is the value of rank at some time

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.860
step. The number of times we go through that

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.590
is going to determine the accuracy of our ranks. We'll

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.720
use ten as the number of loops. You can experiment with

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.210
changing that, and one of the questions in the homework

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.820
assignment will ask you to think about what happens when you

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.010
change that. So, now we need to start, we said

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.140
initially the rank of each url is 1 divided by the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.640
number of pages and so the dictionary ranks, we want to initialize

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.250
with those values. So, we are going to create an empty dictionary.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.456
We'll call it ranks. The number of pages, the number of

00:01:18.456 --> 00:01:21.010
pages, we can get from the graph. The graph is a

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.110
dictionary of nodes and len of graph will tell us the

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.600
number of entries in that dictionary. So, that's the number of

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.490
nodes in the graph which is the number of pages that

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.480
we've crawled. And now we want to go through the pages

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.090
initializing each page to the value one divided by npages, and

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.950
I'm remembering to use 1.0 here to make sure the division

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.290
is done as floating point division and we get an

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.170
accurate number rather than integer division. So, now, we've

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.070
initialized the ranks. We have a dictionary that maps each

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.700
page to its current rank, which is one divided by

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.650
the number of pages. So, now, we get to the

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.970
interesting part. We need a loop that's going to go through

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.670
the number of times of numloops. Each time through this

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.960
loop, what we want to do is update the newranks

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.469
based on this formula, using the old ranks. And then, at

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:12.390
the end of the loop, we are going to make the variable

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.220
ranks hold what was previous newranks and that way, we

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.220
can keep going, each time we are going to get a new value

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.080
from newranks. At the end of doing all updates, we are

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.610
going to update ranks to refer to whatever newranks is. So, that

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.900
means each time through this loop we are going to create

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.120
a new dictionary called newranks that starts as empty, and we're going

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.970
to add all the pages to newranks as we update

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.200
their rank. So, to do that we need to go through

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.120
the pages in the graph and for each page what we

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.480
want to do is compute the new rank for that page.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.145
And the first thing we'll do is this part. The

00:02:47.145 --> 00:02:51.345
new rank is 1 minus d divided by npages plus this

00:02:51.345 --> 00:02:54.670
summation. So, the first thing we will do is introduce a

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.420
new variable, we will call it newrank and we will assign

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.790
it to this value. Then we are going to update it as

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.460
we go through the pages that link into this page. So, we'll

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.456
start by initializing newrank as 1 minus d divided by the number

00:03:08.456 --> 00:03:12.150
of pages. So, then what we need to do is update for this

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.830
summation. And I'm going to leave this blank. And I'm going to

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.840
skip that for now. This is going to be left as a

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.940
quiz. We'll finish the rest of the code. And then your quiz

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.440
will be to finish this part of the code, which is really the

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.300
most interesting part of computing the page ranks. Once

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.620
we've done that, so we've used newrank as a variable

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.965
to keep track of the rank for this page.

00:03:30.965 --> 00:03:33.110
Well, we want to update our dictionary, so we're going

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.050
to add an entry, newranks. We're still within the

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.670
for loop, you're going to put your code that sums

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.960
up all the links here. Once we've done that, we've

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.300
got the value of newrank that reflects both the probability

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.360
of starting from that page, and the popularity from all

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.070
the inlinks. And so, we'll update this to be newrank. We've

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.490
added that to our dictionary, so once we've finished looping through

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.370
all the pages in the graph, well now, we're ready for

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.710
the next step. So, that means, we want to make the

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.440
variable ranks refer to the newranks, so we've changed the

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.690
time step to the next time step, and now we're going to

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.870
go back through this loop, and we go through this loop,

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.430
number of loops times, each time we're

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.390
updating the ranks, and when we're done, what

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.130
we want to return is ranks. That's the

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.610
dictionary that maps each page to its rank.
