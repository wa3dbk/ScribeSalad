00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.482
Now that we know that f of x is equal to x minus 2 times x squared minus 2x

00:00:03.482 --> 00:00:07.142
minus 3, let's see if can go from here to writing the function in its fully

00:00:07.142 --> 00:00:14.800
factored form. Lucky for us, we know how to factor x squared minus 2x minus 3.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.198
So, please factor this and write the two factors in these two boxes. That will

00:00:19.198 --> 00:00:21.479
give us the fully factored form of f of x.
