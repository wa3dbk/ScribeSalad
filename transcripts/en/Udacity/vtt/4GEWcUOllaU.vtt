32 squared plus 16 squared plus 8 squared plus 4 squared plus 2 squared plus 1

00:00:04.663 --> 00:00:10.202
squared is 1,365 bytes. This is about 33% additional space needed for the

00:00:10.202 --> 00:00:14.508
mipmap. This approximately 33% figure is true for any mipmap and is never more

00:00:14.508 --> 00:00:16.460
than this percentage.
