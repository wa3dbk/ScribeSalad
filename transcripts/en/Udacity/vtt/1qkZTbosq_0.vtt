00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.983
This area would be x squared. And this one would be 2x. Great job if you got

00:00:04.983 --> 00:00:10.215
both of those correct. This shape has one side of x and another side of x. So it

00:00:10.215 --> 00:00:15.074
really makes it a square. So the area has to be x times x, or x squared. For

00:00:15.074 --> 00:00:19.893
this rectangle, we know one side is 2 and this other side is x, because this

00:00:19.893 --> 00:00:24.285
side is x. So we have 2 times x, or 2x.
