00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The easiest way to ignore outliers is called quartiles or their closely related cousin, percentiles.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Suppose we have a data set the following form and here

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
the data is shown in order--there's exactly 11 items.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Then quartiles partition this data into four regions and look carefully, there's gaps in between.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The element in the center that you've encountered--you might remember

00:00:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
what is the mean, median, or the mode--please check one of those.
