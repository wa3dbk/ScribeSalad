00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.877
You've just implemented a program that shows two kinds of question; a plain

00:00:03.877 --> 00:00:08.795
question and a numeric question. Both of them work past to the presentQuestion

00:00:08.795 --> 00:00:12.941
method. Clearly we can extend the system with all sorts of other question

00:00:12.941 --> 00:00:18.022
types, and we won't ever have to change the presentQuestion method. So, what

00:00:18.022 --> 00:00:22.241
polymorphism gives us is extensible software systems. We can start out with

00:00:22.241 --> 00:00:26.948
something simple and without having to change any of the basic structure. We

00:00:26.948 --> 00:00:31.438
can extend the functionality by adding more and more subclasses. Polymorphism

00:00:31.438 --> 00:00:35.658
is one of the two corner stones of object orientated programming. The other one

00:00:35.658 --> 00:00:39.623
is encapsulation. Remember that encapsulation means, we separate the interface

00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:44.226
of a class from it's implementation. And that means that the implementations

00:00:44.226 --> 00:00:48.386
can evolve over time and gain more functionality without having to change the

00:00:48.386 --> 00:00:53.400
rest of the system. So, both of these cornerstone properties let us build

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.665
systems that start out small and that can be functional for a long time. Which

00:00:58.665 --> 00:01:02.295
is why object-oriented programming has become such a popular methodology for

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:06.246
writing programs. Now, in a few short weeks, you have gone from just becoming

00:01:06.246 --> 00:01:08.925
familiar with objects and how they work, to being able to write quite

00:01:08.925 --> 00:01:13.850
sophisticated programs that can withstand the test of time. So, you've really

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.164
come a long way in this introduction to programming, and I hope you enjoyed it.
