00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.850
Okay, so opening our file in the browser is probably not what you expected.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.490
Looking at it in developer tools, the structure is exactly as you defined it,

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.940
but the style description isn't there and

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.996
the browser uses it's default style for all of the elements, and as you can see,

00:00:18.996 --> 00:00:25.520
it's not very pretty and the visual layout is completely off as well.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.320
Let's go ahead and add in some styles.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.690
Do you remember earlier when I talked about the HTML file telling

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.640
the browser where to find the style information?

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.570
Yeah, we need to add that.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.950
First, you need to add a single line at the start of the HTML file.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.860
This tells the browser that the type of document is an HTML document.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.980
Then you need to add the top level tag html because everything here

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.240
is html and don't forget, every time we have the start tag,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.680
we also need to have the end tag and then, so our code is easier to read, we'll

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.840
indent our HTML structure so that it's located in between our two html tags.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.610
After the html tag we need to add a head tag.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.290
This is where you'll add the link to the style file.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.230
To add a link to the style file, we start typing, link, and then hit Tab.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.150
Here, Sublime Text has automatically filled in all of the information we need,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.610
except for the name of the file that contains our style information, which,

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.414
in this case, is called style.css.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.090
After the closure of the head tag, we then add the body tag.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.680
Now, contained within our body tags will be our HTML structure that we

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.850
wrote before.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.070
So we need to move this code in between our body tags.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.650
Again, for code readability, we've indented the html structure.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.090
So that we have a bit more to look and

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.740
work with, let's replace the placeholder description with some text.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.410
You can choose to write your own text or

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.540
simply use what we provided in the Instructor notes.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.758
Once the text is added, save the file and then refresh your browser page.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.500
You can see that it updated with the text that we've included and

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.050
since you've linked your style sheet to your HTML file,

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.990
you can go to the style.css file and add some style to the page,

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.760
and just for fun, how about we add the following style.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.310
Save the file and refresh your browser.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.830
Then tell me what happened.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.920
Did the box with class description turn red?

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.910
Did all text turn red, or

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.470
did the text in the description box turn red, or did nothing happen?
