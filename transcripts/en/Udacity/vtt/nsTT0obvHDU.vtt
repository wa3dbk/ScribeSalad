00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.840
So now let's talk about how
password-based authentication

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.920
can be implemented.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.860
So we know the evidence that's
going to be provided is

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.140
a password user is going to supply,

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.240
and then they're going to type or
touch the screen or something like that.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.330
And that's going to follow,
you're telling the system who they are,

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.070
which typically they
provide the user ID.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.590
So they tied their user ID and
password, let's say.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.510
And the system now has this task of,

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.460
well, how do I know that this is
the correct password for this user, and

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.100
if it is the correct password,
authentication will be successful.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.840
So how can we perform this check?

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.400
So you would say well an obvious
solution to this problem is that

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.010
we ask users to share their
passwords with the system.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.540
So the first time this is called
registration or enrollment or

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.120
some out of band method by which.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.010
Of course the system has to know
something about your secret.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.170
If it doesn't, it can't check it.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:07.160
So let's say the secret is password so
we have a set of users with passwords.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.270
And the system stores those passwords.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.750
It's trusted system we,
let's say, give it our password.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.640
And if we do that, it's not a good idea
and actually we won't have to do that.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.510
But if you do that than how can we do
that check that we're talking about.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.585
I will see it's pretty straight forward.

00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:29.530
All we have to do is impair the type
password with the one that's stored.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.070
So where do we store it?

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.860
We have to store it in a file.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.080
People come back, you turn the computer
off and then come back and

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.210
login so
this information has to persist.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.570
Your computer multiple sessions, so

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.260
persistent information
is stored in files.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.640
One thing we should be smart enough to
do is that only the trusted root or

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.430
admin be able to read this file.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.870
The login program is going to run on
behalf of them and they are the ones

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.875
that are going to check and somebody's
trying to authenticate themselves.

00:02:00.875 --> 00:02:06.085
So this file should be made readable
only by the admin or the root.

00:02:06.085 --> 00:02:09.305
The most user we have in the system.

00:02:09.305 --> 00:02:11.215
But what if we make a mistake?

00:02:11.215 --> 00:02:14.045
What if permissions are set incorrectly?

00:02:14.045 --> 00:02:16.895
The permissions are set incorrectly
somebody else may be able to

00:02:16.895 --> 00:02:18.238
read that file.

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:20.130
And if they're able to read that file,

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.110
they're able to learn everyone's
password, which is not a good thing.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.880
Even if the permissioners are set right,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.640
why should an admin be able
to know all the passwords?

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.210
Okay, every user's password,
if they know it, there's no reason for

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.670
them to have access to passwords
of all users in the system.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.260
And the one reason we don't
want to have that is that in

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.700
case you have security breach,
the passwords are going to be exposed,

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.870
everyone's password is going
to be exposed to that hacker.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.230
So it's clear that something about the
secret has to be shared with the system,

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.860
the password has to be
shared with the system.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.490
But storing those secrets in a file,

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.390
even if you do access control,
is not a good idea.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.020
So can we do better?

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.430
So indeed,
we can actually do better, and

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.180
the way to think about that is that we
don't store the passwords themselves,

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.580
but store something that
is derived from it.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.150
It's not the actual password But
something that is possible to

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.600
get hold of only if you had access
to the password at some point.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.280
Or at least in the beginning or
the enrollment time or

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.890
when the password was changed and then
you're not storing the full password but

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.910
just something derived from it.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.560
The question is if you're storing
something derived from what is it and

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.760
how do you use it.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.930
The result that we
derived from password.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.540
One way to do that is to use what
is called a one-way function.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.630
This called are called hash functions.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.250
Hash functions are widely used to
take an arbitrary length of input and

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.820
produce a fixed size output that
is fairly unique to the input.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.380
And one-way basically says that it's
easy to compute given the input of

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.020
the hash value is easy to compute, but

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.420
it's very hard to compute the input
if you just had the hash value.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.170
So such functions exist, we're going to
talk about some examples of those.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.450
So thing to remember here is that

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.089
given a password it produced
a hash value of that password.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:26.350
And going from password to hash value
is straightforward going in the other

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.190
direction which is from hash value
to the password is really hard.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.530
So what you're going to do is you're
going to use a function like that so

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.190
rather than storing the password we're
going to store something derived

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.920
from it.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.580
In particular, we're going to store
a hash value, and that's what we're

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.730
going to have, and even the hash values
that we have, those have to be stored in

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.850
a file as earlier we were talking
we're storing the passwords in a file.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.380
Even this file should be readable only
for the perlist user or the admin user

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.910
that we're talking about on whose behalf
the log in program is going to run.
