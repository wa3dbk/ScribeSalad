00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.840
The topic today is the Object Constraint Language, a part of UML.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.270
So far when we've looked at UML we've been looking at diagrams. But

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.710
diagrams don't tell the whole story. There are places in the specifications and

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.189
the designs of your system where you need more details. And

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:23.930
that is what OCL was designed to provide to designers.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.510
OCL is a language, it's not a programming language,

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.350
it's a specification language. It's declarative, it's strongly typed, and

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.300
allows you to specify the functional details of system properties.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:44.660
OCL consists of a means to express constraints plus some collection classes.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.405
And an ability to navigate around the various classes

00:00:50.405 --> 00:00:56.178
of relationships in your diagrams. OCL's a mature technology is part,

00:00:56.178 --> 00:01:00.689
an official part of UML and supported by various tools. Such as Rational Rose,

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:05.510
ArgoUML, Eclipse, Poseidon, Enterprise Architect and so on
