00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.590
All right, so welcome back from the quiz.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.995
So these are the answers, first we have

00:00:05.995 --> 00:00:08.090
ud-859. Well the dash character can be used

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.050
in project id's but it's not available. Then we

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.000
have hi_there, well underscore cannot be used in

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.090
project id's. So it's not a valid project

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.391
id and therefore not available either. What about

00:00:22.391 --> 00:00:25.340
hi7? Well a project ID must be at least

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.730
six characters, so it's not valid and it's not available. Then we have

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.590
cheesecake 0123456789, well this is a valid project ID but it's not available
