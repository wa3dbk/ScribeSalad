If you got 21 over 21, great job. Let's see how we got that. Well, we know that

00:00:05.783 --> 00:00:12.141
dividing fractions is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal. So, 3/4 divided

00:00:12.153 --> 00:00:18.622
by 5/7 is actually 3/4 times 7/5. And we know when we multiply fractions

00:00:18.634 --> 00:00:24.290
together, we multiply the numerators together, so 3 times 7 is 21. And we

00:00:24.302 --> 00:00:28.238
multiply the denominators together, 5 times 4 is 20.
