00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.130
Now, I'm going to show
you some pseudo code for

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:08.109
how you might implement this API for
a linear regression learner.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.730
So we define our class as LimRegLearner.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.300
And this first method init with
underscores on either side

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.690
is the constructor.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.960
The constructor is really easy.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.030
For the linear regression learner,
we actually don't have to do anything

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.040
when we instantiated
an instance of the learner.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.540
So we just use pass,
which means do nothing.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:37.200
Our training method takes an x and a y,
and remember, x can be multidimensional.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.540
And what it's doing,
it should take this x data and

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.840
this y data and fit a line to it.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.470
So it's trying to find an m and a b.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.620
So the job of the train method is
to find that linear equation or

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.900
the parameters for
that linear equation, m and b.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.306
So here on the left-hand side,

00:00:57.306 --> 00:01:02.950
we have self.m which means the m
goes to the local instance,

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.340
and b to the local instance, and
you're allowed to use any number of

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.820
linear regression algorithms at your
disposal as part of SciPy and NumPy.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.430
So go Google and
find which one you want to use here and

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.040
just stuff it's output into m and b.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.270
Finally, query is passed in x and it's
supposed to predicted y given that x.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.250
And remember,
this is potentially a list of x's and

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.690
it can also be multidimensional.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.530
Anyways, it's very simple.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.730
You just multiply that x times m and
add b and return y, boom, that's it.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.694
In short, this is literally how
short your LinRegLearner can be.

00:01:48.694 --> 00:01:54.360
Now, the k and
n API is going to look exactly the same.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.170
And the reason for that is if we have
the same API, we can easily mix and

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.800
match, and try training and

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.070
querying with the different
algorithms and see how they compare.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.199
Okay, that is it for regression.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.590
I'll see you at the next lesson.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.380
Have a great day.
