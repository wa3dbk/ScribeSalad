00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.059
Here the factored forms for each part of the fraction. Great work if you got all

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:08.776
of these correct. If you made a mistake that's okay too. Now's a great time to

00:00:08.776 --> 00:00:12.211
go back and look over your work. See if you can figure out how to get these

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:17.212
factors. If not, you can always watch the solution. For our first numerator we

00:00:17.212 --> 00:00:21.654
can remove a 2 x squared as the greatest common factor. This leaves us with x

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:26.364
squared plus 4 x plus 3 for our second factor. Now we can easily factor this one

00:00:26.364 --> 00:00:31.512
by finding factors of 3. That sum to positive 4. That would be positive 3 and

00:00:31.512 --> 00:00:35.971
positive 1. This is why it's important to find a greatest common factor first.

00:00:35.972 --> 00:00:39.824
If we don't find this greatest common factor we won't be able to factor each

00:00:39.824 --> 00:00:43.175
these and cancel our factors in the end. For this denominator we have a

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:47.570
coefficient of 1 in front of the x squared term. So we just want to find factors

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.461
of negative 15 that add to 2. This would be positive 5 and negative 3. For this

00:00:52.461 --> 00:00:56.714
numerator the greatest common factor of the three terms is 1. So we just want to

00:00:56.714 --> 00:01:01.070
find factors of negative 50 that sum to positive 5. The factors would be

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.474
negative 5 and positive 10 and then we can use factoring by grouping. To get our

00:01:05.474 --> 00:01:10.452
factors of x plus 5 and 2 x minus 5. For our last denominator we can remove a

00:01:10.452 --> 00:01:15.308
common factor of 6 x from every single term. If we factor the 6 x as a greatest

00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:20.098
common factor, we're left with 2 x squared plus 3 x plus 1. If we distribute

00:01:20.098 --> 00:01:23.944
this really quickly we can make sure that this is correct. When we look at

00:01:23.944 --> 00:01:28.366
factoring this expression, we want to value in factors of positive 2 that sum to

00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:33.237
positive 3. We can use factoring by grouping. To arrive at the factors of x plus

00:01:33.237 --> 00:01:38.272
1 times 2 x plus 1. These factors take the place of this quadratic trinomial.

00:01:38.272 --> 00:01:41.857
Now we're ready to simply our fractions since everything's in factored form.

00:01:41.858 --> 00:01:43.403
Great work.
