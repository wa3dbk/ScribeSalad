00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.620
An IPv4 address is actually a 32-bit or
4 octet value,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.470
which we usually write as a dotted quad.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.250
But writing an IP address
as four decimal numbers is

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.085
just a convention to
make it easier to read.

00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:19.045
When it's used between computers it's
just a 32 bit long string of bits.

00:00:19.045 --> 00:00:24.305
However, not all of the possible 32 bit
values are used for real addresses.

00:00:24.305 --> 00:00:27.055
Some of them are reserved for
special protocols.

00:00:27.055 --> 00:00:30.105
Some of them are reserved for
internal private networks.

00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:33.070
Some of them are for
testing or for documentation.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.900
In fact, just over one-eighth
of all possible IPv4 addresses,

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.600
are set aside for something other
than addressing public hosts.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.940
But as you'll see, even if we did use
all 32 bit addresses to represent public

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.270
hosts that still wouldn't
really be enough.
