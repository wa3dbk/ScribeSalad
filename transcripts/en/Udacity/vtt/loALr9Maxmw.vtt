00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.640
Say you're given this pipeline. You're told that the fragment shader is turning

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.955
out to be a huge bottleneck in this extremely primitive GPU design made by Acme

00:00:06.955 --> 00:00:11.702
GPU's and Bubblegum, Incorporated. Their GPU has a single vertex shader and a

00:00:11.702 --> 00:00:15.876
single fragment shader processor. This is pretty pitiful and, in fact, is what

00:00:15.876 --> 00:00:19.562
differentiates different GPU's in the same class. Some will be more powerful

00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:22.986
simply because they have more shaders on the chip. Modern GPU's process

00:00:22.986 --> 00:00:26.088
hundreds, if not thousands, of vertices and pixels simultaneously with these

00:00:26.088 --> 00:00:30.640
cores, which is why they are called massively parallel. Acme knows that they'll

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.390
need to add more cores to be competitive, so they're making a much larger chip.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.142
They know that it'll be able to have a few hundred separate vertex shaders and

00:00:37.142 --> 00:00:41.564
separate fragment shaders, plus room for other features. You've been hired to

00:00:41.564 --> 00:00:45.458
design their next chip, which will have many more transistors available. Your

00:00:45.458 --> 00:00:49.600
team brainstorms a few architectural ideas and you're asked to evaluate these.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.276
Your task is to decide what's worth considering. Reverse the order performing

00:00:53.276 --> 00:00:56.576
the fragment shader before the vertex shader, test the z-depth before running

00:00:56.576 --> 00:00:59.726
the fragment shader and abort if test fails, rework the shader cores so they

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:02.926
can be used as vertex shaders or fragment shaders, and the last idea is divide

00:01:02.926 --> 00:01:09.618
each triangle into four smaller triangles and render these. Personally, I think

00:01:09.618 --> 00:01:11.929
half of these ideas are worth exploring further.
