As Susan said, these drugs depress the central nervous system, which is the

00:00:04.776 --> 00:00:09.926
opposite of what stimulants do. That's why benzodiazepines are often used to

00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:14.214
treat anxiety. Barbiturates are not used as often today to treat anxiety

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:19.672
because they are not as safe as benzodiazepines. People are more likely to

00:00:19.672 --> 00:00:24.074
overdose on barbiturates than benzodiazepines. Also, if barbiturates are

00:00:24.074 --> 00:00:28.595
consumed with alcohol, it can cause death. Barbiturates, are however, used to

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:33.075
treat some medical conditions, such as epilepsy, because they often help to

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:38.730
suppress seizure activity. Alcohol is not used today in an official medical

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.600
sense. However, it's a widely abused drug that people use to self-medicate.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.590
That is, they may use it to help them cope with problems in their life.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.856
However, it is important to know that alcohol is a drug. You may hear people

00:00:54.856 --> 00:01:01.990
say alcohol and drugs, when in fact it should be alcohol and other drugs.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.266
You'll now be able to point that out to be people when you hear such a mistake,

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:08.270
because you know that alcohol is a drug.
