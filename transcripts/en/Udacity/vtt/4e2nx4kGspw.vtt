00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.617
With reflection mapping, we get sharp reflections. This is good as far as it

00:00:03.617 --> 00:00:08.295
goes, but many reflective surfaces are glossy. They're shiny but they're not

00:00:08.295 --> 00:00:12.470
mirror like, reflections are a bit blurred. One way to simulate this effect is

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.230
to blur the reflection map. This blurring is usually done in advance and the

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.840
texture stored. Some cleverness is needed to properly filter from face to face

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.815
of the cube map, but utilities exist that perform this function for you. Think

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:27.360
about the Blinn-Phong specular reflection model for a moment. Blinn-Phong and

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.630
other reflection models work by taking the lights direction in eye direction.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.668
They use these to decide at a point on a surface how much that point is likely

00:00:34.668 --> 00:00:39.282
to be a perfect mirror, whatever portion is a mirror reflects this light. In

00:00:39.282 --> 00:00:41.783
reality, much of the world most of the time is sending photons to any given

00:00:41.783 --> 00:00:45.936
point in space from many different directions. Look around and everything you

00:00:45.936 --> 00:00:48.792
can see is sending light your way. It doesn't matter if the light is from an

00:00:48.792 --> 00:00:52.280
emitter or a surface, except that emitters are usually brighter. What an

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.025
environment map does is treats the whole surrounding world as a source of

00:00:55.025 --> 00:00:59.528
light. While blurring an environment map is not entirely physically correct, it

00:00:59.528 --> 00:01:02.807
is extremely convincing. There is less of a problem of a reflection not

00:01:02.807 --> 00:01:05.226
matching up with what's in the environment, since you can't see a clear

00:01:05.226 --> 00:01:09.975
reflection on a burnished surface. Another advantage is that these blurry cube

00:01:09.975 --> 00:01:14.375
maps can be considerably smaller in size and still look good. For the two cube

00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:18.470
maps I showed, the original had faces that were 512 by 512 texels in size, the

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.590
blurred version only 128 by 128. A lower resolution is all that's needed since

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.298
the color changes more slowly. If you want a wider range of materials, you can

00:01:27.298 --> 00:01:30.004
blur the original reflection map by different amounts and get different gloss

00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:34.092
textures. You can also mix and match between sharp and blurred reflections on

00:01:34.092 --> 00:01:38.227
the same surface, giving an impression of a multi-coat material. Combining

00:01:38.227 --> 00:01:41.108
these ideas with different reflectivities, illumination models, and surface

00:01:41.108 --> 00:01:43.360
colors can give a wide range of effects.
