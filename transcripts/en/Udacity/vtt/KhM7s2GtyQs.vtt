00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.280
You're looking at the jQuery library.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.170
This is the entire library.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.340
Notice that it's actually just JavaScript.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.500
Let me repeat that.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.680
jQuery is just a JavaScript library.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.060
It's not a language on its own nor is it fundamentally different

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.880
than the thousands of other JavaScript libraries available.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.960
There's no magic in here that you couldn't devise yourself.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.850
If we had a week or so,

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.230
I'd be willing to bet that you could recreate a lot of jQuery's functionality.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.759
Look at this method, isFunction.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.402
Do you see that?

00:00:34.402 --> 00:00:37.940
Look, it's just returning true if the object passed into it

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.310
has a type of function.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.620
If you recreated jQuery,

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.380
your library probably wouldn't be as performant as jQuery.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.340
But you could pretty easily recreate a lot of the same methods and

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.890
functionality that jQuery offers.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.020
jQuery exists largely because manipulating the DOM with

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.220
vanilla JavaScript isn't always easy.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.240
For instance, inserting a new DOM node with JavaScript means

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.319
creating an element, setting attributes and

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:10.400
content of the new node, selecting the soon-to-be parent of the new node, and

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.770
then finally inserting the new node as a child of the parent node.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.030
But with jQuery, all of that is simplified to one simple function.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.400
And no one wants to worry about developing Web sites for

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.890
different browsers when all you want to do is concentrate on

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.460
creating a Web site with a fantastic user experience.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.560
jQuery exists so that you can focus on UX, not browser quirks.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.220
But before you start writing jQuery functions,

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.870
I want you to take a look under jQuery's hood.
