00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.590
If an app updates in the background, 
but no one opens it to find out,

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.560
did it really happen? 
Notification started off

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.940
as a convenient way to notify users 
of background updates.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.980
But they've grown to become 
a powerful standardized shortcut

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.540
to interact directly with apps 
in a lightweight way.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.080
Starting in Jelly Bean 
it was possible to expand notifications,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.590
making them larger 
and containing more information.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.500
That also introduced the concept 
of the rich notification,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.880
which is able to include actions
like these, to be performed on the data

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.390
included within the notification. 
This speeds up interaction

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.060
and helps users streamline 
their notification triage experience.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.890
As a standardized UI designed specifically
for conveying timely information

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.252
in limited screen space. 
Notifications were the obvious mechanism

00:00:42.252 --> 00:00:45.580
to use, when Android expanded 
into wearables with Android Wear.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.150
Suddenly those rich notifications 
that you designed for phones and tablet's

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.880
make your app wearable 
compatible, for free.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.630
Don't overdo it though, 
there's a fine line between

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.650
useful and spammy. 
And it's only a couple of clicks

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.590
for a user to disable 
your app's notifications permanently.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.160

in creating good notifications.
