00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.550
Just as materials can change width and
height, they can also change elevation.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.119
We saw a glimpse of this with
the magnetic reaction of

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:09.620
buttons to the touch of your finger,

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.360
but this can also occur with
interactions such as scrolling.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.030
Consider two surfaces which start off
in the same plane and move together and

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.030
lock step.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.950
At a certain point,
one surface may need to stick and

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.490
raise up to allow
the other to pass below it.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.000
We call this a seam to step transition.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.741
The two adjacent surfaces
first form a seam.

00:00:30.741 --> 00:00:35.330
But when the lower surface slides
below the other, they form a step.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.810
&gt;&gt; For example, this app employs
an extended app bar that collapses to

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.470
a standard height and pins to the top
of the screen as the user scrolls.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.290
So you see the elevation increasing.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.250
Now, you can build this effect entirely
in XML using the new at bar layout and

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.510
collapsing toolbar layout.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.970
Let's look at some layout XML code.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.780
At the root,
we start with coordinator layout

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.900
which helps coordinate behaviors
across several kinds of views.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.980
In this case it will coordinate
the scrolling of a list

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.400
with the scrolling of our app bar.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.990
Since CoordinatorLayout is in
the android design support library.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.210
We'll need to references it
by its full class name and

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.080
also include the app name space for
support library attributes.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.580
We'll use and AppBarLayout
under the CoordinatorLayout and

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.455
give it the expanded
height we want of 168dp.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.470
Within that we'll include
a CollapsingToolbarLayout and

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.790
tell it to scroll off the screen
until it reaches the collapsed size,

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.720
that's this exitUntilCollapsed flag.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.420
Inside that we'll place
our Toolbar widget.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.150
And give it the smaller height we
want to collapse to the 56dps.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.040
Note that the collapsing toolbar
layout will be responsible for

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.260
drawing the title.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.580
The toolbar widget here is only
responsible for drawing the icons.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.220
Finally, the other widget
here will be a RecyclerView,

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.560
which uses a special
predefined layout behavior

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.070
that triggers appbar_scrolling
when the RecyclerView is scrolled.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.860
The Android design support
library does all the rest.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.210
Check out the documentation for scroll
flags in layout behaviors to find out

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.430
about other great scrolling behaviors
you can build with the library.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.210
&gt;&gt; Using these techniques we can
divide our UIs into surfaces

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.880
to communicate the relationship and
provide interaction cues.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.950
Interfaces should be dynamic.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.940
Responding to user interaction and

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.860
clearly communicating
any changes in state.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.480
Remember these techniques when trying
to express the relationship between

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.670
your UI elements.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.550
They'll help make your screens
immediately comprehensible and

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.710
make your app much more intuitive.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.300
Let's go to James, who will show you
how to put this to practise with code.
