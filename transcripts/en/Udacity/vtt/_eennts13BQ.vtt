00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.920
On to if else statements.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.110
You saw several if else statements in
Swift when we talked about operators.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.800
If else statements take the form, if,

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.050
a condition to evaluate, a statement
to execute if the condition is met.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.830
Else, a statement to execute
if the condition is not met.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.050
Notice again that it's not necessary to
place the condition within parentheses

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.060
as you might do in C or Java.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.290
It is necessary to place
the statements between curly braces.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.600
Now let's revisit some of
the statements from lesson one.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.810
Here we've got a bole called Hungry.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.160
If hungry is true, let's eat.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.610
Otherwise, let's wait.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.600
We can use logical operators to
build more complicated conditions.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.010
Here we're adding a second bole,
Vegetarian.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.140
If hungry is true and
vegetarian is false let's eat steak.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.270
If hungry is true and vegetarian
is true let's eat pumpkin curry.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.940
Otherwise forget about it.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.740
We can go for coffee or margaritas.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.900
Similarly, in example three.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:07.270
If hungry is true or if there is pie is
true, let's eat, otherwise, nevermind.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.350
And that's it for now.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.340
If else statements and
Swift are pretty intuitive.
