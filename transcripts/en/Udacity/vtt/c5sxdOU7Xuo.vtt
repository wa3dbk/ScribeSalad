00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.460
How does the Aadhaar data fit into the

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.110
definition of relational database that we just covered? In

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.090
the case of the Aadhaar data, our database would

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.470
have just one table called Aadhaar Data. It has

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.400
numerous columns for example, registrar, enrollment agency, state,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.320
district, and a number of others. We can imagine

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.850
a related table might have information on all the

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.310
Indian districts such as their populations and their size.
