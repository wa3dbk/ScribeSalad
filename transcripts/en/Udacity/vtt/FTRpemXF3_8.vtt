00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.480
Let's see what implementing
instructive motion might look like.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.490
In this example, we have a full bleed
image and some content below it.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.000
There's a tension here,
we want to show the image in full, but

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.470
we also want to indicate that
there's more text available.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.420
And perhaps, we want to show some of
that text content right away too.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.060
What we can do is start off with
the image fully visible, but

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.670
then immediately slide up some of the
text to indicate there's more content.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.090
Let's see how we can implement
this pretty simple form

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.130
of instructive motion.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.690
Let's start with the layout.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.780
Nothing fancy here, just a frame
layout with a fixed height image, and

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.480
a scroll view in front of it.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.620
The linear layout in the scroll view
will contain our text content, and

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.380
have a white background.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.590
We'll give the linear layout
a little elevation to make it clear

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.040
that it's a distinct surface.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.040
Now, at the default scroll position,
you see the full image,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.520
but very little text content.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.740
All we need to do is
animate the scroll position

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.610
as the screen first opens to a position
that shows more of the text content.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.050
Here we're using an ObjectAnimator
to animate the scrollY property

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.480
of the ScrollView.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.030
We could just use the ScrollView's
smoothScrollTo method, but

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.250
this gives you a bit more
control over that animation.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.850
We start the animation inside of
onEnterAnimationComplete to ensure that

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.910
the window transition ends first
before we start the animation.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.100
This is only available in
Android 5.0 and later, but

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.920
you could fake it on earlier versions
using something like a start delay.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.590
The effect is that you get a quick
preview of the image before you start

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.020
reading about it.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.940
And you quickly realize you could
quickly scroll up to see that

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.850
image in full again or
down to read more.
