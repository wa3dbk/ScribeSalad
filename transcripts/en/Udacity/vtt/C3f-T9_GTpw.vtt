00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's talk about inaccurate robot motion.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We are again given 5 grid cells.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Let's assume a robot executes its action with high probability correctly, say 0.8,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but with 0.1 chance it finds itself short of the intended action,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and yet another 0.1 probability it finds itself overshooting its target.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You can define the same for other U values. Say U = 1.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Then with 0.8 chance it would end up over here,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
0.1 it stays in the same element,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and 0.1 it hops 2 elements ahead.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Now this is a model of inaccurate robot motion.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This robot attempts to go U grid cells,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
but occasionally falls short of its goal or overshoots.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It's a more common case - robots as they move accrue uncertainty,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and it's really important to model this, because this is the primary reason

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
why localization is hard, because robots are not very accurate

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We're now going to look into this first from the mathematical side.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I will be giving you a prior distribution,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and we're going to be using the value of U = 2,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and for the motion model that shifts the robot exactly 2 steps,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
we believe there is a 0.8 chance.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We assign a 0.1 to the cases where the robot over or under shoots by exactly 1.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
That's kind of written by this formula over here where the two gets a 0.8 probability,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
the 1 and the 3 end up with a 0.1 probability.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I'm going to ask you now for the initial distribution that I'm writing up here,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.357
can you give me the distribution after the motion?
