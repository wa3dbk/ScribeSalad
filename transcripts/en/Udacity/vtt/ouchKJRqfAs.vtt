00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, the interesting thing about this problem is you have a choice.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Depending on whether you add c or e to the open list first and the first step.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So, you take d out the open list, you add c and e, or you add e and c.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If you do it in this order, then what happens next is you proceed to the end, and when you hit

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the dead end, then you reverse and fill in things in the other end.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You may get a out of 7th and g out of the 5th as one possibility, in which case you have 12.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
But that's not the only possibility--you could have also, after you put d off the list, add e and then c

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
because you don't know whether the neighbors are going to be considered, and that'll cost you

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
to actually expand things in the opposite direction--so if you'd done this way,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
then g would be expanded 7th and a to 5th but you'll still get 12.
