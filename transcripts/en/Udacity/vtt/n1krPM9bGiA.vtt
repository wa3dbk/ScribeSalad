00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.300
So, I hope you're starting to see the pattern. We have i and then i squared

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.998
equals negative 1, i cubed equals negative i, and i to the 4th equals positive

00:00:08.998 --> 00:00:14.862
1. I to the 5th equals i, so we start back over. Then i to the sixth equals

00:00:14.862 --> 00:00:19.782
negative 1, i to the seventh equals negative i, and i to the eighth equals

00:00:19.782 --> 00:00:24.980
positive 1. Taking out all the simplification, it's more clear to see the

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:32.464
pattern. We have i, negative 1, negative i, positive 1. I, negative 1, negative

00:00:32.464 --> 00:00:34.310
i, positive 1.
