00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.940
&gt;&gt; So often in the theory of computation, we analyze algorithms in

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.250
terms of their use of resources. And it's usually time and space.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.500
So like, when we talk about an algorithm running in say n

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.200
log n time, we're saying something about this, the time that it takes.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.040
So if you say that it uses n-squared space, we're talking about

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.290
the, the amount of memory that it takes up as the function

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.930
of the growth of the inputs. So what sort of resources do

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.300
you suppose might matter in the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.702
context of computational learning theory? So we're

00:00:25.702 --> 00:00:29.550
just, we're trying to select among algorithms. We want algorithms that

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.942
use their resources well. What source of resources would we analyze?

00:00:32.942 --> 00:00:36.070
If there's multiple possible answers, just fill in one of them.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.960
We'll just see if it's any of the ones on our list.
