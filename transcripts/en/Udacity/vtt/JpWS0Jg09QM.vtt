00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.300
Let's understand what exactly this shadow page table

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.130
is and what it is. In many architectures,

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.920
for example, Intel's X86 family, the CPU uses

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.970
the page table for address translation. What that means

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.760
is presented with the virtual address, The CPU

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.740
gets to what? It first looks up the TLB

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.290
to see if there is a match for

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.890
the virtual page number contained in this virtual address.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.900
If there is a match, it's a hit and it

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.970
can translate this virtual address to the physical address. If

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.140
it is a miss, CPU knows word in memory the

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.670
page table data structure is kept by the operating system. And

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.650
therefore what it does, it goes to the page table,

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.430
which is in main memory, and retrieves the specific entry

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.030
which will give it the translation from the virtual page

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.100
number to the physical page number. And once it gets that,

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.420
It'll stash it in the TLB, as well, and be able to generate the physical address

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.230
that is specified by this particular virtual address.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.510
So that's the way the CPU does the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.910
translation in many architectures. So in other words,

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.080
both the TLB and the page table are

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.560
data structures that the architecture uses for address

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.170
translation. Page table is also a data structure that

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.030
is set by the operating system for enabling the processor to

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.420
do this translation. So in other words, the hardware page table

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.450
is really the Shadow page table in the virtualized setting, if

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.730
the architecture is going to use the page table for address translation.
