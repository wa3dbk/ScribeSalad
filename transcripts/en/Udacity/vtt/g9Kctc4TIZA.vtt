00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.442
The answer is 184, you lose more than a quarter of all output levels when you

00:00:03.442 --> 00:00:08.085
gamma correct an 8 bit image. Doing so can lead to what's called banding.

00:00:08.085 --> 00:00:11.010
Especially with the lower values where you can see the different levels due to

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.621
the gaps. Here's one solution; it uses the observation that each channel

00:00:14.621 --> 00:00:19.260
computed will be either a new one, in which case you want to add it to a count.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.940
Or it's a previous one that you've already seen. That bit of code was from

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.080
Patrick Cozzi, and frankly, it was better than mine. Patrick, Mauricio, and

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.550
later on Branislav did massive amounts of work on this course's material.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.372
Thanks so much, guys. This course is at least twice as good as it would have

00:00:33.372 --> 00:00:34.970
been without their help.
