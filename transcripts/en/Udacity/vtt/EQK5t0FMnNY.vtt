00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Well it turns out all these are sort of right.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You really do need to give the answer. Well this isn't quite right. You can't guess the answer.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If you have an algorithm that just guesses the answers,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that algorithm is going to wrong some other time

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and we're not talking about the complexity of algorithms that are allowed to be wrong.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We're talking about the complexity of algorithms that have to be right.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So what about this tournament argument?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Well, in a parallel computing scenario, you actually can do something like this

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
where you have the list of numbers that you're trying to compute the max of.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
You can separate this in two lists.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Ask some group of processors to compute the answer for this half of the list

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and some other processors or group of processors to compute the answer for this half of the list

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and then you only have to do one comparison to find the max.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The number of rounds that this takes actually really is (log n).

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So this problem is solvable in (log n) time

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but not under the computation model we've been talking about.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It's a computation model where there's kind of an infinite number of processors

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
that can share information between them.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
This Θ(n) argument is actually correct and just to kind of spell it out for you,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
imagine we've got an algorithm that runs faster than Θ(n).

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So that's means it can't possibly look at every element in the list.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So whatever that algorithm has done, let's say, it's looked at a couple different elements of the list

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and it has a guess as to what the max is.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
We can make sure that this is always wrong by hiding a value

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
in one of the spots in the list that the algorithm didn't check in.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And if that number is bigger than everybody else,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
it can't have answered the question correctly without looking at it.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So that's really cool actually because finding the max of a list, we have an upper bound of Θ(n)

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and we have a lower bound of Θ(n) and they match each other.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Another algorithm that you could get matching upper and lower bound without too much work is

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
first, sorting at least under the model where we're counting

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
the number of comparisons of elements you have to do and it turns out that in fact,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
sorting under a comparison model has matching upper and lower bounds of (n log n).

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So this (n log n) that we've been having for sorting is essentially the best you can do.
