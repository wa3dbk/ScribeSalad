Collecting data and
tracking metrics can be tricky.

00:00:02.864 --> 00:00:08.029
So, here are some tips and awesome
tools for how to go about that process.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.001
First is Google Analytics.

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:12.241
It's great for getting stats on traffic.

00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:17.270
You can see demographics, user devices,
and browser types inversions.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.518
It's a bit more exploratory in nature,
but

00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:22.759
you can quickly get data on page
views and click through rates.

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:26.128
You do want to be careful because
oftentimes the data does not show

00:00:26.128 --> 00:00:27.650
unique users.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.170
Analytics can be messy, so it's good
to reproduce the numbers in two tools.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.360
Mixpanel is another great tool
to measure user activities.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.549
It's particularly great for
measuring drop off in a funnel.

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:44.206
You can build customer funnels to
determine if students drop off at step

00:00:44.206 --> 00:00:48.722
one step two, or step three of any
process or sequence of behaviors.

00:00:48.722 --> 00:00:50.900
It's also useful for
measuring retention.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.920
Now, you will need to be deliberate
about instrumenting events

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.230
that you want to track
when using the tool.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.340
This forces you to get clear about what
you want to know about your users.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.420
If you come across big differences when
using two tools like Google Analytics

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.630
and Mixpanel, you want to dig deep to
determine which value is more reliable

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.240
and what might be
driving this difference.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.740
If you're building an app,

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.140
AdMob is another excellent
tool to add to your arsenal.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.940
It offers many features,
such as flows to the application,

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.120
user exit points, and ways to
automatically maximize add revenue.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.500
If you're looking to conduct surveys,
you might use tools such as Qualtrics.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.140
They're a popular solution for MPS.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.650
You might also try SurveyMonkey or
Google forms.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.850
Once you have a user base and
feel like you have a core product,

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.770
you can optimize around smaller changes
in your website, such as layout,

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.270
headlines, button colors, and images.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.270
This is called the A/B testing and

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.370
Optimizely is one tool that
let's you do this easily.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.510
Now, A/B testing isn't the best
way to go, and certainly,

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.540
not when you're first starting out.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.490
Up next, Pete from Optimizely will
discuss why this is in more detail.
