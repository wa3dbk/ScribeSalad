00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The correct answer is the URL changes to include your text.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's take a look at that in the browser. Okay--so here we are.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We have our text in our box, and we press enter.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Ah--what happened?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Our URL changed, and you can see our parameter q--

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
which was the value of the name attribute--

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
equals Udacity--equals the text we typed in.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We can put new text in the box, hit enter,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and we see that q equals our new text. Pretty neat.
