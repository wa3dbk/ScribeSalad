00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.630
I'm going to ask you to sort of go back,
transport yourself back in time,

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.029
about 10 years back,
I guess, when you were here.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.230
And if there's anything interesting
you recall from the time that you

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.450
spent with us.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.290
&gt;&gt; I would say that what impressed
me the most was the talent of

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.890
the students that I worked with.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.270
The talent of the faculty that I
worked with, their passion for

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.170
the discipline of computer science for
information security in particular.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.760
The fact that they treated me
as a professional colleague.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.180
And really I learned as much
as I could humanly learn.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.220
Didn't sleep much during that time.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.410
I would encourage those listening
whether they're doing this full time or

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.747
part time at night,

00:00:41.747 --> 00:00:45.290
just drink deeply from the well
while you have this opportunity.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.820
And really when you're done
to understand that this

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.640
a constantly evolving space and
that you need to not stop learning.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.420
You have to continually feed your mind
with new information, new knowledge.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.640
&gt;&gt; I have advised many PhD students,

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.120
but you clearly stand out in that
one respect, the uncommon army

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.200
discipline that you brought to the
academic environment that we have here.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.055
And I thank you for coming down today
and having this conversation with us.

00:01:15.055 --> 00:01:16.825
You actually have a website, isn't it?

00:01:16.825 --> 00:01:18.875
&gt;&gt; So my personal one is gregconti.com.

00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:20.965
And actually that's a good point.

00:01:20.965 --> 00:01:24.185
It's important to have, I think,
a professional presence online,

00:01:24.185 --> 00:01:27.145
something each researcher
controls themselves.

00:01:27.145 --> 00:01:30.884
And then my professional
website is cyber.army.mil.
