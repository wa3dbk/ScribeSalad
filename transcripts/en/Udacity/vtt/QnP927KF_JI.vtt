00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.180
Okay, so here is the code for class Parent

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.980
and now I will start to define class Child.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.110
Now, I know class Child inherits from class

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.550
Parent and the way to indicate that in

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.350
Python is to say this. The syntax here

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.180
means that class Child will now inherit or reuse

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.230
everything that is publicly available in class Parent.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.050
Now, things will get really interesting when we begin

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.360
to define the init method, or the constructor

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.020
for this class. So, we know that class Child

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.740
has three variables. Last name and eye color

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.960
that are inherited from class Parent. And this

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.000
other variable called number_of_toys. So, in addition to

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.820
the key word self, I will receive those values

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.890
as arguments right here in the init function;

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.530
there they are. Now, to initialize the variables I'm

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.097
inheriting from class Parent, variables like last_name and

00:00:55.097 --> 00:00:59.600
eye_color, I will actually reuse class Parent's init method.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.380
This is how we do it.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.420
The last instance variable, number_of_toys, will be initialized next. Okay,

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.730
finally, I will add a print statement to the very beginning of the init method.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.770
All right, now that we have defined our class Child, the next thing to do is

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.780
to create an instance of this class Child.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.590
I will call it, appropriately enough, miley_cyrus. And here,

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.620
I will provide it the three necessary arguments.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.860
And then, I will print out two things.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.850
Her last name, and the number of toys.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.690
Also, so I can focus on these print statements

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.590
in my output, I will comment out the previous instance

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.560
for now. There. Let me save this file. Now, before

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.780
I run this program, I want you to think about

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.520
what the output of this program will be. So, here

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.550
is the code one more time. Here is class Parent,

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.390
and here is class Child, and here, we are creating

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.580
an instance of class Child, and we named it miley_cyrus.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.720
So, what do you think will be printed when I run

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.050
this piece of code? Enter your responses in this box.
