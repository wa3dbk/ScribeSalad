00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.710
For your window component, we're going to call that a ViewPort, and

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.370
you need to be able to use it, to display the textual content graphically. And

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.530
we're going to make some assumptions here, we're going to assume that

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.580
the ViewPort displays an inter, integer number of lines, and we're going to be,

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.350
assume that it can be resized to be any length between one and a 100 lines. And

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.260
we're going to assume that all the text in the same font, is in the same font

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.520
and has the same point size. So these are simplifying assumptions to make the,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.770
make this particular exercise, you know, small enough to fit in a lesson and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.460
also allow us to focus on just what the important issues are.
