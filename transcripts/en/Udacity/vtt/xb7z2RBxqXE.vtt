00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.580
Let's now put together all that we have discussed

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.340
and see how a requirements engineering process actually works.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.450
So, first of all, we saw that requirements engineering

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.080
consists of three main steps. Elicitation of the requirements,

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.450
in which we extract requirements from various sources. Modeling

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.880
in which we represent the requirements using one or

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.650
more notations or formal reasons and analysis, in which

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.230
we identify possible issues with our requirements and there is

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.870
actually a 4th step that we kind of mention

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.670
but not explicitly. And this is the negotiation that can

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.320
happen between the stakeholders and the developers, during which

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.400
requirements are discussed and modified until an agreement is reached.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.000
So if you want to think of this as a

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.030
process, so as a sequence of steps, we can see

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.000
that we start from elicitation. So we start by eliciting

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.450
an initial setup requirements. We negotiate and refine this set,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.820
then we model the resulting requirements. And finally, we

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.190
analyze such requirements. However, the process doesn't really stop here.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.620
Why? Well, because as a result of the analysis,

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.230
we might have to perform further elicitation. And so this

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.850
process is not really a sequential one, but rather

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.340
an iterative process. So, in practice, we continue to iterate

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.700
over these four steps gathering a better and better understanding

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.560
of the requirements at every iteration until we are happy

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.080
with the settle requirement that we gather and stop the process.
