First of is Intermodel Consistency. The analysis process may have

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.070
produce multiple diagrams, each of which we can think of as a model.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.852
These must be checked for inter-model consistency. For

00:00:11.852 --> 00:00:17.400
example, if you produce use cases, in, in the form of a use case diagram,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.490
you want to make sure that you have some representation for

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.230
the individual use cases. Possibly in terms of a communication. Or

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.030
sequence diagram, and the names would have to match up.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.970
Similarly, if you have classes that have complex behavior, you want to

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.310
make sure that you have a StateChart for those classes, and in the StateChart,

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.540
any events, actions and activities correspond to methods in the class model.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.950
And, if you, have data conditions on your StateChart.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.240
Those data conditions are going to refer to attributes. It had better be,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.650
the case that those attributes are listed in your class model diagram.
