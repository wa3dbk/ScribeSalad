00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.117
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I know a 5 year old is considered to be a child, and so is a 2 year old. A

00:00:04.117 --> 00:00:08.667
person who is 16 would be considered a teenager, and people for these last ages

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:13.447
would be considered adults. When checking to see if this is a function, I want

00:00:13.447 --> 00:00:18.324
to make sure that my inputs correspond to exactly 1 output. In each case, I only

00:00:18.324 --> 00:00:22.821
have one arrow leaving, or going away, towards the output. So yes, this is a

00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:27.462
function. And remember, just like last case with Jill and Tim, who's outputs

00:00:27.462 --> 00:00:31.669
were i, we have 5 and 2, who's outputs were both at child. We can havt two

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.443
inputs that make the same output, but we can't have two outputs from one input.

00:00:36.444 --> 00:00:41.672
For the second relation I know the color red can correspond to a strawberry or

00:00:41.672 --> 00:00:46.642
to a raspberry. Notice this input has 2 different outputs. If I say the word

00:00:46.642 --> 00:00:51.570
red, I'm not sure what output I'm talking about. I could be talking about a

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.670
strawberry or a raspberry. I don't know. So this is definitely not a function.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.222
It breaks our rule. This input has two outputs. We find the same case to be true

00:01:01.222 --> 00:01:05.566
with yellow. It could correspond to a banana or a lemon. If an input has two

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:10.136
outputs even once, then it's not a function. So we only need to stop once we see

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:11.373
that the first time.
