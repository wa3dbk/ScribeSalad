00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:03.706
5. Cull the list, removing elements that'll already been visited.

00:00:03.706 --> 00:00:05.374
How do we know if they've been visited?

00:00:05.374 --> 00:00:07.782
Well we're going to look in the D array, the depth array for each element,

00:00:07.782 --> 00:00:12.146
and we can mark the vertex 0 as already visited, because it has a depth of 0.

00:00:12.146 --> 00:00:15.461
All the rest we're going to keep, because they have depth minus 1.

00:00:15.461 --> 00:00:21.000
So what we need is an operation where we take a vector of elements and a set of trues and falses

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.179
and omit only the elements who are associated with trues.

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:26.453
What do we call this operation?
