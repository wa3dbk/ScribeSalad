00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.711
We can actually use the greatest common factor to factor expressions like this.

00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:09.367
This would be factored form. We have one factor multiplied by another factor of

00:00:09.367 --> 00:00:13.947
two terms. When we factor a number out of other numbers, we want to think about

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:18.616
what would be left, or what's remaining. For example, if we factor out 9 x

00:00:18.616 --> 00:00:23.573
squared y squared from our first term, we would be left with 5 times y. These

00:00:23.573 --> 00:00:28.745
are the left over factors remaining. This should also make sense, because if we

00:00:28.745 --> 00:00:33.327
multiply 9 x squared y squared by 5 y, we would wind up with 45 x squared y

00:00:33.327 --> 00:00:38.163
cubed. What do you think should go inside this box? What's our second term

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:39.937
inside of our parenthesis?
