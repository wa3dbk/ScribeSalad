00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.748
Let's take a second to step back and look at the steps we've gone through over

00:00:03.748 --> 00:00:08.834
the past few quizzes to move from f of x, to f inverse of x. First, we change

00:00:08.834 --> 00:00:12.250
variable names from f of x to y, just to make our manipulations a little bit

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.602
easier. Then we did something that's generally not legal when we're modifying

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:21.990
equations. We switch the positions of x and y in our equation. This is a really

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.290
important step, because it's in this step, that we're actually switching from

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.158
the original function to the inverse function. After that, we rearrange our

00:00:30.158 --> 00:00:35.315
variables once more, so that y was by itself on one side. Then since we know

00:00:35.315 --> 00:00:38.853
this is the inverse function. To make that clear, we change the name of y to f

00:00:38.853 --> 00:00:43.516
inverse of x. Showing its relationship with the original equation we started

00:00:43.516 --> 00:00:46.740
out with. I think it would be worth it to have a bit more practice finding the

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.322
inverses of functions. So let's do that, I've written three functions here for

00:00:52.322 --> 00:00:56.788
you, f of x equals x plus 1, g of x equals one fourth times x minus 9 and h of

00:00:56.788 --> 00:01:02.515
x equals x cubed. For each of these functions, I'd like you to find its

00:01:02.515 --> 00:01:06.352
inverse. If you're having trouble remembering what to do and why, then please

00:01:06.352 --> 00:01:09.463
go back and just watch the past few videos, or just review the beginning of

00:01:09.463 --> 00:01:11.499
this quiz.
