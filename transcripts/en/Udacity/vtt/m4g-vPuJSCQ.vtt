00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.118
The distance between the points is 5 times the square root of 5. Great solving

00:00:05.118 --> 00:00:09.892
if you found that one. This is a rough sketch of the points on the coordinate

00:00:09.892 --> 00:00:15.480
plane. Notice that I'm not precise, and that's okay. We're really just after

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.540
the difference in the x values, and the difference in the y values, or the

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.210
change in them. So, to find the distance between these two points, we need to

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.539
set up our right triangle. First we'll find the horizontal distance. We'll go

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:36.475
from x equals 2 to x equals negative 3. That's a distance of five units. Now if

00:00:36.475 --> 00:00:41.514
that's confusing, try thinking about it by starting at x equals negative 3. If

00:00:41.514 --> 00:00:46.211
we start at x equals negative 3 and count up to x equals 2, we will travel the

00:00:46.211 --> 00:00:51.636
five units horizontally. We want to think about the horizontal distance when

00:00:51.636 --> 00:00:56.661
traveling on a number line. Now we need to find the vertical distance. We start

00:00:56.661 --> 00:01:01.906
at y equals negative 4 which is here. And then we climb all the way up to y

00:01:01.906 --> 00:01:07.659
equals 6 here. The vertical distance between y equals negative 4 and y equals 6

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:13.910
is ten units. So we know this vertical distance is simply ten. Now that we have

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.002
the legs of our right triangle, we can solve for the distance. We'll have the

00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:22.343
change in x squared which is 5 squared. the change in y squared, which is 10

00:01:22.343 --> 00:01:27.347
squared equal to d squared, our hypotenus. We'll add the sum of the squares, to

00:01:27.347 --> 00:01:31.946
get d squared equals 125, and then, we'll square root both sides, to get 1d is

00:01:31.946 --> 00:01:39.736
equal to the square root of 25 times 5. We simplify this square root to get our

00:01:39.736 --> 00:01:45.520
final answer of 5 root 5. Again great work if you got some of that correct.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.920
Even more amazing if you got it right on your first try.
