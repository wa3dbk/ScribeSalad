00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.034
So now our equation looks just like the ones we were solving earlier. There's

00:00:04.034 --> 00:00:08.423
an exponent term only on one side and a constant on the other side. It makes

00:00:08.423 --> 00:00:12.729
sense then to use the same technique we did before. Taking the log of both

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:17.979
sides to get x by itself. Now, think about what base log we need to use to get

00:00:17.979 --> 00:00:22.285
x by itself. And then, think about if that log is something you can plug into a

00:00:22.285 --> 00:00:26.720
calculator. Once you do get an answer for x, please round to three decimal

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.030
places.
