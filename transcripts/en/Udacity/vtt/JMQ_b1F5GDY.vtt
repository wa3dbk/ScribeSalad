We know that there are two numbers when multiplied by themselves that equal 81.

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:09.733
We know that 9 times 9 equals 81 and we also know that negative 9 times negative

00:00:09.745 --> 00:00:14.256
9 equals 81. The way we would denote these with radical signs is different,

00:00:14.361 --> 00:00:19.315
though. We get 9, positive 9, if we just write the square root of 81 and we get

00:00:19.327 --> 00:00:23.875
negative 9 if we write negative square root 81. The principal square root is a

00:00:23.887 --> 00:00:28.435
square root that doesn't have a negative sign out in front of it, the positive

00:00:28.447 --> 00:00:32.915
square root, so the answer is 9. The principle square root of any number is a

00:00:32.927 --> 00:00:36.220
positive number, that times itself, equals that number.
