00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.970
So in lesson one, you use the pin tool
to test connectivity between your

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.700
machine and another network host.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.840
But what's ping actually doing?

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.780
There's a tool you can use to display
quite a bit of detail about network

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.990
traffic between hosts and networks.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.200
It's called TCP dump, and
that's slightly misnamed.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.710
You can actually look at any
network traffic, not just TCP.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.630
You already installed it on your
machine back in lesson one.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.590
So let's take a look at the manual for
it.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.640
Holy wow, that's a lot of options.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.400
Okay, we're going to
ignore most of these.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.430
The important part is that we need to
tell TCP Dump what traffic we want.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.690
It has its own little language for
this, called the PKep filter syntax.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.070
You can look at the pcap-filter
man page for more about it.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.970
But for now, I'll just give you a really
straightforward command to catch traffic

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.340
that's going between your host and
the host at 8.8.8.8.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.089
It's going to be sudo
tcpdump -n host 8.8.8.8.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.750
Now let's run tcpdump over here and
run ping again over here.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.120
Hey, look.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.670
Packets.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.760
Now for each ping over here.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.000
Which there are three.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.330
We see two packet records over here.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.830
Two messages appear from tcpdump,
one after the other.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.000
Each one of these records is
a description of one of the packets that

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.828
ping is sending over to that machine or
one that's coming back.

00:01:28.828 --> 00:01:35.650
See here's 8.8.8.8 and
here's the IP address of my machine,

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.700
and here it says that,
this record is an ICMP echo request,

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.980
that's a ping request, and
then coming back as an echo reply.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.740
Like a request is
the message the ping sense,

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.710
an echo reply is the one coming back,
other things agree too.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.280
For instance the ping program
tells us that ii got 64 bytes, and

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.680
sure enough there's length 64 to
exit TCPDUMP we'll type control c.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.100
You can use tcpdump to monitor
traffic for any network application.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.210
Like for instance if you wanted to see
all the DNS requests your machine sends,

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.700
you'd need to know what port DNS uses,
which is port 53 by the way, and

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.930
then you'd compose a line like this,
Sudo tcpdump -n port 53.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.360
Then if you do anything
that causes a DNS lookup,

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.430
like say pinging a machine by host name,
you'd see the DNS traffic like so.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.410
If you look closely, here's my IP
address and here's the IP address of

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.040
the DNS server that I'm using,
and since I pinged Yahoo.com,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.353
here's an A query, or A request,
question mark for query, for Yahoo.com.

00:02:42.353 --> 00:02:46.810
And then here comes back the response
on the next line, with an A response.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.650
The first ip address sent
at being 206.190.36.45.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.080
Which is the ip

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.660
address that ping is using to ping Yahoo
took a moment to try this yourself.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.640
Don't worry about all the other bits
the TCP non temperance up, but do get

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.280
a sense of where the traffic you're
looking out is coming from and going to.
