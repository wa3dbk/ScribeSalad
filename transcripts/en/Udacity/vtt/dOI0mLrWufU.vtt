00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.530
So to use an API, you generally have
to go through a couple of steps.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.460
Typically, you have to sign up for

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.370
an account with the service,
if you don't have one already.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.510
You have to register
the app you're making.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.090
And later on, in order to make requests,

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.300
there's usually some sort of
authentication process involved.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.830
In order to keep this setup simple for
now,

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.890
our Sleeping in the Library app
is going to use the Flickr API.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.480
Unlike other similar services, Flickr's
API allows us to bypass a few of

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.150
the normal set up steps, requiring
us to only sign up and register.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.520
We'll cover the parts skipped,
namely the authentication flow,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.890
later in the course.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.870
Signing up for a service like Flickr or
Yahoo is pretty straightforward, so

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.580
let's talk about registration.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.970
When you register an app, you're usually
given what's called an API key and

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.660
sometimes additional keys as well.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.250
That are used to uniquely
identify your app.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.140
The reason for a service to want to
uniquely identify your app is so

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.330
that they can detect requests
coming from your app and

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.230
protect against apps that
are making too many requests.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.980
This allows the service to ensure apps
don't do harmful stuff, like say,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.630
flood the network with so many
requests that their server shuts down.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.920
So you can see why these identification
keys would come in handy.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.019
So let's get started using our API.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.010
You'll want to sign up for a Yahoo
account if you don't have one already.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.470
I know this part may be
a little bit annoying, but

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.260
trust me this does
make our lives simpler.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.630
Click create an app,
then you'll want to get your API key.

00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:21.135
You want to click non-commercial, since
we don't plan on making any money off on

00:01:21.135 --> 00:01:23.525
pictures of people
sleeping in the library.

00:01:23.525 --> 00:01:26.115
You'll then fill out these two fields,
and upon submitting,

00:01:26.115 --> 00:01:28.535
you'll receive a key and secret.

00:01:28.535 --> 00:01:31.005
I'm going to call this
Sleeping in the library.

00:01:38.293 --> 00:01:40.940
Copy these two values and
paste them somewhere safe.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:41.620
You'll need them soon.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.540
Lastly, you'll want
to take some time and

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.900
look around
the Flickr API Documentation.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.880
This will give you an idea of some
of the methods that you could

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.680
potentially use.
