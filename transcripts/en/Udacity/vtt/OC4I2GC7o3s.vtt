00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.620
These kinds of effects get more interesting when your

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.730
source material is a set of moving pictures.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.050
The effects that we're doing on single images can be done in

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.270
real time while showing a movie.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.320
Let's begin with a simple HTML page containing a video that we want to

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.130
use with the canvas.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.480
We can see that it has a very empty script tag.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.320
Our video can be any given size, so hard coating dimensions is not optimal.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.230
Luckily for us, the video tag has a loaded metadata event that we can

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.618
subscribe to and set the width and the height.

00:00:34.618 --> 00:00:36.420
Like loaded metadata,

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.960
the play event tells us when the user has started playing the video.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.030
If the video isn't paused or ended, it's going to execute this draw function,

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.090
which tells it to draw the image to the canvas.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.680
Before we refresh this page, let's see if you can predict what happens.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.900
What will this code do?

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.230
It shows the video in sync with the source video.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.580
Or does it show a single frame of the video?
