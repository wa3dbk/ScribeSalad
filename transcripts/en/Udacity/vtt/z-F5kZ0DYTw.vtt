00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.906
The answer is this one, y equals 3 to negative x. First of all, we can to tell

00:00:05.906 --> 00:00:09.749
that the graph, this one right here, looks just like the one for 1 3rd to the

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:16.059
x. It's the only one on this coordinate plane that's showing exponential decay.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.713
We can also see why this equation is equivalent to the one for f of x from

00:00:19.713 --> 00:00:26.963
algebra. 3 to the negative x is equal to 3 to the negative 1 to the x. 3 to the

00:00:26.963 --> 00:00:33.874
negative 1 is just equal to 1 3rd. So the equations and the graphs for these

00:00:33.874 --> 00:00:38.571
two functions are one and the same. They're the same function.
