00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
And there's 2 correct answers here.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.080
The first one is that the size of this huge Boolean formula here

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.910
is polynomial in n, and I will show you why.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.350
First of all, how large is each one of these formulas that we're building?

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.100
Well, there's a constant number of variables

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.300
and as I showed you before,

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.720
if you want to ensure that for a constant number of variables,

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.960
only exactly one of them

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.510
can be set to true,

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.390
then the resulting formula

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.830
is about the square of the number of variables that you have

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.930
and since we have a constant number of variables,

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.010
each formula here is about the size of the square of that constant,

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.170
so we have--

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.080
it's kind of O of c squared, and c does not depend on the size of the inputs,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.860
so in a way, we can even write this as O of 1.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.870
Now we have a polynomial number

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.100
of these Boolean formulas,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.740
so we have a polynomial n times the constant;

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.690
this is again a polynomial of n,

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.040
so we're fine on this side here.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.150
We're also fine on this side here, because the formulas again are

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.300
of constant size;

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.300
it can, of course, be a huge size,

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.070
especially if you have a system that can carry very large variables,

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.120
but nevertheless, it's a constant size,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.370
and that's all we care about; it does not depend on the size of the input,

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.420
and we have a polynomial number of them again here.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.550
And finally, the code also has a constant number of lines,

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.010
and so the Boolean formula resulting from that

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.550
will also have constant size,

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.760
so overall, this huge formula here

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.880
has a size that is polynomial in n.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.530
Does this formula have only one satisfying assignment?

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.640
No, it doesn't; it has a huge number of satisfying assignments,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.030
but each of those satisfying assginments

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.460
will ensure that exactly one of the variables here is set to true and so on,

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.950
and this gives us the third property,

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.800
which means that this satisfying assignment

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.920
defines a snapshot, because it will tell you exactly what's in this memory cell here

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.180
and so on.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.780
It will tell you exactly where the program is at

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.430
and it will also tell you exactly

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.460
what's here in this memory.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.180
And once we have this,

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.680
you have actually completed the most difficult step of this unit

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.290
in my mind,

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.670
and we are now ready to show that

00:02:20.670 --> 99:59:59.000
sat is np complete.
