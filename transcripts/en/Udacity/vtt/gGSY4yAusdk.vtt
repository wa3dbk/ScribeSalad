00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.180
So now that we know about ord and we know

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.880
about modulo, we're ready to define a hash function. So

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.380
let's remember what our hash function should do. So the

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.290
hash function takes two inputs. It takes the keyword, and it

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.000
takes the number of buckets. And it's outputting a number

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.612
between 0 and buckets minus 1, that gives us the

00:00:17.612 --> 00:00:22.310
position where that string belongs. And we've seen the function

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.631
ord that takes a one letter string and maps that to

00:00:25.631 --> 00:00:28.940
a number. And we've seen the modulus operator that takes

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.790
a number and a modulus and produces, as a result, the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.680
remainder that we'd get when we divide that number by

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.060
the modulus. So now, we can use those to define a

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.600
hash function. I'm going to start by giving you a really

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.254
bad hash function. So let's define a procedure, and we'll call

00:00:44.254 --> 00:00:47.818
it bad_hash_string to make sure we remember that it's really

00:00:47.818 --> 00:00:50.731
bad. And it takes as inputs the keyword and the number

00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:54.357
of buckets. And we're going to output the bucket based

00:00:54.357 --> 00:00:57.543
on the first letter in the keyword. So we'll

00:00:57.543 --> 00:01:00.279
use ord on the first letter, and we'll use

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:04.150
modulo the number of buckets. And that's our simple

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.400
hash function. For the quiz, I want you to

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.097
answer all the reasons why that's bad. And remember

00:01:10.097 --> 00:01:13.090
what bad_hash_string does is take the first letter in

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.780
the keyword, turn it into a number using ord,

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.870
and then find that value modulo the number of buckets.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.860
Here are the possible reasons, check all the reasons that apply.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.320
The first is it takes too long to compute. The

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.320
second is there's at least one input keyword for which bad_hash_string

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.930
will produce an error. The third is, if the keywords

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.840
are distributed like words in English, then some of the buckets

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.560
will get too many words; others will get too few. And

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.240
the fourth choice, if the number of buckets is large then

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.660
there's some buckets that will never get any keywords.
