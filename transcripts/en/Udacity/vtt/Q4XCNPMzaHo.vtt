Because strings are comparable, we can sort them by writing one line of code.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.736
If I create an array list of strings and add a whole bunch of things not in any

00:00:07.736 --> 00:00:11.332
order, and then I want to print them out in alphabetical order, I can add the

00:00:11.332 --> 00:00:17.836
line collections.sort strings. Collections is a class a little bit like a race

00:00:17.836 --> 00:00:23.255
that has some useful utility methods. If I compile and run this code, it will

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:28.556
print out all of the animals that I added to the list, but from A to W. We

00:00:28.556 --> 00:00:31.670
might want to be able to sort countries like this too. Let's say countries are

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.275
naturally ordered by their areas. Let's implement the compareTo method for

00:00:36.275 --> 00:00:39.968
countries. I want to be able to make an array of countries like this, and then

00:00:39.968 --> 00:00:43.208
use the sort method in the arrays class to sort all of the countries in the

00:00:43.208 --> 00:00:48.487
array, so that this will work. Let's implement the comparable method for

00:00:48.487 --> 00:00:54.220
countries. We'll need to make the country measurable and also comparable. Now

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.243
the method should be public and return an int. It's called compareTo, and it

00:00:58.243 --> 00:01:02.970
takes an object, otherObject. Now if we want to compare otherObject to this

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.270
object, the first thing we'll need to do is check whether otherObject actually

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.662
has a name and an area. If otherObject is not a country, then it doesn't really

00:01:10.662 --> 00:01:15.292
make sense to compare it to this country. If you keep studying Java, you'll

00:01:15.292 --> 00:01:19.487
figure out how to avoid this cast using generics. For now though, let's focus

00:01:19.487 --> 00:01:23.243
on the compareTo method. For now, fill in the code, so that compareTo works as

00:01:23.243 --> 00:01:28.078
I described before for countries. Return a negative number if this country is

00:01:28.078 --> 00:01:31.500
smaller than other, positive is this country is larger, zero if the two

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.121
countries are equal. And notice, I implemented .equals for you. So, you can use

00:01:38.121 --> 00:01:41.936
this. And if the countries are exactly the same size, you can break ties using

00:01:41.936 --> 00:01:46.313
the name. Can you fill in the rest for me?
