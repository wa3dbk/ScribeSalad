00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In Kalman filter land, we're going to build a 2-dimensional estimate.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
1 for the location, and 1 for the velocity denoted x dot.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The velocity can be zero. It can be negative, or it can be positive.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
If initially I know my location, but not my velocity,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
then I represent it with a Gaussian that's elevated around the correct location,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but really, really broad in the space of velocities.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Let's look at the prediction step.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
In the prediction step, I don't know my velocity,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
so I can't possibly predict for location. I'm going to assume.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
But miraculously, there'll be some interesting correlation.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So let's for a second, just pick a point on this distribution over here.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Let me assume my velocity is 0.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Of course, in practice, I don't know the velocity,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
but let me assume for a moment the velocity is 0.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Where would my posterior be after the prediction?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Well, we know we started in location 1.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The velocity is 0, so my location would likely be here.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Now let's change my belief in velocity and pick a different one.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Let's say the velocity is 1.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Where would my prediction be 1 time step later starting at location 1 and velocity 1?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I'll give you 3 choices.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Here? Here? Or here?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.794
Please pick the one that makes the most sense.
