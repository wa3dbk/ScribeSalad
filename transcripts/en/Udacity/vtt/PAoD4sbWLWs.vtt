00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.350
So here's what we have for compounding twice a year with Grant's situation.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.424
This of course is just an example and these numbers could be different

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:11.990
depending on how his account was set up. However, numbers have played their

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.032
roles as I've written in here. This number is his principle, the amount he

00:00:16.032 --> 00:00:21.504
first invested. Here goes the interest rate divided by 2, And the exponent is

00:00:21.504 --> 00:00:27.300
the number of years that have passed multiplied by 2. Now we always like

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.350
generalizations so let's see if we can apply one here. I think we're going to

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.200
need some variable names however. Let's call our principal P. r will be our

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.766
annual interest rate written as a decimal. T will be the number of years that

00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:48.543
have passed since the account opened. N will be the number of times interest is

00:00:48.543 --> 00:00:54.636
compounded per year. This was two in our example up here. And A will be the

00:00:54.636 --> 00:00:58.997
total amount of money in the account. I'd like you to use these quantities we

00:00:58.997 --> 00:01:04.438
just came up with to create a general equation for A. The total amount of money

00:01:04.438 --> 00:01:10.050
in the account. Just fill in the proper letters in these different slots.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.266
Remember you can use this formula as a guideline for figuring out what goes

00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:16.030
where here.
