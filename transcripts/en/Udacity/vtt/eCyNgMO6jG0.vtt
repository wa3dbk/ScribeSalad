That does it for optionals.

00:00:01.862 --> 00:00:05.596
As you can see, by making the use
of nill values more explicit,

00:00:05.596 --> 00:00:08.910
optionals can lead to safer and
cleaner code.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.520
Mastering them now is well
worth your while, and

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.310
sure to cut down on
debugging in the future.
