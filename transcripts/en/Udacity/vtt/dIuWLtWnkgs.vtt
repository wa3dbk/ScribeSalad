00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.210
Inserting a new node is
where the magic happens.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.520
There are several different
states of the tree and

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.100
the node you're inserting that
require different courses of action.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.390
Remember that your resulting tree needs
to follow both the red-black tree and

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.130
BST rules.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.920
There's a lot of information here.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.285
Your first goal should be to watch and
get a sense of how red-black trees work.

00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:25.750
You can rewatch the video later
to actually memorize the details.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.860
One overall rule of insertion is that
you should try to insert a node as a red

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.490
node, which from here on out
I'll represent as both red and

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.580
square to help with differentiation,
and then change its color as needed.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.400
The first situation is when you're
inserting the first node into the tree.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.839
Since it's the root, you can change
the color to black if you're adhering to

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.850
the root must be black rule.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.200
Otherwise you'll have nothing to do.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.870
If the new parent node is black,
you don't need to do any work.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.400
Since you're adding a red node,
you haven't upset the balance

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.330
of black nodes in any path or
violated any of the other rules.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.190
Now if the parent is red,

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.560
there are several cases with
more complicated solutions.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.740
If the parent and

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.839
its sibling are both red,
then they should be changed to black.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.990
And their parent, the grandparent,

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.429
let's say, of the node you're inserting,
becomes red.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.740
We switch the node colors in this
way to maintain the number of

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.700
black nodes in a given path.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.690
Look through all the paths in this tree.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.149
The number of black nodes
in each path is still two.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.600
The biggest problem here is that
we could have violated another

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.470
property by changing the grandparent.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.121
We can just treat the grandparent as
a newly inserted node and change it or

00:01:40.121 --> 00:01:43.565
its ancestors according to
the same cases and rules.

00:01:43.565 --> 00:01:45.250
Here we just treat it like Case 1 and

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.290
change it back to black since we
still want the route to be black.
