But what about the sugar I have left over? I've only used 3/4 of a cup and 3/4

00:00:04.909 --> 00:00:09.596
of a cup. I still have 1/4 and 1/4 that I can still use to make more brownies.

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:14.700
1/4 and 1/4 is really 2/4, so I still have 2/4 of a cup of sugar that I can use

00:00:14.712 --> 00:00:19.815
to make brownies. This is the 2/4. So, this 2/4 cup of sugar represents what

00:00:19.827 --> 00:00:23.650
fraction of the batch of brownies? You can enter your answer here.
