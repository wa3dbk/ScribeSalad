00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.325
Ready to change some classes?

00:00:02.325 --> 00:00:05.620
There's an element in the DOM with the class featured that I want you to change.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.730
An element that's featured sort of has a bluish color background.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.850
Can you use the .toggleClass method to remove the featured background from

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.218
Article number 2?

00:00:17.218 --> 00:00:20.780
Check out the documentation for toggleClass and give it a shot.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.980
Before we start, let's see what the page looks like before we toggle the class.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.180
I've gone ahead and hit Test Run, and I'll scroll down.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.880
We can see that Article 2 has this blue background.
