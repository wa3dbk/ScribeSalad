00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.270
So now that we have seen
what the TLB size should be,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.410
let's see if we understood it well.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:11.300
Suppose we have a processor with a 32
kB cache and a 64 byte block size.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.030
Suppose we also have virtual to physical
address translation for a 4kB page size.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.705
The question for you is, how many
TLB entries do we need if we want to

00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:25.393
have similar miss rates in
this cache and in our TLB?

00:00:25.393 --> 00:00:31.842
The choices you have are 8 to
512 entries, 64 to 32,000,

00:00:31.842 --> 00:00:36.999
fewer than 64 entries, or
more than 256 entries.

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:38.220
Choose the best answer here.
