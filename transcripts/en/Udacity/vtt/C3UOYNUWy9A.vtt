00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.088
The topic of aggression is of great importance in our lives. In fact, there's

00:00:04.088 --> 00:00:08.220
not way around it that we experience aggression in our lives. And other animals

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.724
engage in aggressive behavior to get the resources that they want. So, we can

00:00:12.724 --> 00:00:16.610
define aggression as violent behavior that is intended to cause psychological

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.080
or physical harm, or both, to another individual or being. Now, why are we

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.683
aggressive? Chances are, we're often aggressive because we've been provoked.

00:00:26.683 --> 00:00:29.966
And we engage in aggressive behavior because we've been provoked by feelings of

00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:34.743
anger. We call that hostile aggression. I'll be honest with you and then share

00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:37.495
an experience of hostile aggression that I had last week when I was walking at

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:42.467
the campus. I was crossing the street and I had the walk sign. And another car

00:00:42.467 --> 00:00:46.612
came around and almost hit me. Now as a frequent pedestrian, this was not the

00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:51.016
first time it almost happened to me, but I was very upset. And I started to

00:00:51.016 --> 00:00:54.190
yell at the driver, and I had a few choice words to say to him. Now my

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.180
hostility was limited in anger to yelling at the person. But in some cases, we

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.755
see people, maybe more aggressive, and try to hit the person or chase after the

00:01:02.755 --> 00:01:07.900
car. In fact, the term road rage has been developed to explain such hostility

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.270
the driver sometimes experience.
