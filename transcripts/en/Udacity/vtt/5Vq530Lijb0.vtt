00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.500
Okay, let's talk about Tabular Data. You're

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.530
probably familiar with spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Office's

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.480
Excel, or Calc from Apache OpenOffice, or

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.090
even Google Spreadsheets. So with any one of

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.059
these applications. We can create tabular data

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.170
in the form of spreadsheet. So I'm a

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.060
big Beatles' fan, indulge me as we begin

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.070
a little data wrangling with some discography data.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.460
After all, I'm sure even space cowboys

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.380
will be listening to Beatles' someday. Okay,

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.800
so as data scientist were usually concern

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.910
with what items a dataset contains and what

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.860
fields. Those items have. As I'm sure

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.430
you're aware, with tabular data, each row represents

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.324
a data item. And, an individual item can have one or more fields. The columns

00:00:51.324 --> 00:00:57.610
each represent a different field. And in most tabular data, the very first row

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.010
will actually label those fields in some

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.440
way. Finally, we have an individual cell

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.700
that contains a value for a particular field. In this case the label for

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.340
this particular album is capital records in Canada. Okay so just to look at that

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:24.390
again in a more abstract sense. Each row is an item in our data set. Each column

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.080
makes up the fields for the data items. And finally, individual values for a

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.060
field are stored in cells. In the videos

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.560
that follow, we'll quickly get our hands study

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.520
working with tabular data in the CSV and

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.690
Excel data formats in the Python programming language.
