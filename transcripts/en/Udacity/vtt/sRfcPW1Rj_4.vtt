00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.110
So I hope everyone understands the main idea behind the hash

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.660
table now. Our goal is to map a keyword and a

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.120
number of buckets. Using our hash-string function to a particular bucket

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.410
and that bucket will contain all of the keywords that map to

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.040
that location. So now what we're going to do is try to

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.980
actually write the code to do this. We're going to start from

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.460
our index that we wrote for the previous unit, but try

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.960
to figure out how to implement that with a hash table instead.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.500
So the first question is, how is this going to change our data structure? So

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.860
this was what we had before, if you remember we had our index was a list

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.280
of keywords, we had a list of entries, and each entry was a pair,

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.650
which was a keyword. And the second element of the pair was the list of

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.580
the URLs where that word appears, and we would have each word in the index

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.760
as its own entry with its own list of URLs. So

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.150
this was the data structure that we used last class. Now

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.370
we want to change things to implement a hash table. So,

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.700
I want you to think about what data structure we'll use

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.770
and we'll make that a quiz to decide a good data

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.820
structure to use to implement the hash table. So the question

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.950
is which of these data structures would make most sense to

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.060
implement the hash table index? The first choice is a list.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.780
Where the elements in the list are. A list where the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.930
first element is a word and the second element is a

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.860
list of URLs where that word appears. The second choice is

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.800
a list where each element in a list is the list itself

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.300
where the first element is a word and the second element

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.270
is a list of lists where each element in that list

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.250
is a list of URLs. So, the third choice is a

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.600
list. Where each element is a list. Where the element lists themselves

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.270
contain lists. Where the element lists of the element

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.480
list are a list of the word, all by

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.390
a list of all the URLs for that word.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.960
So, we have three nested lists for choice three.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.120
For choice four, we have a list where each

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.440
element in the list is a list. Where within

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.550
the element list, there is another list, which is

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.930
a list of words, followed by a list of URLs.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.710
And for the final choice, we also have three nest of lists, where each element

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.670
is a list, where the elements of that list are a list, that are word

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.550
followed by a list. Where each element in that list is a list of urls.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.436
So which one of these would be the best structure to implement a hash table?
