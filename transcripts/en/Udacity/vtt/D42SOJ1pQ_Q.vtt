When I need to build something using
materials I shouldn't be breathing in,

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.939
I naturally put on a dust mask and
safety goggles.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.370
Just like that, our tools can save
us web developers from disaster.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.170
Now, of course, you won't accidentally
amputate a finger from bad JavaScript,

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.680
but you can make any of countless
mistakes that can result in your

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.369
site being unusable for a lot of users.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:21.800
Here's the thing.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.690
Tools aren't perfect either, but

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.420
their never tired, never lack
concentration, and don't have an ego.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.980
By utilizing your build and
editor tools,

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.299
you can quite heavily improve
the quality output of your coding.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.090
Let's talk about the numerous
ways to get there.
