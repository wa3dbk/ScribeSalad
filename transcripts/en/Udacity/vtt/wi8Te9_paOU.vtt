00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.890
So far we've described the address translation process like this.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.170
The offset from the virtual address, simply gets copied to

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.970
the physical address. And in order to translate the virtual

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.090
page number, we do a look up in the page table,

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.420
which is in memory, to find the physical page frame.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.310
Now you may be asking yourself, won't going to memory, for

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.450
the page table every time we access a memory address

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.380
be slow? In fact, we'll have to go multiple times for

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.450
our hierarchical page table. Well indeed it would

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.610
be. Thankfully the page tables themselves may end up

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.200
in our cache, which can help considerably. But

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.180
architects have also created a special purpose cache for

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.230
storing page table entries, called the table lookaside

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.880
buffer. Or TLB for short. Instead of going through

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.680
these slower traditional memory mechanisms, we're taking a special

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.610
shortcut. Whereas the caches we talked about earlier are

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.830
usually indexed by physical address, the TLB is indexed

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.310
by virtual address. After all, its job is to

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.910
translate virtual page numbers to physical ones. This is

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.770
extra tricky, because one virtual page number may be mapped

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.210
to a physical address in one process, but it

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.980
might be invalid in another or mapped to different

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.160
location. There are two ways to handle this problem.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.050
Some systems simply flush the TLB, on every context switch.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.540
That is, every time the address space switches. This is

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.800
a main reason that context switches are considered so costly. Alternatively,

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.468
the TLB can use an address space identifier field in the

00:01:26.468 --> 00:01:29.194
table, to make sure that the translation in the table is

00:01:29.194 --> 00:01:32.080
meant for use in the current context. I should point out,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.300
too, that the kernel sometimes get's special treatment in the TLB.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.390
Because the kernel addresses our constant across processes, there is no

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.670
need to flush them from the TLB on a context switch.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.680
Sometimes, too, part of the TLB is reserved for kernel addresses.
