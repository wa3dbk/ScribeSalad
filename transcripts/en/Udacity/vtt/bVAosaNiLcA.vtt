So we mentioned that a mobile user persona is

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.180
different than a web or desktop user persona. So I

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.960
think that a lot you might have started out

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.960
in web or desktop, so maybe we should start there.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah, what are the attributes of this web or desktop persona?

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.370
&gt;&gt; Well the first thing is that there always going to be plugged into power.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.050
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.620
&gt;&gt; They generally have a constant internet

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.170
connection that's usually fast. And generally they

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.390
have a pretty big screen. And they have some sort of physical keyboard and a

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.930
mouse or touch pen. And they're seated with their

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.930
full attention usually on their laptop or their desktop.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.123
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is so different then

00:00:33.123 --> 00:00:35.636
a mobile user because unlike mobile for web and

00:00:35.636 --> 00:00:38.610
desktop applications. Let's say, you're writing a document or

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.520
you're working on a presentation, chances are. You're fully

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.490
immersed in the content that you're creating on

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.290
your machine. And another difference, actually, between web, and

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.360
desktop apps, and mobile apps. Is that when you

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.800
close a desktop app, they tend to go away.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.000
Like you close a tab on your browser, but mobile

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.030
apps tend to run in the background quite a bit.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.770
They're sensing your location, they've all kinds of sensors that

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.260
are providing input. And applications are doing something within the background
