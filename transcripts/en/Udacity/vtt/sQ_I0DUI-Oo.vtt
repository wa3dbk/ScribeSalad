00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.772
Here's another function for us to consider. This time, we have f of x equals x

00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:12.532
times x minus 2 times x minus 2 times x minus 1 times x minus 1. Well, this is

00:00:12.532 --> 00:00:18.900
interesting. We have some repeated factors here. So far, we've only seen

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.876
polynomial functions. That have unique zeros or all factors with different

00:00:22.876 --> 00:00:27.582
zeros associated with them. In the past when we were looking at these functions

00:00:27.582 --> 00:00:30.693
with unique zeros the number of zeros was always equal to the degree of the

00:00:30.693 --> 00:00:35.448
polynomial. I wonder if that's the case if we have some zeros that are repeated

00:00:35.448 --> 00:00:39.871
instead? Let's use this function to check that out. What I'd like you to do to

00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:43.591
analyse this function then is to enter the x value of each of its zeros and

00:00:43.591 --> 00:00:47.559
then tell me how many times each of those factors associated with those zeros

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:54.114
occur in the equation for the function. So if you said that one of the zeros

00:00:54.114 --> 00:00:57.831
was four for example, and you saw the factor x minus 4 three times in this

00:00:57.831 --> 00:01:03.935
equation, you would write a three right here. Lastly, I'd like you to add up

00:01:03.935 --> 00:01:08.960
the total number of zeros that we have. This total number should just be the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.697
sum of all of the numbers in this repeat boxes. Think, then, about how this

00:01:13.697 --> 00:01:17.983
should relate to the total number of factors we see in this equation.
