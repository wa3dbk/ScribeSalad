00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.669
Keep in mind that there are other questions that might be asked. For example,

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:08.016
now that we know x, we can go back and find other values. We could find the

00:00:08.016 --> 00:00:10.832
speed of the boat against the current, the speed of the boat with the current,

00:00:10.832 --> 00:00:14.807
or the distance travelled. For this question, I just want you to tell me,

00:00:14.807 --> 00:00:19.960
what's the distance travelled in each direction. Type that answer in here.
