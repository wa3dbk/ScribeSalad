00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.391
If a is negative in the equation of this form, then the parabola opens downward.

00:00:04.391 --> 00:00:08.225
We saw before that the equation for the green curve was y plus 13 equals

00:00:08.225 --> 00:00:12.305
positive 3 times, times x plus 1 squared. And we can see that this is opening

00:00:12.305 --> 00:00:16.642
upward. The only thing that changed when we switched this to a negative was that

00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:20.832
the parabola now opens downward which is graph D. Except for playing the

00:00:20.832 --> 00:00:25.933
opposite direction Graph D is exactly the same as graph C. It has the same shape

00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:28.181
and it even has the same vertex.
