00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now let's ask what we expect the variance to be when we generate a couple of data points,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
say by flipping coins.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
There are 4 possibilities: 0 and 0, 1 and 0, 0 and 1, and 1 and 1.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
In each case, compute the variance and then compute the average of the variances

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
or the expected variance.
