00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.692
Adding 16 to both sides of our equation, gives us y plus 1 equals x squared

00:00:04.692 --> 00:00:09.500
minus 8x plus 16. All we need to do now is factor the right-hand side of the

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.669
equation to make sure that it fits the form we're looking for. And sure enough,

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:19.456
we can factor this to be x minus 4 squared. So, we have a final equation of y

00:00:19.456 --> 00:00:23.245
plus 1 equals the quantity x minus four squared. Awesome.
