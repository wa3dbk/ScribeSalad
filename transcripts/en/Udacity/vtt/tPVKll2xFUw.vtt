00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.278
So now let's recap. You just saw that the population standard deviation, divided

00:00:06.278 --> 00:00:11.906
by the standard deviation of the distribution of sample means, also known as the

00:00:11.906 --> 00:00:17.425
sampling distribution, is equal to the square root of the sample size. And in

00:00:17.425 --> 00:00:22.736
this case, the sample size was two, cause we rolled the tetrahedral die. Two

00:00:22.736 --> 00:00:29.160
times, so if we know this, the what is SE? The standard deviation of our

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.662
distribution of sample means. Is SE sigma, square root n, sigma squared divided

00:00:36.662 --> 00:00:41.113
by n or sigma divided by square root n.
