00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.185
To give you a slightly better understanding of the differences

00:00:03.185 --> 00:00:06.300
between black-box testing and white-box testing, I am going to provide you

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.040
a couple of simple examples that illustrate the, the strengths and

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.920
limitations of these two techniques. So, in this case, let's start

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.750
with black-box testing, so we're only working with this specification.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.540
So, let's say that our specification says that this is a

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.550
program that inputs an integer value and prints it. And implementation,

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.900
we don't know because we're working at the black box level.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.710
If we wanted to test this function according to its

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.060
specification, what we will probably do is to select a positive

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.370
integer, a negative integer, and the zero as test inputs

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.840
and see how the program behaves for these inputs. So let

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.500
me now show you a possible implementation for this specification.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.590
What I'm showing here is this function that we called print

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.010
NumBytes, which takes the parameter and prints it. And one thing

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.905
that we notice right away is that, although in the specification,

00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:53.960
numbers that are less than 1024 and numbers that

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.320
are greater or equal to 1024 are exactly equivalent from

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.020
the specification standpoint. They're however treated differently in the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.140
code, so the developer decided that the program was just

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.200
going to print the value of the parameter if it's

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.300
less than 1024. But it was actually divided by 1024

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.560
and printing it with a kilobyte mark after it

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.170
if you are greater than 1024. And notice that here,

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.370
there is a problem. The developer, just a number 124, instead

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.840
of 1024. So there's probably a typo in this point in the

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.260
code. So this is a case in which by simply doing black-box

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.750
testing, so by simply looking at the specific issue, we might miss

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.510
this problem. Because we have no reason to consider numbers that are

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.780
less than 1024 or greater than 1024. However if we were to

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.010
look at the code, so operating at white-box manner, we will right

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.340
away see that we need to have a test case that checks

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.880
the program when the parameter is greater than 1024. And we will find

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.300
the problem right away. So now let me show you a dual example.
