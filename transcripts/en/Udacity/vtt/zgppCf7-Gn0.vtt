00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.420
So, before going any further,
think about what we've done thus far.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.250
We've set everything up in our
environment to give us location

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.340
services.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.850
And in our main activity,
we've created a connection to them and

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.600
instructed the API to call back to
this activity when it connects,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.600
as well as when the connection fails.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.140
We don't yet
have enough code to run the application.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.630
There are several overrides
that we have to add

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.100
because of the interfaces we specified.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.330
Let's take a look at these next.
