Research has shown that this process
is subject to at least three

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.930
common sources of error,
an incomplete knowledge base.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.530
The physician can't know everything
given the rapidly increasing store house

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.255
of medical research and knowledge.

00:00:14.255 --> 00:00:17.490
And error in perception or judgement.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.050
Physicians are still human and
are subject to human error.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.760
And a lapse an attention.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.130
Physicians are also very busy and
may not sufficiently focus on each case.
