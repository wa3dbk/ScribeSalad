00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.680
One of the exciting results,
if FHIR were widely adopted,

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.720
is that it could constitute
a universal health app platform.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.120
Developers could then use that platform
to help solve some of the limitations

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.240
of current EHR systems we'll
discuss in lesson six.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.760
They can also provide innovative tools
for patients, the topic of lesson seven.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.850
In fact, such a platform already exists.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.450
Harvard's Boston Children's Hospital
received federal funding

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.960
to develop a universal health
app platform called SMART.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.900
The lasted version, SMART on FHIR,
is based on the new standard and

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.980
you can visit the app gallery
on their website using the link

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.520
provided in the instructor's notes to
see examples of SMART on FHIR apps.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.420
These could be plugged directly into
any EHR that supports the platform.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.481
I'll interview the chief
architect of the platform, Dr.

00:00:57.481 --> 00:01:00.510
Josh Mandel at the end of lesson 5B.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.050
HIMSS is the largest health
IT meeting in the world.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.490
At the last two HIMSS meetings,
he demonstrated multiple EHRs

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.300
running the same third-party
apps using this approach.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.620
Cerner and Epic, the two largest
enterprise healthcare software

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.879
companies, have announced FHIR support.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.100
We believe it may not be long
before your most promising ideas

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.820
could plug into actual
electronic record systems.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.870
You could then validate your team's
approach with real practicing

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.730
physicians, other clinical personnel,
and their patients.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.230
Finally, it is also entirely possible
that FHIR will be further developed

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.360
to solve the analytic challenges,

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.530
we'll be discussing in
the lessons eight through ten
