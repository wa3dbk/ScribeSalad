00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.882
This is the equation in vertex form, and the vertex is at 2, 1. Good thinking

00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:10.484
if you found these two. Now, this one was pretty tough, especially since we had

00:00:10.484 --> 00:00:15.448
a negative 3 here. Let's work through it together. Our goal is to get a perfect

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:21.136
square so that way we can put this equation in vertex form. So we're going to

00:00:21.136 --> 00:00:25.662
try and complete the square by adding some amount to our polynomial. I can't

00:00:25.662 --> 00:00:29.568
quite complete the square yet, since I have a factor of negative 3 in front of

00:00:29.568 --> 00:00:35.850
the x squared. We want this coefficient to be a one. This means that we can

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.810
factor a negative 3 from these two terms, leaving us with negative 3 times x

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.180
squared minus 4x. We can quickly check to make sure that if we distribute, we

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.190
would get back with what we started with. We'd have a negative 3x squared here

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.845
and negative 3 times negative 4x which is positive 12x. Now we're ready to

00:00:56.845 --> 00:01:01.349
complete the square. The b term is negative 4, so b divided by 2 equals

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:09.480
negative 2. And b divided by 2 squared equals 4. We simply square this number.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.070
So, we need to add 4 in order to complete the square for this trinomial. But we

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:22.338
didn't just add 4 here, we really added negative 12, 4 times negative 3. Again,

00:01:22.338 --> 00:01:25.314
think about the, shooting this negative 3 to each of the three terms, and we

00:01:25.314 --> 00:01:29.967
would wind up with this expression. Now we can't just go adding numbers to

00:01:29.967 --> 00:01:35.860
equations and changing them at random. Instead we need to keep things balanced.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.869
If we subtract 12 from an equation then that means we need to add 12 to the

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.686
equation as well. This makes the equation balance. It makes it so that way it's

00:01:44.686 --> 00:01:50.560
not changed. We know this since that negative 12 and positive 12 sum to 0. So

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.340
we're just changing what this equation looks like, but it's really the same

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.350
exact equation. Now that we're here we're ready to write our perfect square.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.332
The perfect square for this trinomial is x negative 2. If we square this

00:02:05.332 --> 00:02:09.351
amount, we'll get this expression. Our negative 3 stays in front as the

00:02:09.351 --> 00:02:14.918
coefficient, and then we have negative 11 plus 12 on the end. If we combine the

00:02:14.918 --> 00:02:19.226
like terms on the end, we get a positive 1 here. This gives us our equation in

00:02:19.226 --> 00:02:25.384
vertex form. And finally, for the vertex, we have an h value of positive 2. And

00:02:25.384 --> 00:02:30.052
a k value of positive 1. Setting the binomial equal to 0 gives us the x

00:02:30.052 --> 00:02:35.451
coordinate of our vertex. And the k value, or the y coordinate of our vertex,

00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:37.723
is just positive 1.
