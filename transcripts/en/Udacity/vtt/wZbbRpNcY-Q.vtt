00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.420
So, to calculate how many pixels we need per second, we take the horizontal

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.439
resolution, 1920, multiply it by 1200 and multiply that by 60. The answer is

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:17.514
138,240,000 pixels. By the way, the word pixel is short for the phrase, pixel

00:00:17.514 --> 00:00:21.804
element. Note that this value is the minimum number of pixels to compute. This

00:00:21.804 --> 00:00:25.444
huge number helps explain why all computers may nowadays, have some sort of 3D

00:00:25.444 --> 00:00:29.024
graphics acceleration hardware inside them. This can take the form of a $2

00:00:29.024 --> 00:00:32.735
integrated chip on up to two or more graphics cards, each costing hundreds or

00:00:32.735 --> 00:00:34.073
even thousands of dollars.
