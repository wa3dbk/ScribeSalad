00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.689
We could also solve this problem by setting up a proportion. We can compare the

00:00:04.702 --> 00:00:09.380
number of dimes and quarters in the ratio to the number of dimes and quarters in

00:00:09.392 --> 00:00:14.145
our hand. When we set two ratios equal, we get a proportion. The number of dimes

00:00:14.157 --> 00:00:18.650
in our ratio was 2. For our ratio we had 2 to 3, or 2 3rd. And in our hand, we

00:00:18.662 --> 00:00:22.785
had 10 dimes, and I didn't know the number of quarters, so I'm going to use a

00:00:22.797 --> 00:00:26.990
variable, q. Once the proportion is set up, we can solve for unknown amounts

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:31.490
using cross-multiplication. This method comes from multiplying both sides of the

00:00:31.502 --> 00:00:36.239
equation by the denominators. Notice 3 divided by 3 makes 1, so I'm left with 2

00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:41.324
q on this side. And q divided by q makes one as well, so I'm left with 3 times

00:00:41.336 --> 00:00:46.283
10 or 30 on this side. We could've gotten to this step a lot quicker, if we

00:00:46.295 --> 00:00:50.938
would have just cross multiplied 3 times 10 is 30, and q times 2 is 2 q, we

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.463
would get this equation. We want to be careful when we cross multiply. We can

00:00:55.475 --> 00:00:59.426
only do it when there's one entire fraction on the left and on the right. If

00:00:59.438 --> 00:01:03.571
there's other sums or differences, you should try something else. And then to

00:01:03.583 --> 00:01:07.642
find the number of quarters, we divide by 2. So, the number of quarters is 15.
