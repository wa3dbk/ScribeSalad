00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.350
So now that we have seen an example of loop unrolling let's do a loop and

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.760
rolling quiz. let's say we have the following loop. We load something from

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.770
memory. We add it to some sort of a sum in R3, and then we move our

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.420
memory pointer by four bytes and then if we have reached some end of an array,

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.565
then we exit otherwise we loop back. So what this loop is really doing is

00:00:21.565 --> 00:00:25.790
it's summing up an array. Let's say we have a processor that is in order and

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.980
executes one instruction per cycle. A load takes three cycles. So, for

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.380
example here, because we are using the result of the load,

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.230
there would be 2 stall cycles in between and ADD or ADDI, take 2 cycles each.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.470
So for example, between the ADDI and the branch, there would be 1 stall cycle.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.250
So the question for you is after scheduling this loop,

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.020
but without applying any unrolling, it takes how many cycles to

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.580
do 1000 iterations of the loop? And then after unrolling once,

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.540
meaning we do the work of two of these iterations per new iteration, and

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.090
then scheduling the loop, it takes how many cycles for 1000 iterations?
