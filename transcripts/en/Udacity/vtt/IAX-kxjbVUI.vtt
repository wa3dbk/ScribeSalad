00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.340
Let's look at the answer to our, when can we free the reservation stations quiz.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.850
If the instruction cannot issue because there is no available reservation

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.686
station for it, that means that all of our reservation stations are busy.

00:00:12.686 --> 00:00:15.510
With a processor that doesn't have a ROB,

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.570
we hold on to our reservation stations. From the time when we issue

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.790
the instruction until the time the instruction brought us a result. So issuing

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.950
of an instruction once the reservation stations are busy will have to wait for

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.340
the next instruction to broadcast the result. In contract,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.150
in a ROB based processor with the same number of reservation stations,

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.030
we grab them at the same time, when we issue the instruction.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.170
But, we free them as soon as we dispatch the instruction for

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.100
execution. So we free the reservation stations sooner, thus,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.220
the next instruction might find the reservation station free over here.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.290
Where over here it was still not available. So this situation is more likely

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.623
to happen when we do not have the ROB than when we do.
