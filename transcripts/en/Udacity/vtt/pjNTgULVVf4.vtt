00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.719
Welcome to Lesson Seven. This lesson's going to be a little bit

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:05.070
different from the previous lessons in that it's mostly going to

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.080
be me and a couple other engineers sharing with you our

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.150
real world experiences. So we'll start with how Reddit is architected today.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.880
So, when I started Reddit I knew not much more than

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.730
you know right now, and over the years, we've had to scale

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.540
Reddit to quite a big size. And I'm going to talk

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.580
with Neil Williams, who's the current lead engineer at Reddit. And we're

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.740
going to discuss Reddit's architecture, and how it serves billions of

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.130
pages per month. It's quite a bit different from the sort

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.440
of stuff we've been working so far in this class. But

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.470
you'll see how we got there. And then I'm going to spend some

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.750
time talking with Chris Chew, who's one of the Udacity engineers.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.660
And Udacity actually uses App Engine to serve their entire website.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.320
Just like you, I was new to Udacity a few months

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.580
ago, and I've basically learned as I've gone through this course. And

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.830
I've actually really learned to love it, and so has Chris at Udacity. So,

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.970
we're going to discuss some of the real-world

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.660
problems they've had to face that we

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.310
haven't yet had to encounter. Now, nothing in this lesson is required for your

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.090
final exam. So, it's just sit back and learn, and we'll have a good time.
