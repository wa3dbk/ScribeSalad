00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.184
The equation would be x squared plus y squared equals r squared. Now that's

00:00:05.184 --> 00:00:08.690
amazing work if you got this equation. Remember that for any point on our

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.609
circle, we can set up a right triangle. So, we'll have this leg squared, plus

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:20.442
this leg squared, equals our radius squared. It works for a point out here. And

00:00:20.442 --> 00:00:24.639
it would've worked for this point, down here. We have another right triangle,

00:00:24.639 --> 00:00:29.160
here, so we would have X squared plus Y squared equals r squared. Where r is

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.870
the length of our string.
