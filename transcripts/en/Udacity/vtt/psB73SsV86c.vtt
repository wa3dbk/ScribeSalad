To figure this out, we just need to find the points of intersection between y

00:00:05.409 --> 00:00:10.651
equals 850 and each of these three lines. So, they are here, here, oh, wow,

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.584
three-way intersection, and here. Brand 1, as we've already figured out, would

00:00:16.596 --> 00:00:23.016
give Grant 75 gallons for $850. Brand 2 would give him 80 gallons and brand 3

00:00:23.028 --> 00:00:29.724
would only give him 70 gallons. So clearly, brand number 2 is the best deal.
