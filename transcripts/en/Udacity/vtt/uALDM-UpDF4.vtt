00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The answer will be 0.025. If you look at this, the variance of the sum increased with N.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:21.000
But now we're dividing 2.5 by 100, 10²--so 2.5/100 gives 0.025,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and there's really an interesting insight here, which is the spread of the mean--

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
what you compute from the sample--goes down as N increases.

00:00:33.000 --> 99:59:59.000
For small N, it's 0.25, but for larger N like N=10, it's now 0.025.
