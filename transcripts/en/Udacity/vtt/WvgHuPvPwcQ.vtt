00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.710
Let's look at the solution to our multiple predictions quiz.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.970
Branches are result in the third stage which means,

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.750
that, we will fetch this branch, and then we will fetch this.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.870
And then we will fetch this. And at that point, this branch will be here and

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.660
be resolved. So we will cancel this and this instruction, and

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.905
start fetching from X and then Y. So overall, we have wasted two cycles.

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:37.630
Note that this penalty here is the same as if the second instruction here was

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.470
not a branch at all. So basically here we actually mis-predicted two branches.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.890
But the second one was mis-predicted in the shadow of the first mis-prediction.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.440
This branch would never have been fetched if we predicted this correctly.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.920
However, the penalty's unaffected. So when we mis-predict a branch,

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.000
we just need to worry about getting on the correct path and we pay a penalty for

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.380
that, but we don't pay additional penalties. For mis-predicted branches that

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.190
themselves should never have been executed because of mis-predictions.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.300
Let's see why this is so. It is because the first branch here results

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.200
in flushing the pipeline when it gets to the stage where branches are resolve.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.870
The branch that was fetched after it is at that time here. And

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.740
the instruction A is here. And what now happens is,

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.300
we flush the pipeline by converting these two into pipeline bubbles. And

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.120
next cycle, we will be fetching X. So what happens is really

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:50.230
if a branch has been fetched in error because of a previous mis-prediction,

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.320
that branch never gets a chance to cause a pipeline flush, because it

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.293
itself gets flushed before that. And that's why we had a two cycle penalty. And

00:02:00.293 --> 00:02:05.500
not four cycles of penalty because technically these two were miss predicted.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.680
But really this one should have never been executed in the first place. But

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.910
this one was flushed before it could trigger a flush of it's own.
