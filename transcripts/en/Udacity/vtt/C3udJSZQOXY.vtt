Another category of connector is called the adaptor connectors.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.280
These are responsible for putting together components that were not designed to

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.750
be put together. This often means there's some kind of translation going on.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.288
It might be converting protocols and policies and

00:00:14.288 --> 00:00:20.260
hence there's a conversion or transformation activity provided.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.660
Some of the variations include invocation conversion, that is is

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.460
there a dress match, mapping? Is there marshalling, virtual memory translation,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.480
virtual function tables? Are there conversion as far as wrappers or

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.910
packagers? Is there protocol conversion or even is the presentation conversion,

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.000
that is is the output. The actual form of the output determined by some kind of,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.250
computation engine such as XSLT.
