00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.734
In order to condense this expression

00:00:01.734 --> 00:00:05.375
the first thing I'm going to do is condense within 
each term.

00:00:05.375 --> 00:00:07.645
To do that I need to use the power property

00:00:07.645 --> 00:00:09.854
so that we can get rid of these coefficients.

00:00:09.854 --> 00:00:11.253
Doing that gives us-

00:00:11.253 --> 00:00:17.560
log of x cubed plus log of y squared minus log of z to the one half.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.433
However I also know that z to the one half

00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:21.429
is just the square root of z.

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:23.333
So I think I prefer to write it that way.

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.158
Now we've gotten rid of our coefficients

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:28.527
we're finally allowed to use our product and 
quotient properties.

00:00:28.527 --> 00:00:33.572
&gt;From the product property we know that log of x cubed plus log of y squared

00:00:33.572 --> 00:00:36.907
is equal to log of x cubed y squared.

00:00:36.907 --> 00:00:40.692
Since we're subtracting log of the square root of z 
from that,

00:00:40.692 --> 00:00:42.949
I can use the quotient property as well.

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.585
The numerator of our fraction is going to be 
the input of the first log,

00:00:46.585 --> 00:00:50.245
and the denominator is going to be the input of 
the log we're subtracting.

00:00:50.245 --> 00:00:53.827
So that means that in the end we've condensed our original expression-

00:00:53.827 --> 00:00:59.298
3 log of x plus 2 log of y minus one half log of z

00:00:59.298 --> 00:01:02.435
to be just this little compact thing right here-

00:01:02.435 --> 00:01:07.375
log of x cubed y squared over the square root of z.

00:01:07.375 --> 00:01:09.000
Awesome!
