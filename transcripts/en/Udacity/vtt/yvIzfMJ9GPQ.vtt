00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.960
Recall that our original goal was
not just to evaluate a polynomial at

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.109
the roots of unity but rather to
multiply two polynomials together or

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.790
even more generally to convolve
two sequences of numbers together.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.149
The faster way to transform would seem
only to get us a little past halfway.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.380
So let's go back and

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.230
look at our road map to see where we are
in multiplying two polynomials together.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.520
Let's take a step back and

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.840
see where we are in trying to find
a faster way to multiply polynomials.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.100
We have an N logN way to
evaluate the polynomials,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.300
we can then multiply them in the value
representation easily in N time,

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.610
but the interpolation
step remains a problem.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.760
Remember that this runtime
involved inverting or

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.120
applying Gaussian elimination
to a Vandermonde matrix.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.270
Or to get the square here, we could
have used Lagrange interpolation.
