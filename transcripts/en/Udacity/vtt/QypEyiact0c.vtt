00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.250
The mean integrated standard error is the expectation values

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.700
of the square of the difference between the estimated PDF and the true PDF.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.360
We will see this expression a lot in lesson four,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.009
when we're validating any model in general.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.580
This is a loss function that is used quite often, in model building.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.060
The AMISE is the asymptotic limit of the mean integrated standard error.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.320
It is often difficult to calculate this integral.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:42.020
And we take some asymptotic value for the integral as an approximation.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.780
Breaking the mean integrated standard error into its component,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.720
we get some irreducible variance that comes from the data set itself.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.030
The bias square determines the smoothness of our kernel density estimate for

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.990
different bandwidths.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.498
The variance determines the jaggediness of the kernel density estimate for

00:01:04.498 --> 00:01:06.260
a different bandwidths.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.650
So the choosing the right bandwidth is a tradeoff between the Bias square and

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.470
the variance.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.600
We will learn a lot more about these two quantities in the next lesson,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.810
where we emphasize validation of models.
