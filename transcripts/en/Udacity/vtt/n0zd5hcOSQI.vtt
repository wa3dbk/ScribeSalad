00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.340
Being a little more formal now,

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.410
we define P to be the set of problems
solvable in polynomial time.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.090
By polynomial time, we mean that
the number of Turing machine steps

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.950
is bounded by a polynomial.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.580
We'll formalize this more in a moment.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.010
Bipartite matching was one example
of this class of problems.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.990
NP we define as the class of problems
verifiable in polynomial time.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.120
This includes everything in P, since if
a problem can be solved in polynomial

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.280
time, a potential solution can
be verified in that time too.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.400
Most computer scientists strongly
believe that this containment is strict,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.680
that is to say, there are some problems
that are efficiently verifiable, but

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.650
not efficiently solvable.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.880
But we don't have a proof for this yet.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.950
The clique problem that we considered is
one of the problems that belongs in NP,

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.710
but we think does not belong in P.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.390
There's one more class of problems that
we'll talk about in this section on

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.630
complexity, and
that is the set of NP complete problems.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.980
These are the hardest problems in NP,
and we call them the hardest because any

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.150
problem in NP we can efficiently
transform into an NP complete problem.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.570
Therefore, if someone were to come
up with an polynomial algorithm for

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.590
even one NP complete problem,
then P would expand out in this diagram,

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.080
making P and NP into the same class.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.020
Finding a polynomial solution for
clique would do this.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.950
So we say that clique is NP complete.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.020
Since solving problems doesn't
seem to be as easy as checking

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.500
answers to problems, we're pretty
sure that NP complete problems

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.050
can't be solved in polynomial time.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.190
And therefore, that P does not equal NP.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.810
To computer science novices,
the difference between matching and

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.900
clique might not seem to be a big deal.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.180
And, it's surprising that one is so
much harder than the other.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.790
In fact, the difference between
the polynomial solvable algorithm and

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.260
an NP complete one, can be very subtle.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.730
Being able to tell the difference
is an important skill for

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.110
everyone who'll be designing
algorithms for the real world.
