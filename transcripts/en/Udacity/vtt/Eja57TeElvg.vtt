00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In the real world, it's entirely possible that language influences thought,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and it may be that some things are easier in 1 language than another.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In the world of computing, the languages that we are considering,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
like Python and JavaScript, are ultimately equally expressive in a strong formal sense.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
However, we often still think that some things are easier--

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that is, maybe they take you a little less time to write or they're a little easier to read,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
they feel a little more natural--in 1 language than another.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
You may just prefer writing code in Python to writing code in JavaScript

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
even though ultimately you could say all of the same things in JavaScript.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
One may feel a little easier to you even though the end results would be the same.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So I assert that interpreting or translating between 2 systems of meaning

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
is actually a very deep concept.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And 1 interesting downside for us is that simulating a program,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
interpreting it, translating it often requires running it.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Let's see how that plays out.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Here I've written a simple Python program,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
the sort that we might want to translate or interpret into JavaScript and then back again,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and what I'd like to know is, what does it do? Maybe it prints 0.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I've listed a few options.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I want you to think about this program in your head

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and tell me, what will happen if I run it?

00:01:11.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Check all that apply, bearing in mind that I am trying to trip you up.
