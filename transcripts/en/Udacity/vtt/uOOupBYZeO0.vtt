00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.730
Given some sample data
how do we populate a ListView?

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's look at an example
of some contact data

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.526
and how it can be displayed in the list.

00:00:08.526 --> 00:00:11.992
We start with our raw data
of contacts which is three contacts,

00:00:11.992 --> 00:00:13.791
as well as our profile images.

00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:18.300
Then we pass this data into the adapter
so it has a reference to it.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.623
The adapter also knows
how to build a list item layout

00:00:21.623 --> 00:00:24.006
for each of these data items.

00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:27.270
So it could go ahead
and create the layouts for them.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.820
But we don't need to create the views yet
until the ListView requests

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.173
that it needs them.

00:00:32.883 --> 00:00:35.176
For example, if you had hundreds
of contacts here,

00:00:35.176 --> 00:00:40.610
you wouldn't want hundreds of layouts
sitting around that aren't being used.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.850
Then when you bind
the adapter to the ListView,

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.390
the ListView will ask how many items
are actually in the data set.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.360
And the adapter will check
in the data set, there's three items,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.518
so we will return that to the ListView.

00:00:52.518 --> 00:00:55.060
Now the ListView knows that it will
have to populate itself

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.372
with three list items.

00:00:57.102 --> 00:01:01.805
Now the ListView starts at position zero
and asks for the list item layout

00:01:01.805 --> 00:01:03.490
located at that position.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.856
It goes back to the adapter
and the adapter checks

00:01:06.856 --> 00:01:10.402
that at position zero,
we have the contact, Anna.

00:01:10.402 --> 00:01:15.140
The adapter knows how to create
a list item layout from the contact, Anna.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.772
So, it goes ahead and does that.

00:01:16.772 --> 00:01:18.984
And then we return it to the ListView.

00:01:20.034 --> 00:01:22.179
And now we see that the 'Anna' list item

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:24.584
is located at the zeroth position in the list.

00:01:25.294 --> 00:01:28.970
Next the ListView wants to get
the item at position 1,

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.790
so ask for the layout from the adapter.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.110
The adapter checks that at position 1,
we have the contact, Bob.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.660
The adapter knows how to create
a list item layout for Bob,

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.790
so it goes ahead and does that
and then it returns it to the ListView.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.950
And now we see that the list item for Bob

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.350
has been successfully added
to the ListView at position 1.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.233
Now the ListView fetches
its last item because it knows

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:55.706
that there was three list items to expect.

00:01:55.706 --> 00:02:01.190
It fetches the last list item layout
at position 2 by asking the adapter.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.890
The adapter checks that at position 2,
we have Charlie, as well as that image.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.560
And we know how to make
a list item layout for Charlie,

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.850
so we can go ahead and do that,
and return it to the ListView.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.860
And now we have the list item for Charlie
at position 2 in the list.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.824
And we have our complete list.
