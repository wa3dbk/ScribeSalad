[MUSIC]

00:00:14.026 --> 00:00:15.040
Welcome back.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.150
I hope you enjoyed the previous lesson
on the common features of frameworks.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.440
In many cases,
frameworks seem like magic.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.110
I want to strip away
some of the magic so

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.670
that you'll better understand how your
code and framework code fit together.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.870
In this lesson we'll be
diving into backbone and

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.170
the utility library underscore.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.540
Backbone is a highly opinionated
framework in the NBC family.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.260
It uses underscore for its templating,
and has its own event management and

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.640
routing systems.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.800
We'll uncover how these features work.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.400
I want you to follow along with
me in your own browser and

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.270
code editor this lesson.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.960
I'll be doing the majority of my
work with the Chrome dev tools so

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.330
that I can take advantage
of break points.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.660
It'll make it easier to open up
the frameworks internals and

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.120
get a clear idea of what's happening.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.750
Keep in mind that the point of this
lesson is not to write backbone,

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.590
the goal is to demystify how
frameworks do things and

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.330
for you to realize that frameworks,
they're just JavaScript.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.340
If you want to build backbone apps,
check the instructor notes for

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.890
a link to our learn backbone course.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.080
So let's pop the hood and
see what templating has for us.
