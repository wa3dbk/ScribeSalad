00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.750
We must have a starting point from which to conduct our investigation.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.790
Sometimes, this will be highly specified and

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.960
may even come to you from a colleague or perhaps a supervisor.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.160
Often however, we start with vague direction we want to investigate.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.980
And it is our job to refine this into something we can answer.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.540
Let's start by asking the high-level question,

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.130
how popular were the different kinds of candy?

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.150
Note that this question can not be answered in the way that it is phrased.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.740
We have no meaningful description of popular.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.660
Much less a way to say that one candy is more popular than another.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.030
To get the iterations analysis going, our task is to

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.650
refine this initial question until it is cast in the form of a precise,

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.510
statistical inference problem.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.590
To do this, we will first need to make a guess as to how to quantify popularity.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.850
So how would you quantify popularity?

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.820
What metrics would you use?

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.970
Type your answer in the text below.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.290
Don't worry, there are no right or wrong answers.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.310
And I will share my answer with you in the next video.
