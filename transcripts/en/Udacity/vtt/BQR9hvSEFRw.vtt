00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:05.939
The phrase checkedOut.LoanableItem is an example of a compound name in OCL.

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:11.140
The checkedOut part is an association which is adjacent to patron, and

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.440
then the qualification of that is LoanableItem which is also adjacent

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.950
to the association. So it's as if we're walking through the diagram. And

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.920
every step along the way, is going to be a name in our qualified name.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.840
OCL yomilla as a, in general, treats the names of

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.450
these associations syntactically, just like it would treat an attribute.
