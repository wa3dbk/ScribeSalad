Great work if you got 16x squared plus 40xy plus 25y squared. I start by listing

00:00:06.764 --> 00:00:12.020
out my factors twice. Then, I can draw a triangle to represent the areas that

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:18.083
I'm going to calculate. 4x times 4x is 16x squared. 4x times positive 5y is

00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:25.112
20xy. 5y times 4x is 20xy. And 5y times 5y is 25y squared. Finally, we just

00:00:25.112 --> 00:00:32.168
combine our like terms, the xys and the xys, to get 16x squared plus 40xy plus

00:00:32.168 --> 00:00:33.403
25y squared.
