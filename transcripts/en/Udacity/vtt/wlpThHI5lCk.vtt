Okay.

00:00:00.332 --> 00:00:04.238
let's put everything you know about exponents together and answer this question.

00:00:04.329 --> 00:00:08.169
A cell divides into 4 cells after 2 hours. If each new cell also divides into 4

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.129
cells after 2 hours, how many cell are there after one day? You're going to need

00:00:12.141 --> 00:00:16.122
to think about time and how many rounds of division you'll have. Remember you're

00:00:16.134 --> 00:00:19.679
going to start with one cell, and then it's going to split into 4 cells. So

00:00:19.691 --> 00:00:23.560
after one round you'll have 4 cells, then each of these cells is going to split

00:00:23.572 --> 00:00:26.315
into 4 cells. You can put your answer into this box here.
