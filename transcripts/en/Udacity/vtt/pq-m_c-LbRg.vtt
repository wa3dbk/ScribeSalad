00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.660
When i first started programming I was
pretty intimidated by all the new jargon

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.260
that people were using.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.080
When I met people that introduced
themselves as programmers, developers or

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.237
coders, or when they said words like
front-end, backend and data analyst,

00:00:13.237 --> 00:00:17.010
I'd always ask, so what do you do again?

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.810
On top of that, I wasn't even sure about
how coding will impact my daily life.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:21.470
Is really hard for

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.170
me to see how learning programming
would affect me in my current role.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.090
But then I started realizing how
the knowledge of programming can

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.070
enhance different people's lives.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.330
Here's some examples.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.770
A restaurant owner is able to build
his own website in HTML, CSS and

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.730
JavaScript to advertise
his business online.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.330
He might even be able to use Python or
Ruby to take customer orders.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.830
A program manager that works with
software engineers, is able to

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.050
understand the technical components
of a project and analyze data.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.410
A teacher may be able to create
a mobile app to remind his students

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.630
about homework that's due the next day.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.100
Or an artist is able to put up
a responsive portfolio online for

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.810
clients to see.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.830
As a dancer,

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.570
I realized that I needed a way to share
my work with local dance companies.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.410
Once I learned how to code, I created
a website for my dance portfolio.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.940
I didn't consider myself
a programmer at the time, but

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.110
coding really impacted my role.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.150
Programming skills can impact anyone.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.330
Let's hear from Liz about how her
new skills have impacted her.
