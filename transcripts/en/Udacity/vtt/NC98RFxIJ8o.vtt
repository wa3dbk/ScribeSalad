00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.780
Now it's time to modify our application.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.370
And before I do this, I'm going to suggest, that you

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.240
initialize a Git repository, so you can always revert any mistakes you make.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.750
I always do this.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.890
In my case, when I got the code base from GitHub, I made that repository.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:18.890
And sure enough.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.350
I'll use PWD to see that I'm on the desktop inside of my to do folder, and

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.030
I can say, get status, and sure enough, there is a give repository.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.490
Get log, shows me that it turns out I've actually made some commits.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.270
Now if you do this, you'll see my commits as well.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.120
You won't see any commits by yourself, because you haven't made any yet.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.890
But as you make changes, if you like the changes you make.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.690
Go ahead and use get to make commits and keep track of whats going on.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.970
I'll type queue here.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.483
Now if you really want to you can skip the git steps steps but

00:00:53.483 --> 00:00:56.260
I highly recommend learning it at some point.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.864
If you don't already know it Udacity is a version and

00:00:59.864 --> 00:01:03.990
there are tons of other good resources around the web as well.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.020
Using version control means, its easy to experiment and

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.530
that's the exciting thing.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.430
We're not going to mess up our application accidentally.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.060
Since gits, our version control system, is keeping track of what we change and

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.920
when, we can play with code without fear.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.190
If we mess up, we just ask git to revert our changes and we try again.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.185
Now, I've already initialized my repo, but if you have to initialize a repo.

00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:30.240
Git init is the command that you'll use.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.480
I just wanted to point that out,

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.750
because this is my favorite command because it rhymes.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:35.880
Get init.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.750
Now, enough about get.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.400
Our first feature modification will be a simple one.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.700
We need to make it so that way, to do items that are marked as completed.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.440
Show dash dash, done at the end.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.560
Now, there are lots of ways you can make this happen, but

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.850
some art much cleaner and simpler than others.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.740
Here's a good way of going about it.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.940
Before you start, ask yourself a couple questions.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.660
Should this change the way data is stored, or is it only a cosmetic change?

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.210
I like to consider that profound or cosmetic changes.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.460
Is this a big change, or is it just the way it's visualized or shown?

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.310
Another question to ask yourself is, where could this change be implemented?

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.460
The view file?

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.740
The template?

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.700
Where?

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.930
And lastly, but most importantly in my mind.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.810
Is there something already like this?

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.310
Does something already happen visually, when an item is marked complete?

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.310
If so, like for example the check mark, where is that implemented?

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.260
Maybe you should implement your change,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.180
in the same place that this change happens.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.240
Be a detective.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.480
When you're done, we'll continue.
