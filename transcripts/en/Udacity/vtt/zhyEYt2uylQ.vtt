00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.300
So let's look at the example history based projector that

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.746
has a 1-bit history with 2-bit counters, for each history. So

00:00:06.746 --> 00:00:09.896
the general approach to this branch vector stays the same,

00:00:09.896 --> 00:00:12.227
we take some bits of the PC, we index into the

00:00:12.227 --> 00:00:15.566
branch history table, but instead of having a 1-bit counter

00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:18.640
or a 2-bit counter in each entry. Now we have a

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.906
single bit history in each entry, a two bit counter for

00:00:21.906 --> 00:00:25.243
when the history is 0, and the separate two bit counter

00:00:25.243 --> 00:00:29.910
for when the history is 1. So the state of the predictor is now not just

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.220
the state of a single 1-bit or 2-bit

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.090
counter, it's the state of a single bit history

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.200
and two of these counters. So now let's

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.050
look at the behavior of predictors over time,

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.480
like this. We have the predictors state, the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.220
prediction, the outcome, and whether the prediction was correct.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.989
Let's start the predictor in a state where the

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.971
history bit is and the 2, 2-bit predictors are

00:00:55.971 --> 00:00:59.030
both in the strong not taken state. So again

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.660
all three of these together are now the state of

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.819
the predictor. The prediction in this type of predictor

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.960
is formed by using the history bit to tell

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.237
us which of the two predictor to use. Because

00:01:12.237 --> 00:01:15.234
the history is 0, we will be using the first

00:01:15.234 --> 00:01:18.520
of the two counters. It's saying strong not

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.880
taken, so the prediction will be not taken.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.236
Let's say that this is a branch where

00:01:24.236 --> 00:01:27.200
the outcome is taken, not taken, taken, not

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.708
taken, et cetera, and in this case the

00:01:29.708 --> 00:01:33.810
prediction and the outcome differ. So, we have

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.778
an incorrect prediction. Now we will update the

00:01:36.778 --> 00:01:40.380
state depending on the outcome. The way we update

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.180
the predictor, is to use the history to

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.670
index into the two counters. Meaning we will

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.140
be using this counter and modify the counter

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.100
according to the outcome. In this case, the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.585
outcome is taken, so the first of the two counters will be moved to the weak

00:01:57.585 --> 00:02:00.420
not-taken state from the strong. So this counter

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.120
becomes weak not taken, this counter is not affected,

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.340
and then we shift into the history the actual

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.764
outcome, which was taken, so the history becomes 1. When

00:02:12.764 --> 00:02:16.462
the history is 1, we're going to be using the second

00:02:16.462 --> 00:02:19.756
of the two counters. So pretty much, we use the

00:02:19.756 --> 00:02:21.786
history to kind of index into this array of

00:02:21.786 --> 00:02:24.396
counters that only has two counters, so when it's 1

00:02:24.396 --> 00:02:27.800
we use this one. The prediction will be not taken

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.540
and it will be right. The state of the predictor

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.830
is now updated, so that we use the

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.970
history to index again into the counter, modify that

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.838
counter according to the outcome. It stays strong

00:02:38.838 --> 00:02:42.638
not taken, because that's already as convinced about the

00:02:42.638 --> 00:02:45.740
not taken outcome as it can be. The

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.507
other counter just stays the same. And the history

00:02:49.507 --> 00:02:51.577
now shifts in the zero because of the

00:02:51.577 --> 00:02:55.818
not taken outcome. So now we have the state

00:02:55.818 --> 00:02:58.266
of 0 weak not taken, strong not taken to

00:02:58.266 --> 00:03:02.620
predict the next outcome. Our prediction now will index into

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.590
the array of counters, get the first one. Weak

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.040
not taken means that we still predict not taken. We

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.002
are wrong. We update the predictor by finding the

00:03:12.002 --> 00:03:14.634
counter that corresponds to the history and this case 0

00:03:14.634 --> 00:03:17.454
means we use this one. We update it using the

00:03:17.454 --> 00:03:20.900
outcome from weak not take we go to weak taken.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.220
The other counter stays the same, the history shifts

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.430
in the one for taken and this is the new

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.236
state that we use to predict the next outcome. 1

00:03:30.236 --> 00:03:33.197
means we use this counter, that counter says strong not

00:03:33.197 --> 00:03:36.222
taken, so we predict not taken. We are correct,

00:03:36.222 --> 00:03:39.872
update the predictor, 1 means we update this counter with

00:03:39.872 --> 00:03:42.938
not taken, so it stays strong not taken, this one

00:03:42.938 --> 00:03:47.530
stays weak not taken because it's not affected by this.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.050
Not taken is shifted into the history so we

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.282
can 0, and now we use this to predict

00:03:52.282 --> 00:03:55.880
the next outcome. 0 means we use this counter,

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.652
this counter say weak taken so we predict taken and

00:03:58.652 --> 00:04:02.690
we predict correctly. We update the predictor by using

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.680
0 to tell us which counter to update. Taken is

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.640
used to update the counter, so from weak taken

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.690
it becomes strong taken. The other counter stays the same.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.610
The history shifts in a 1, so we get

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.750
this. 1 means we use this counter next. It says

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.880
not taken. We predict not taken and we are

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.070
right. Update the state of the predictor. 1 means we

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.480
update this one with not taken. It stays strongly

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.195
not taken, this one stays the same. History shifts in

00:04:32.195 --> 00:04:34.380
a 0 so it becomes 0. We use 0

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.170
to tell us which counter. This one it's strong taken,

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.000
so we predict taken and we will be right. And as you can see, from now on we get

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.680
perfect prediction in this predictor. Why? Well, because if

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.100
the previous outcome was 0, we are now guessing that

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.447
the next outcome will be taken. If the previous

00:04:53.447 --> 00:04:56.483
outcome was 1, then we are predicting that the next

00:04:56.483 --> 00:04:59.126
outcome will be not taken. And now we do this

00:04:59.126 --> 00:05:03.350
continuously because both of these counters have learned strong decisions,

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.462
because every time we have seen a 0, it

00:05:05.462 --> 00:05:08.022
was followed by taken, every time we have seen a

00:05:08.022 --> 00:05:11.220
1, it was followed by not taken. So this predictor

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.670
learned the pattern of taken, not taken, taken et cetera.
