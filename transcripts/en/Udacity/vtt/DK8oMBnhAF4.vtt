00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.110
Looking at the requirements, item is definitely a relevant element

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.060
for my system, so it is appropriate to model item as

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.300
a class. Sale, on the other hand, is more of

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.610
a characteristic of an item, an attribute of an item, rather

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.960
than a class in itself. So, we're not going to mark

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.460
this one. Shopping cart sounds, as well, as an important element

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.550
for my system. Time can be an important system in some

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.420
contexts, but in this case we're measuring time just because more

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.430
than one item at a time can be added to the shopping cart.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.770
So, time really doesn't have any reason for being modeled as a class.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.550
And finally, user also seems to also have an important role to play

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.260
in the system, and therefore we will model user as a class as well.
