Remember the spotlight and shadow exercise? If you look at the code, you'll

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.908
notice a mesh phong material is used for the ground plane. This material is

00:00:07.908 --> 00:00:11.684
something we normally need for specular highlights. However, the ground plane

00:00:11.684 --> 00:00:15.770
is not shiny. So say we change this material to mesh Lambert material.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.207
Strangely enough, the spotlight disappears. But the shadow remains, if you look

00:00:19.207 --> 00:00:23.926
closely enough. Why did the spotlight disappear? The spotlight is evaluated per

00:00:23.926 --> 00:00:29.118
vertex, not per pixel. Shadows are baked onto the surface, the spotlight is

00:00:29.118 --> 00:00:33.944
not. The spotlight is actually defining a specular highlight. A spotlight can

00:00:33.944 --> 00:00:35.770
be thought of as a negative shadow.
