00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.417
Here, the product was 2x squared minus 1x minus 6. If you got this, you're quite

00:00:04.417 --> 00:00:08.836
the pro at multiplying binomials. Now, I know I threw a negative sign at you. So

00:00:08.836 --> 00:00:13.128
it's okay if you got stuck. There's also a coefficient of 2 here. So that might

00:00:13.128 --> 00:00:18.594
have thrown you off. I'm going to start by listing the factors on each side of

00:00:18.594 --> 00:00:23.152
my rectangle. I'll have 2x plus 3 and x minus 2. So I'll have 2x times x, which

00:00:23.152 --> 00:00:28.479
is 2x squared. Then I'll have 2x times negative 2, which is negative 4x. Notice

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:33.363
that we're distributing or multiplying the 2x in the first parenthesis to each

00:00:33.363 --> 00:00:38.544
term in the second parenthesis. That also happens in our rectangles. Then I'll

00:00:38.544 --> 00:00:43.832
do 3 times x, which is 3x. And finally by making a little bit more room, I'll

00:00:43.832 --> 00:00:49.281
have 3 times negative 2, which is negative 6, our last area of our rectangle.

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:54.642
And finally, we combine our like terms, the negative 4x and the 3x, to get our

00:00:54.642 --> 00:00:55.295
answer.
