00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.180
So why do we care about how far light can travel

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.670
in one nanosecond? If you know what kind of processor you

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.950
have, and if you have a Mac, you can find this

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.290
by selecting from the Apple menu, About this Mac. They'll be

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.600
instructions on the website how you can do this for other

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.400
operating systems. But you'll see a window like this appear that

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.940
will tell you what kind of processor you have. And if

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.540
you zoom that a little bit you can see that we have

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.790
a 2.7 GHZ Intel Core processor. What GHZ stands

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.549
for is gigahertz. Which means that we can do 2.7

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:36.120
billion cycles in each second. So that means the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.750
time we have for one cycle. Is actually less than

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.260
a nanosecond, and you can think of a cycle

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.080
as the time that computer has to do one step.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.650
So it does one step 2.7 billion times in

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.140
a second, that means the time for each cycle is

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.460
1 divided by 2.7 nanoseconds. So that means

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.486
in the time that computer has for one cycle,

00:00:56.486 --> 00:01:00.240
light travels 11.1 centimeters. So how far is

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.840
that? So, let's have a little scale here. If

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.790
we have a dollar bill, that's actually quite

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.749
a bit longer than 11.1 centimeters. 11.1 centimeters is

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:14.190
about three quarters of the way across the bill.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.300
So within the time light can travel that distance,

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.510
the computer's gotta finish processing one cycle,

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.000
finish at least part of an instruction. This

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.560
should give you some idea of how fast

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.420
the computer is operating, and this is part

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.370
of the reason the processor has to be so small. If the processor was bigger than

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.760
11 centimeters, we couldn't even send light across

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.360
the processor in the time for one cycle.
