00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.039
Since at a point of intersection, the 2 lines that are crossing share both an x

00:00:05.039 --> 00:00:09.859
value and a y value, and we know that we want this x to be the x coordinate of

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:14.795
some point of intersection, we can say that these two lines already share a y

00:00:14.795 --> 00:00:20.026
value. And we can let that y value equal this side and this side. If we set y

00:00:20.026 --> 00:00:25.716
equal to this side of the equation, we get a new equation y equals 3 x plus 4.

00:00:25.717 --> 00:00:31.615
So that could be this line for example. The line that it crosses at this point

00:00:31.615 --> 00:00:36.886
of intersection where we have this x coordinate is y equals 2 x minus 1.
