00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.698
So, to summarize what we can say about function behavior, or at least this

00:00:04.698 --> 00:00:09.600
aspect of it. If the value of the function goes down as the value of x goes up,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.230
then we say that the function is decreasing. Just like over here where it's

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.497
sloping down. Now if instead f of x increases as x increases, then we say that

00:00:18.497 --> 00:00:22.840
the function is increasing. Like in this part of the graph. The third option is

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.246
that f of x doesn't change at all as x increases. Here, f of x is a constant. So

00:00:28.246 --> 00:00:32.341
here I've drawn another sort of silly looking graph, and I'm going to divide it

00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:37.037
into several regions. So for each of the regions of the domain that I've split

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:41.369
up right here on the left, I'd like you to tell me if in that range in the

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:46.309
domain, the function, which is g of x in this case, is increasing, decreasing,

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.426
or a constant? Please pick one of these 3 values for each part of the domain.
