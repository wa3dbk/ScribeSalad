00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.760
What do you think, David?

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.560
&gt;&gt; So perhaps unsurprisingly,
I said that the two most similar

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.830
situations in my original answer were
both deeply and superficially similar.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.700
A woman climbing a step ladder
is both deeply similar in that

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.260
the relationship are the same.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.640
And superficially similar
in that the woman and

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.550
the ladder are somewhat similar.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.910
I also said that the woman climbing
a set of stairs is both deep and

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.320
superficially similar.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.580
We still have a woman climbing in both,
and

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.460
I said that a set of stairs is somewhat
superficially similar to a ladder,

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.630
in that both are designed
to allow someone to ascend.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.060
Although some others might say that
that's not superficially similar.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.000
Then I said that the other three that
involved rising in some way were all

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.480
deeply similar as well.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.600
The plane taking off into the sky,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.510
the woman climbing the corporate ladder,
and the ant walking up the wall were all

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.550
deeply similar to me because all
involved this relationship of climbing.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.850
I said that the woman painting a ladder
was only superficially similar,

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.170
which is why it was one of the lowest
rated in our original exercise.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.460
And finally the water bottle sitting
on a desk is neither deeply similar nor

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.440
superficially similar,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.510
because nothing is the same
between those two situations.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.730
&gt;&gt; This is good, David.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.330
Once again, different people may give
different answers to this exercise.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.370
Why did we do so?

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.940
Well, let's examine it next.
