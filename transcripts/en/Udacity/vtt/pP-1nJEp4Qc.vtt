00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:03.449
So our problem is that we're achieving coalesced reads but scattered writes.

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.591
And our goal is to achieve coalesced reads and coalesced writes.

00:00:06.591 --> 00:00:09.244
Clearly, swapping the order of the reads and writes wouldn't help

00:00:09.244 --> 00:00:12.050
because then we'd simply have scattered reads and coalesced writes.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.980
So, how do we achieve both of these?

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.199
The solution is going to be a really important general strategy, so I'll spend a little time on it.

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:24.546
The idea is that we're going to take a tile of the input matrix at a time,

00:00:24.546 --> 00:00:31.141
and we're going to transpose it and copy it into its transposed location in the output matrix.

00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:36.691
And this is going to be the job of a single thread block, so the threads in this thread block are going to work

00:00:36.691 --> 00:00:42.699
cooperatively together to perform this copy and transpose of a tile of elements at a time.

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.097
The threads in the thread block are going to copy the tile into shared memory--

00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:50.994
a shared memory belonging to that thread block--they're going to perform the transpose.

00:00:50.994 --> 00:00:56.103
So now the transpose of these elements, the elements in this tile is happening in shared memory,

00:00:56.103 --> 00:01:02.050
where you don't pay that tremendous cost that you see in global memory to do a scattered write or read.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.803
And finally, the threads in the thread block will work together to copy the elements out.

00:01:06.803 --> 00:01:14.071
And the key is this. If our tile is large enough--say it's a K by K tile--say the K is 32.

00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:23.767
In that case, each warp will copy out a chunk of 32 elements at a time into shared memory.

00:01:23.767 --> 00:01:27.458
And because all 32 threads in that warp are

00:01:27.458 --> 00:01:30.881
reading and writing in adjacent locations in memory, you'll get good coalescing.

00:01:30.881 --> 00:01:36.397
And then, when you copy the transposed matrix to its new location in global memory,

00:01:36.397 --> 00:01:39.688
you can once again do it in a coalesced fashion.

00:01:39.688 --> 00:01:42.802
So, let's try this as a programming exercise.

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:47.601
We'll give you the start of the tile transpose kernel and the code that calls it,

00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:50.545
and you should modify the kernel code to declare it an

00:01:50.545 --> 00:01:56.498
array in shared memory and copy appropriate elements in and out of the shared memory so that

00:01:56.498 --> 00:01:58.993
the final elements are written out in transpose fashion.

00:01:58.993 --> 00:02:04.260
And don't forget to add any syncthread barriers that you need to make sure that you get the correct result.
