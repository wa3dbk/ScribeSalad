00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.354
So when we're determining conic sections, we want to look at the equation. We

00:00:04.354 --> 00:00:08.575
can tell by the equation whether or not the shape will be a circle, an elipse,

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:13.987
a hyperbola, or a parabola. For the case of circles, they will always have the

00:00:13.987 --> 00:00:18.619
same amount of x squared and y squared. Meaning the numbers in front of x

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.865
squared and the number in front of y squared will be the same. Even if I change

00:00:22.865 --> 00:00:28.742
these to 2 I still have a shape of a circle. And changing into 5 I still have a

00:00:28.742 --> 00:00:34.044
perfect circle. So let's go back to a perfect circle that has a radius of 10

00:00:34.044 --> 00:00:39.780
units. We can change this equation to become an ellipse. All we need to do is

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.504
make the coefficients of x squared and y squared different. For example, if I

00:00:44.504 --> 00:00:48.596
make this x squared term have a coefficient of four, instead of one, I get an

00:00:48.596 --> 00:00:53.293
ellipse. The key idea for circles and ellipses is that there's a positive sign

00:00:53.293 --> 00:00:58.230
in between the x squared term and the y squared term. The difference between

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.106
them is that circles have the same coefficient whereas ellipses, have different

00:01:02.106 --> 00:01:06.529
coefficients. Here the coefficient of x squared is 4, and here the coefficient

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:12.410
of y squared is 1. We usually just don't list the 1. But notice it's the same

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.772
exact graph. Now if we want to turn this ellipse into a hyperbola. We'll want

00:01:17.772 --> 00:01:21.630
to change this addition sign to subtraction. Hyperbolas will always have a

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.470
subtraction sign between their x squared term and their y squared term. So,

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.651
changing this to a minus, we get our hyperbola. Remember, the minus sign is

00:01:33.651 --> 00:01:37.242
like the knife that cuts open our ellipse and inverts the sides so they point

00:01:37.242 --> 00:01:42.745
outward. And since our x squared term comes first our hyperbola opens to the

00:01:42.745 --> 00:01:47.805
left and to the right. They point in these directions. But let's see what

00:01:47.805 --> 00:01:51.640
happens when we make the x squared term negative, and the y squared term

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.357
positive. We have subtraction between the squared terms, so we know this graph

00:01:56.357 --> 00:02:03.526
will end up being a hyperbola. And look, it is. The only difference is that

00:02:03.526 --> 00:02:08.502
now, our hyperbola opens up and it opens down. And that's because the y squared

00:02:08.502 --> 00:02:14.204
term comes first, it's positive. Whereas, the x squared term is negative. Now,

00:02:14.204 --> 00:02:18.734
there's one more conic to look at, the parabola. A parabola has x squared or y

00:02:18.734 --> 00:02:24.775
squared, but it doesn't have both. So in order to change this hyperbola into a

00:02:24.775 --> 00:02:29.747
parabola let's change y squared into just y. Now, I'm also going to change the

00:02:29.747 --> 00:02:34.556
value 100 to 10, so that way we can see the graph on here. And notice, when we

00:02:34.556 --> 00:02:40.678
change y squared to y, we get a parabola. The vertex is at zero negative 10,

00:02:40.678 --> 00:02:45.388
and the parabola opens upward. And here's how you can tell if a parabola will

00:02:45.388 --> 00:02:52.090
open up or if it'll open down. We can rearrange this equation and solve for y.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.880
So first I'll subtract negative 4x squared from both sides of this equation.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.967
This gives me negative y on the left, negative 4x squared on the right, and

00:03:00.967 --> 00:03:07.876
positive 10 on the right. Next I'll multiply every term by negative 1. This

00:03:07.876 --> 00:03:14.064
will give me 1y equals positive 4x squared minus 10. And we can easily see that

00:03:14.064 --> 00:03:17.922
all three of these equations represent the same graph. I could graph this one

00:03:17.922 --> 00:03:23.330
and I could graph this one and see that they all make the same parabola. Since

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.795
this parabola is y equals we know its going to open up. Or it's going to open

00:03:27.795 --> 00:03:33.860
down. And since the coefficient on the squared term is positive, it opens up.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.085
Now, if we make this coefficient negative, the parabola opens down. So, when

00:03:38.085 --> 00:03:41.605
determining whether or not something opens up, or something opens down, you

00:03:41.605 --> 00:03:45.070
want to solve for the single variable first, and then look at the coefficient

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:51.540
of the squared term. Is it positive or is it negative. So we've seen a parabola

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.320
open up and down but let's see one that opens left and right instead of having

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.980
the parabola be y equals let's make it be x equals so we'll make the x term be

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:06.630
a single x variable. And the y term be y squared. Doing that we see we get a

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.347
sideways parabola and it points to the right and again we know this parabola

00:04:10.347 --> 00:04:17.320
opens to the right since we can rearrange this equation to be x equals. First

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.974
we'll add y squared to both sides so we'll get 4x equals positive y squared on

00:04:20.974 --> 00:04:27.250
the right. And positive 10 on the right. Next we'll divide every term by 4, to

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.724
get x equals 1 fourth y squared plus 10 fourth. And when I graph each of these

00:04:32.724 --> 00:04:36.883
equations, I should see that they're all the same. Since this parabola is in

00:04:36.883 --> 00:04:41.876
the form x equals, we know it's going to open to the right or to the left. And

00:04:41.876 --> 00:04:46.855
since this number, this coefficient is positive 1 fourth. Our graph opens to

00:04:46.855 --> 00:04:52.086
the right. If instead we make it negative 1 fourth, our parabola will open to

00:04:52.086 --> 00:04:58.820
the left. So remember y equal parabolas open up and down. And x equal parabolas

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.522
open right and left. The sign on the squared term tells us which direction that

00:05:04.522 --> 00:05:11.837
is. Up and right for positive. Down and left for negative.
