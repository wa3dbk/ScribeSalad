00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.840
At the beginning of the lesson we
identified NP as those problems for

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.020
which an answer can be
verified in polynomial time.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.530
Remember how easy it was to check
that a clique was a clique?

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.370
In the more formal treatment however,
we identified NP as those languages

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.650
recognized by non-deterministic
Turing machines in polynomial time.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.210
Now we get to see why
these mean the same thing.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.300
To get some intuition,

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.210
we'll revisit the example of
finding a clique of size four.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.010
We already discussed how a clique
of size four is easy to verify.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.860
But how easy is it to find with
a non-deterministic machine?

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.800
The key is to use the non-determinism
to create a branch of computation for

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.040
each subset of size four.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.710
And then use our verification strategy

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.920
to decide whether any of those
subsets correspond to a clique.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.160
Remember, that if any sequence
of configuration accepts,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.790
then the non-deterministic
machine accepts.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.420
One branch of computation
might choose these four, and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.970
then reject, because it's not a clique.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.630
Another branch of computation might
choose these four, and also reject.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.750
But one branch will choose the correct
subset, and this will accept.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.440
And that's all we need.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.850
If one branch accepts,

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.490
then the whole non-deterministic
machine does as it should.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.040
There is this clique of size four here.
