00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.059
Before beginning this lesson, it might
be worth brushing up on a few concepts,

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:06.030
so that you won't have to go back and
review them later.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.280
We will be using complex numbers, and in
particular their polar representation,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.815
just a familiarity with
the basics is required here.

00:00:13.815 --> 00:00:17.395
We will also be using
a little linear algebra,

00:00:17.395 --> 00:00:22.505
the ideas of matrix inverse and systems
of equations being the most important.

00:00:22.505 --> 00:00:25.675
And since we will be using a divide and
conquer strategy,

00:00:25.675 --> 00:00:28.375
it might be a good idea to review
the master theorem briefly.
