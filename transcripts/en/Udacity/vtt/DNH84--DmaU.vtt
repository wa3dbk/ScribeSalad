00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.003
Let's make another prediction. This time, how may batches of brownies can you

00:00:04.016 --> 00:00:08.481
bake if your recipe requires 3/4 of a cup of sugar and you have 2 cups of sugar

00:00:08.493 --> 00:00:12.568
at home. Again, before we solve this problem let's guess about how many batches

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.614
we'll make. Will we make less than one batch of brownie, exactly one batch, more

00:00:16.626 --> 00:00:20.486
than one batch, but less than 2, exactly 2 batches, or more than 2 batches. Go

00:00:20.498 --> 00:00:21.804
ahead, choose your answer.
