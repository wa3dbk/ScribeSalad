00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.620
The next thing I'm doing here then is I'm

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.400
using a function that I wrote here in this

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.710
code called is_street_name, okay. And the way

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.420
is_street_name works is it simply looks at the element

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.870
that was passed in so in this case, I'm

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.560
taking that nested tag that I got back from my

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.100
way element, alright? And I'm checking the k attribute

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.970
for that element okay, and if you remember how attributes

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.870
are part of a tag, okay. So for example, here is an example of

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.560
a k attribute and in fact, what I'm doing next then is, I'm saying all right, I

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.260
want that k attribute to actually have this

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.820
value. Okay. So I'm looking for tags that

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.940
actually specify a street name. Again we're talking

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.140
about a way here. Okay. So items with

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.390
this particular key should have as their value,

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.680
the name for that way, whether it's 3rd Street

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.650
or 14th Avenue or say, 7th Avenue here

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.852
in New York City, near where the MongoDB offices

00:01:04.852 --> 00:01:10.560
are located, okay. So the next thing I'm doing here then is if I've got a tag

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.365
that's actually specifying the name for that particular way,

00:01:13.365 --> 00:01:16.950
then I'm going to call audit_street_type, okay.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.080
So let's take a look at that. All right. Now,

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.230
the way I've set up audit_street_type is it's actually

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.510
going to use a regular expression. This regular expression is

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.500
one that we've seen before. What it does is it pulls

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.630
out or matches the very last word in a street

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.050
name, because most street names end with the street type that

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.250
we're interested in. So avenue or boulevard street, something along those

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.210
lines, okay? So, in order to get the value that actually

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.180
matched, so if this condition is true, then there was a

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.120
match of some kind, and the way I get the specific match

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.660
is by calling the group method of the matched object, okay?

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.770
So the next step here then is what I'm doing is, I

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.550
don't actually want to see these come out in my audit.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.620
These are what I expect as names. These are normal, there's nothing

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.880
wrong with these. I don't care about these, I don't care about

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.820
trying to fix these. I'm just trying to find weirdos here, okay.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.670
So what I want to do here is, if the street type that I matched okay, as the

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.010
last word in the street name, okay, is not in my expected list. Then what I

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.560
want to do is to my street_types

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.540
dictionary, which I initialized right here, what I want

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.820
to do is add that street name. So

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.930
basically what this says is, if the street type

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.500
that I found here for this particular tag is a

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.200
weirdo, then I want to add it to the street_types

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.300
dictionary where I'm keeping track of all the unusual street

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.790
types. Okay now the way I've done this is I've set

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.240
this up as a default dictionary, okay, and this allows

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.510
me to not have to check to see whether the key

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.530
is already in the dictionary it's a convenience. Okay, read the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.180
docs if you want to know a little bit more about

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.860
default dictionaries. The value for each one of these

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.870
keys, so, if I find something unusual like "ave." okay

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.160
for example, which isn't going to be in this

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.200
expected set, that key might appear in street_types. The value

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.780
then, will be a set. So what I'm going

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.950
to do then is for my street type, I'm going

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.700
to add the specific street name that I found,

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.330
because I'd like to see all of the examples, alright,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.730
where a particular unusual street type was used to give

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.270
me a better sense for the data as a whole.
