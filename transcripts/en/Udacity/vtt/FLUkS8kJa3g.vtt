00:00:00.525 --> 00:00:04.965
Parness' other solution is a little bit more subtle.

00:00:04.965 --> 00:00:08.500
Now, in this case we're going to coordinate the communication between

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.640
the components using a technique called registration broadcast.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.260
Components requiring services which, we're going to call clients, express

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.460
interest in state changes in components providing them which we'll call servers.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.730
And that requesting notification is called a registration process.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.340
When a server component announces that something,

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.360
detects that something has been changed and announces it, it's going to

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.240
announce it to all the registered clients and that's going to be broadcast.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.700
In this particular approach, servers don't know the identities of the clients.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.700
The clients called them and

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.160
said, call me back, but I don't know who you are that I'm calling.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.460
And the uni, unit of notification here is the event.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.240
We have essentially the same components as before,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.020
it's just that their mode of interaction has changed, and, and

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.370
is now implicit invocation based upon something happening.
