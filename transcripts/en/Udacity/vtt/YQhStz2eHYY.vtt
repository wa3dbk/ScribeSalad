00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's assume there are two coins equally distributed, same probability of having each.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The first type of coins are fair. The second type of coins have a probability of heads of 0.9--90%.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Let's assume you and I both flip a coin. When I flipped, I get the following sequence.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
When you flipped, you get the following sequence.

00:00:32.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So please write in this box the probability that we flipped coins of the same type.
