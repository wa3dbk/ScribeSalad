00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.108
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Grant is still at the Udacity Glasses Expo. And to get people more excited

00:00:04.108 --> 00:00:08.329
about his family of glasses wiper products, he's decided to add a game to his

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:12.653
booth. Anyone who wins the game gets a free pair of deluxe glasses wipers, the

00:00:12.653 --> 00:00:17.076
ones with the awesome curlicues on them. The game is pretty simple. The person

00:00:17.076 --> 00:00:21.626
playing uses this giant slingshot that Grant built to try to get a ball through

00:00:21.626 --> 00:00:26.116
a hoop that's attached way up high on the ceiling. Grant has another idea of a

00:00:26.116 --> 00:00:30.605
way to soup up his booth though. The game isn't quite enough for him. A gigantic

00:00:30.605 --> 00:00:34.586
sign with his brand name on it. That way no one will ever forget what his

00:00:34.586 --> 00:00:38.860
company is called. The question is, where should he hang it? He needs to make

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.940
sure that it doesn't get in the way of shots from the slingshot that would

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.149
otherwise have gone through the hoop.
