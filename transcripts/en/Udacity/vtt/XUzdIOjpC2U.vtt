00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.400
The answer lies in understanding covariance.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.870
Covariance only examines linear relationships and

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.310
is at the heart of linear regression.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.640
A relationship which is not linear will have a very low covariance score.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.570
Let's look at an example.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.240
Let's look at y equals x squared between negative 1 and 1.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.740
So y is totally determined by the value of x in this example.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.850
Y and x have a very strong relationship.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.250
Now, let's suppose that I were to sample points from

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.310
this curve totally uniformly at random.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.820
So I'm going to collect points x and

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.130
y from points along this curve and just select them totally uniformly at random.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.760
And now, given these points let's calculate covariance.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.980
Well, the covariance between x and y is, if you recall

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.820
the expectation of x minus the mean of x times y minus the mean of y.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.340
And if you evaluate this for the curve above you'll find that the answer is 0.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.330
So you'll find that the covariance takes on a maximum value when the degree of

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.410
the polynomial is 1.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.090
As they increase in degree, but

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.690
remain odd, the covariance gradually decreases slowly.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.820
But for even degree polynomials the covariance always evaluates to 0.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.600
Similarly, inter-tweet time and

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.120
mention distance are related, but they're not linearly related.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.310
Now, this makes intuitive sense.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.270
If someone you know calls out your name, you are likely to immediately respond.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.920
In general, in addition, in real life relationships are not linear.
