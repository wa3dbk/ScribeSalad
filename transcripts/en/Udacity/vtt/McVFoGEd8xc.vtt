00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.360
Whoa! We're not quite done yet. This was the original end of

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.060
the class. And if you've made it this far and learned everything that

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.320
we've covered, you definitely accomplished a lot. And you've learned a lot

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.580
about computer science, as well as

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.000
Python programming. But we've learned that it's

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.680
very hard for students based on just this to be ready for

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.980
the next level of classes. So we added a few extra units that

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.450
I think will prepare you for that. As well as get you to

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.900
the next level as a programmer. The main focus of the extra units.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.150
Is on how to mange complexity. This is something that becomes more

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.583
and more important as your programs get longer and more complicated. As well

00:00:32.583 --> 00:00:35.600
as if you start working in teams to build larger programs. Where you

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.574
have to understand other peoples code, and they have to understand your code.

00:00:38.574 --> 00:00:41.770
As you develop as a programmer, learning how to mange complexity becomes

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.720
more and more important, and these new units will teach you tools and

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.230
techniques for how to do that. I congratulate you on getting to the

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.020
end of the original course, but hope you'll stick with it, and join

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.860
me for the new units.
