00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.469
The next example of relationship we're going to look at is

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:06.740
the association relationship. This is a relationship in which objects of

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.570
one class are connected to objects of another. And it's

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.480
called an has a relationship. So it means that objects of

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.930
one class have objects of another class. So let's see

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.750
what that means. Let's do it by considering two classes in

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.370
our example system. The student class and the course offering class.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.300
In this case, there is an association between the student and

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.010
the course offering, because the student is registering for the

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.750
course offering. So, in a sense, the course offering has students.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.360
Contains students, to indicate this fact we add a solid

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.750
line between the student class and the course offering. And the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.540
fact that having a solid line doesn't really tell us

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.780
much about the nature of the relationship, so to clarify such

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.550
nature we can use what we call adornments that we

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.010
can apply to associations we can add to associations to clarify

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.850
their meaning. In particular we can add a label to

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.550
an association and the label describes the nature of the relationship.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.440
In this case, for example, it clarifies that the student

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.970
registers for CourseOffering. We can also add a triangle to

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.050
further clarify the direction of the relationship. So in this

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.240
case, the triangle will indicate that it's the student That registers

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.120
for the course offering, and not the other way around. Another

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.650
important adornment or limitation that we can put on an association,

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.800
is multiplicity. Multiplicity defines the number of instances of one

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.540
class that are related to one instance of the other

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.900
class. We can define multiplicity at either end of the

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.620
relationship. In this case, for instance, we can say that

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.890
if we look at the student, the student can register

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.410
for two or more course offerings. Whereas, if we look

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.560
at the course offering, we can say that each course

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.260
offering can have or can enroll between 1 and 50 students.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.120
So as you can see by adding a label, a direction,

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.590
and multiplicity, we make it much clearer what the relationship is

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.170
and what it means and what are its characteristics. As we

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.130
saw when we introduced relationships, there is a different kind of

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.860
association, kind of a specialized one, which we call aggregation. So

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.130
here we're going to look at an example of an aggregation. So

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.490
first of all what is an aggregation? An aggregation is a

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.580
relationship between 2 classes in which 1 represents a larger class

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.610
like a whole which consists of smaller classes which are

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.430
the parts of this whole. So let's look at an example

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.960
in the context of our system. Let's consider a Course

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.160
and the CourseOffering. And in this case, we can see

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.000
that the Course consists of multiple CourseOfferings. So in

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.520
a sense, a course is a whole and the course offerings

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.430
are the parts of this whole. So this a perfect case

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.620
in which we will use an aggregation to express this relationship.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.630
So we will add a solid line with a diamond on the side of the whole class

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.380
to indicate that the course consists of multiple course offerings.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.670
And as we did for associations even though we

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.010
are not going to do it for this specific

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.540
example, we could also in this case add multiplicity

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.830
information on the aggregation to indicate how many classes

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.310
of the two types are involved in the relationships.
