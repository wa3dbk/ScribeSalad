00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.210
Consider now the results
of this thought experiment.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.530
Our casino enabled us to allocate
our 1,000 tokens to 1,000 tables.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.320
We looked at two extreme cases.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.190
One where we put a small bet
on all 1,000 tables, and

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.620
another where we put all
our money on one table.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.970
We saw that the expected return was
the same in both cases, about $20, but

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.060
the risk was substantially higher for
the single bet case.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.509
This was true for both type of risk that
we looked at, risk to lose everything,

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.120
and risk as standard deviation.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.510
When we consider risk and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.090
reward together,
we come away with three lessons.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.830
One, higher alpha generates
a higher sharpe ratio.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.580
Two, more execution opportunities
provides a higher sharpe ratio.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.980
And three, sharpe ratio grows
as the square root of breadth.
