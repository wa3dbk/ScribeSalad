00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.530
The first question is about star networks. A star

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.480
network is a network that has a single node

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.820
in the center that is connected to all the

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.300
rest of the nodes in the graph directly. So,

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.540
here's a star network with five nodes. It has

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.860
one, two, three, four edges. Now, what you should

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.240
do, is write a python program that returns the

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.410
number of edges in the star network with n nodes.
