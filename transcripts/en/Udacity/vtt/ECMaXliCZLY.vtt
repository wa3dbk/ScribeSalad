00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.928
Well the answer again is log N.

00:00:01.928 --> 00:00:05.421
Just like in the previous step, we're doubling the hop count on each step

00:00:05.421 --> 00:00:08.678
so it will take log N steps to fill in all output positions,

00:00:08.678 --> 00:00:12.315
and if you count both awake and asleep threads as doing 1 unit of work each iteration,

00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:15.007
we do N log N work overall.

00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:20.488
The big idea here is that this entire algorithm is a good example of trading off work for steps.

00:00:20.488 --> 00:00:23.526
We do more work than the serial version, N log N versus N,

00:00:23.526 --> 00:00:26.846
but we finish in fewer steps, log N versus N.
