00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.540
To showcase the importance of both the field of view and its relationship to

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.060
the focal length lens I'm going to show you a series of pictures a friend of

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.127
mine, a colleague of mine at Georgia Tech, Henry Christenson.

00:00:13.127 --> 00:00:15.860
Professor Christensen took from his apartment and

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.990
this would be actually interesting for all of you to see

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.150
interesting perspective of the Georgia Tech campus from the city of Atlanta.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.010
Here is basically the focal of the camera we're using or

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.410
the lens we're using is 12 millimeter.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.674
This is the view, 24 millimeter, 50 millimeter,

00:00:32.674 --> 00:00:36.170
85 millimeter lens, moving to a 116.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.130
220 millimeter, all the way to 300 millimeters.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.360
So we've gone from 12 millimeter to 300 millimeter, and now, of course,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.380
you're seeing the iconic Georgia Tech tower in front of our football stadium.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.520
Right behind was the Coca-Cola campus.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.610
So this is an interesting way of kind of now showing you the values,

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.960
to field of views really kind of getting focused in.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.150
Let's look at it a little bit in backward direction.

00:01:09.891 --> 00:01:10.833
And forward again.

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:21.590
Let's look at the same images in a different form next.
