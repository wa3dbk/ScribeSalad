00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.420
Let's create a web application that
allows us to create multiple restaurant

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.150
menus without having to
change the source code.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.170
We want to be able to create menu items,
read the items we've created,

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.830
update our menu items, and
delete items from time to time.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.610
Hm, sounds like we
need to make some CRUD.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.550
What's so special about CRUD, you ask?

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.980
Well, this four letter acronym
encapsulates all of the actions a user

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.950
does on a data-driven website.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.430
Each time we make a new profile, post
a new status, write a new blog entry,

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.270
upload a new pic, or
add a new item to a menu,

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.130
we are creating new data to
be stored in our database.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.640
Whenever we look through a friend's
latest tweets and pics, or

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.890
skim through our news feed,

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.230
we are reading data that was already
stored in an application's database.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.920
When we correct the typo on
a blog post we already made,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.840
modify the item quantity in our shopping
cart, or change our profile information,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.160
we are performing an update on
existing information in the database.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.510
And when it's time to erase that
embarrassing baby pic from our profile

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.470
or get rid of those items
in our shopping cart,

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.230
we're deleting information
in the database.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.070
Virtually everything we do on the web
can be summarized with one little

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.160
acronym, CRUD.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.590
I want you to take a look at
a few common website actions and

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.150
then decide what the CRUD is going on.
