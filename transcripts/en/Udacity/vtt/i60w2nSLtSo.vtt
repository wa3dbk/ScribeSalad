00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.140
All right. So why don't we recap what

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.580
we've discussed in this lesson. First, we discussed

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.450
the components to an effective information visualization. They

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.490
were visual cues, the coordinate system, the scale and

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.440
data types, and the context. After that, we

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.090
dived a little bit deeper into the various

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.189
different ways that we can encode data visually.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.050
These included its size, position, color, and many more.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.058
We also discussed various scales and data types such as numerical,

00:00:30.058 --> 00:00:35.240
categorical, and time-series. We took

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.360
a deeper dive into time-series, since that's what

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.980
most of the data for our assignment will look

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.470
like. And finally, we went over the basics

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.490
of creating graphics using ggplot, a library for

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.740
Python. For this week's assignment, you'll use what

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.150
we've learned in this lesson. That is the basic

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.230
principles of data visualization and the basics of

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.340
how to create a graphic in ggplot. You'll create

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.100
a few basic visualizations that describe things about the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.170
New York City subway. So, you'll want to communicate to

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.930
people our statistical findings from assignment 3, but also

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.240
maybe just some general information regarding the subway. Ridership

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.960
at various hours of the day, how many people

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.264
are going into and out of different stations, etc.
