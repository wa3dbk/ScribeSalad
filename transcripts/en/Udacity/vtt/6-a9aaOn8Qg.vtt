00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And now for the answer. This is something that we can best find out by testing.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Here's our first input, here comes the second, number 3 with the quotes outside,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and number 4 with the quotes inside of the text.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
For the first input, the output should be just the text foo.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
For the second one, it should be the same but enclosed in double quotes

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
as is the same for the third one.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
For the fourth one, we'd simply expect the text foo. Let's go and test this.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Surprise, surprise. The output is very different from what we expected.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
To start with, the third output still has HTML markup,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
but for the second input has also something fishy going on because the quotes

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
that were actually part of the text have been removed.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
In our quiz, we only cared for the HTML markup,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
so the third input definitely produces HTML markup.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And therefore, this is the correct answer.
