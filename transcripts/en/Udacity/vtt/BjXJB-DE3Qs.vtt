00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.430
And I'll get us back to a known state.

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.019
Well, there we go.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.550
Now, the next command that I want
to show you is print object.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.490
And print object displays a description
of an object that you specified.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.952
And the output that you'll get is
similar to what would happen if you used

00:00:14.952 --> 00:00:18.650
the expression command and
then use print LN, like we just saw.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.770
Now, the abbreviation for
print object can all be done with PO,

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.670
instead of just P,
space, O, it's all PO.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.150
And we'll run this for the bugs array.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.530
And we can see that it is empty again.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.273
Now let's try running PO for self.

00:00:33.273 --> 00:00:36.746
And this time, LLDB does its best to
give us description, just like we saw

00:00:36.746 --> 00:00:39.950
earlier when we were implementing
printable and debug printable.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.779
But because those things are not
implemented, this is the best it can

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:48.151
do so it gives us the type, breakpoint
bug view controller, and the address.

00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:51.687
Now if we were to implement
printable and debug printable,

00:00:51.687 --> 00:00:54.869
like we saw earlier,
then when we use the PO command,

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:59.206
LLDB will choose the most specific
protocol and show that description.

00:00:59.206 --> 00:01:02.890
So, Debug printable is considered
more specific than printable.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.840
So if Debug printable was implemented,
it would show it.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.650
If printable is the only
thing implemented,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.740
then PO would just display
the printable description.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.950
So, we'll show that as
an example real quick.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.030
I'll stop, and
we'll go to the bottom of this file.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.120
And let's implement these
protocols in an extension.

00:01:30.827 --> 00:01:34.084
And now that we've implemented
both the Printable and

00:01:34.084 --> 00:01:38.060
DebugPrintable protocols,
let's try printing out self again.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.510
And we see that because debugDescription
is the more specific, or

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.520
DebugPrintable is the more specific
protocol, that's what's used.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.620
So, hello from DebugPrintable.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.050
And I'll stop, and let's comment this
out, and only implement Printable.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.530
Let's bring back up the same situation.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.740
Now, if we PO self,
we get hello from Printable.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.660
So, that was pretty cool, but now I
really want to show off the flexibility

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.570
of the command line interface.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.770
This next example's going to be
a little advanced, so don't worry if

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.560
you don't follow everything
the first time I show it to you.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.720
We're going to use it again in
an example later in the lesson.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.960
So, to start, what I've done
is kind of set us up again.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.880
We're in the add bug to view, and
we have a breakpoint set that we've

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.420
reached, and I've already allowed it to
run so that all these bugs were created,

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.870
and then I've triggered it again by
tapping when the breakpoint was active.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.020
And the reason that I did that was
I wanted to be able to print out

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.760
the bug object.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.700
And you can see all these
image views here, and

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.960
we're going to use one
of these raw addresses.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.640
So, I'm going to copy this for
later use, and let's go ahead and

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.720
clear this out.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.730
Make sure it's copied.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.230
Okay, there we go.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.880
So, we're going to start with
the expression command, but this time,

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.390
we're going to use Swift's
unsafe Bitcast function.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.070
And the unsafe Bitcast function,
it's going to allow us to convert

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.870
the raw address into an object that
we can actually interact with.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.650
And this might be really useful in cases
where you have the memory address for

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.120
an object, but you're unable to
access its properties and values.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.430
So, let's see.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.600
Can I actually look at bugs?

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.030
There's one of them.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.740
And yeah,
we can interact with some of it.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.730
But let's imagine that we couldn't.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.300
And there are cases where
this will be handy.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.900
So, here's how it can be used.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.260
The first argument is going
to be our raw address.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.610
And this is the raw address that we
saw earlier for one of our bugs,

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.270
in the bugs array.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.890
And we know that this address
refers to a UIImageView,

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.930
because that's what is
contained in the bugs array.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.270
And so, for the first argument
we have the raw address, and

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.060
then in the second argument we
have the UIImageView.self),

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.370
which is going to allow us to cast
the address into a UI image view object.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.830
And we'll hit enter.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.241
So boom, there we go.

00:03:55.241 --> 00:04:01.201
LLDB has just converted our raw address
into a UI image view object and

00:04:01.201 --> 00:04:06.590
it's even stored it into
a temporary variable called $R4.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.324
Now, if we wanted to instead use our
own variable name instead of the $R4,

00:04:12.324 --> 00:04:15.101
or whatever it ends up assigning it,

00:04:15.101 --> 00:04:20.310
we can instead run the same expression,
and we'll use let $bug1.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.623
You need to do use the $, that's
special for the console debugger here.

00:04:25.623 --> 00:04:29.964
Hit Enter, and now,
if we run the expression

00:04:29.964 --> 00:04:34.580
println with our variable, there we go.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.080
So, notice here the print output is
the exact same output that we would get

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:47.760
if we print out bugs, or we scroll
up to the top, lot of bugs here.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.900
Here we go, so, for the first one,
I think it stops right there.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.830
There's our first UIImageView, and
this matches exactly the UI image

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.210
view here that's now contained
in the variable above one.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.621
And I can even change bug one's values.

00:05:04.621 --> 00:05:09.216
So we'll run another expression, so

00:05:09.216 --> 00:05:13.970
we'll say $bug1.frame = CGRect.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.970
And let's print this guy back out.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.310
And there we can see that the frame
has now been updated to have X and

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.090
Y of 0, and a width and height of 64.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.200
And because we know that bug one refers
to the same thing as the first bug in

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.530
the array,
if we are to print out the bug's array,

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.450
we should see the same thing.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.380
And there we go.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.210
So the frame for
the first bug, (0 0; 64 64).

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.580
Now, again, don't worry if this example
is kind of hard to follow at first.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.360
We're going to demonstrate using
this again later in the lesson.
