00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.360
So this is the situation we have for dispatch. This is what we're

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.530
broadcasting this cycle. This is what we have in our reservation stations. And

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.360
the question is why hasn't this instruction here in,

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.100
RS3 dispatched before this? Because, obviously, it's not waiting for

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.660
anything at this point. So the question is, if this is a beginning of a cycle,

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.450
then why hasn't this already executed before we got to this cycle?

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.020
The first choice is, it was issued in the previous cycle. So basically,

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.970
this says that this instruction was inserted here in the previous cycle, so

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.360
that's why it didn't dispatch yet. The next answer is, another instruction was

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.890
dispatched to the add unit, so this one couldn't. And the third answer is

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.150
that if the instruction in RS2 is older than the instruction in RS3,

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.020
it comes before it in program order, than RS3 cannot dispatch until RS2 does, so

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.170
simple, this instruction cannot dispatch because it's waiting for something.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.890
In this quiz, you need to, select all answers that would possibly be correct.
