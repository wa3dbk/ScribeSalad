00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's say we have a variant of the SAT problem called MAX-SAT

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
where instead of the question

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
does the boolean formula have a satisfying assignment

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
we'd rather like to know what is the maximum number of clauses

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
in a given boolean formula that can be satisfied?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Let's say we have an algorithm for deciding this,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
or rather, approximating it, where first we simply assign

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
true or false randomly to all variables,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and we count the number of satisfied clauses with this assignment.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Then we invert the assignment of all variables, that is,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
we flip true to false and false to true for every variable,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and finally, we count the number of satisfied clauses

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
with this new inverted assignment.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Now, my question to you is what is the approximation factor of this algorithm?

00:00:46.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And please enter the number in this box below.
