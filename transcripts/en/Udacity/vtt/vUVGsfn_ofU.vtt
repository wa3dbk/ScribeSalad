00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.322
The answer should be 5 rows. We'll always have the first one, and then each

00:00:04.322 --> 00:00:10.060
additional row is another 400 times root 3 meters of length. So, to get the

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.700
total number, we can do 4000 minus 800 over how much we need for another

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:22.068
additional row. So, 400 root 3, and then we add 1 because there's that first

00:00:22.068 --> 00:00:30.210
row that took up 800. This calculation would give us 5.61. But we said that we

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.095
couldn't have fractional rows. So, we just get 5. Let's generalize what we just

00:00:34.095 --> 00:00:36.804
did, if you already know the equation for the number of rows given the length

00:00:36.804 --> 00:00:41.456
of the field, write it down and skip to the next question. Based on what we did

00:00:41.456 --> 00:00:45.929
up here, the equation should be, rows equals the length, minus the diameter

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:53.223
over the radius times the square root of 3 plus 1. Remember the radius was the

00:00:53.223 --> 00:00:59.165
400 and diameter would be 2 radius' or 800. And then once we do this

00:00:59.165 --> 00:01:04.006
calculation, we would drop the decimal. Save this, you're going to need it

00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:05.128
later.
