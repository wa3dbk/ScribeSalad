00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.969
There are major shortcomings with
the electronic code-book method.

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:10.660
First, we observe that for the same key,
if two plain-text blocks are the same,

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.040
then their corresponding server
text blocks are also the same.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.240
This is true if the two plain-text
blocks are in the same message, or

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.780
across two different messages.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.380
As long as they use the same key.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.040
This is a major weakness that can
be exploited by cryptoanalysis.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.480
For example, if it is known that the
message always starts out with certain

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.665
predefined fields, then cryptoanalysis
can have a number of known plain-text,

00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:42.030
server-text pairs to work with.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.860
As another example,
if the message has repetitive elements,

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.880
then these elements can be identified
by cryptoanalysis as well.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.084
In other words, whenever we see
two identical cipher-text bocks,

00:00:56.084 --> 00:01:01.210
we know that the corresponding
plain-text blocks are exactly the same.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.282
And if we have obtained the plain-text
block off a cipher-text block,

00:01:05.282 --> 00:01:08.152
then if you see the same
cipher-text block again,

00:01:08.152 --> 00:01:11.900
we know the corresponding
plain-text block already.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.680
In other words, ECB does not provide a
very strong confidentiality protection.
