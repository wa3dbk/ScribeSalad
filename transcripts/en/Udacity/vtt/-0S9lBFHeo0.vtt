Okay. I like to teach you about a new concept. These are

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.460
called HTML attributes. They look something like this. We still have our

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.740
opening tag name and, and a closing tag as before with this

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.570
slash but we have an, a new thing called an attribute. Attributes

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.600
have a name, in this case, I just called it ATTR. Equals,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.390
and you've got quotes and the value is inside the quotes, and

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.070
attributes these days always equal a value. Didn't use to be the

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.560
case to be the case to be honest but everything we're going to

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.930
do is, is, equals a value. And tags can

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.410
actually have multiple attributes. An example of a tag

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.980
that uses an attribute is the anchor tag, which

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.480
is the a tag, and a full example looks something

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.110
like this. You've got the opening a, you've got

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.830
an attribute called href, you've got its value, in

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.120
which in this case is a URL, you've got

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.500
the contents, and then you've got the closing anchor tag.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.930
So if you were to render this in HTML we'd

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.060
just see the word derp, but it would be a

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.650
link to reddit.com. Anchors are for making links. Let's play

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.210
around with this in our browser a little bit and

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.690
see it in action. Okay, so we've got our HTML

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.150
from before. I'm going to clean out some of these tags

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.230
here, so we have a little bit more room to

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:16.100
work. Let's make the, the words HTML here a link. So,

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.792
we're going to make an opening a tag. An href to www.w3c.org/html

00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:28.480
and a closing a tag. When we render this, we

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.630
see that HTML has turned into a link and if I were to click this it would

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.890
open this page, w3c.org in a new

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.030
window. Pretty neat, huh? Okay, so quick quiz.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.990
Take the phrase below or take the words my favorite from the phrase below and

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.241
make those words a link to udacity.com.
