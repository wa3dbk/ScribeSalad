00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.050
Up to this point we've covered four different conic sections. We looked at

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:10.660
circles then ellipses, hyperbola and finally parabola. We call each of these a

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.830
conic section because they come from the intersection of a plane with a cone.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.736
So, here we have a cone and we have a plane that intersects it, creating this

00:00:19.736 --> 00:00:25.240
shape. Here's another cone that has a plane cutting straight across through it.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.811
And notice that this plane is horizontal to the base of the cone. For this

00:00:28.811 --> 00:00:33.774
shape, we have a plane cutting at an angle down to the side of the cone. And,

00:00:33.774 --> 00:00:38.932
finally, for this shape, We have a plane cutting through a double cone. So what

00:00:38.932 --> 00:00:42.523
I want you to do is match each of these conic sections with the picture that is

00:00:42.523 --> 00:00:48.232
represented by it. So if you think this shape is a circle, you would write a in

00:00:48.232 --> 00:00:50.930
this box. Good luck here.
