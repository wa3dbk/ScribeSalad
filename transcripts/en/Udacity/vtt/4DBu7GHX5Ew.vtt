00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.605
In this algorithm we will count all of the elements that match a certain

00:00:03.605 --> 00:00:08.341
criterion. When you have a picture, we say that the picture is in landscape

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:13.872
orientation if it is wider than it is tall. Most, but not all of these

00:00:13.872 --> 00:00:18.177
pictures, of course, contain a landscape. We say that the picture is in

00:00:18.177 --> 00:00:22.662
portrait orientation if it is taller, than it is wide. Now let's say we have a

00:00:22.662 --> 00:00:25.455
bunch of pictures and we want to count how many of them are in portrait

00:00:25.455 --> 00:00:30.191
orientation. That's an example of a counting problem, in general you keep a

00:00:30.191 --> 00:00:35.385
counter. You visit each element. If the element is a match for whatever it is

00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:40.520
you're looking for you increment the counter. What does it mean to be a match?

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.554
Well that depends on the problem. If you have an array of bacteria, we might be

00:00:44.554 --> 00:00:49.770
looking for the ones that are beneficial. If you have an array of pictures,

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.190
like we have in our example, we happen to want to know the ones that are

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.200
portrait. Those are the ones for which the height is greater than the width.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.750
Now that's your job in the next quiz. Complete the program so that it counts,

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.850
how many pictures are taller than their way.
