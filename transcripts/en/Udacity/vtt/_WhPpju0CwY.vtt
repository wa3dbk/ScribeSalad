00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.560
For the Chinese Puzzle Pot is, is fun. You can

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.980
pour water in the bottom. And turn it upside down, and

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.960
no water falls out. How do you think it works? So

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.850
draw a picture of the inside of the pot showing how

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.320
it works. Now remember, you have to solve two problems.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.330
First, if you pour the water in the bottom, it doesn't

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.920
come out of a spout. When you turn it around, the

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.360
water does not come out of the hole in the bottom.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.760
But you can then poor it out of the spout. So, your

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.120
diagram, your answer to how it works. Has to solve both those puzzles.
