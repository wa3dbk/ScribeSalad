00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.810
At the end of the previous video we chose a metric which we thought would be

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.000
a good way to quantify the question when will my service deck arrive?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.890
We ended up going with the technician's actual reported arrival time at

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.190
the customer's home.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.930
Now to proceed we have to find a way to turn that

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.300
question into a rigorous statistical inference problem such as point estimation,

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.130
confidence sets, classification or parameter estimation.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.490
For example, the problem could be cast as a classification problem in which we

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.840
attempt to predict if the technician will arrive before noon or after noon.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.210
At the complete other end of the spectrum,

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.230
we could create a regression estimator which predicts a precise time of arrival.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.360
Both of these have advantages and disadvantages.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.030
Now before telling you how we approach this problem.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.300
We would love to know if you cast this as a classification or

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.540
a regression problem.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.240
Why or why not?

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.230
Like the previous assessment, please share your thoughts with your

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.230
fellow students in the forum post linked in the instructor comment below.
