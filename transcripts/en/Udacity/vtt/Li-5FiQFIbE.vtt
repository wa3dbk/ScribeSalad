00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
So we have talked about using search trees, pre-processing,

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.270
and approximation to solve NP complete problems.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.820
But there's one technique that we haven't yet talked about

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.080
and that is using randomness to solve challenging problems.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.280
Now you know that so far in this course, I have always insisted

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.100
on finding guarantees for the performance of algorithms.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.120
I wanted to have guarantees for the running time of the search trees.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.040
I even wanted to have guarantees for approximation. So am I ready to give that up now?

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.860
Actually, I'm not, because even when we use randomness,

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.720
we can demand certain guarantees from our algorithms.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.100
So, one way we could demand a guarantee from a random algorithm is,

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.640
that we say it produces the correct or best possible solution with a certain probability.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.130
So best would be in the case of optimization problems

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.370
and correct, of course, in the case of decision problems.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.090
And so, we'll also write this down for decision problems

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.610
and finally we could also say that the algorithm has a running time that is random,

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.410
and we want the running time to be polynomial with a certain probability

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.640
and of course in this case here, we would be demanding that the solution is always

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.730
the best possible solution or the correct solution.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.470
Well, actually we could also have combinations of these,

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.840
but then the algorithm becomes rather weak in my mind

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.650
and actually I'm not aware of any example where I have seen this before.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.550
Now, some of these approaches have special names

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.860
and this one here is known as a Monte Carlo algorithm,

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.510
and this one here is known as a Las Vegas approach.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.410
Don't ask me what that says about casinos in

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.580
Europe versus casinos in America because I have no clue.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.340
Now the two approaches, Monte Carlo and Las Vegas are actually related to each other,

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.170
and if you think about it for a little while, I think you can figure that out yourself.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.220
So my question for you is how are Monte Carlo algorithms

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.460
and Las Vegas algorithms related to each other, and I'll give you three choices here.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.150
Is it that any Las Vegas algorithm can be turned into a Monte Carlo algorithm?

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.150
So any algorithm over here can be turned into an algorithm like this.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:02.290
Is it the other way around, that any Monte Carlo algorithm can be turned into a Las Vegas algorithm?

00:02:02.290 --> 99:59:59.000
Or is it even that the two approaches are, roughly speaking, of course, more or less the same.
