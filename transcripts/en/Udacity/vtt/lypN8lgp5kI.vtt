00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.420
Let's have a look at how engineers
can help create your product.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.070
If there's a difference between
how your app works right now, and

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.038
how you hope it will work in the future,
then you probably need an engineer.

00:00:10.038 --> 00:00:13.730
For your start-up, let's focus on
front end, back end, mobile, and

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.110
data engineers.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.030
So, what's a front end engineer?

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.355
A front end engineer helps
design the look of your app,

00:00:19.355 --> 00:00:23.440
create interactions, and
build the overall user experience.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.080
They'll make responsive interfaces so

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.680
that your app is accessible no
matter what device your user has.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.420
Take a little time to explore
some of your favorite web apps.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.270
Is there anything you like about them?

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.417
Maybe there's something
you find a bit awkward.

00:00:35.417 --> 00:00:38.677
Either way, that's something
a front end engineer developed.

00:00:38.677 --> 00:00:40.660
How about a back end engineer?

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.890
Back end engineers build and

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.450
maintain the technology that
powers your servers and databases.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.990
They're responsible for storing and

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.720
distributing this data to
the rest of your team.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.400
As your business scales,
back end engineers will help create

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.919
the infrastructure necessary
to continue running smoothly.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.905
Now, let's look at mobile engineers.

00:00:57.905 --> 00:01:01.730
Mobile-based apps are native apps you
download and run on your Android or

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.090
iOS phones.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.769
A mobile engineer is responsible for

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.910
building this mobile-based
functionality.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.030
They're able to improve
mobile performance, and

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.080
test apps on new devices.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.940
Common types of mobile engineers
are Android and iOS developers.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.390
Mobile engineers can give direct
access to Bluetooth, Gyroscope, and

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.390
Accelerometer functionality
within your app.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.950
And finally, what's a data engineer?

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.520
Data engineers focus on
developing the architecture your

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.220
business needs to collect,
manage, and analyze data.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.185
They have some similar responsibilities
to back end engineers.

00:01:33.185 --> 00:01:37.008
They help distribute data to your team
by creating the data pipelines necessary

00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:38.727
to collect and organize your data.

00:01:38.727 --> 00:01:41.783
This will help you make data-driven
decisions for your business, so

00:01:41.783 --> 00:01:44.127
you can more accurately meet
the needs of your users.

00:01:44.127 --> 00:01:47.360
There's so much more you can learn about
these different types of engineers.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.380
But, now that you know a little,

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.010
do you see yourself needing any of
these skills for your business?
