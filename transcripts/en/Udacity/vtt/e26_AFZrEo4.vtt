You may have stereotypes that you're not even aware of. Have you ever heard of

00:00:03.846 --> 00:00:08.555
these stereotypes? Athletes are dumb. Blondes are ditzy. Or even, professors

00:00:08.555 --> 00:00:12.210
are absent-minded. Now, we don't endorse these stereotypes, but they are, in

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.274
fact, stereotypes. And as we'll see, stereotypes can help us save time, and

00:00:16.274 --> 00:00:21.610
they allow us to make an impression of somebody that we don't know very well.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.600
However, even though stereotypes can save time, they can have negative results.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.813
So what we'll see in this lesson is that stereotypes can be inaccurate, they

00:00:29.813 --> 00:00:35.440
can be self-perpetuating, they can be overused and they can be automatic. Let's

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.040
look at the idea of a stereotyping self-perpetuating in a little more detail.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.274
For example, let's say you have a stereotype that professors are older men, who

00:00:43.274 --> 00:00:48.162
listen to classical music, and drink fine wine. Now if you meet somebody who

00:00:48.162 --> 00:00:50.846
doesn't fall into that stereotype, we're actually likely to ignore that

00:00:50.846 --> 00:00:55.390
information. For example, you meet a professor who's a young woman, who listens

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.970
to rock and roll, and drinks beer. In this situation, we may modify our

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.876
stereotype, and then women would be the exception to the rule. However, the

00:01:04.876 --> 00:01:08.628
stereotype that professors are men who listen to classical music and drink wine

00:01:08.628 --> 00:01:10.160
will remain.
