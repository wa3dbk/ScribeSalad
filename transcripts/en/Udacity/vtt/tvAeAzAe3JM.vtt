00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.140
A common answer we heard from our students, is that the word delegate,

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.510
makes them think of the relationship between a boss and an employee.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.770
Perhaps you've been in a situation where your boss has delegated some work to

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.420
you, or given you some work.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.460
The idea of delegating work is similar in iOS,

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.520
here you can think of AV audio recorder like boss.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.410
It knows how to record audio.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.510
It also knows when the recording is done and is ready for playback.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.480
In fact, if you look deep enough in the code for AV audio recorder you'll find

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.110
a function called audio recorder did finish recording.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.340
This is the function that gets called when the recording has finished.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.120
Now honestly, this seems like a method we could use in our class.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.920
Record sounds view controller.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.580
Remember the situation where our user would record a five minute long

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.520
conversation with a friend on their app?

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.950
If somehow we had access to this method,

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.320
it could tell us exactly when the audio was recorded successfully, so

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.010
then we could do things with that audio, for instance, playback.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.630
So then, why doesn't av audio recorder just tell our class that hey.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.460
Audio has been recorded successfully.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.510
Well, one reason for that is that we wrote our class today.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.280
And this class, AVAudioRecorder, was written by an Apple engineer years ago.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.130
At the time they wrote this class,

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.520
they had no idea we would be writing our class.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.220
And that we would call it record sounds view controller.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.440
One way Apple decided to overcome this problem,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.110
was by delegating the implementation of methods like this, to classes like ours.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.790
Our class record sounds view controller can take advantage of this method,

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.750
if we become a delegate of AV audio recorder.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.940
So to make this boss, employee, or

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.010
delegate relationship work in our code, we have to do two things.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.600
The first thing we have to do, is to change the definition of record sounds view

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.840
controller by adding this thing av audio recorder delegate to it.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.750
The second thing we have to do is, somewhere in our class,

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.100
we have to write this line of code: audio recorder dot delegate equal to self.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.010
Self here means record sounds view controller.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.010
And what this statement is saying is that RecordSoundsViewController is now

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.310
the delegate of audioRecorder.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.730
After we have done these two things, we can then implement the function

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.110
audioRecorderDidFinishRecording inside our class.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.870
So in the next video, we will add these two things to our code.
