00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.300
So we're in a predicament. We want a small bin size to have as much detail as

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.430
possible about the location of data values, relative to the rest of the

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.276
distribution. But eventually, we start losing the shape of the distribution. But

00:00:13.276 --> 00:00:17.546
if we have a large bin size, then we can't tell the proportion less than any

00:00:17.546 --> 00:00:22.766
data value. We're going to handle this conundrum using a theoretical model for

00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:28.261
our distributions. This model is a smooth curve that uses relative frequencies.

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:33.481
This is a theoretically continuous distribution that can be described with an

00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:38.322
equation. This simple feature, an equation, allows us to calculate the

00:00:38.322 --> 00:00:43.720
proportion between any two values on the x axis. We're not going to discuss or

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.494
analyze this equation in this class, but we can definitely go in depth into

00:00:48.494 --> 00:00:53.157
forms if you'd like. Now what will be the area under this curve? This is a

00:00:53.157 --> 00:00:58.272
really tricky problem. Just remember that when we had a histogram, what did all

00:00:58.272 --> 00:01:00.496
the relative frequencies add to?
