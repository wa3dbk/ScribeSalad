&gt;&gt; Now remember, Hart and Risley had families of a professional status,

00:00:03.621 --> 00:00:08.962
middle-class, or welfare. And what they found was that, children from

00:00:08.962 --> 00:00:16.119
professional families heard, on average, 2,153 words per hour. Children in the

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:23.608
middle-class family heard on average 1,251 words per hour. And, the children in

00:00:23.608 --> 00:00:29.720
the welfare families heard on average 616 words per hour. Therefore, we see

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.689
that the type of family that the child was in had a great impact on the overall

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:39.226
number of words that they heard. But, that's not all. That means that, for

00:00:39.226 --> 00:00:43.782
children in a professional family they had approximately 11,000,000 words per

00:00:43.782 --> 00:00:49.744
year. those in the middle class family heard approximately 6,000,000 per year

00:00:49.744 --> 00:00:54.702
and finally those in the welfare group heard approximately 3,000,000 words per

00:00:54.702 --> 00:01:00.463
year. Hart and recently found that by age four, the children from the welfare

00:01:00.463 --> 00:01:04.492
families could have heard about 30,000,000 fewer words, compared to those in

00:01:04.492 --> 00:01:10.638
the professional family. But that's not all. Let's look at one more important

00:01:10.638 --> 00:01:12.180
finding from Hart and Risley.
