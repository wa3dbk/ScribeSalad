00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.328
For the most part, we're going to focus on normally distributed data. There are

00:00:05.328 --> 00:00:10.802
many kinds of normal distributions. Stretched, skinny, or maybe somewhere in the

00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:15.893
middle. But the area underneath will always be 1, or 100%. You've also seen

00:00:15.893 --> 00:00:21.028
before that in a normally distributed data set, the mean, median, and mode are

00:00:21.028 --> 00:00:26.381
approximately equal. In our theoretical model, they're exactly equal. Our

00:00:26.381 --> 00:00:31.872
theoretical model is perfectly symmetrical. This doesn't usually happen in real

00:00:31.872 --> 00:00:37.479
life. These models approximate our real distributions. But we can usually get

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:43.446
pretty good approximations. And in our theoretical model, most of the data is in

00:00:43.446 --> 00:00:49.029
the middle clustered around the mean, median and mode. You might recall from the

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:54.533
last lesson that approximately 68% lie within one standard deviation of the

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:58.812
mean. And 95% fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean.
