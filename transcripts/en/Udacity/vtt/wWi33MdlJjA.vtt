If you chose 24 minutes, nice work. I know that there's 60 minutes in an hour,

00:00:04.834 --> 00:00:09.619
so I need to split that 60 minutes up into five equal pieces. I know 60 divided

00:00:09.631 --> 00:00:14.221
by 5 is 12, so if I go 1 5th of an hour, I've just gone 12 minutes. But I need 2

00:00:14.233 --> 00:00:18.867
5ths an hour, I need double that. So to go 2 5ths in an hour, I need to go 2

00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:24.044
times 12 minutes, so I need to go 24 minutes. 2 5ths of an hour is really just

00:00:24.056 --> 00:00:24.688
24 minutes.
