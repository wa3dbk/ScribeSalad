00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.170
If we know that we want the distance between x and 4 to be greater than or equal

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.262
to 5, then we just start at 4 and count over 5 in one direction, and then shade

00:00:08.262 --> 00:00:12.675
in everything beyond that. So we get to negative 1, want to shade in everything

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:16.758
to the left of that, since we want to be further away from 4. And we also want

00:00:16.758 --> 00:00:21.182
to include this point, because we have a greater than or equal to sign. And do

00:00:21.182 --> 00:00:25.713
the same thing in the other direction. Get up to 9. We know we want to go beyond

00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:30.069
that, but then also of course, include it. So, here is what you should have

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:30.574
marked.
