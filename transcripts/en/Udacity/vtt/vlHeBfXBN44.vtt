00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.310
Okay, so we've got our awesome
prototype, and we've got our excitement.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.170
And we know what information we want to
get out of the user research process.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.720
We're all ready to go.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.190
The only problem is we haven't
found any users to test with yet.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.170
Where do we find those users?

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.220
Remember the idea of
circles of feedback?

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.360
In this version of the app,

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.050
we're going to target the circle
that is closest to you.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.680
That means friends, family or coworkers.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.760
However, we don't want just anyone.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.070
Some people don't always
give good feedback.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.840
For instance, my dad will pretty
much always tell me that anything I

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.950
build is great, so
I can't rely on him for

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.619
feedback on what's
wrong with an app idea.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.635
Also, people who are technical or design
focused will often delve straight into

00:00:37.635 --> 00:00:40.930
solutions without giving
their raw reactions.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.640
This means that their feedback is
often less valuable at this stage.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.600
The ideal person to ask for feedback
on the app concept and execution

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.400
is someone close to you who does not
build app or design apps on their own.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.960
If you work in an office, HR and

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.890
marketing can often give
really good user feedback.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.060
If you don't,
you can often find a family member or

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.010
friend who is not in
the business of building apps.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.910
Oh, and one more thing, be sure that
this is someone you have easy access to.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.600
Prototyping is a fast process, and

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.350
you'll want to get feedback
as soon as possible.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.380
Ideally, this is someone you
can talk to later today.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.480
A family member in a faraway land
is not going to be quite as helpful

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.930
as your neighbor who
you can talk to now.
