00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's take our usual approach--

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
start making an inventory of concepts and figure how to represent them.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We want to represent a person, a collection of people,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and probably it looks like we want to have two collections of people.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
One, the collection of people on the here side,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and one, the collection of people on the there side.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We also need to represent the light or the torch.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
From there it seems like that's about it,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and the other concepts we need are the concepts we already had

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
of states and paths.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Now, how about the representation choices.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
For person, well, I hate to reduce people to numbers,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
but in this case that seems like the perfect thing to do.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This person, regardless of all his wonderful individual qualities,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
we can just represent by the number 5.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
How about a collection of people?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We could represent a collection as a tuple--1, 2, 5, 10--

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
as a list, as a set. There's also this data type in Python called a frozen set.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
What I want you to tell me is of these four, which do you think would be okay for representations

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
just in terms of being able to to manipulate them and calculate the successors.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Which of these are hashable?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Hashable is important, because if we're going to use the same type of technique we used before

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
for our search we had our explored set, which was a set of states,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and members of a set have to be hashable.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
That's a property that we might want to worry about.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Now, I should say one more thing

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
in that the description of the problem it was explicitly stated that each of the people

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
has different speeds.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
That bothered me a little bit, because I could certainly imagine two people having the same speed.

00:01:58.000 --> 09:59:59.000
But let's just solve what we were asked to solve where every person has a distinct speed.
