00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.330
So if you're going to go into
the world of paid advertising,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.130
that's a huge world and
there's so much to learn there.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.910
And if you're on a budget, the key is
always targeting, targeting, targeting.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.510
So you need to figure out
who your best user is.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.440
So if you're selling a software for
businesses what kind of business is it?

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.480
How big are they?

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.110
How many employees do they have?

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.020
In what vertical do they operate?

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.480
Who's going to be that exact
science that's going to

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.635
make the most out of
what I'm offering them?

00:00:29.635 --> 00:00:32.215
And you want to target those guys
because you can't afford to spend

00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:33.725
money broadly.

00:00:33.725 --> 00:00:38.565
And once you have it,
try it with a little bit just spend

00:00:38.565 --> 00:00:41.955
a little bit of money and see what you
get and optimize, optimize, optimize.

00:00:41.955 --> 00:00:45.735
And then you'll potentially be
able to get some clients that

00:00:45.735 --> 00:00:46.985
will use your product.

00:00:46.985 --> 00:00:52.130
When you do paid advertising what
you really want to do is experiment,

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.700
experiment, experiments.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.590
If you have 1,000 bucks, you want to
run 100 experiments for $10 each.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.620
Try different language,

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.040
try different imagery,
try different types of targeting.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.550
What you really want to do with that
kind of budget is not get as many users

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.220
as possible, it's just learn, learn
what works, learn what are the words?

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.070
What are the things that
will get people to sign up?

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.100
And out of those 100 experiments you
will see the one that works better and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.661
later on when you have budget
you'll know how to spend it.

00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:23.610
So platforms that will work well for

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.620
low budgets is an ever evolving thing,
right?

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.020
because new platforms keep coming up.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.560
And you kind of have to find the right
platform that's right for your product.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.220
But I think marketers have to keep their
eyes and ears open for what's the up and

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.860
coming platform, and
usually platforms that are new and

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.390
that have just opened up.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.080
A couple of years ago YouTube,

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.380
I don't know why they said they
haven't used it in a while,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.460
but a couple years ago getting YouTube
views, and targeting it down and

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.490
getting the right people to view
your video was really, really cheap,

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.930
it was just a few cents for
every video of view so that was YouTube.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.420
And it usually starts out when it's new
that there's not a lot of competition.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.190
So if you're the first one there
you'll get the cheapest prices.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.050
It was the same for
Facebook app install ads.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.720
That was a brilliant format and
Facebook started it a few years ago.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.870
And when it just came out,
it was so cheap and

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.910
you could take such advantage of that.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.690
And today, everybody’s there so
competition drives the prices up.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.380
So you kind of need to keep your
eyes open for what’s new and

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.050
what you can take advantage of.
