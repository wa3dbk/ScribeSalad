Our new equation for profit is going to look pretty much the same as the old

00:00:04.465 --> 00:00:09.137
one, except, we need to change this constant term on the end to be 10,000 lower

00:00:09.137 --> 00:00:13.892
than it was before. If Grant's rent increases, then his overall profit is going

00:00:13.892 --> 00:00:15.579
to decrease by a set amount.
