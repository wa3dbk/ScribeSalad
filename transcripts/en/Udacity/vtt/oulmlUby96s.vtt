00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
If we make analogy with natural languages,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:11.000
if expressions like "tmp" are noun phrases, then operators like "assignment"

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
are verbs and entire statements like tmp gets 5 are sentences.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This whole thing together is a statement.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It involves two expressions--tmp an identifier, 5 a number--

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and an operator--the assignment operator.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Just as I might write the English sentence, j becomes 3--perhaps it's her birthday today,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I can write the JavaScript assignment statement, j becomes 3.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
J is assigned the value 3.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Similarity between the syntactic elements--the subject, verb, object, and punctuation.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Subject- verb, object, and punctuation.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Identifier, operator, expression, semicolon is relatively direct.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Now that we have an intuition for statements, let's add them to our JavaScript formal grammar.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
One of the most common kinds of statements is the assignment statement

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
where we have an identifier on a left-hand side of an equal sign

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and then an arbitrary expression on the right--x becomes equal to 5.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Another kind of statement is the return statement.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
At the end of absolute value or Fibonacci or factorial or almost any function or procedure

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
we want to return with the final value, return an arbitrary expression

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
that becomes the value of the function.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
There are also statements that influence what gets executed and under which conditions.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Formally, these statements are said to refer to control flow

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
because they guard how execution flows through your procedure.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The if statement checks to see if a certain expression is true,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and if it's true, then we execute the then branch.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
There is also an if then else.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
If the expression is true the then branch else the else branch.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I haven't said what a compound statement is, although since we've seen JavaScript before

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
we're going to guess that it involves those curly braces.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Let's write it out right now.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
A compound statement is an opening curly brace, a closing curly brace,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and some statements in the middle.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
This is a list of statements terminated by semicolons. I'm going to show you how that works.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Here I've added a recursive grammar rule.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Statements can be one statement followed by a semicolon followed by

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
as many more statements as you like,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
or you can decide that you're done and replace it with nothing.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Or if you like, we'll draw the epsilon there to mean the empty string.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
For the subset of JavaScript that we'll be handling in this class,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
this grammar gives more details about what's possible.

00:02:36.000 --> 99:59:59.999
In addition to expressions, we have statements that build upon expressions.
