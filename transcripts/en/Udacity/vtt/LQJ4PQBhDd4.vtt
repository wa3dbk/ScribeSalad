00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.870
Okay, so this is the quiz. Assume that you

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.170
have two coins, A and B. Both are fair coins,

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.700
and you flip both A and B. We will assume

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.210
in this case that A gives us no information about

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.690
B, which is how it works in the real

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.440
world. So the probability of A and B is 0.5.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.730
Try to find out the joint probability of AB, conditional

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.260
probability of A given B. The entropy of A, B,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.040
and the joined entropy, the condition

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.590
entropy and imaging information. 'Kay, refer to

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.650
the nodes or formulas from previous videos and try to answer these questions.
