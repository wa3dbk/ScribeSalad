This data, is what's called normally distributed. That's very important. A

00:00:05.098 --> 00:00:10.370
normal distribution has one peak right here, called the mode. And it looks like

00:00:10.382 --> 00:00:14.766
most scores fall at around 20%. And in fact, when you looked at the

00:00:14.778 --> 00:00:19.926
interactivate software in the last video, when I showed you the different bin

00:00:19.938 --> 00:00:25.935
sizes for this data, it said that the mean was 19.151, which is about 20%. The

00:00:25.947 --> 00:00:32.265
shape is roughly symmetrical. You can see that it follows a distribution that

00:00:32.277 --> 00:00:38.413
looks kind of like this. And, if you were to fold it across this line, it would

00:00:38.425 --> 00:00:43.133
pretty much overlap right on top of each other. Now 35 percent is out about

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:48.219
here, so we cannot say that the most common body fat percent is 35%. We can,

00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:53.808
however, say that most scores fall in the middle of the distribution. Here's the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.239
middle, and you can see that 64 approximately men fall right here in the middle

00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:05.916
with these 2 bins. Are there more scores between 15 and 25 than 35 and 50. 15

00:01:05.928 --> 00:01:12.197
and 25 covers this middle area here, but 35 and 50 goes from here out to about

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:18.553
here. So yes, we can say there are more scores between 15 and 25 than 35 to 50.

00:01:18.686 --> 00:01:25.773
How about between 0 and 10? Doesn't look like there are many scores, whereas

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:32.725
between 18 and 24, that covers pretty much this whole section, so no we cannot

00:01:32.737 --> 00:01:39.860
say this. And finally, do relatively fewer men have a body fat percentage above

00:01:39.872 --> 00:01:45.797
35, or below 5%? Yes, only a few men have that body fat percentage.
