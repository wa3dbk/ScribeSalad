00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.880
Happy birthday!

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.490
The zoo has some new-born baby possums.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.380
Let's add them to the database.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.140
To do that, we need a different SQL
statement, the insert statement.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.120
Insert adds a row to a table.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.870
When you write an insert,
you tell the database,

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.880
what values to put into
the columns of that table.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.650
If the new values aren't in the same
order, as the table's columns,.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.540
Then you also have to tell it
what columns they go into.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.880
On the next page,
you'll see two queries in the editor.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.620
One of them is the select query and
the other is an insert.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.610
Your job is to fill in the second query,
with the right insert statement.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.530
When you press the test run or
submit button, you'll see the results of

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.790
the select before the insert, and
then the results after the insert.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.130
And here's what we'd like to do.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.840
Find the opossums that
are already in the table, and

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.760
add the newborn opossum to the table.
