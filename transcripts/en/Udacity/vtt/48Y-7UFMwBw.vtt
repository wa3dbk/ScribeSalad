00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.705
The answer is this one. Y minus k equals a times the quantity x minus h squared.

00:00:04.705 --> 00:00:09.247
This is almost the same as the equation that we were working with, in the last

00:00:09.247 --> 00:00:13.910
lesson. Remember that we kept talking about the form y minus k equals x minus h

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.444
squared. And this was used for parabolas that had a leading coefficient of 1. So

00:00:18.444 --> 00:00:22.776
this makes perfect sense that if we have a leading coefficent of a instead of 1.

00:00:22.776 --> 00:00:26.754
We would modify the equation like this. Now, 2 of these equations here are

00:00:26.754 --> 00:00:31.131
actually not correct mathematical representations of what we're looking for.

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:35.311
This one, y minus k equasl ax minus h. Doesn't graph a parabola at all. We can

00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:38.901
see that we only have an x to the first term, not an x to the second term. So

00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:42.756
this is a linear equation. That means it definitely can't be right. And the last

00:00:42.756 --> 00:00:46.642
one right here doesn't have the correct placement of the leading coefficient of

00:00:46.642 --> 00:00:50.100
a, as we can see from the last example we did. The second choice is

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.388
mathematically equivalent to the third one, the correct one, except here, like

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:58.228
we saw in the last quiz, we can't directly read off the coordinates of the

00:00:58.228 --> 00:01:02.335
vertex, or we wouldn't be able to if we had actual numbers plugged in. So this

00:01:02.335 --> 00:01:03.384
is the best choice.
