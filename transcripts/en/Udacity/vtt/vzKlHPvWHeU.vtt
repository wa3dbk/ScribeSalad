00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
So let's take a look at our Jersey Square team and see what they've done with channels.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.690
By the time they've gotten to this part in the canvas, they've actually recognized that

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.800
besides working on channels they actually have two distinct customer segments,

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.510
sport jersey owners and single-game attendees.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.740
And just if you remember, by the time you understand you have multiple segments,

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.910
that means you need multiple value propositions and multiple revenue streams.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.620
And you might also have multiple channels in customer relationships but at least at this point

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.500
and they're thinking the only thing that matches the channels are the value prop and revenue streams.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.530
And so let's see what they've learned about the channels.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.710
In getting out of the building, they understood that both segments, the sports jersey owners

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.510
and the single-game attendees, really liked the idea of going to their website

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.510
and actually being able to buy or rent a jersey.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:05.069
But their hypothesis that stadium shop owners and vendors would be a channel and/or a partner

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:07.490
early on turned out to be incorrect.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.940
In talking to those two channels, they discovered that they viewed Jersey Square

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:19.220
as a potential competitor and they also understood the sales cycle of selling to them as a channel

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.440
but it was going to be a lot longer than they had to start up their company.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.200
And so they kind of put this off the list for now and they might get back to this later.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.290
They also started looking at direct mail and realized that direct mail was nothing more than a potential

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.990
customer acquisition activity rather than a channel itself so that just left them with a direct website

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.780
and potentially ticket websites and remember your goal as a start up is not to make

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.050
the longest list of potential channels but in fact to narrow down

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.680
what is it you're going to be focusing on in your early days.
