00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.150
A worm's spread on the internet has

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.780
the following life cycle. First, the infected machine

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.660
might scan other machines on the internet

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.980
to discover vulnerable hosts and subsequently infect the

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.000
vulnerable machines that it discovers via remote

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.010
exploit. Let's take a look at a couple

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.510
of well known early worms and how they spread, as well as how one might design

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.280
a super fast spreading worm.
