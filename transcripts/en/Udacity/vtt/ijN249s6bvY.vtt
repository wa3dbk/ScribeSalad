00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.370
Let us look at the algorithm for incremental concept learning more systematical

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.010
in more detail. This time, imagine that there is an AI program, and there is

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.810
a teacher which is going to teach the AI program about the concept of an arch.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.600
So teaching this first example and suppose the teacher gives the example which

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.520
has four bricks in it. Two vertical bricks that are not touching each other and

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.568
there is a third brick on top of it and a fourth brick on top of it. To the AI

00:00:30.568 --> 00:00:35.657
program, the input may look a little bit like this, there are four bricks, A, B,

00:00:35.657 --> 00:00:40.750
C and D. And there are some relationships between these four blocks. So

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:47.020
brick C is on left of brick D. Brick C supports brick B. Brick D

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.930
supports brick B as well, and brick B supports brick A. This then is the input.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.680
What may the error program learn from this one, single example?

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.480
Not very much. For this one single example, the AI program can only variablize.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.820
There were these constants here, brick A, brick B, brick C, brick D.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.310
Instead, the AI program may be able to variablize these constants and say, well,

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.370
brick A is an instance of brick, and therefore, I just have brick here.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.100
Brick B is an instance of a brick. Therefore, I'll just have a brick here. So

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.500
now, I can have any brick in these spaces as long as these relationships hold,

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.450
it's an example of an arch. Note the first example was the positive example.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.090
Now we are going to see a series of positive and negative examples, and

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.740
each time we see an example, the AI program will either generalize or

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.580
specialize. If it sees a positive example, then it may generalize,

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.800
if the positive example is not covered by a current concept definition.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.870
If it sees a negative example, it may specialize the current definition of

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.290
the concept to exclude that negative example.
