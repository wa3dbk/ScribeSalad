00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.900
Welcome to lesson three. In this lesson, we'll learn how to investigate a

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.310
single variable within a data set. You'll

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.710
learn about visualizations like the box plot

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.980
and the histogram and you'll learn the R syntax to create them. But, before

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.510
we do that, let's hear from Dean about how he approaches looking at data.
