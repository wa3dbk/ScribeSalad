00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.859
And now for those steps.

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:04.520
First, we drag a table into
the view from the object menu.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.450
It'll automatically expand
to fill the whole view.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.715
You'll want to drag this upper border
down a bit so that it ends up a.

00:00:12.715 --> 00:00:14.275
Below the status bar.

00:00:14.275 --> 00:00:18.905
Next we bring up the constraints menu,
and add constraints for the borders.

00:00:18.905 --> 00:00:22.045
And once the table's in place,
we can connect the data source.

00:00:22.045 --> 00:00:25.800
So Ctrl-click on the table to open
up the pop-up connections menu.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.330
Then you can drag from this data source
property to the view controller icon.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.070
You're probably familiar
with those steps by now.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.010
Here come the two new steps.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.970
Add a cell to the table by going
to the attributes inspector, and

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.970
setting prototype cells to one.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.450
If you click on the cell,
you'll see it needs a reuse identifier.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.180
Let's go into the project navigator so

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.280
we can double check what the cell was
called in the Villan view controller.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.145
Here you can see the VillanCell.

00:00:54.145 --> 00:00:55.205
Is being dequeued.

00:00:58.845 --> 00:01:02.195
So, here we can see our reuse
identified to be VillainCell.

00:01:04.785 --> 00:01:07.920
By the way, when you're
entering text into these cells.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.490
Make sure you always hit return.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.950
Otherwise storyboard won't save it.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.140
This is weird behavior, and the source
of a lot of frustration for both new and

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.240
accomplished developers.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.510
And those are the steps for
setting up a table view in storyboard.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.030
So let's run it and see how it looks.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.640
So you can see that the pictures and
names are there, but

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.290
not the evil schemes.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.550
That's because of the cell style.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.520
If you go back into
the attributes inspector,

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.870
you will see this drop
down menu labeled style.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.540
Here you can see your options for
cell styles, and

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.040
we'll have more details on
that in the next section.
