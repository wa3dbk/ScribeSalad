00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.246
This parabola will open upward. Good hinking if you chose up. Now we haven't

00:00:06.246 --> 00:00:08.640
even covered this yet, so don't worry if you didn't get it right on your first

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.421
try. But what I wanted you to recall is that the number in front of the x

00:00:13.421 --> 00:00:19.110
squared term is the a value. This tells us about the parabola's direction.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.033
Since a equals two and is positive, we know the parabola will open up. And

00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:27.297
since the parabola was in the form y equals, we already knew that the parabola

00:00:27.297 --> 00:00:31.904
opened up, or it opened down. So left and right weren't really good options

00:00:31.904 --> 00:00:32.610
there.
