00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.380
Now recall, that we have actually
talked about five different steps

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.650
that are important in
creating a panorama.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.790
First, of course,
is being able to capture images.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.470
We've looked at how cameras work and

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.610
how we should be able to
use them to capture images.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.190
We'll talk a little bit about it again
here specific to panorama building.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.480
Then we have actually
discussed how to detect and

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.190
match features in images, a pair
of images or a sequence of images,

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.360
that will allow us to do alignment.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.030
Then, of course,
we talk about how we can warp

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.590
an image to align the images to kind of
have no kinds of ghostly artifacts.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.820
Then also, we actually looked
at how we can do blending,

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.970
both at the frequency level to
be able to kind of merge images,

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.130
we can fade images, and cut images.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.760
The final part, cropping,
you know how to do, it's rather easy.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.520
It's basically changing, of course,
the domain of the image itself,

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.080
that is finding the range at the,
at the number of columns and

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.130
number of pixels that we want to
actually use to do cropping.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.270
Cropping, of course, is the last step
and it's an optional step to be able to

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.330
kind of now just create a rectangular
image out of a series of images that we

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.210
use to build a panorama and in essence,
it's really about finding the right

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.460
number of rows and columns and the
pixels to create a rectangular image.
