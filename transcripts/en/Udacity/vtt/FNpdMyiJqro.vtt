00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.650
Today we'll talk about another method of learning,

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.340
called learning by correcting mistakes. An agent reaches a decision.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.650
The decision turns out to be incorrect, or sub optimal. Why did the agent make

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.150
that mistake? Can the agent correct its own knowledge and reasoning so

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.170
that it never makes that same mistake again? As an example, I'm driving and

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.740
I decide to change lanes. As I change lanes, I hear cars honking at me.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.400
Clearly I made a mistake. But what knowledge, what reasoning led to

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.800
that mistake? Can I correct it, so that I don't make the mistake again?

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.890
Learning to correct mistakes is our first lesson in meta-reasoning.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.940
We'll start today by revisiting explanation-based learning. Then we'll use

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.590
the explanations for isolating mistakes. This will be very similar diagnosis.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.300
Except that here we'll be using explanation for isolating mistakes.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.170
This will make it clear, why explanation is so central to knowledge based AI.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.360
Then we'll talk about how we can use explanations for correcting mistakes which

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.985
will set up the foundation for subsequent discussion on metareasoning.
