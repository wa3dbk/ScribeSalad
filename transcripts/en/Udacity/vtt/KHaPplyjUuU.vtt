00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.770
So this is how the Admin dashboard looks
after you first get your tracking ID.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.080
We're going to close this window,
just have some information,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.690
you can read it if you want,
I'm going to close it.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.376
So we're currently in the Admin tab and
if you click this button here.

00:00:14.376 --> 00:00:19.310
This arrow, left-pointing arrow, that
expands the Admin dashboard for you.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.410
And you see up here these tabs tell
you which dashboard you're in.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.800
Currently we're in the Admin dashboard.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.720
So the overall account is Whats for
dinner, and

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.330
within that account,
we can have multiple properties.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.060
But right now we only have one property,
DinnerApp.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.650
So basically, DinnerApp is our app.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.700
So if you click Property Settings,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.980
this pretty much takes you to
the settings for the property.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.680
This is where you come if you
want to find your tracking code.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.350
Here you see your Tracking ID.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.050
You can also go to
tracking code down here.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.660
This is where you started out, remember.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.840
So Google Analytics was
originally designed for websites.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.980
Before there ever were any Android apps.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.580
It's still a great tool for
tracking website data, but

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.620
it's become an equally amazing tool for
tracking mobile app data too.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.180
But there are still parts of
the Analytics dashboard that haven't yet

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.376
let go of their origins as a tool for
websites.

00:01:09.376 --> 00:01:14.700
The icon here, .js, is taken
from the web usage of Analytics.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.650
Websites use JavaScript code
to talk to Analytics, but for

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.330
mobile apps, of course,
JavaScript code is not needed.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.370
Don't worry, it's just an icon.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.580
So to get back to
the overall Admin dashboard,

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.470
you press this button here,
the arrow I mean.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.050
Let's take a look at the views section.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.170
By default, you get a view
called All Mobile App Data,

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.720
which, you guessed it, tracks all
the data from your mobile app.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.650
You can add more views if you like,
and set up filters.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.470
But one view will serve us just fine for
now.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.800
When you have some data to view
you can use the Reporting tab

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.360
here to explore the ways that
Users are using your app.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.790
No Users yet, but

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.180
that's not a surprise because we haven't
hooked the app up to Analytics yet.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.930
To get back to the admin dashboard,
go to the Admin tab.
