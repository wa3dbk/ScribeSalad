00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.830
So now let's look at what
kinds of faults can we have.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.520
We can classify the faults by cause,
and we can have a hardware fault

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.890
when the hardware of the system fails
to perform as it was designed to do.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.910
We can have design faults.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.140
For example, software bugs are design
faults, and also some of the hardware

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.000
design mistakes,
such as the famous Pantheon FDIV Bug,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.740
where this FDIV instruction was
not implemented correctly, so

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.110
if you gave it some
combinations of numbers,

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.190
you would get incorrect results,
and it was designed that way.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.270
Then we have operation faults.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.900
For example, operator and user mistakes.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.980
For example, the operator accidentally
tells the system to shut down, and now,

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.780
of course, it no longer provides the
service that it's supposed to provide.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.880
And then we can have environmental
faults, such as fire that

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.740
burns down the system, power failure,
sabotage of the system,

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.435
all things that in the environment may
cause the system to have an error,

00:01:02.435 --> 00:01:04.480
ar not perform the service.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.450
Note that these are all false.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.040
Some of them don't result in a failure.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.360
For example, the FDIV bug
doesn't result in a error or

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.218
a failure, if you never really use
the wrong combination of numbers for it.

00:01:18.218 --> 00:01:24.890
A software bug in a rarely used function
may never result in an actual error.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.200
Operator faults may not cause
a system to actually have an error.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.250
For example if you shut down the system,
but at this time, for example, nobody's

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.920
trying to use it to get service from it,
it might not be an actual failure.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.230
And then, we can have a fire but
if we protected our system from fire,

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.810
a fire in the system room may
not actually result in an error.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.770
For example we can have a switch
over to another system.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.950
Power failure can be mitigated so
it can be a fault, but

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.090
may not result in an error.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.510
For example,
if our battery power supply lasts

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.130
long enough to overcome
the power failure, and so on.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.310
So again these are faults
according to their cause.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.970
Any of these faults might result in
errors, and subsequently failures, but

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.210
for all of them it is possible
that we get a fault but

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.300
not an error or a failure.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.870
We can also classify faults by duration.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.740
For how long do we have
the fault condition?

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.330
For example we can
have a permanent fault.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.500
Once we have it,
it doesn't get corrected.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.000
An example of a permanent fault is
when we want to see what's inside

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.300
the processor and
now the processor is in four pieces and

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.370
we don't know how to
put it back together.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.110
We can have intermittent faults.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.345
They last for a limited duration
of time but they are recurring.

00:02:45.345 --> 00:02:50.410
So it's not like we get this type
of fault, and for a while it causes

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.200
things to not work fine, but then it
just disappears and never comes back.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.420
This is something like, every couple
of seconds something happens.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.130
A good example of intermittent fault
is when we overclock our system.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.730
It works fine then crashes,
then we reboot it, it works fine,

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:06.780
it crashes, and so on.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.970
So for a while it works fine, but
then the same type of problem recurs.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.460
And then finally we have the transient
faults, which are when it lasts for

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.625
while, then just goes away.

00:03:16.625 --> 00:03:21.020
A transient fault is for example,
when an alpha particle hits chips, so,

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.510
for a while,
it has all sorts of problems, but

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.345
then once we reboot it, it's no longer
going to have these problems and

00:03:27.345 --> 00:03:31.760
they're not going to occur again, until
much later when something else happens.
