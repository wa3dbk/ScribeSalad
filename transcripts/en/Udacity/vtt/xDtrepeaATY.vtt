00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.982
Many classes needed to collect objects of another class. Use an array list or

00:00:04.982 --> 00:00:10.043
maybe an array for the collecting. Supply a method for adding to the collection

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:15.256
so that it can get bigger over time. And depending on your problem, maybe you

00:00:15.256 --> 00:00:20.680
want to have a method from removing items from the collection. You'll want to

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.133
supply some methods to find out about the contents. Maybe something that prints

00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:33.610
the contents, maybe to test whether a given value is in the collection. That

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.624
depends on the individual situation. And here's a bonus tip when you declare

00:00:38.624 --> 00:00:43.860
that array list or array, don't forget to initialize it in the constructor.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.640
because otherwise it will be null, and when you add the first element, you'll

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.620
get a null pointer exception. Sadly that happens to me a lot. So let's practice

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.658
that with another variation of the car class. In this case we want to collect

00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:03.722
the names of the passengers. And I've already declared an array list of strings

00:01:03.722 --> 00:01:09.380
for you. So that's the instance variable. And your task is to update that

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.344
instance variable in a couple of methods.
