00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Here we have a scatter plot of the height of adults versus their height as children.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:18.000
What I'd like you to tell me is whether the standard deviation of adult heights

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
or the standard deviation of children's heights is larger.

00:00:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Please check the variable that has the greater standard deviation.
