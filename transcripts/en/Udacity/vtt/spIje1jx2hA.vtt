00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.319
If I decided to use a static variable to do this, then in the constructor, I

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:09.030
would want to start with last assigned ID as zero. Now whenever a person is

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.593
created, the constructor is called. We increment the last assigned ID and use

00:00:14.593 --> 00:00:20.843
the value of last assigned ID as the ID for the person being instantiated.
