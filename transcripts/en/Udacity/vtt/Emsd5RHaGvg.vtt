00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.470
Let's jump in to some real code and
add a service worker to our Weather App.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.970
The first thing we need to do
is register our service worker.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.110
But wait, what if the browser
doesn't support service workers?

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.720
We want to progressively
add features and

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.190
we only want to do this if
the browser support service workers.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.619
Using progressive enhancement
like this has little overhead and

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.370
won't break in older browsers.
