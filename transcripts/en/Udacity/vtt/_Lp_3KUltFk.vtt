00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.610
Okay, I hope you're enjoying the course so far.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.340
Here's an exercise that'll give you a chance to do

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.670
some data wrangling using the XLRD module in Python.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.050
What I'd like you to do here, is read through

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.580
the aircot hourly load file. This file here, and report the time stamp,

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.310
which is stored in this column, and load for the min, max, and

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.310
average values from this column. From the coast region of Texas. Let's

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.660
quickly take a look at the code provided. What I'd

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.080
like you to look at first are the assertions here

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.730
at the bottom. This gives you an idea for the

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.430
type of values you need to produce. What I'd like you

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.890
to do here, is find the max value in that

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.680
column B, the coast region. And then, for that max

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.540
value, find the value on column to the left where

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.250
the time stamp is stored. And report it as a tuple,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.180
just like we did when we were looking at our example of how

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.690
to use XLRD. In order to complete this exercise, you'll be working in

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.240
the Parse File function. And you need to pull out values that will

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.720
allow you to complete this data dictionary

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.340
right here, which is going to be returned.
