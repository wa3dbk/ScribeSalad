In this session we're going to take a look at shadows. This is a little

00:00:03.221 --> 00:00:07.854
environment i built and it's being lit by a directional light. When doing

00:00:07.854 --> 00:00:11.550
trivial graphics rendering, which I'm doing here, shadowing is typically not

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.575
supported. For instance we can see that light leaks in under the little roof in

00:00:15.575 --> 00:00:23.672
the back of the scene. so let's lay a little shadowing. Now we can see that the

00:00:23.672 --> 00:00:28.579
scene is being properly shadowed. Parts of the environment that were previously

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.580
incorrectly lit are now dark. This happens because we are now disabling light

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.400
if there is something between the light source and the geometry. By rotating

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.440
the light, we can also place the shadow where we want it. But there is still

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.034
something wrong with the shadows. View live shadows are typically not as sharp

00:00:45.034 --> 00:00:54.132
as what we see here. Now we have enabled soft shadows. This looks much more

00:00:54.132 --> 00:00:58.314
realistic. Perfectly sharp shadows come from assuming the light sources

00:00:58.314 --> 00:01:03.220
infinite this small. In real life, light sources have size. And by taking it in

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.874
consideration, we get a soft shadow border. This shadow border separates the

00:01:07.874 --> 00:01:12.566
shadow into two parts. We call the completely shadowed area the umbra. And the

00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:17.390
soft part with the gradient the penumbra. The penumbra happens in regions of

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.244
the surface where the light source is being partially occluded. Also note how

00:01:22.244 --> 00:01:25.592
the penumbra has been small when the lit point is close to the occluder, and

00:01:25.592 --> 00:01:32.004
large when it's farther away. This wraps up the part about shadowing. Thanks

00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:33.030
for your attention
