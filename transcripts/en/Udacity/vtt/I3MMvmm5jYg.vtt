00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.160
The use of object orientation and object oriented

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.430
concepts led to what we call OOAD, object oriented

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.650
analysis and design. OOAD is a software engineering approach

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.790
whose main characteristics is to model a software system

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.600
as a group of interacting objects, and we'll

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.160
see what that means. In particular, in this lesson

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.590
we will specifically focus on the first part of

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.360
this, object oriented analysis, which is a requirements analysis

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.650
technique that concentrates on modeling real world objects. And

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.340
as I usually like to do, I would like

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.812
to start by providing some historical perspective on object

00:00:34.812 --> 00:00:37.472
oriented analysis to better understand how we went from a

00:00:37.472 --> 00:00:40.990
function-centric world to a data-centric world. And several people

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.800
contributed to this shift in perspective, but I'd like

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.960
to mention a few that were particularly influential. Starting

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.540
from James Rumbaugh, which in the 90s developed an integrated

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.900
approach to object oriented modelling with three main aspects.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.680
A data aspect, so the modelling was based on

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.390
using an extended version of entity relationship diagrams to

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.680
describe classes and inheritance. So that's what was called

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.770
the object model. And the second aspect has to

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.770
do with functions. So data flow diagrams were used

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.850
to represent the functional aspects of the system, where

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.070
each function was then becoming a method in a class.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.500
So this is what is called the functional model.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.120
So object model and functional model. The third model

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.120
in Rumbaugh's methodology had to do with control. So

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.301
it was representing the dynamic aspects of a system. And

00:01:29.301 --> 00:01:31.880
it uses state machines, which we'll cover in more

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.730
detail, to represent how a system would evolve going from

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.650
one state to the other based on what happened

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.260
to the system. These three models together represented what was

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.950
called the Object Modeling Technique, or OMT. And

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.860
OMT combined with contributions from several people, and in

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.290
particular Jacobson and Booch, evolved into what we call

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.910
the Unified Modeling Language, which is UML, which is

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.910
probably the modeling language that most of you

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.480
are familiar with. UML extends OMT by providing more

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.460
diagrams and a broader view of a system from

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.270
multiple perspectives. So, in the second part of the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.850
lesson, we will cover some of these

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.530
diagrams in details, but before that, I'd like

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.215
to talk a little bit more about object

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:14.540
oriented analysis, and how we can perform it.
