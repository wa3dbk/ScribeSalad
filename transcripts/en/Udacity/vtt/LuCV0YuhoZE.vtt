00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.810
To continue through all the debuggers, I'm simply going to close the web

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.500
console and see what gets displayed in my chart.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.520
And as you can see here, we've drawn one blue circle for

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.340
every game of the World Cup throughout the years.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.990
Now, there's a few style issues, I'm going to clean up simply with some CSS.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.980
Mainly, the width of the access lines, the years on the x-axis, and

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.640
something you may not be able to notice here,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.230
is that there's a lot of overlap in the circles.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.230
So by adding some opacity to the circles, you can see similar to what we

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.776
saw in the Facebook IPO example, some overlap to know the density of points.

00:00:39.776 --> 00:00:45.910
So again, using CSS to style my axis and my SVG circles,

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:52.189
in my text, the chart looks much nicer and much crisper.

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:56.250
I don't want to go, spend the time to go through every one of the CSS changes

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.902
I've made, but if you're interested, and you're comfortable enough with CSS,

00:01:00.902 --> 00:01:03.259
I encourage you to look back at the files and

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:07.679
use the CSS resource we have provided, to understand better what's going on.

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:11.490
So after all of these updates, that we've made in D3,

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.626
we finally have a equivalent chart that we made in dimple js,

00:01:15.626 --> 00:01:20.979
with its short five lines, but again by converting our previous chart to D3,

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.765
it's going to allow us much more flexibility to add both interaction and

00:01:25.765 --> 00:01:28.795
to customize the look and feel of the chart.

00:01:28.795 --> 00:01:32.888
And when all is said and done, took only approximately 40 or

00:01:32.888 --> 00:01:37.147
more lines of D3 to recreate what we've done in dimple in five.

00:01:37.147 --> 00:01:40.126
But if you're going to be a stickler about it, each of

00:01:40.126 --> 00:01:45.050
these statements here technically is one line, one long chain of functions.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.790
But for clarity's sake, I've written every new function call on a new line
