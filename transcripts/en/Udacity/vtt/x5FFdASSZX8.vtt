00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
To make another case for explicit debugging,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
let me illustrate this with a game of Mastermind.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You know Mastermind, don't you?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Your opponent has 4 pins hidden behind a board,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and your job is to guess the colors of these pins.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So you come up with 1 trial, and you get points

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
for every color that's in the right position,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and for every color that's correct but not in the right position.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This is what your opponent tells you.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And so, you make 1 attempt after the other,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
until after normally 7 or 8 attempts or so,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
you finally guess the right combination.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Mastermind is a prime example of applying the scientific method:

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
coming up with 1 experiment after the other

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
to validate or reject a hypothesis on what's behind these bars,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and then based on your observations, you come up with a new hypothesis and a new hypothesis.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You literally refine your hypothesis until you find the answer.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Now, when you're playing Mastermind,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
you always record what you tried before and what the result was.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This is the same as explicit debugging.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
You write down what you do and what the result was.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And this is what makes you effective.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Not writing down what you do is like playing Mastermind with a blindfold,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
trying to remember all the combinations and all the results.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Sure, you can do that.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
You're a great thinker.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
You're a smart person.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
You could probably also play Mastermind blind.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
But why do that, if you can simply look at what you already did,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
interrupt the session at any time, and resume later at wish?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Think about your significant other and remove your blindfold.
