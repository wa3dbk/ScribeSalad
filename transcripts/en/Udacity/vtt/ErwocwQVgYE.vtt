00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.960
This is exactly what you did in Lesson 7, when you found where a sample mean

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.994
falls on the distribution of sample means. And then you used the z table to

00:00:08.994 --> 00:00:14.204
find the probability that you'll select a sample mean greater than that value.

00:00:14.204 --> 00:00:18.511
If you look in the z table for this z-score value, 2.44, you'll see that a

00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:26.240
proportion of 0.9927 is less than that z-score. That means the proportion

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:34.760
greater than 2.44 is 1 minus 0.9927, which is 0.0073. If our sample mean falls

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.420
within the critical region, we then conclude that this mean comes from an

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.830
entirely different distribution. In other words, the treated population.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.110
Another way to put it is that we believe that our treatment had an effect. Of

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.495
course, it is possible that we made a decision error. In other words, it's

00:00:52.495 --> 00:00:56.330
possible that we should have kept the null hypotheses, that there is no

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.490
significant difference, and that the only reason we got this sample mean was

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.129
due to chance, because there's a 0.0073% chance that we get at least this

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:11.720
sample mean. However, the chances are small, less than our alpha level.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.572
Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis. But again, we don't need to find the

00:01:16.572 --> 00:01:21.102
probability of obtaining at least the sample mean. All we need to know is that

00:01:21.102 --> 00:01:25.392
the z-score of the of the sample mean is greater than the z-critical value.

00:01:25.392 --> 00:01:31.714
2.44 is greater than 1.96. That alone tells us that our sample mean landed in

00:01:31.714 --> 00:01:35.930
the critical region and then we can reject the null.
