00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.250
In many situations, we need to match based

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.290
on inexact criteria, such as all people above a

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.210
certain age, or all cities with populations greater than

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.420
some number. MongoDB provides a variety of operator to

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.370
solve these and other types of problems. So

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.200
the idea with MongoDB operators is very similar to

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.890
what you find in programming languages, where you have

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.190
comparison operators, inequality operators, et cetera. MongoDB operators use

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.190
the same syntax as field names. And we distinguish operators from field names

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.670
using the dollar sign character. So, all operators have a leading dollar sign.
