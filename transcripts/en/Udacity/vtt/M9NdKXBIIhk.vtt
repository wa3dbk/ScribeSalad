00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:01.988
The top function takes 50% of the runtime,

00:00:01.988 --> 00:00:05.087
and that means that even if you made it go to 0 time,

00:00:05.087 --> 00:00:07.175
the program would only go twice as fast.

00:00:07.175 --> 00:00:09.528
So you'd get a 2x speedup.

00:00:09.528 --> 00:00:12.696
The top 3 functions between them take 50%, 20%, and 10%,

00:00:12.696 --> 00:00:14.563
or 80% of the total time.

00:00:14.563 --> 00:00:16.332
So if you were to make those all drop to 0,

00:00:16.332 --> 00:00:19.169
the program would be taking 20% of the time that it used to take

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:21.566
and you'd have gotten a 5x speed up.
