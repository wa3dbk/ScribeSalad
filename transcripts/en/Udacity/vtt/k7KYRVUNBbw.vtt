00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
Now, it turns out that the answer to both questions is k. Let's see why that is.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.430
Now remember a clique is a sub-graph in which all of the vertices in the sub-graph

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:18.430
are connected to all the other vertices in the sub-graph--like for example this sub-graph,

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.080
now might be part of a larger graph--we don't really need to know that,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.310
but this is a clique right in here.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:32.610
So if we color just one of these vertices like this, well then we can't color

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.320
any of the other vertices with that color.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.320
So we need as many colors as are in the largest clique and that would be k.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:48.190
Now, for the second question, let's say we know that the graph can be colored with at most k colors

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.800
and that's all we need--we don't need more than k colors.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:59.940
Well, then we know because the reason we just use--the largest clique can only have k vertices in it.

00:00:59.940 --> 99:59:59.000
So as otherwise we wouldn't be able to use k colors in order to color the graph.
