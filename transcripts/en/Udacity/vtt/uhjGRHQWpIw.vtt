00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
At this point we've seen how to handle static data,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
how to capture and replay user interaction

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and even a generic mechanism to record and replay the interaction with the environment.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Let me now briefly discuss some additional items

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that are of particular importance during debugging.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The key concept for all of these is to make non-deterministic behavior

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
deterministic and controllable at the same time.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
First, time. If your program depends on real dates and times,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
be sure to provide a means to set these, for diagnostic purposes.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
If it depends on real timing, make these limits controllable as well.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Second, randomness. If your program has planned, non-deterministic behavior,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
for instance, if you're building a game, ensure that you can reproduce this at will.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
If you use a pseudorandom generator, be sure to save its seed.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
If you use a true random generator, save the sequence of random numbers.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Third, schedules. Multithread programs may non-deterministically switch between threads.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Again, find means to make these thread switches deterministic.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Otherwise, you may run into hard-to-reproduce thread scheduling issues.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Fourth, physical influence.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Depending on your environment, it is possible

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that some physical influence causes software errors.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
If you place a strong alpha emitter on top of your CPU or your RAM,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
this will likely cause malfunctions.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Cosmic rays may also result in spurious errors.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
But this is more an electronics problem rather than a software problem,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
so we leave it as it is.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Fifth, debugging tools. Debuggers instument the code and alter its execution.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The least they do is to influence the real timing.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Therefore, they may induce Heisenbugs,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
again, bugs that appear or disappear when being observed.
