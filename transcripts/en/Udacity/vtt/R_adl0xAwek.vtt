00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.871
So even though something like the square root of 2 can't be simplified, some

00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:08.960
other square roots can. So let's figure out if we can simplify roots and how to

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.896
do that. We'll start with this one. We're going to use the product rule to help

00:00:13.896 --> 00:00:18.239
us simplify this radical. The product rule allows us to breakup a radical into

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:22.492
the multiplication of two separate radicals. So when we have two factors

00:00:22.492 --> 00:00:26.800
multiply together underneath the radical. We can take the square root of each

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.344
of them and multiply that result together. For example for the square root of

00:00:30.344 --> 00:00:35.550
100, we know this is really just 10. But we can find this answer another way.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.125
We know 100 is the same thing as 4 times 25. So we can break up this radical

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:44.315
and take the square root of each of the factors. The square root of 4 is 2, and

00:00:44.315 --> 00:00:47.560
the square root of 25 is 5, which leaves us with 2 times 5, which is 10, our

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.547
original answer. And these were perfect squares, so we were able to take out a

00:00:52.547 --> 00:00:57.202
factor in each case, the 2 and the 5. You'll notice that 75 is not a perfect

00:00:57.202 --> 00:01:02.134
square, but there is a perfect square as one of its factors. Use the product

00:01:02.134 --> 00:01:05.110
rule to break this up into 2 radicals, and then take the square root of one of

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.240
them. Leave any numbers that are not perfect squares, underneath the radical.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.743
When you're ready, write your answer here.
