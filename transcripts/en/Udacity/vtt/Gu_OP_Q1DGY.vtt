00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.500
So how do we analyze the data
because sometimes it can get, for

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.090
example, contradicting results.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.350
&gt;&gt; Yes so it highly you asked
before what they love to answer,

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.270
you know that by now, it depends.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:14.630
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.020
it highly depends on the question
that you're trying to answer, so

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.750
if you're trying to answer a question
such as which design is better?

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.290
Design A or design B?

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.580
There's not a lot of fancy
analysis that goes into that.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.810
You have numbers that can either show
you that it's either A, B, or a tie.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.400
&gt;&gt; So the majority of people decide?

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.130
&gt;&gt; If it's such a question that,
right, A or B.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.660
But a more complicated question would be
&gt;&gt; Do I

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.770
have a good idea or not or
what do people need?

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.590
That's hard, not the majority,
sometimes I call these head-bangers.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.880
When you see, only one person that does
something or behaves in a certain way,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.390
you only need one person to
understand okay, this is important.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.850
I don't care That the nine others
didn't demonstrate this behavior.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.672
I know that this is important.

00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:16.400
So it's not easy.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.570
It's a team effort.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.000
It's a team sport.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.670
Research is never the researcher's.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.688
If your startup is fancy
enough to have a researcher,

00:01:25.688 --> 00:01:28.750
it's not their responsibility.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.750
It's a team sport.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.650
So the data is not going to
be always very helpful.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.510
So what I like to do is have people
in the team be involved in that.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.730
If you have an engineer, if you have
a product manager, the entrepreneur

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:49.110
himself or herself, a designer,
a marketing person, whoever you have.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.280
Have all of these people coming
from all of these angles

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.940
observe the same behavior and
decide what's important here together.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.190
That's going to be the way to
analyze and synthesize the data.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.330
To decide together.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.540
It's not always clear.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.550
It's not always easy.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.060
I would say this is
the hardest part of research.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.460
Is understanding okay,
what is the result here?

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.970
What did we find out?

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.210
Sometimes, I use a tool that I created.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.823
I call it, the rainbow spreadsheet.

00:02:23.823 --> 00:02:28.320
So, the rainbow spreadsheet is
a spreadsheet that allows you to List

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.880
all the observations.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.210
Everything that you see,
all the behaviors that you see.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.920
And let's say you obverse, I don't know,
maybe five people, six people,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.732
and then you just highlight or

00:02:39.732 --> 00:02:44.169
color different cells to see which
participants we call them, people.

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:49.588
We invite to participate in research
demonstrated that behavior,

00:02:49.588 --> 00:02:55.300
and then you get some kind of
histogram of what happened most.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.460
And that's helpful in coming to
conclusions into what happened here and

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.070
what does it mean.
