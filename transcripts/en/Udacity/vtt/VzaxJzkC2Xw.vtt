00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.540
So let's discuss the answer for our manufacturing cost

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.710
quiz. We had a watch processor that was one millimeter

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.545
square in size,and a laptop processor that is 100

00:00:09.545 --> 00:00:13.370
millimeter squares in size. The question was, which of the

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.079
following is true? Is the cost of the laptop

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.477
processor about 100 times the cost of a watch processor?

00:00:19.477 --> 00:00:22.240
Is it more than that or less than that?

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.144
We have seen already that if we disregard the yield,

00:00:25.144 --> 00:00:29.302
the cost of a laptop processor would be about 100 times the cost of a watch

00:00:29.302 --> 00:00:33.429
processor. Just because the same cost wafer gets

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:37.310
divided into 100 more of these than of these.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.760
However, logic processors also result in lower yield.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.313
So, this is why the cost of laptop processor

00:00:44.313 --> 00:00:46.935
will be more than proportionately the cost of

00:00:46.935 --> 00:00:50.030
the watch processor and this is the correct answer.
