They said that the square root of a negative number belonged outside of the

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:08.320
portion of diagram that contains the real numbers. So in this area over here.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.346
And since we don't have a name for the type of numbers right now, we need to

00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:16.678
come up with one. And since these numbers are real numbers. You might as well

00:00:16.678 --> 00:00:20.638
call these numbers imaginary numbers, since they're not real. I think this is a

00:00:20.638 --> 00:00:24.702
pretty cool term. It's hard to even think about what the number that's imaginary

00:00:24.702 --> 00:00:28.474
means, or what it really is. We'll get a handle on this soon enough. For now

00:00:28.474 --> 00:00:32.543
though, let's talk about the simplest imaginary number we have. Well in my mind

00:00:32.543 --> 00:00:36.610
the simplest negative number I can think of is negative 1. The number related to

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.292
this that we're interested in then, is the square root of negative 1. Now

00:00:40.292 --> 00:00:44.012
because this is the simplest of that new type of numbers that we're talking

00:00:44.012 --> 00:00:48.430
about; the imaginary numbers, it gets a special name. It gets its own letter, i,

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.735
because it's the simplest imaginary number. Note that even though this is a

00:00:52.735 --> 00:00:57.345
letter representing a number, this is not a variable. It's a constant. Just like

00:00:57.345 --> 00:01:01.485
we have numbers like pi and e that also have letters going along with, with

00:01:01.485 --> 00:01:06.159
them. I is just representing the constant, the square root of -1.. So let's play

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.651
around with I a little bit. Since we know that i is just a number, albeit, a new

00:01:10.651 --> 00:01:14.756
kind of number, but still just a number. We should be able to take it to

00:01:14.756 --> 00:01:19.248
different powers. For each of these, I'd like you to write in what number you

00:01:19.248 --> 00:01:23.674
think it's equal to. So what is i to the 0, what is i to the 1, what is i to the

00:01:23.674 --> 00:01:28.284
2, etc. Now of course, since I is an imaginary number, we would assume that some

00:01:28.284 --> 00:01:32.837
of these answers at least, will be imaginary numbers as well. So I itself will

00:01:32.837 --> 00:01:37.492
probably appear somewhere in here. Remember though, that because this is just

00:01:37.492 --> 00:01:42.056
another number exponents work with it in exactly the same way. I to the five is

00:01:42.056 --> 00:01:47.062
just equal to I times itself five. Times. Or 5 i's multiplied together. I think

00:01:47.062 --> 00:01:52.096
you might see something interesting happen when you do these. Also 1 last note.

00:01:52.096 --> 00:01:56.880
If you ever feel tempted to write the square root of 1, just write i instead.
