00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.930
Let's discuss the solution to
our cache summary quiz part one.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.650
We have a 256-byte cache with 32 byte
lines, and 2-way set associative.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.300
We have a 32-bit address.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.870
We need to know which bits are tag,
index, and offset.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.190
Remember to always
start from the offset.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.180
Bits 0 through something are the offset.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:21.900
Which bit?

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.070
Well, 32 B is two to the fifth bytes.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.260
So we need 5 bits to tell us
which byte we have in a line.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.100
That means that we're talking
about bits 0 through 4.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.450
This is five bits because we begin at 0.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.610
The index bits are the next bits
in the order of significance.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.770
So they will begin at bit 5.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.980
The question is, how many do we need?

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.070
To determine that, we need to determine
how many sets do we have in this cache.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.690
The cache has 256 bytes
divided by 32 bytes.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.020
This is the number of lines,
and the result is 8.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.850
So we have 8 lines.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.960
It is a 2-way set associate cache,
so we have 8 over 2 sets.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.850
This is four.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.700
We need two bits to tell
us which set we have.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.880
So it's going to be bits 5 and 6, and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.209
that means that the tag bits
are starting from 7 all the way to 31.
