00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Alright, so the first problem is false,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and this comes from the definition of NP-completeness.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
By definition since SAT is in NP-complete,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
every problem in NP can be reduced to it in polynomial time,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
so there can't exist NP problems that can't be transformed

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
into SAT in polynomial time.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The second problem is also false.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Nondeterministic RAMs don't give different results for the same decision problem.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This is something that a lot of people have problems with,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
but the key is that  nondeterminism isn't the same thing as randomness.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
At each step, remember whenever the if better procedure is called,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
it makes the best possible decision,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
so it's not going to make a random one,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and it's going to make the same best possible decision every time,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
so it won't give different results for the same decision problem.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The third problem is also false.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
A problem with exponential possible solutions can only be in P if P equals NP.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
A good problem to see this on is sorting.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Whenever you sort a list of N elements, let's say,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
there are exponentially many different possible sorts,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
but actually, there are quite a few sorting algorithms that

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
can find the correct sort of an element list

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
in much shorter than exponential time,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
so this is actually not true.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The fourth problem, just like the other 3, is also false.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It is not true that every program that takes exponential time

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
on a deterministic machine can be made to run in

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
polynomial time on a nondeterministic machine,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and good examples of this are any program where the

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
output size is exponential in the input size.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
For example, if you have a list of N elements

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and then you want to print out all possible sub lists,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
then the fact that you have to print out every single possible sub list,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
of which there are exponentially many in the input size of the list,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
means that if better doesn't actually buy you anything.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
You still have to explore the entire exponential space,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
so even a nondeterministic machine

00:02:11.000 --> 99:59:59.000
will have to take exponential time in that case.
