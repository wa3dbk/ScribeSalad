00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay, this is the unit 4 homework solution.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
To recap, the first thing I wanted to do
is make a registration page.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This should look basically like the
homework 2, where we made the form.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So if you type in some junk, we get
the same error messages,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and if you type in a valid username and
password, and you submit,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
you get redirected to this welcome page, that says, 
welcome and then has the username in it,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.692
and the username this time is 
not included as a get parameter.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.876
It's actually included in a cookie,

00:00:27.876 --> 00:00:31.000
and I'm using this little cookie extension in 
Chrome so I can see the cookies,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.768
and in this case, you can see it included.

00:00:32.768 --> 00:00:34.000
This is supposed to be the user id 5.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
That is the hash of that as we 
discuss that technique in the lesson.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So let's look at the code for the first problem.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Once you solve this first registration 
part of the homework,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
the other 2 parts of the problem are 
very easy because they just kind of build

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
on the same code, so we're going to be going 
through a lot of code here for this first part.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The first thing I have is I have a secret,
which is just this random string

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.892
that we're going to use as our
hash secret for cookies.

00:00:56.892 --> 00:00:59.000
Normally I wouldn't store this in the 
same file as my code,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I'd probably store it in some other module
that's only on the production machines

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
or something like that,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
but for our purposes, it's fine just to stick it in here.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Again, a lot of this code you've seen
before, template directory stuff.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Here are 2 functions.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.876
You basically had quiz problems in 
the lesson for generating these functions

00:01:14.876 --> 00:01:19.000
for making a secure val, which takes a val
and just returns that value--a pipe,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.846
and then the hmac of that val.

00:01:21.846 --> 00:01:24.000
We did this in the lesson, so 
you should be familiar with this.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and then the function for taking one of 
those secure vals and making sure it's valid.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We split on the pipe.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
If a call makes a secure val on the value
we pulled out of the string,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
if it matches that string itself, it's valid.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
You've seen this functions.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.646
We did them in quizzes and we're going
to be using them in here.

00:01:39.646 --> 00:01:41.000
Here is this bloghandler.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.353
This is the class I've been using, kind 
of a parent class for all of my handlers.

00:01:44.353 --> 00:01:46.000
I added some more functions.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Write, render, stern, render--those are old.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I've added a function called set<u>secure</u>cookie,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
which basically sets a cookie whose
name is name and whose value is val.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
All it does is it basically gets the secure, 
calls make<u>secure</u>val on this val,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and then it stores that in a cookie.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and we store a cookie by just using 
'Set-Cookie' header,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and say name = val. Path = /.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
We could also include an expires time, 
but I didn't here so by default these cookies

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
are going to expire when we close the 
browser, which is fine for our purposes.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Then we have another function for 
reading a secure cookie.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
You give it a name, and if finds 
that cookie in the request.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
If that cookie exists, and that 
cookie passes check<u>secure</u>val,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
we return cookie_val,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
In Python you can use this kind of 
shortcut notation for saying,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
it's the equivalent of writing, if cookie<u>val 
and check</u>secure<u>val, return cookie</u>val.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.557
If 1 of these is false, we just return 
false or none or whatever.

00:02:42.557 --> 00:02:44.000
We've got this function login.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
This will be used for the second part of the
homework for actually doing logins,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and this just sets the cookie,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and we've got a function logout, which I 
believe is the third homework question.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
We'll come back to these.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I added this function initialize.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
You don't strictly need this.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Google App Engine is a function that 
gets called before every request,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and so what I have it do is check for the 
user cookie, which was called user_id.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
If it exists, store in self.user the actual user object, 
which we'll get to this in a second.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Now you don't have to do this, but I kind 
of did the more complicated route

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
where you have to login to enter things into 
the blog, and it keeps track of all the blog pages

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
where the user is and that sort of thing,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
so if you're going to have that structure where
once you're logged in every page

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
is a little bit different, it's handy to have
some sort of function like this

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
that gets run on every request and just 
checks to see if the user is logged in or not.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
That's what this initialize function does, and this 
function is called by the App Engine framework.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So we still have some of our blog stuff.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I've been doing all the
homeworks on the same file,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
so you'll see some of the other homeworks in here.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
We have this function make_salt.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
This was a quiz function, just to make a string of 5 letters.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
So that's what this does. This makes our salt.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
This function was also a quiz function, I believe,
for making a password hash.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
It takes a username and a password and
an optional parameter for salt,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and then returns the salt, the hash version
of the name, password, and salt.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
This is what we store in the database.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Then we have this other function, also
a quiz question from the lecture

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
of how to verify a password.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So it takes a name and a password 
and the value in the database,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and it makes sure the hash from the 
database matches the new hash created

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
based on what the user entered in.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Again, quiz question. You've seen that before.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Users_key--this creates the ancestor element in
the database to store all of our users.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Again, you don't have to do this.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
I like to have things a little bit organized,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
so again, I gave it a parameter and thinking maybe 
I'll have user groups in the future.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I don't right now. That's just how I did it.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Okay, so now we get to some interesting code.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
This is our user objects that we'll 
be storing in the database.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
so it inherits from db_model that's what 
makes it a data store object.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.567
and it has three parameters:

00:04:44.567 --> 00:04:47.102
it has a name, which is a string
property, required,

00:04:47.102 --> 00:04:49.960
a password hash, which is a 
string property, also required,

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.290
and an e-mail, which is a string
property, but not required.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.446
Now, remember, we don't actually 
store passwords in the database,

00:04:55.446 --> 00:04:58.718
we just store hash of the password. 
We can't grade that, we can't tell

00:04:58.718 --> 00:05:02.162
how you're storing stuff in the database,
well, we could, but you would have to

00:05:02.162 --> 00:05:05.294
write some other handlers or something...

00:05:05.294 --> 00:05:09.165
But this is how I'm doing it. 
And then I added a couple of functions

00:05:09.165 --> 00:05:13.275
on this class. They are kind of

00:05:13.275 --> 00:05:16.405
convenience functions. 
The syntax here, @classmethod

00:05:16.405 --> 00:05:19.679
this is called a decorator. I'm not
going to get into exactly what decorators

00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:25.919
are, but what classmethod does, is it says:
you can call this method, on this object.

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.923
It doesn't have to be instance of this object.
So normally you would say the first parameter

00:05:29.923 --> 00:05:33.234
on a method on a class itself, 
that's referring to yourself,

00:05:33.234 --> 00:05:37.263
that instance. In this case I call it 
"cls" for "class", which means it's

00:05:37.263 --> 00:05:43.842
referring to this class user, not an
actual instance of a user, these are objects

00:05:43.842 --> 00:05:49.405
So we can just say, user.byid, give it an ID,
and then we'll call this get<u>by</u>id function

00:05:49.405 --> 00:05:53.169
to load the user on to the database.
Get<u>by</u>id is built into the datastore.

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:56.597
If you recall from a previous homework, 
I had this kind of "make key" thing,

00:05:56.597 --> 00:05:59.511
and just called the "get" function, but 
that was before I learned about this

00:05:59.511 --> 00:06:03.826
get<u>by</u>id function, which is a more convenient
way of doing what we are doing now.

00:06:03.826 --> 00:06:06.823
I have another function called by_name, 
which looks up a user by its name.

00:06:06.823 --> 00:06:10.513
I'm using the datastore procedural code 
again for doing the database look up,

00:06:10.513 --> 00:06:14.302
instead of the GQL, because I prefer typing 
this, I think it's a little bit easier to read,

00:06:14.302 --> 00:06:18.220
and all you do is, you say, 
filter(name =', and then you can

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.797
give it another parameter, so this basically 
says, "select * from user, where

00:06:21.797 --> 00:06:26.016
name = name." We call "get" on that, 
which returns the first instance,

00:06:26.016 --> 00:06:27.292
It returns that.

00:06:27.292 --> 00:06:31.258
Another function I've added is this 
method called register, which takes

00:06:31.258 --> 00:06:34.016
a name, a password, and and e-mail, 
and creates a new user object.

00:06:34.016 --> 00:06:37.681
So the first thing it does is create 
a password hash for that name

00:06:37.681 --> 00:06:41.225
and password, and then it creates a 
user object. The parent is that user key,

00:06:41.225 --> 00:06:45.466
not required for you guys, 
name = name, pw<u>hash = pw</u>hash

00:06:45.466 --> 00:06:49.953
email = email. So that creates the
user. It doesn't actually store it

00:06:49.953 --> 00:06:52.227
in the database yet. 
It just creates the object.

00:06:52.227 --> 00:06:56.111
And here's another one, called "login". 
We'll come back to this one, but

00:06:56.111 --> 00:06:58.145
it's fairly self-explanatory, 
for the future homework.

00:06:58.145 --> 00:07:01.015
So now, let's go down to the handlers. 
You can see I've added three handlers

00:07:01.015 --> 00:07:03.852
for each of these three homework problems.
The first one we'll talk about is "signup",

00:07:03.852 --> 00:07:07.340
so /signup goes to the register handler,
let's take a look at that.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.891
Now, the register handler here 
inherits from the class "Signup".

00:07:10.891 --> 00:07:15.854
"Signup" is actually up here, 
and it's identical to what I had

00:07:15.854 --> 00:07:19.073
or, nearly identical to what I had
for the homework 2. Since I'm

00:07:19.073 --> 00:07:22.422
working in the same file I didn't want to
rewrite this whole class again.

00:07:22.422 --> 00:07:25.513
We are still rendering signup form, 
like we were before. We are still,

00:07:25.513 --> 00:07:28.445
I'm not going to go through this in great 
detail, but we still get all the values

00:07:28.445 --> 00:07:32.238
out of the request, we still check
to see if they are all valid, and

00:07:32.238 --> 00:07:35.783
if there is an error, we re-render the form, 
with the error messages and the values,

00:07:35.783 --> 00:07:39.445
just like we did before, and if there's
not an error, I call self.done,

00:07:39.445 --> 00:07:44.389
which in this class "Signup", doesn't do
anything, it just raises an error.

00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:48.236
And then I have two other classes that inherit
from "Signup" and overwrite this function

00:07:48.236 --> 00:07:53.433
"done". The first one is the Unit 2 "Signup" page,
and all that one does is, it redirects this

00:07:53.433 --> 00:07:56.935
/unit2welcome with the "get" parameter.
That's how we did the Unit 2 homework.

00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:59.676
The "register" one overwrites 
"done" to have different behavior.

00:07:59.676 --> 00:08:03.230
First, what it does, there's an extra 
error that can occur in this one,

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:07.223
in that the user can already exist, 
so what I do is I look up to see,

00:08:07.223 --> 00:08:11.399
"does that username already exist?"
And if it does, send an error message

00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:14.000
and I re-render that form.
error_username = msg, so

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.027
I probably could have done this a little 
bit more cleanly, but this is kind of just

00:08:17.027 --> 00:08:22.066
tax on an extra message, so this doesn't
appear to preserve the parameters

00:08:22.066 --> 00:08:25.204
if you enter in a different username.
It's a little bit less than ideal, I probably

00:08:25.204 --> 00:08:27.216
could have put some more things in there, 
but that's how we have it.

00:08:27.216 --> 00:08:31.135
Otherwise, if that error doesn't exist
we register the user, which creates

00:08:31.135 --> 00:08:33.130
a user object, and we actually store it 
in the database here.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:37.210
And then, what I do is, I call my "Login"
function, all the "Login" function does is

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:40.044
set the cookies. So, for the first homework
we may not have a "Login" function,

00:08:40.044 --> 00:08:43.419
you may actually just set the cookie here, and 
then we redirect it to the welcome page.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:46.385
But then I generalized it, when I did the 
"Login" version, and just made this work,

00:08:46.385 --> 00:08:50.933
this "login" function that multiple handlers 
can use, because we will have both the

00:08:50.933 --> 00:08:55.767
Sign up page for registering and signing in, 
and then we'll have just the "Login page",

00:08:55.767 --> 00:08:59.486
not for creating a new user, but signing
into an old one, and they can both use this

00:08:59.486 --> 00:09:02.351
"Login" function, and we'll go 
over that in a second.

00:09:02.351 --> 00:09:06.130
We redirect to /unit3welcome, 
which is down here, this handler,

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:09.350
Unit3Welcome, and all this does is, 
it checks to see if self.user, and

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:13.303
remember self.user gets set up in that 
initialize function, that's where it

00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:16.559
reads the cookie and makes sure that
the cookie is valid and sets the user

00:09:16.559 --> 00:09:20.310
on the handler, and since this 
Unit3Welcome inherits from BlogHandler,

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:24.104
it has access to that user, we render
our Welcome HTML, you can probably

00:09:24.104 --> 00:09:27.440
guess what's in there. With 
username = self.user.name,

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.276
Otherwise, we redirect to the Signup.

00:09:29.276 --> 00:09:32.276
Let's see that working one more time, 
again, now that you've seen the code.

00:09:32.276 --> 00:09:36.105
Okay, so if we enter a username
and a password, we should actually

00:09:36.105 --> 00:09:38.863
get an error message that this 
username already exists. And we do.

00:09:38.863 --> 00:09:42.283
And it cleared the form, because
I was a little bit lazy on this one,

00:09:42.283 --> 00:09:46.033
and didn't preserve all those parameters.
Although I easily could have, so,

00:09:46.033 --> 00:09:48.891
let's type a new username, and 
submit the form, and it worked!

00:09:48.891 --> 00:09:53.050
And if I were to, on this page, 
modify this cookie, change it to

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:57.470
user id 5, which is what we had before, 
and I were to reload this page,

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.812
we get redirected to the signup page, 
because the value in that cookie

00:10:00.812 --> 00:10:04.041
doesn't match the hash in that cookie, 
therefore is invalid, and we

00:10:04.041 --> 00:10:08.041
get bounced to the signup page.
So that is the first question in this homework.
