00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:05.790
Not necessarily. Remember, these data are purely correlational. We can't make

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.600
causal statements using these data, for the reasons described at the end of

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.130
lesson 14. Remember, correlation versus causation? Anyway, there are many

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.950
variations of multiple regression. Including ways of adding or dropping

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.900
predictor variables. Deciding what variables should be included in the final

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.030
equation, types of criterion variables, etcetera. It's often difficult to

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.189
account for all the possible factors that could influence the dependent

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.830
variable. Maybe if you go on to more advanced statistics classes, you'll get to

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.800
learn those methods, but now you have a basic understanding of a very complex

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.610
topic. Great job!
