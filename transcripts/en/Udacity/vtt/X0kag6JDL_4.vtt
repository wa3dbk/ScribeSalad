00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.753
Here are the answers.

00:00:01.753 --> 00:00:09.200
If u,v goes from A to B,
then u is reachable from s but v is not.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.350
We conclude that the edge u,v must
not be in the residual graph.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.830
So the edge must be saturated, and
the flow is equal to the capacity.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.650
If u,v happened not to
be in the original flow,

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.990
then the capacity would be 0 and
the equation still holds.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.910
If on the other hand u is in B and
v is in A,

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.350
then there can't be any
flow going from u to v.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.410
Otherwise, it would be possible
to unsend this flow and

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.710
the edge u,v would be
in the residual graph.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.430
So this tells us that there
is no flow going from B to A.
