Okay, so thus far, we've seen how inheritance

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.030
can help us with reusing instance variables. Now I

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.420
want to show you an example of how inheritance

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.790
can help with reusing methods. So here we are

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.710
back at the code, where we have a class

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.650
called Parent and a class called Child. And if

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.610
you recall, class Child inherits from class Parent. Now,

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.220
I'll begin by defining a simple instance method inside

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.160
class Parent. And I will call it show_info.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.000
The first argument of this method is self, and

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.020
all this method does is it prints out the last name and eye color of the parent.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.380
All right, there are the two print statements.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.970
Now to test to see if this method actually

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.910
works, I'm going to call this method show_info

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.190
using the parent's instance billy_cyrus. So let me do

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.135
that next. So there is that method. Now all I've done thus far is created a new

00:00:57.135 --> 00:01:01.060
method called show_info inside class Parent. And then

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.050
used an instance of class Parent, instance called billy_cyrus

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.130
to call that method. Now to be able to focus on this statement's output, I am

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.100
going to comment out the other instance statement for now. There. Let

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.570
me go ahead and save and run this program. Alright. So the program prints

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.660
out the correct values of billy_cyrus' last name and eye color. So far so good.
