00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.097
We know the boat travels upstream for 6 miles so here this is 6. The boat is

00:00:05.097 --> 00:00:08.330
going to travel the same distance to return back from where it started, so we

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.908
know the downstream distance must also equal 6. We know the boat travels 12

00:00:13.908 --> 00:00:17.762
miles per hour in still water. So that means with the current, we would add x

00:00:17.762 --> 00:00:22.585
going downstream and that means going against the current. We would subtract x,

00:00:22.585 --> 00:00:27.142
that would be moving upstream. The key idea is that for the boat's rate, we let

00:00:27.142 --> 00:00:32.164
the speed of the current equal x. So the boat would be traveling faster going

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:36.210
downstream, and slower going upstream. And finally, for our time column, we

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.513
know that we just need to take the distance, and divide it by the rate. So,

00:00:40.513 --> 00:00:45.850
going upstream, the boat would take 6 divided by 12 minus x hours. And going

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.475
downstream, the boat would take 6 divided by 12 plus x hours. Fantastic work if

00:00:51.475 --> 00:00:54.960
you've done all these expressions, this is pretty tricky.
