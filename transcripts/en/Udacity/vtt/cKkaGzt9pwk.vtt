00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.490
So here's one way to define hashtable_lookup. So we're going to take

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.540
the table and the key. And the first step is to

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.960
find the bucket, so we'll use the hashtable_get_bucket that we defined

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.140
earlier for that, and store it in a variable called bucket.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.110
So we'll use hashtable_get_bucket to look up in the hashtable where

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.930
that key would occur, and we'll store that in the bucket.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.530
But now to do the lookup we need to go through

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.660
all the entries in that bucket, find one that matches the key.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.360
To do the lookup, we need to go through all the

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.502
entries in the bucket. So we'll use a for loop for that,

00:00:29.502 --> 00:00:33.540
going through the entries. For each entry, we need to check whether

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.950
the key part of that entry, matches the key, and remember the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.430
bucket was a list of entries. And each entry in the bucket

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.720
was a keyword in the value. In the case for our web

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.880
crawler, the value was a list of URLs. So if the entry

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.870
matches the key, so the first part of the entry is the

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.760
keyword, if that matches the key we're looking for, then what

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.080
we want to do is return the value. So that's the result

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.600
of entry position one. If it doesn't match, well then we

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.790
want to keep going, keep trying the next, we're going to keep going through

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.450
this for loop, checking all the entries in the bucket. When

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.870
we get to the end, we didn't find it, and what

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.400
we said in the question was if it's not in the

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.990
table, what we should do is output none, so now we'll return,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.440
the value none. So let's try that in the Python interpreter.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.170
So here's the code, we're defining a hashtable_lookup, we find the bucket,

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.480
we loop through all the entries in the bucket, if we

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.680
find one where the key matches, we return the value associated with

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.560
that key, otherwise we return none. When we got to the

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.290
end of the bucket without finding the entry, we know it couldn't

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.090
exist anywhere else in the hash table because the only place that

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.320
keyword could appear is in this bucket. We still have all the

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.870
same code from before, that makes the hashtable, that gets the

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.160
bucket and then adds to the table. And, we'll test it

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.730
using some of the code we wrote before. We're going to add

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.140
several words to our hashtable, and let's try looking up a

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.370
keyword. We'll look up udacity. And we get the value 23,

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.140
which is what we expect, that's the value that we associated

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.408
with udacity. So this is looking pretty good. We've got our

00:02:03.408 --> 00:02:06.490
hashtable almost working. The one problem is the one we mentioned

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.250
before, if we try to change the value

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.320
associated with udacity, and we're going to need to

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.680
do this for our web index, right? When we add all of the urls to the table,

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.786
we need to keep adding UR, URLs. We don't want to lose the one we have, but we

00:02:19.786 --> 00:02:21.979
want to change the value associated with, with that

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:24.710
keyword. Now, we do the look up again, and

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.010
we get the same result. And the reason we got the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.740
same result, if we look at the bucket in the hashtable that's

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.140
associated with the keyword udacity, well what we see is it's a

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.690
list of two elements. And because of the way we implemeneted add,

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.630
the newer one is later in that list, because of the way

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.290
we define lookup, it's always going to find the first one it matches.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.980
It's going through the entries in order. The first one that matches

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.590
it returns that value. So thats why we get the value 23.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.810
So we're really almost done, but we have to

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.240
make one other change. We want to change add to be

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.640
more like update. So instead of adding a new entry,

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.270
we want to update the value that's associated with that entry.
