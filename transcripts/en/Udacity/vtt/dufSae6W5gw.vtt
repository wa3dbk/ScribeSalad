00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.170
So the ADD is peer producing a value of R1.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.740
That is not a problem because the previous instruction is just for

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.770
using R2. So the ADD can't write its result when it's time. And when it,

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.790
it's executed in cycle three, so it's going to write in cycle five.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.240
Now let's look at this multiplication instruction over here.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.140
Remember, we can execute any number of instructions. In the, in the same cycle.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.580
The reason we had to delay the ADD is because it actually has this dependence

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.530
from R2 to R2. The multiplication is using only R3 and producing R3.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.750
Using R3 has no problem because neither the mul, nor the add are producing R3 so

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.800
this multiplication can actually execute in cycle two.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.880
And then, there is no problem with R3 here because there is only R1 and

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.710
R2, written by the previous instruction. So

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.054
this multiplication can actually write R3 in cycle four. Because it's like two,

00:00:52.054 --> 00:00:57.780
three, four. Now, let's look at this ADD here. It uses R1 and R3. The R1 it's

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.630
supposed to be using is produced by this ADD. Which executes in cycle three.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.300
The R3 is produced in cycle two by the multiplication. So this instruction

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.195
actually has to wait for cycle four because of this. Then it's going to be cycle

00:01:13.195 --> 00:01:16.860
five when it's in the MEM stage. And it's able to write its result in cycle six.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.180
It's going to override the result from the ADD here but because the ADD is

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.280
writing in cycle five. It's okay if we write in cycle six so everything is fine.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.300
Here we can write in cycle six. Now let's look at the multiplication here.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.450
It's using R4 none of the other instructions are producing R4.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.570
So it can also execute in the second cycle. It produces R4. None of the previous

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.866
instructions are writing it so we have, we don't have to wait for anything. So

00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:48.590
we can actually write our R4 in cycle four as well. Just like this amount here.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.260
And then finally let's look at this add here. It's using R1 from here.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.710
It's using R4 from here. So our execution has to be

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.150
in the cycle that follows the larger of these two. The larger is the cycle four,

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.410
so we have to begin our execution in cycle five here. At the end of cycle five,

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.180
then we will have the result. And the MEM, we can write the result in

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.670
cycle seven. But we have to check, is somebody else going to override it later.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.360
And that's not going to happen, because if we write here in cycle seven,

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.640
we are safe. This is the latest instruction, it should do the write of the,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.370
of the R1 at the latest time among all the other instructions. And if you

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.802
look at the previous instructions have written the results in cycle five and

00:02:29.802 --> 00:02:33.360
cycle six. So it's okay if we here write it in cycle seven.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.250
So this is the solution to the quiz.
