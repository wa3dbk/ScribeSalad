00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So for this question, your goal is to define a procedure, named "find_last," that takes as input 2 strings.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The first string is a search string; the second string is the target string.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And it outputs the last position in the search string where the target string appears, as long as it appears at least once.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
If it doesn't appear at all, then the output should be -1.
