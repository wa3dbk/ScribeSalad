00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.040
For the first example, if we drive more miles in a rental car the cost will

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.026
usually go up. Now I know most rental car companies have a flat fee but some

00:00:08.026 --> 00:00:11.994
also charge per mile and they might charge if you go over a certain number of

00:00:11.994 --> 00:00:16.894
miles. So in general, if the miles go up the cost also goes up. So that must be

00:00:16.894 --> 00:00:22.790
direct. The second example would be inverse let's say 2 people live together and

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.990
rent is $400 this would mean each person pays $200 but if we increase the number

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.190
of roommates let's say from 2 to 4 then people wouldn't pay $200 each they'd pay

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.607
less. Now instead of paying $200 each person would just pay $100. So as one

00:00:38.607 --> 00:00:44.100
quantity increases, the other decreases, inverse. The second case is another

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.702
example of inverse. As the speed of a vehicle increases, the time that we have

00:00:48.702 --> 00:00:53.095
to drive that vehicle decreases. And maybe you've never driven a car before. But

00:00:53.095 --> 00:00:56.633
you could still think about this if you were walking. If we walk slower or drive

00:00:56.633 --> 00:01:01.460
slower then that means our time would increase to get to our final destination.

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:05.376
One quantity is increasing while the other is decreasing. So that's definitely

00:01:05.376 --> 00:01:10.214
an inverse relationship. This fourth example is an example of direct. If we

00:01:10.214 --> 00:01:14.404
don't drive for a while, then we can't cover as much distance. So as one

00:01:14.404 --> 00:01:19.062
decreases, the other would decrease. Likewise, if we drive for a long time then

00:01:19.062 --> 00:01:23.846
we can cover more ground so this would be direct. For this last example if we

00:01:23.846 --> 00:01:28.520
make more money then we can spend more money. So that will be a example of the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.590
direct. If our arrows point in the same direction then we know it is a direct

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.878
relationship whereas if the arrows point in opposite directions we know it's an

00:01:36.878 --> 00:01:38.063
inverse variation.
