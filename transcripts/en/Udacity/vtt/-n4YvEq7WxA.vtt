00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.430
So, and I have a quiz, to see if you can figure out, either through experiments,

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.420
or logic alone. But probably you'll want to do some experiments. How default

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.892
parameters work and why there's certain pitfalls to using them. One issue some

00:00:09.892 --> 00:00:12.882
people have with the provided list depend method, is that it doesn't actually

00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:18.006
return anything. It's a really common mistake to assign to p the result of

00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:22.626
p.append. In this case, while p.append modifies the value of p, but it doesn't

00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:26.976
return the list p, it returns none. So after this the value of p will be none,

00:00:26.976 --> 00:00:30.894
which is probably not what we want. There are lots of situations where we might

00:00:30.894 --> 00:00:33.973
want to use append in this kind of functional way. We might want to pass in the

00:00:33.973 --> 00:00:37.150
result of appending to a new function. So I'm going to try to define a function

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.030
that does that. So I want a function, my-append, that behaves like this. If we

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.255
call it with just one parameter, it'll create a new list containing that as the

00:00:45.255 --> 00:00:48.846
only element. If we call it like this, passing in two parameters, the first one

00:00:48.846 --> 00:00:52.630
being orange, the second one, the result of my-append apple. Well then, what we

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.210
would like to get is a list containing the elements apple and orange. This will

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.670
allow us to write code in a fairly compact way. So we could try to define

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.006
my-append like this using a default parameter. This seems to almost work. So

00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:09.372
here, we'll call my-append as shown above. And we do indeed get the list apple,

00:01:09.372 --> 00:01:12.608
orange as desired. But there's something really broken about this code. And I

00:01:12.608 --> 00:01:15.220
want to see if you can figure out what it is. You may need to do a few

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.100
experiments to figure that out, but it should all make sense once you think it

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.326
through. Here are the choices. The default parameters initialized to empty list,

00:01:22.326 --> 00:01:25.844
but default parameters can only be None. The second choice is the default

00:01:25.844 --> 00:01:29.276
parameters initialized when the function is first called, and then, that same

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:32.510
value is reused each time. And the third choice is default list parameters

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.927
initialized when the function is defined and that same object is reused for each

00:01:35.927 --> 00:01:39.524
call. See if you can figure out which is the reason this code doesn't behave as

00:01:39.524 --> 00:01:40.003
desired.
