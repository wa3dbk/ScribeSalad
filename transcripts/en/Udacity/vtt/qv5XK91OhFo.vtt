00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.080
Okay. Let's add something new to our URLs called a

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.650
query parameter, also known as get parameters, and we'll talk

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.510
about this name shortly, when we start talking about HTTP.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.550
Here is an example. We've got our normal URL or the

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.170
type of, the simple URL we just discussed, with a,

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.410
a simple path slash foo and we've added to the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.150
end of this a question mark p equals one. And

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.600
this adds an actual, extra parameter whose name is P and

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.500
whose value is one. The format of a query parameter looks

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.670
like this. You've got name equals value, or in this case

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.410
P equals 1. And the value can be just about anything,

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.440
but it's good not to use question marks and other URL

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.440
characters, although you could if you really wanted. We can make

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.730
this a little bit more complicated by adding more query parameters.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.040
Let's do that. We've added a second query parameter. The first

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.220
query parameter is separated from the UR, URL using a, question

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.430
mark. All of the following parameters are separated from each other

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.370
using ampersands. First one gets a question mark. The next one

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.570
gets an ampersand. In this case, the new parameter is Q,

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.620
and it equals the string neat. So, we have these query

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.790
parameters. What are they for? They're for basically, when you, when

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.650
you make a request for this path, this is extra information

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.010
the server gets, and there's all sorts of things you can

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.440
do with this. If this is a, a web application doing fancy

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.050
things these parameters might mean something. It can affect the

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.700
caching because technically it changes the entire URL. So there

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.380
are all sorts of handy uses that we'll discuss later

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.040
in the class for what these query parameters can do. But

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.150
they are separate from the path. But they are included

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.720
in part of the whole URL that the server sees

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.870
when you make a request. In the following URL, what

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.500
is the value of the Z parameter? Here is your URL.
