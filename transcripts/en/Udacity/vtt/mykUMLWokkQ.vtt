00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.490
But wait, there's more!

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.850
The Sharpe ratio for
the same asset can vary widely,

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.500
depending on how
frequently you sample it.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.520
So in other words,
if you sample the prices every year, and

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.870
compute your Sharpe ratio based on
yearly statistics you'll get one number,

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.920
if you sample monthly you'll
get a different number,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.410
if you sample daily you'll
get still another number.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.780
The original vision for the Sharpe
ratio is that it's an annual measure.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.200
So if we're sampling at
frequencies other than annually,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.640
we need to add an adjustment
factor to make it all work out.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.030
So if we have our original
sharp ratio over here

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.200
we multiply it by an adjustment factor
called K to get the annualized version.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.920
Now what is K?

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.940
K is simply the square root of
the number of samples per year.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.400
Since if we're using daily data.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.955
There are 252 trading days per year,
so K is the square root of 252.

00:01:04.955 --> 00:01:10.597
If we're, say, taking weekly samples,
it'd be square root of 52.

00:01:10.597 --> 00:01:14.947
Important thing to keep is mind is
the number in here is the rate at which

00:01:14.947 --> 00:01:16.760
we're sampling.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.820
So as an example, let's suppose
we were trading for 85 days.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:30.740
Because we're sampling at a daily rate,
we use this number for our K.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.380
Square root of 252.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.160
Even though we only traded for 89 days,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.790
we use 252 here because
we're sampling daily.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.770
It's the frequency at which we sample
that effects this value for K.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.700
So, recapping, if we sample
the value of our portfolio monthly,

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.510
K is the square root of 12,
if we do it weekly,

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.800
it's the square root of 52 because
there's 52 weeks in a year, and

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.330
if we sampled daily,
it's square root of 252.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.920
Bringing it all together,
if we're using daily data,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.420
our Sharpe ratio is square root of 252,
that's our K,

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.500
times mean of our daily returns
minus the daily risk free rate,

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.540
divided by standard
deviation of daily returns.
