00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
Now, before we continue, I would like you to think a little bit about

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.190
the implications of what we have just shown.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.050
We have just shown that the halting problem is undecidable.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.900
What I would like to think about for a moment here is what that means or implies,

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.520
and I would like you to select the ones that are correct.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.010
The halting problem being undecidable, does that mean that an algorithm

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.490
that solves the halting problem would take far more than exponential time to run,

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.170
does it mean that an algorithm for this problem here for the halting problem cannot exist

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.900
or does it mean that if we gave them any specific program and are asked to solve the halting problem

00:00:35.900 --> 99:59:59.000
that will never be possible, at least not using an algorithm.
