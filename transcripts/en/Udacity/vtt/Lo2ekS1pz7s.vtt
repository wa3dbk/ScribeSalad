00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.317
Here's a list then of some of the possible rational zeros that we came up with

00:00:03.317 --> 00:00:08.636
in the last quiz. In fact this is just the positive versions. Starting at the

00:00:08.636 --> 00:00:11.912
top of this list and then working down, please plug in each of these values of

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:17.392
x into the function. And oops, I made a mistake. I accidentally wrote f of x

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:21.225
instead of P of x. Remember it's super important to keep the names of our

00:00:21.225 --> 00:00:24.312
functions straight so that we know what functions we're talking about, but

00:00:24.312 --> 00:00:28.900
everyone makes mistakes including me. Once you've found the value of the

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.660
function at each of these X values please evaluate whether or not it's a zero.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.952
If P of X does equal zero then please type O Y in the zero column, but if it

00:00:37.952 --> 00:00:42.945
doesn't type and N. Since some of these numbers are pretty big I'm going to

00:00:42.945 --> 00:00:46.727
make your life a little bit easier. As soon as you type a y into the zero

00:00:46.727 --> 00:00:50.907
column, you can stop. We're just trying to find which x value is the first

00:00:50.907 --> 00:00:55.641
zero. Or at least the first zero on this list. That will be enough information

00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:59.449
for us to continue simplifying this function, and figuring out more information

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.133
that we need.
