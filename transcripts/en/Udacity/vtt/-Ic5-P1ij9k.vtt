00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.870
So working with native
elements is great for

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.800
focus behavior,
because they're automatically inserted

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.420
into the tab order based on
their position in the DOM.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.800
To give you an example I've
written a little bit of HTML here.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.010
I've got three button elements and

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.100
then you can see the output
over here on the right.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.030
So there's three button elements
rendering inside of my browser.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.210
Now because the tab order corresponds
to the DOM order, when I go and

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.530
press the tab key you'll see
that the first button element

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.060
gets the focus indicator around it.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.740
And as I keep pressing tab, you'll see
the next item in the DOM order gets

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:43.210
focused and tab again, now the last
item in the DOM order is focused.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.850
Now it's important note that
using something like CSS,

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.210
it's possible to have things
appear in one order on screen, but

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.930
actually exist in a different
order over in the DOM.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.520
To give you an example of that,
what I've done now is I've just

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.890
added this inline style to
my first button element and

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.650
I'm telling it that I want
to float to the right.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.670
Now what this is going to do is it's
going to visually change the ordering of

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.840
these buttons here such that our
first DOM element is now appearing

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.530
last on screen visually.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.330
So even though the visual order has
changed, the DOM order remains the same.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.610
Let's see how that effects tabbing.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.790
When I press the tab key, the first
DOM element is still focused, but

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.210
now visually it's the last element in
this group which is kind of weird.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.280
If I press tab again,
now we see that the second DOM element,

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.380
which is the first visual
element becomes focused.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.770
And pressing tab again, I've got this
middle element now being focused,

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.940
even though that's the last DOM item.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.720
So the moral of the story is, be careful
when you're using something like CSS to

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.260
visually change the position
of your elements on screen.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.370
This can cause the tab order to
jump around seemingly at random and

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.130
for users relying on a keyboard
this can be extremely confusing.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.700
For this reason the WebAIM checklist
specifically states in section 1.3.2

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.080
that the reading and navigation
order as determined by code order

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.080
should be logical and
intuitive in your application.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.920
I have just sort of
a general rule of thumb.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.330
I like to tab through my page every so

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.180
often just to make sure I haven't
accidentally messed up the tab order.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.810
It's a good habit to adopt and

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.350
it's one that doesn't really
require a ton of effort on my part.
