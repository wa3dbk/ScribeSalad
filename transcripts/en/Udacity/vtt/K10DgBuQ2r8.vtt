00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.493
The current travels at 3 miles per hour. Excellent problem solving if you found

00:00:04.493 --> 00:00:08.535
that answer. To solve this equation, we'll start by multiplying through by the

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:14.346
lowest common denominator. The LCD in this case is 12 minus x times 12 plus x

00:00:14.346 --> 00:00:21.364
times 15. The product of all three of the denominators. So we'll multiply each

00:00:21.364 --> 00:00:25.719
of these terms by the LCD. We'll note the factors of 12 minus x simplified in

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:30.310
the first fraction. 12 plus x simplifies in the second fraction. And 15

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:37.168
simplifies in our last fraction. Each of these reduces to 1. This leaves us

00:00:37.168 --> 00:00:42.920
with this equation. We know 6 times 15 equals 90, so we'll change these. And

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.460
then we know this is a difference of square pattern. a minus b times a plus b.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.768
So this will equal a squared minus b squared. 12 squared is 144. We'll have our

00:00:53.768 --> 00:00:58.515
minus sign in between the terms, and x squared is x squared. Next we'll

00:00:58.515 --> 00:01:03.438
distribute 90 to each of these terms. We'll distribute 90 here, and we'll

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:08.200
distribute positive 16 here. We get this equation, and then we want to combine

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.648
the like terms on the left. We know positive 90x, and negative 90x sum to 0.

00:01:14.648 --> 00:01:20.580
And 1080 plus 1080 sums to 2160. And the right hand side of our equation

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.072
remains the same. Now that we have this equation, we want to try and solve for

00:01:25.072 --> 00:01:29.418
x. Since I only have an x squared term and no other x terms, I want to move

00:01:29.418 --> 00:01:35.466
this constant to the left hand side, and then divide through by negative 16. So

00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:40.068
we can take the square root of both sides. We subtract 2,304 from both sides to

00:01:40.068 --> 00:01:47.201
get negative 144 equals negative 16 x squared. Then we divide both sides by

00:01:47.201 --> 00:01:52.995
negative 16 to get 9 is equal to x squared. We take the square root of both

00:01:52.995 --> 00:01:57.598
sides so x can equal positive 3 or negative 3. Since x is the speed of the

00:01:57.598 --> 00:02:02.412
current, we know that we need the positive value. x must equal 3 miles per

00:02:02.412 --> 00:02:03.390
hour.
