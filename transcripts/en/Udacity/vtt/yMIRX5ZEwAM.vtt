Your personality is what makes you uniquely and consistently you. Personality

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.445
is defined as an individual's pattern of thinking, feeling and behaving. Now,

00:00:10.445 --> 00:00:14.590
let's take this hypothetical situation. What if I just met Rosio and I see her

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.820
acting in an unfriendly way? Am I likely to conclude that she's an unfriendly

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.248
person? Well, I might. But that might not be correct. Because I've only seen

00:00:24.248 --> 00:00:28.008
her acting this way in that one situation. I haven't seen her under many

00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:31.713
circumstances over a long period of time, and those are two things that we need

00:00:31.713 --> 00:00:37.050
if we're going to make a conclusion about someone's personality. We just know

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.460
something about the mood she was in, or how she was behaving that day.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.988
Everybody acts differently sometimes. The most introverted person can light up

00:00:44.988 --> 00:00:49.482
when they're around their friends. The kindest person can sometimes be angry or

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:54.580
even hostile. But personality is how we behave most of the time.
