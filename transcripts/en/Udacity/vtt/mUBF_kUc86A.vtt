00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.951
First, let's look at how we're going to use the decode method. It's going to

00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:10.390
return a string with the decoded message. And it doesn't need any arguments.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:18.660
So, in the decoder tester, we want to print out the result of decoder.decode.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.664
The decoder was made with the coded messages string already in it. So we don't

00:00:23.664 --> 00:00:28.448
need to pass that string in again. Now, back to the decoder itself. We need to

00:00:28.448 --> 00:00:33.820
write a for loop that reads every 10th letter, starting with the 0th one. Since

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.180
we're reading a string, we want to go as long as the index is less than the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.652
length of the string. EncodedMessage is the string that we're reading. And

00:00:40.652 --> 00:00:45.092
instead of incrementing by one at a time I'm going to increment i by 10 every

00:00:45.092 --> 00:00:51.552
time, so that we only see every tenth letter. Inside the loop, the part that I

00:00:51.552 --> 00:00:57.730
want to repeat is reading the ith letter, and adding it to decoded message. So

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.425
decoded message will be itself Plus, encodedMessage.substring from i to i plus

00:01:03.425 --> 00:01:08.560
1. Remember, this is how we got one letter out of a longer string. Let's see if

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.718
this works. Looks like there are more secret messages in here. If you're

00:01:12.718 --> 00:01:14.842
curious what they are, I guess you'll have to try starting at different

00:01:14.842 --> 00:01:18.781
indices. Let me talk for a moment about a couple of bugs that you might have

00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:23.722
encountered. If you accidentally wrote less than or equals to, right here like

00:01:23.722 --> 00:01:28.556
this. You might encounter a string out of bounds exception. When you try to

00:01:28.556 --> 00:01:34.239
access too high of an index in encodedMessage. A string index out of bounds

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:38.411
exception is a runtime error. That particular runtime error is nice, because it

00:01:38.411 --> 00:01:41.711
stops the program and tells you, you tried to access a value that doesn't

00:01:41.711 --> 00:01:47.214
exist. Which is much better than silently messing up your program's result. You

00:01:47.214 --> 00:01:50.926
could correctly, though, a little clumsily write the condition as, i is less

00:01:50.926 --> 00:01:55.637
than or equal to encodedMessage.length(), minus 1. That would work, but I don't

00:01:55.637 --> 00:02:00.806
think it's as clean. When you iterate over a string, it's best, to go, as long,

00:02:00.806 --> 00:02:04.674
as i, is less than, the length.
