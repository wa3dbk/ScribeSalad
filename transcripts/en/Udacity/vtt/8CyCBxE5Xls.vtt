00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.200
To solve this and compound inequality, let's solve each and inequality

00:00:04.212 --> 00:00:08.720
separately. For the first inequality, we add 4 to both sides, then divide by

00:00:08.732 --> 00:00:13.070
negative 3, to isolate x. Remember, we divided by a negative so we need to

00:00:13.082 --> 00:00:17.655
reverse the inequality sign. So, for this inequality sign, x needs to be less

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:22.354
than negative 3. For the second inequality, we add 1 to both sides, then we

00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:26.323
divide by 5. So x is less than or equal to negative 4. We have an AND

00:00:26.335 --> 00:00:30.982
inequality, so I want both of these solutions to be true. x needs to taken a

00:00:30.994 --> 00:00:35.773
value that works for this inequality and this inequality. So I want to find the

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:41.236
overlap of these 2 regions. Let's look back at our number lines. Here are two

00:00:41.248 --> 00:00:46.041
solution regions. x could be less than or equal to negative 4, or x could be

00:00:46.053 --> 00:00:50.773
less than negative 3. We have an and inequality, so we want the region of

00:00:50.785 --> 00:00:55.847
overlap. So, it's any number, less than or equal to negative 4. That would be

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.213
this number line. Nice job if you got that one right.
