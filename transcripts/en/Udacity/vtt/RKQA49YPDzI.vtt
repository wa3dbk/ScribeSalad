So, you want to know how the Chinese puzzle pot

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.660
works? Well, I'm not going to tell you. It's a puzzle.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.650
I want it to remain a puzzle. You figure it out.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.150
You might even ask some friends to try it, and listen

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.110
to their explanations. But go to the forum. That's the place

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.700
where you talk about it. That's where all of you might

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.650
get together. And maybe, the person who does figure it out

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.510
might share the answers with you. They might also share some

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.970
wrong answers. So, try the forum.
