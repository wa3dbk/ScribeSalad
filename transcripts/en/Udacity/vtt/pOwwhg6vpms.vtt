00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.516
So here's another pipeline. Don't worry about what each stage is doing. I'm

00:00:03.516 --> 00:00:08.196
going to let you figure this one out, what happens if stage B suddenly starts to

00:00:08.196 --> 00:00:12.864
take, instead of one nanosecond, it take three nanoseconds? I'll give you the

00:00:12.864 --> 00:00:16.971
easy answer. An object will take a total of one, two, three, four, five, six

00:00:16.971 --> 00:00:21.558
nanoseconds to travel through this whole pipeline. The harder question is How

00:00:21.558 --> 00:00:26.175
often will an object come out of the pipeline being fed with objects? So our

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:30.349
original pipeline had one object per nanosecond. Think through how often the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.794
objects will come out of this pipeline once it has settled down under these new

00:00:33.794 --> 00:00:38.173
conditions. An object will come off this pipeline every how many nanoseconds?
