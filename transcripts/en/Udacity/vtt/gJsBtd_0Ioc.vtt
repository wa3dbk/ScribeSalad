00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.996
Here was the expression we agreed upon for the last two books of stamps. I'm

00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:07.959
going to show you two ways of doing this and then we're going to figure out

00:00:07.971 --> 00:00:11.698
which way is correct based on our diagram. For this first one, I'm going to

00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:15.893
start in the parentheses. I know I need to simplify containers first. When I

00:00:15.905 --> 00:00:19.284
look at this two, I can choose between the exponent or I can choose

00:00:19.296 --> 00:00:23.396
multiplication. I'm going to choose the exponent first, so I'll get 2 times 5

00:00:23.408 --> 00:00:27.916
times 4. I know 2 squared is 4. Right here, I have multiplication. Remember that

00:00:27.928 --> 00:00:32.073
whenever you have a number outside of a parentheses, we just have multiplication

00:00:32.086 --> 00:00:36.158
in front. 5 times 4 is 20 and I finish simplifying my parenthesis. Now, I can do

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.024
2 times 20, which is 40. This time for this second one, I'm still going to start

00:00:40.036 --> 00:00:43.871
in parentheses, but for this two, I'm going to choose the, the multiplication

00:00:43.883 --> 00:00:48.020
over the exponent. So I'm going to do 5 times 2 first, so I have 2 times 10

00:00:48.032 --> 00:00:52.921
squared. I know 10 squared is 100, so I have 2 times 100 and I get 200. Okay.

00:00:52.923 --> 00:00:57.801
One of these answers is correct. I know that in one book of stamps, I have 20

00:00:57.813 --> 00:01:00.728
stamps, so in two books, I must have 40 stamps.

00:01:00.735 --> 00:01:04.318
So here are two books of stamps and I can see that I should have 40 stamps

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.173
altogether. So I know that this method was correct. So, let's go back and look.

00:01:08.262 --> 00:01:11.356
Here is where I made the choice. The two could have been paired with

00:01:11.368 --> 00:01:15.136
multiplication or with exponents. I know that the two should be paired with the

00:01:15.148 --> 00:01:18.675
exponent. The exponent takes priority over multiplication.

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.300
So with our order of operations, we know that we need to add in another

00:01:22.312 --> 00:01:26.130
priority. Okay,. So when faced with the decision between an exponent and

00:01:26.142 --> 00:01:30.159
multiplication, I know that the exponent or the power should come first. So

00:01:30.171 --> 00:01:34.420
powers take the highest priority in our order of operations. When doing my order

00:01:34.432 --> 00:01:38.585
of operations, I know power should come first, multiplication and division

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:42.631
should come second, and then addition and subtraction should come third. So you

00:01:42.643 --> 00:01:46.646
might be wondering where parentheses fit on our order of operations. Well, we

00:01:46.658 --> 00:01:50.742
just need to make sure we do the order of operations within each parentheses. We

00:01:50.754 --> 00:01:54.875
need to simplify any parentheses or brackets before we do any outside operations

00:01:54.887 --> 00:01:55.261
on them.
