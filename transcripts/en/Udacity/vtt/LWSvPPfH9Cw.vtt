00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
For this question, you're asked to find the element which occurs most often consecutively in a list

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
In this case, it's 5 because there are three 5s in a row,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and that's more than any of the other elements in row.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
There are more 6s, but they're split. They're not in one consecutive list.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm going to talk about this as a sublist.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We're looking for the longest sublist of the same element repeated.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now, in order to do that, we're going to have to keep track of some things.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We're going to have to keep track of our best element as we go.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We're going to have to keep track of how long the sublist containing the best element is.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
As we go, we're going to have to keep increasing our count as we find another element

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that's the same as the previous one.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
For 6, we're going to have to keep track of the fact we're looking at 6

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and the number of 6s that are occurring, so we can compare them with these two values here.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I'm going to introduce two more variables.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I'm going to introduce current and the current length.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
To start off with, we haven't got any information, and we look at 7--

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
well, that's my current one, and there's one of them. Okay, I've got one 7.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
That's definitely the best, because I haven't got anything else before, and there's one of them.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Now we move on from 7 and we get to 6. Well, there's one 6.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Move on again, and that's not better than we had before, so we're not going to replace best element with 6.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Now we come on to the second 6--oh, well, now we've got two 6s.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
That's actually better than we had before.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I'm going to replace the 7 with a 6 and the length with 2.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
We haven't got 6s anymore, so we're not going to increase the count for 6.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
We're going to start a new count for 5.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
We've got one 5, two 5s, three 5s, and now we're out of 5s.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Let's compare that with our best element from before.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.000
It was 6 and there were only two of them, so 5 and 3 is better. There are more 5s.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Now we're not dealing with 5 anymore. We're dealing with 6 again.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
There is one 6, two 6s.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Now, we compare the number of 6s with the number of 5s, and there aren't enough.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
We're not going to replace the values there.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Then we come onto 7. There's one 7. Again, we're not going to replace the value.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Our procedure should return 5.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Now let's look at the code to do that.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
We're going to define a procedure, longest_repetition, which has a list as its input.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Now, when we first start, we don't know what the best element is.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I'm going to set it none. It has length zero.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000
If it's an empty list, then there isn't a longest repetition, and the length would certainly be 0.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Our current--well, we don't have one either.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
That's going to have length 0 as well.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
What do we do? We looped through all the elements in the input list.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
What are we going want to check?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Let's check to see if current is equal to the element or not.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
If it's not equal to the element, then let's make it equal to the element,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and let's reset the current length to one, because we've now got an element ,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
so it must occur at least once.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
We don't know yet whether it'll occur more times, because we've only checked that first time

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
we've seen it in this sublist.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
If current is equal to the element, then we're going to increase the length by 1,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000
because we've got a second one so our sublist is 1 longer than it was before.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000
In either case, we want to check whether the element we have is greater than the length

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
that we have stored as our best length of a sublist at the moment.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
If it is better, then we're going to replace our best element with the current one,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and we're going to replace our length with the current length.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:23.000
So when these for loops run through, all that there's left to do is return best_element.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
That completes the code.
