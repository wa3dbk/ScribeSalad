00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
In lecture, we introduced a centrality algorithm

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
that measures centrality by taking the average

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
distance from a node to all the other nodes that it can reach.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We want you to modify this algorithm

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to return the maximum distance from a node to all the other nodes it can reach.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This algorithm captures a different notion of centrality.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
A node is central if no other node is very far away from it.
