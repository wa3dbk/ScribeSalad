00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.545
Since our point estimates are based on our samples, our point estimate for the

00:00:05.545 --> 00:00:12.360
difference will be 5.08 minus 7.8 which is negative 2.72. But we still want to

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.260
know how this compares to other differences. And so we need to find the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.683
standard error of the differences.
