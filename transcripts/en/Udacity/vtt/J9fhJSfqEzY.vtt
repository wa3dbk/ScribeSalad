I happen to love the game, Minecraft, along with a few other million people.

00:00:03.748 --> 00:00:07.952
Yes, I built the teapot in the game. I even wrote a program to help me print 3D

00:00:07.952 --> 00:00:12.458
models in Minecraft. But really, no, I'm not addicted at all. One confusing

00:00:12.458 --> 00:00:17.114
thing in the game is the coordinate system. In the beta version of Minecraft,

00:00:17.114 --> 00:00:22.675
the coordinate system was as follows, the X-axis points south, Z pointed west, Y

00:00:22.675 --> 00:00:26.484
points up. You could tell these where the axis directions because in the game,

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:30.304
their sun rose in the east. When the game was released the developers changed

00:00:30.304 --> 00:00:34.380
the direction the sun moved. The sun started rising and what I used to think of

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.424
was the south but was now considered the east. In other words, in release, the

00:00:39.424 --> 00:00:45.400
X-axis now points east, Z points south, and Y points up. So, what handedness are

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.823
the beta and the release coordinate systems, right-handed or left-handed?
