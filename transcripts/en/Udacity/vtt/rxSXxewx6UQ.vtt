00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.491
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. So, we know we can draw lines on this Cartesian grid. The line is just

00:00:04.491 --> 00:00:09.204
a visual for a linear equation. Let's explore the relationship between linear

00:00:09.204 --> 00:00:13.913
equations and lines. For now, I'll just tell you that this line is described by

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:18.582
the equation negative 2 x plus 3 y equals 6. Now, we know that this x-intercept

00:00:18.582 --> 00:00:23.522
is negative 3. But how do we find it? Let's see if you can figure it out. Would

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:28.262
you set y equal to 0 and solve for x, set x equal to 0 and solve for y, or solve

00:00:28.262 --> 00:00:33.149
the equation for y in terms of x? Think about what this point means and think

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.863
about how you could actually find the coordinate to the point. Good luck.
