00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.180
DHT or distributed hash table, is an

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.090
implementation vehicle for a content distribution network

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.270
to populate the routing table at the

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.180
user level. As I mentioned earlier, for placement

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.550
you need a put operation. And the put operation is going to take 2 parameters, a

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.530
key, and a value, and the key

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.230
is some content hash that uniquely identifies something

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.600
that the user community may be interested in finding.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.630
And value is the node ID where the content

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.120
is stored. And retrieval of a key value is

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.070
done using a get operation. And when you do

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.850
a get and give the key, what you're expecting

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.350
to get back is the value that is associated

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.470
with this key value pair. So, what you get

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.320
back is a value that is associated with this key,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.520
which was placed somewhere using the put operation. So using the put and

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.580
get operation, let's see how to construct the routing table as new content gets

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.430
generated. That is, you want to do placement of key value pairs using

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.160
put operations, and retrieval of a value

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.590
associated with a key, with this construction.
