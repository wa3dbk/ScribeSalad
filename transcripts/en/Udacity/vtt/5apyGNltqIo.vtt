[Norvig] Now, suppose we arrange our program like this.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So we set up the houses and we have a list of all 120 possible orderings

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and then we iterate each of the 5 properties in each of the 5 property groups

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
through all those orderings.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And so now, 5 levels nested deep into our code we've got an assignment

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
of all 25 properties.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Each of them is assigned to one of the houses,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and now we can check the constraints, like the Englishman lives in the red house

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and the Spaniard owns the dog and so on. Those can all go here.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
If we find something that checks out, we can just report we've got an answer.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Now, I want you to go back to the back of your envelope

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and tell me if we wrote the program this way and filled in this code with all the constraints

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and then ran it, about how long do you think it would take to find a solution?

00:00:45.000 --> 09:59:59.000
About a second, a minute, an hour, or a day? Click on the best answer.
