Okay, here is our little load balancer simulator. I've give

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.540
you a list of servers, servers 1, 2, 3, and

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.720
4. And I'd like you to implement the function get_server

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.420
that returns which server we should send our connection to. It

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.780
should return in order 1, 2, 3, 4 and then

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.300
cycle back over to return 1. There are a number of

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.160
ways of doing this in Python. I'll include some links

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.190
in the instructor comments for some different approaches that might work.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.800
The way we'll test it is, we'll just call your function

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.470
a bunch of times and see what it returns. So, good luck.
