00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's take a look at what we used to believe and then contrast it to what we now know.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
One of the biggest fallacies was believing that startups

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
are just smaller versions of a large company.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
That everything you do in a large company, you'll do on day one of a startup.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
What we now know is something very different.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The core difference is that startups do something called search

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
while large companies spend their time, at least their core time, executing.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
One of the questions we'll answer is search for what and execute what.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And so later on in this lecture, you'll see the difference

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and then in fact will make you a much better enterpreneur.
