00:00:00.037 --> 00:00:04.673
Block ciphers need to use both
confusion and diffusion operations.

00:00:04.673 --> 00:00:09.270
AES uses longer keys and
is more secure than DES.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.909
We should use CBC to
encrypt a large message.

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:16.490
We can also use the last CBC block
as the message integrity code.
