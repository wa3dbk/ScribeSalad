00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.112
The next and somewhat final piece of the, puzzle to convert our

00:00:04.112 --> 00:00:09.400
Dimple.js plot to pure d3, is to actually draw circles on the page.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.680
I put a debugger right after all the code we've written so far.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.960
And let's check in and see what our page actually looks like.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.940
Going back to the browser, we can see the debugger's paused here.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.150
You can see we have a y an a x axis.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.820
Though they still look pretty crude they are in the right relative range

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.730
going from zero to probably looks like a 180 thousand for

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.493
attendance and the years even though they're very squished and

00:00:41.493 --> 00:00:47.436
scrunched together if we actually read them go from 1932 to 1934 to 1936 and

00:00:47.436 --> 00:00:54.970
so forth, all the way to 2014 if we look to the far extent of this axis.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.690
And now we're so close to having our chart done.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.280
And I've happened to save the best for last, the actual circles we want to draw.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.060
For the sake of simplicity, I'm only going to recreate the scatter plot.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.730
Now the way the sense of where we are in terms of the axis,

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.430
let's jump back to sublime text and actually create some circles for our data.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.280
In dimple, we simply need to specify that we want to draw some

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.700
series corresponding to some shapes, in this case, scatter or line.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.180
Removing these two lines and also since we don't have any dimple code left,

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.500
we can simply remove the draw.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.450
In d3, there's not an explicit draw function or rather,

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.190
every SVG gets appended to the page whenever we create it.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.560
Remember, in dimple, since it's much higher level than d3.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.980
You simply have to specify what axis this series corresponds to, and

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.700
it automatically knows the extent, the scale, the axis of that.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.780
Now here's another quirk of d3, if you remember from above.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.000
When we bound data we actually appended circles to the page, and

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.210
now we're selecting the circles already on the page to add an x position,

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.410
a y position, a radius and a fill.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.170
Going back to the browser, you'll notice here that there aren't

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.350
any circles actually drawn, but if we look back at the code.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.100
&gt;From where we started when we bound our data, we actually appended circles.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.690
So what gives?

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.850
Where are the SVG circles which our bound to data which should be on the screen?

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.700
Answer in the box below where you think the circles are on the screen or

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.440
why they're not showing up visually in our chart.
