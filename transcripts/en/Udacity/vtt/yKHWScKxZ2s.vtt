00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.700
So, as you can see here, we've wrapped our webkitAudioContext in a try-catch

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.110
block, catching any exceptions, and opening an alert dialog box to let the

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:12.895
player know that the Web Audio API is not supported in their browser. After

00:00:12.895 --> 00:00:18.233
this, we create a new gain node, and we connect it to our main node. Then, we

00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:22.970
connect it to our destination, which in most cases would be the speaker.
