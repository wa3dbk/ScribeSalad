00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.790
So what kind of questions would a Forensic Psychologist ask? So many of you may

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.220
be familiar with TV shows like Lie To Me, or the movie and book Silence of the

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.890
Lambs. These shows depict psychologists who solve crimes, using their knowledge

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.400
of psychology to narrow in on the criminal cases and solve the case. These are

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.100
examples of some sexier kinds of things forensic psychologists might ask and

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.110
do. More often than not, however, they're involved in more mundane things like

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.030
custody battle disputes, insurance claims, or evaluating witnesses in criminal

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.850
court cases.
