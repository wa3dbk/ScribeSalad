00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.580
So again,
this is what we're interested in.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.430
A scene, and
of course we have two projection planes.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.790
And we know from our work
that we did in modeling or

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.440
being able to kind of look at warps,
that we basically need to find a new p,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.590
prime, that basically is kind of a warp
our projection from the original p.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.250
And these are the two images we have.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.010
Of course if you recall, we knew how
to do this with an equation like this.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.410
And of course, this was
the homogenous coordinate system, and

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.810
these are trying to
get to the new pixels.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.870
This is basically used in order to
introduce a concept of homography

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.440
between two images.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.090
So the idea really is,

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.960
how can we relate two images,
which have the same camera center?

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.420
Again remember, the camera was
rotating and getting newer points.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.610
And again this rotation might
actually create a different plane.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.940
I refer you back to some of the earlier
visuals I showed you on that one.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.940
So the basic idea and
this is, this is a rectangle.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.690
And again remembering the properties
of these types of equations.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.750
A rectangle should make, should map
to any arbitrary quadrilateral.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.930
Again lines should remain lines.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.140
They do not have to be parallel.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.390
So the shape of this para,
this region might change, but

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.800
overall it will remain a quadrilateral.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.320
It'll have straight lines.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.220
So again,

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.200
parallel lines won't be parallel,
but lines will remain straight.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.330
As we know again, this is something
we have looked at before when we

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.770
looked at this whole equation.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.890
Now, of course you may remember,
that i in this one is always equal to 1,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.790
and we have eight parameters
that we need to now model.
