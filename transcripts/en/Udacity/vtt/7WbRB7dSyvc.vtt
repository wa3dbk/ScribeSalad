00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.300
Let's start talking about the efficiency
of this algorithm with a new example.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.610
Here we have an array with eight
elements and we're going to try and

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.490
find the number ten.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.874
Okay, so
we'll want to start in the middle.

00:00:12.874 --> 00:00:16.508
This problem is a little bit weird
because there's an even number of

00:00:16.508 --> 00:00:17.855
elements in this array.

00:00:17.855 --> 00:00:20.630
So we could either start with four or
five really.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.982
When you're designing your algorithm,
you need to decide from the start

00:00:24.982 --> 00:00:27.788
whether you're going to
err on the lower side or

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.880
the higher side when you hit this
weird case of having no real middle.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.180
I'm going to go ahead and
err on the lower side and

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.150
start with the number four.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.920
Just like before, we'll check
whether our number is bigger or

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.410
smaller than the one in the middle.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.700
And since our number is bigger,

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.300
now we only need to look at
the second half of the array.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.610
Again, we have an even number
of elements in our array, so

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.425
we're going to pick the number on the
left of the middle and start from there.

00:00:54.425 --> 00:00:57.625
Okay, since ten is greater than six, yet

00:00:57.625 --> 00:01:00.645
again we get to cut our array in
half and deal with just the top.

00:01:01.675 --> 00:01:04.175
Yet again we have an even
number of elements, so

00:01:04.175 --> 00:01:07.440
we're going to err on the lower side and
check there first.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.500
Since ten is greater than
our middle element seven,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.850
we're left with just
the last element now.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.700
And now that we've checked the highest
element in the array and our number is

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.690
still bigger than it, we know that this
number doesn't exist and we can move on.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.610
Since the time efficiency is really
just the number of steps you're going to

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.275
need, keeping track of each iteration
is going to help us figure it out.

00:01:28.275 --> 00:01:31.705
In the past, we had to step
through every single element,

00:01:31.705 --> 00:01:36.334
but here we're cutting the array in
half and only considering some elements.

00:01:36.334 --> 00:01:41.910
So the efficiency isn't going
to end up being as big as O(n).

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.580
I've created a table so
we can take a good look at

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.120
the array size versus the number
of iterations of our algorithm.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.910
As we just saw, we had to go through
our algorithm four times for

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.679
an array size of eight.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.387
Again, we're talking
about worst case here.

00:01:56.387 --> 00:02:00.400
I could have tried to put a number
in between all of these places and

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.390
on the outsides to figure
out what the worst case was.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.310
Just to save your time,
I did that before recording this video.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.199
In the process I also
discovered a trick here.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.400
If you want to make sure you're
checking for the worst case,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.900
you can pick an element that's bigger
than anything else in the array.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.900
And when you hit this weird middle case,
always favor the lower side.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.590
You should prove this to yourself so
you know that it works, but

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.480
just trust me on it for now.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.480
Okay, so for an array size of eight,
we have worst case for iterations.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.804
We can take the results
from the first example too.

00:02:33.804 --> 00:02:38.880
There it took us three steps to find
something in an array of seven.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.954
Hm, let's start thinking about
different array sizes now.

00:02:41.955 --> 00:02:46.462
If you had an array size of one and
you were looking for an element, say 30,

00:02:46.462 --> 00:02:50.899
it would always only take you one step
to see whether that element was in your

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.580
array or not.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.880
Great, that means we can
add one to our table.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.840
Let's say we have an array with two
elements in it and we're looking for

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.200
this number, 23.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.710
Again, I'm taking
advantage of that trick.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.900
I picked a number bigger than
the ones that were in the array.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.870
And when I have that weird case, I'm
always going to favor the lower side.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.340
And when my array has
an even number of elements,

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.510
I'm going to pick the number
that's on the left of the middle.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.480
Since 23 is greater than 18,
I can check 21 now.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.579
In just two steps I have my answer,
that 23 doesn't exist in this array.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.980
Great, we can add two to the table now.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.709
In the interest of time, I'm not going
to go through all of these examples.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.230
You should definitely do them
yourself though to prove that

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.179
these results are true.

00:03:35.425 --> 00:03:38.800
Okay, we're starting to get
a picture of our efficiency here.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.490
I notice that four is half of eight, so

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.630
maybe our efficiency looks
something like this.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.780
Again, keep in mind that
I'm approximating here.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.400
Instead of counting the number of
overall steps in the algorithm,

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.670
I'm just counting the number of times
I'll need to run the algorithm,

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.850
in this case four when my n is eight.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.810
Actually I don't know that this is
true since half of two isn't two,

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.780
and half of one isn't one.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.320
That's too bad.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.359
I really feel like two should
go in this efficiency somewhere

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.870
since I have to cut the array in half
every single time I run the algorithm.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.980
Let me think about exactly
what that means for a second.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.620
If I cut the array in half every
time I go through an iteration,

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.480
that means every time I double
the number of elements,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.600
I need to do an extra iteration.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.900
Actually, now that I think about it,

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.549
that actually looks true with
the results of my table.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.369
Every time my array doubles in size,

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.199
it takes an extra iteration of
the algorithm to get through it.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.728
Actually when I represent these as
exponents, I notice that the power

00:04:42.728 --> 00:04:47.121
on top of the two is always one more
than the number of iterations it takes.

00:04:47.121 --> 00:04:51.686
So maybe my efficiency
looks more like this.

00:04:51.686 --> 00:04:56.209
The number of overall iterations
is going to increase every time

00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:59.557
the exponent on the power
of two increases, and

00:04:59.557 --> 00:05:01.833
of course it's only off by one.

00:05:01.833 --> 00:05:06.380
How do I get some number or
expression that represents this,

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.439
the power of two exponent?

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:12.693
So this is what I'm starting with,
the number of elements in my array, and

00:05:12.693 --> 00:05:16.425
I want to end up with this number,
the exponent.

00:05:16.425 --> 00:05:20.305
Well, I remember some weird math
that I used to do a long time ago.

00:05:20.305 --> 00:05:23.295
There was this thing called
a logarithm that let me express

00:05:23.295 --> 00:05:25.895
this kind of function
in a different way.

00:05:25.895 --> 00:05:30.272
Instead of saying this,
I could say log base 2 of 8 = 3, and

00:05:30.273 --> 00:05:32.550
it means the same thing.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.820
Okay, so this looks a little bit nicer.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.330
I want to make a point to note that
you don't need to know a ton about how

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.740
logarithms work to understand this.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.929
If you just understand the equations I
showed you before, you should be fine.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.780
So we could actually use another
approximation to make this

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.270
look even nicer.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.830
As I mentioned before,
adding a constant or

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.280
adding one doesn't really
change my efficiency very much.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.869
Also, I don't really need to
say that this is log base 2.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.800
In computer science it's actually pretty
safe to assume that your logs are in

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.200
base 2.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.359
We often do things like cut
arrays in half or use binary.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.350
So our logs are normally going to be in
base 2 instead of the typical base 10.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.859
So this is the efficiency
that we end up with.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.500
A little later on we'll
have some more tools.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.700
So it'll be easier for

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.740
me to show you visually why
this efficiency makes sense.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.380
There's one thing I want to make
very clear to you all right now.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.260
When I was learning about efficiency,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.700
it often seemed like people could
just jump to this conclusion.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.800
They could just look at
the original problem and say,

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.330
of course this is log n.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.740
However, after years
of being a developer,

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.630
I learned that that
really wasn't the case.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:51.650
I found that there are three main ways
that people can get to this efficiency.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.715
One of them is just by knowing
what binary search is,

00:06:54.715 --> 00:06:58.734
having seen it before, and being able
to just memorize the efficiency and

00:06:58.735 --> 00:07:00.935
spit it out when you see it again.

00:07:00.935 --> 00:07:04.855
I highly recommend you just memorize
the efficiency of basic algorithms for

00:07:04.855 --> 00:07:06.585
your interviews.

00:07:06.585 --> 00:07:09.854
It'll make you seem really smart if
you can just spit out the efficiency

00:07:09.855 --> 00:07:11.335
from the start.

00:07:11.335 --> 00:07:13.854
However, if you're presented
with a new problem and

00:07:13.855 --> 00:07:16.790
you don't know the efficiency
of the algorithm already,

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.450
you need to be able to
solve it on your own.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.140
One way you can do that is with proofs.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.849
I personally don't like proofs and
have never used them in an interview or

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.560
seen other people use
them in interviews.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.100
If you want to learn how to make proofs,
you can look it up online and

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.610
go read research papers and
see other people step through that.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.569
However, my goal is to teach you
the practical approach to this.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.940
When you haven't seen
the algorithm already, and

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.400
you don't have time to whip up a proof
out of nowhere, making a results table

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.810
like this is actually one of
the best things you can do.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.930
Creating a results table
helps you notice patterns and

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:57.380
helps you start thinking about
efficiency in terms of array size

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.730
versus the number of
iterations of your algorithm.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.830
When I first started
learning about efficiency,

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.320
I needed tables like this
to see those patterns.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.507
However, after using tables for a while,

00:08:08.507 --> 00:08:11.685
I started to be able to see
the patterns on my own without them.

00:08:11.685 --> 00:08:13.406
Now when I interview,

00:08:13.406 --> 00:08:19.350
I know what types of patterns are common
like changes in the powers of two.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.117
And now I solve problems way quicker and

00:08:21.117 --> 00:08:26.200
there are very few problems that I can't
at least approach and try to solve.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.289
The worst thing you can do in
an interview is say I've never seen this

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.890
algorithm before or I don't know
how to write a proof for it.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.600
If you're down on your luck and you
really don't know what the answer is,

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.390
please make a results table and
try to figure it out.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:43.210
Your commitment to solving the problem
is really going to impress your

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:43.710
interviewer.
