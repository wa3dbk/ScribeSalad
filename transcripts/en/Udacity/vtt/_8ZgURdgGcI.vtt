00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.810
To do that let's look at how architectural evolution

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.880
occurs in practice. Ideally when a system evolves, its prescriptive

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.340
architecture should be modified first. Just like when you

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.170
modify a building. You change the blueprint and then you

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.940
change the actual building. You don't go the other

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.820
way around. In software, unfortunately this rarely ever happens in

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.706
practice. In practice the system, and therefore it's descriptive

00:00:21.706 --> 00:00:25.150
architecture are often directly modified. Like in this case that

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.870
I'm showing here. So what happens is that the architecture

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.259
as conceived does not change. Whereas the architecture as implemented, does

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.600
change. And therefore these two things start diverging. And this really

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.720
happens for a number of reasons. So I'm just going to list

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.740
a few of those reasons here. In some cases it

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.620
just happens for plain sloppiness. I need to make this modification

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.290
and I don't really want to go back and look at

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.610
the prescriptive architecture modified. I'm just going to make the change, and

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.800
maybe I'll fix the description later. And then you never really get

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.950
to it. In other cases you do this because of the perception

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.290
of short deadlines. If you have to do something by this afternoon,

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.300
you're not going through a four

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.410
month software architecture review, you normally just

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.460
get to it, and do it. In some cases a prescriptive architecture

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.510
is not even present, so there's a lack of documentation. So in these

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.450
cases, clearly, you cannot go and modify something that does not even

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.880
exist, and so you jump directly to the code and start modifying that.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.280
And as I said there's many, many more

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.080
other reasons why that happen. But important point here is

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.770
that it does happen and it does happen often

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.250
and the result is that prescriptive and descriptive architectures diverge.
