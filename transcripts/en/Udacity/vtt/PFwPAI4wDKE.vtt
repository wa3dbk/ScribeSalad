Hi, my name is Aina. I'm a junior at Stanford University studying something

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.560
called Symbolic Systems. It's a combination of computer science, philosophy,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.685
psychology, and linguistics. And within that, I'm focusing on human computer

00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:17.840
interactions. I actually entered Stanford as a pre-vet. I was going to be a

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.890
human biology major. I started taking the chemistry, biology, and physics

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.540
classes, and I was getting kind of bored, honestly. So, at the beginning of my

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.840
sophomore year, I took my first computer science class. I absolutely fell in

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.530
love with it, and I abandoned all things pre-vet, and it's been a marriage ever

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.910
since.
