00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.630
So far you've created promises and
chained the some work off them.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.170
You did so in the last quiz by
creating a get function and

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.790
then using .then to do something
with the data that you retrieved.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.660
You also included catches to ensure
that no error goes unhandled.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.960
With the promise API,
.then also return promises.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.730
So if you can .then off
of an initial promise,

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.870
you can .then off of .thens
because they are also promises.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:34.150
Developers commonly use the term
thenable to describe promise in .thens.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.130
Any method or
object that returns a .then is thenable.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.660
Anything thenable can become a part
of a chain of asynchronous work.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.410
Promises are thenable as are .thens and
.catches.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.470
In fact, other libraries
include thenable objects.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.940
See the instructor notes for
more information.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.840
When creating a chain of asynchronous
work, each subsequent link in the chain

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.690
receives either the fulfilled
value of the previous promise or

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.569
the return value of
the previous .thens function.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:05.446
In this way,

00:01:05.446 --> 00:01:10.713
you can pass information collected from
one asynchronous method to the next.

00:01:10.713 --> 00:01:15.492
Being able to chain thenables is
an incredibly powerful technique for

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:19.307
simplifying complex sequences
of asynchronous work.

00:01:19.307 --> 00:01:23.390
You'll be practicing a few chaining
strategies in the next lesson.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.870
So this is the end of the first lesson.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.990
You have already added a powerful
new tool to your toolbox, and

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.180
you are just getting started.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.190
At the beginning of the next
lesson you'll be creating a chain

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.580
of .thens to put thumbnails
on the Exoplanet Explorer.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.080
See you then.
