00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.624
Now that we have this equation, let's think about what to do next. Remember, our

00:00:04.624 --> 00:00:09.794
goal here was to solve for x. So we have x on one side of the equation. In fact

00:00:09.794 --> 00:00:15.712
it's in two terms. So how can we isolate x from these two terms? If our variable

00:00:15.712 --> 00:00:20.987
appears in two terms, we need to factor in order to isolate it. Both of these

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:26.468
terms share a factor of x, which means I'll be left with x times the quantity 1

00:00:26.468 --> 00:00:31.630
minus z. A quick distribution let's me know that this step is correct. Finally,

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.174
we divide both sides by the number 1 minus z to get our final answer. 1x, or

00:00:37.174 --> 00:00:43.592
just x, is equal to zy divided by 1 minus z. Here, we actually solve for x. So

00:00:43.592 --> 00:00:47.197
solving for a variable is very similar to solving for numbers. We want to

00:00:47.197 --> 00:00:50.979
isolate the variable on one side of the equation, and sometimes that might

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:56.304
involve factoring. Then we just divide by the coefficient, or everything that's

00:00:56.304 --> 00:00:57.763
not x, to get x alone.
