00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.930
So you've seen some of the responses
we get from these APIs,

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.310
and they're kind of unwieldy.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.990
Although they are somewhat readable,
at first glance it's difficult

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.150
to extract something useful
from these responses.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.000
But these JSON responses
are easily parsable in Python.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.770
I'm going to call the getGeocodeLocation
function again, but this time,

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.700
store the result in
a variable named Dallas.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.460
So when I call Dallas,
I get this huge JSON object again.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.860
Looking at this response,

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.810
I can try to better understand the data
that google maps is providing to me.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.460
All of the data that looks like
coordinates is in this portion of

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.740
the response.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.640
I see quite a few coordinates though,
so which ones are the ones that I need?

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.310
Well, reading through the response,
the first thing I notice

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.490
is that Google is giving me
an approximate set of coordinates,

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.540
that correspond to the Northeast and
Southwest bounds of the city.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.880
Then it provides a suggested viewport
for viewing the entire city on the map.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.100
But this final set of coordinates seems
to correspond to a central set of

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.780
coordinates for the city.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.166
These are the ones
that I want to extract.

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:02.000
By typing dallas.keys

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.540
I can navigate through the keys of the
JSON response like a Python dictionary.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.880
In some cases,
I see that keys contain lists of values.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.460
So by using the square brackets,

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.550
I can reference to an index
inside of these lists.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.330
After navigating through
this response for

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.550
a little bit, I found that going
into results, then the zero's index,

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.920
then geometry, location, and lat,
gave me the latitude that I wanted.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.980
Similarly, going down the same path and
then using lng,

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.290
returns the longitude
coordinate I wanted.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.240
So I'm finished extracting
just the latitude and

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.080
longitude coordinates from
my geocoding request.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.585
I modify my geocode.pie file like so,

00:01:41.585 --> 00:01:45.255
such that now it responds the latitude
and longitude coordinates.

00:01:45.255 --> 00:01:47.445
I'll also comment out the response
header for now as well.

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:50.975
The code for this activity can be
found in the instructor notes.
