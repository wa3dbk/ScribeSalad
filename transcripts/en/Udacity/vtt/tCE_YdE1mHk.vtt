00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For this question, we will use toy-sized values to demonstrate RSA Encryption.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You'll be given a public key where e equals 79 and n equals 3737

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and a private key where d equal 319 and n equals, again, 3737.

00:00:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
If we received an encrypted ciphertext of 903, what is the plaintext?
