00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.810
Now this course is part of
the App Entrepreneurship Nanodegree.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.470
Lots of entrepreneurs work in teams but
many also work alone, so

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.290
it's important to think about which
of these circles of feedback you can

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.540
access as an individual.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.370
To think about that,

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.010
let's first look at how you access
each of the circles of feedback.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.420
The first circle is pretty simple.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.000
If you work at a company, you can walk
down the hole to ask someone or if

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.570
you're working on your own, you can ask
a fried to sit down on a couch with you.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.930
Since you only need 10 or 15 minutes of
someone's time to get a good sense how

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.850
they would react to your app,
you can usually get it.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.370
Experts in the field are often
slightly more difficult.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.680
To get in touch with, and

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.140
are best reached by using Twitter,
email, or phone.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.320
Look for experts that are in your area,
or wait until you have an interactive

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.750
online prototype like the one
we'll be building with Envision.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.180
The third and

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.440
fourth circles are often best reached
through Guerilla prototyping.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.140
You can often find someone who
matches your target demographic at

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.440
a coffee shop, and it's possible to
offer them coffee in exchange for

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.349
looking at your prototype.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:09.230
Now, which of these can you
do as a solo entrepreneur?
