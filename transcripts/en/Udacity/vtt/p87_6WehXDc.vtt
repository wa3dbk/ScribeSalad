00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.034
Each sample has n minus 1 degrees of freedom. If there are three samples, that

00:00:05.034 --> 00:00:10.515
means we would subtract 3. That's the same as subtracting the number of groups.

00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:14.607
And as you've seen before, we use capital N to represent the total number of

00:00:14.607 --> 00:00:20.376
values in all the samples. Capital N minus k is probably the easiest way to

00:00:20.376 --> 00:00:24.987
symbolize the degrees of freedom for within-group variability.
