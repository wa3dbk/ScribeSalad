00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.209
How about we do this in a spreadsheet. So first let's find the population

00:00:04.209 --> 00:00:10.404
standard deviation. We already know that the mean is 2.5. So we'll say, equals

00:00:10.404 --> 00:00:18.216
A1 minus 2.5, and we'll square it. So those are the squared deviations. Command

00:00:18.216 --> 00:00:26.354
c, command down, command shift up, highlighting these four cells. Command v and

00:00:26.354 --> 00:00:34.669
we have all of our squared deviations. Now to take the standard deviation we

00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:44.224
take the average of cell B1:B4. So that's the variance. And then we take the

00:00:44.224 --> 00:00:48.484
square root of the variance to get the standard deviation. So we get 1.118

00:00:48.484 --> 00:00:54.516
approximately. Okay, now let's do the same thing with our sample means. So we

00:00:54.516 --> 00:01:02.854
already know that the mean of all our sample means is 2.5. So here we'll write

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:11.722
equals A6 minus 2.5 squared. So we get our first squared deviation. And now

00:01:11.722 --> 00:01:18.976
we'll go to that cell, push command c, go to cell A6, command down, go to cell

00:01:18.976 --> 00:01:26.502
B21, command shift up, highlighting all these cells and then command v. And now

00:01:26.502 --> 00:01:30.822
we get all of our squared deviations, now we'll find the average squared

00:01:30.822 --> 00:01:39.538
deviation or the variants. B6 through B21. And then we'll take the square root,

00:01:39.538 --> 00:01:45.725
to find the standard deviation. So the standard deviation of our sampling

00:01:45.725 --> 00:01:53.315
distribution, or the distribution of sample means, of size n equals 2, is about

00:01:53.315 --> 00:01:58.271
0.79. We're going to call this SE.
