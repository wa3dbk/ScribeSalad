00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.860
We've seen two methods for expanding
our ability to do segmentation.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.150
One was the new method,
the new algorithm of finding modes

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.340
within some feature space and that,
and it was you know, didn't require

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.070
you to know the number of modes to begin
with, and all those other properties.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.260
And then in some sense, more
importantly, no not more importantly,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.550
in addition, we found a way of expanding
our feature space to include something

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.280
that describes texture.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.455
And what you did was you created
a big t, feature vector,

00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:31.748
texture feature vector at every point,
and

00:00:31.748 --> 00:00:36.667
you would cluster that to get
these keywords or these textons.

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:39.625
And then you would, for every region,
you would get a histogram.

00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:41.989
And then you would cluster based
upon those histograms, and

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:43.740
that's what gave you your segments.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.860
Combined, these gives us
a pretty powerful method.
