00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.149
Here's half of my array. I'll just pick up parts for the second half so I can

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:09.294
tell them apart. Here's the other half of my array. Now what could I do? It

00:00:09.294 --> 00:00:13.200
looks like it would be helpful if I could swap these two elements, cause that

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.945
way I would get this element in place, and also this one. Let's do it again,

00:00:19.945 --> 00:00:25.690
that's good. Now these two elements are in place. And so are these. Another

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.429
swap, and another, and another, and presto! I'm done. I have what used to be

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.963
the second half now in the first half, what used to be in the first half now in

00:00:33.963 --> 00:00:39.168
the second half, in exactly the right order. Well that's great, now I can start

00:00:39.168 --> 00:00:43.430
writing pseudocode. So which elements did I swap? The one in positions zero and

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:52.556
five. 1 and 6, 2 and 7, 3 and 8, 4 and 9. So each time I swapped position i

00:00:52.556 --> 00:00:59.485
with position i plus 5. What's five? That's the length of each sub-array, or

00:00:59.485 --> 00:01:05.357
one half the length of the original array. So i started at zero. We'll figure

00:01:05.357 --> 00:01:08.834
out in a minute how far it went, and then I'll swap the element at position i

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:12.368
with, well I can't say i plus 5 in the pseudo-code, because the pseudo-code

00:01:12.368 --> 00:01:19.090
needs to explain the general situation. So, it was length over 2, now, how far

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:27.120
does i go? In this case, it went from zero to four. So in general, it'll go to

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.778
length over 2 minus 1. Now that was the hard part, the easy part is to program

00:01:32.778 --> 00:01:35.859
that in Java, and I'll leave that to you.
