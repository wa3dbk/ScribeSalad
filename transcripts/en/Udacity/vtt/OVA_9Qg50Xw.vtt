00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.080
So let's see how we can implement the lock

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.000
function. Our lock function needs to do something like this.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.060
We need some sort of a magical lock that

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.650
works without using locks. That protects a critical section in

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.630
which we check if the lock variable is zero.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.970
We put one in the lock variable. And we leave.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.065
Because we have just successfully acquired the lock. If the

00:00:22.065 --> 00:00:25.796
lock variable is one, we repeat all of this, and

00:00:25.796 --> 00:00:28.981
we need to let others also be checking, so

00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:32.439
really we need to insert the unlock magic here

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.910
and here. So basically we're just trying to do

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.140
this check. And if it's 0, setting to 1 automatically

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.200
with each other using some sort of magic. Obviously

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.260
there is no magic. So if there is no

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.830
magic, what to we do? There are several ways

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.690
to get the effect that lock magic would give us.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.378
One way is to use what's called Lamport's Bakery

00:00:53.378 --> 00:00:56.386
algorithm or some other algorithm that actually is able

00:00:56.386 --> 00:00:59.458
to use normal old loading stored instructions to replace

00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:02.530
lock magic, but these algorithms tends to be relatively

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.700
complicated. And just as simple a lock function will

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.090
take 10s of instructions to do. So doing this

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.060
is expensive, it makes the lock function slow. The

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.770
other option is to use some sort of special

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.577
atomic read and write instructions. So there will be

00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:21.475
an instruction that does this check and set to 1,

00:01:21.475 --> 00:01:24.373
or something similar to that, that would allow us

00:01:24.373 --> 00:01:27.810
to in one instruction do this without needing the magic.
