00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.370
We use the FragmentManager 
to begin a transaction,

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.376
to look that we want 
to add this transaction

00:00:04.376 --> 00:00:06.652
to the back stack,
and the use the replace command

00:00:06.652 --> 00:00:09.680
specifying the container i.d.
whose contents we want to replace

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.390
and the new fragment we want 
to put in there.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.040
And we execute the transaction 
by calling commit.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.070
Now you can actually chain 
a number of changes together

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.020
within the same transaction, 
so it's also possible to achieve

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.820
much of the same effect 
by first removing the contents

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.010
of container A and adding 
fragment B to that container.
