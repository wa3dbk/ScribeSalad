00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.179
Here are the correct answers. For a square, we know we need to multiply X plus 4

00:00:05.179 --> 00:00:09.668
by itself twice, the same is true for 3 x plus 1. I draw out my rectangle and I

00:00:09.668 --> 00:00:14.228
label each of the sides. Finally, we add up all the rectanges to get our total

00:00:14.228 --> 00:00:18.562
area. I can only add the 4x and the 4x areas together because they're like

00:00:18.562 --> 00:00:23.322
terms. That's where I get 8x. Down in this square, we have 3x times 3x, which is

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:28.714
9x squared. Then we have 3x times 1 which is positive 3x, and 1 times 1, which

00:00:28.714 --> 00:00:34.009
is positive 1. We add up all of these areas just like before to get 9x squared

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:37.598
plus 6x plus 1. Great work if you got these correct.
