00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.352
So we've been focusing on even functions for the last few quizzes, and I think

00:00:04.352 --> 00:00:08.610
it's time that we pay attention to the odd ones for a little bit. So let's ask

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.065
the same question of odd functions. Which of these choices apply in their case?

00:00:13.065 --> 00:00:17.113
Do they have symmetry across the x axis or the y axis? And do either of these

00:00:17.113 --> 00:00:19.500
rules about points on the functions apply?
