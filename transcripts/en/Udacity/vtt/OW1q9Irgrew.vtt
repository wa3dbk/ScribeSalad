00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.429
We've shown how an image texture can be applied to a model. However, these

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:06.964
sorts of mappings are only skin deep. If we carve away any part of the object,

00:00:06.964 --> 00:00:10.610
the fact that a 2D texture is getting used is revealed. What we'd like is

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.526
something that's more like a real material. The solution is to create a 3D

00:00:14.526 --> 00:00:18.459
texture that fills space. One way to define this texture is to actually create

00:00:18.459 --> 00:00:22.760
something like a stack of images. Unfortunately 3D textures are not yet

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.788
available in WebGL. My guess is wait a year. Another method is to make a

00:00:26.788 --> 00:00:30.925
function that takes in a point on a surface and gives back a color. If you

00:00:30.925 --> 00:00:34.510
think about it, these are equivalent in intent. Using images also takes in a 3D

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.930
point and gives back a color. Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.548
Functions have an unlimited resolution compared to textures, but you also have

00:00:42.548 --> 00:00:46.730
to be careful to filter their results. While I'm at it, I should mention you

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.840
can shade points on surfaces however you want with a fragment shader program.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.080
Here's an example of animated procedural textures in use. These examples are 2D

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.220
functions. They don't fill space, but show how elaborate effects can be

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.780
computed on the fly in the fragment shader.
