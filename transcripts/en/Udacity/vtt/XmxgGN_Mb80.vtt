00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.744
Other property attributes you may want
to include between these parentheses

00:00:04.744 --> 00:00:07.820
include readwrite, readonly, and copy.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.670
Notice that for the House class
we declared our properties in

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.560
the header file, the public interface.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.520
So right now,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.070
if I go into the main function, notice
that I'm outside of the House class.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.800
But I can get a hold of
an instance of House and

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.900
change its number of bedrooms for
example.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.700
Let's say we wanted
to limit that access.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.640
We could start by declaring number of
bedrooms in the implementation file so

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.910
that it's private.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.205
So we switch over to the .m file and
and we redeclare number of bedrooms.

00:00:38.365 --> 00:00:41.285
And we marked this private
implementation with the property

00:00:41.285 --> 00:00:43.925
attribute readwrite.

00:00:43.925 --> 00:00:45.785
Readwrite means what it sounds like.

00:00:45.785 --> 00:00:49.767
&gt;From inside the class, one can read or
write to this variable.

00:00:49.767 --> 00:00:52.517
Then we switch back to the .h file and

00:00:52.517 --> 00:00:56.047
we mark this version of
the property as readonly.

00:00:56.047 --> 00:00:59.697
Naturally, read only means that one
can read the value of the property but

00:00:59.697 --> 00:01:01.300
not write to it.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.520
Notice that if I go back
to the main function,

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.470
I can access the number of
bedrooms from outside the class.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.640
But I don't have to worry about
accidentally changing it.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.830
If I try to write to this property,
the compiler won't allow it.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.870
You can think of readwrite and
readonly as being similar to var and

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.740
lap in Swift.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.788
Readwrite is akin to defining
something as a variable and

00:01:23.788 --> 00:01:26.720
readonly is akin to defining
something as a constant.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.650
Since our address
property is an NSString,

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.450
we're going to want to mark it
with the property attribute copy.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.330
In general,
you want to use copy for strings.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.810
To understand why,

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.570
let's see what happens when we
don't mark the address with copy.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.450
Here we are in the main function
of the House class, and

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.940
in this line we're creating
a string that's holding an address.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.810
Now we're going to use that address to
initialize an instance of the House

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.100
class, myHouse.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.270
If we log the address of myHouse to
the console, we see 555 Park Ave.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.080
Cool, now let's say some joker
is writing test code and

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.580
they append this string La la Land
to the addressString variable.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.810
Notice that we never accessed
myHouse.address a second time?

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.980
But if we log the current value of
myHouse.address to the console,

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.750
we see 555 Park Ave., La La Land.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.080
So that's no good.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.050
We don't want to leave properties
of our classes vulnerable to

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.170
unintentional changes.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.810
Right now,

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.260
we're initializing the address property
with a pointer to addressString.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.640
We can fix this problem by initializing
the address property with its

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.360
own independent copy of addressString.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.390
So we'll go back to our house.h file,

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.260
we'll mark address with copy,
and then run the program again.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.010
You can see that this time the value
of myHouse.address doesn't change.
