Well, were able to remember directions because of our short term or sometimes

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.225
called our working memory. Working memory allows for the day-to-day fluidity of

00:00:08.225 --> 00:00:12.287
our actions. So this includes things like listening to someone speak, and

00:00:12.287 --> 00:00:17.240
remembering what they're saying during the conversation. Same thing with

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.906
reading and remembering what you're reading. Now, working memory can be

00:00:20.906 --> 00:00:25.168
transfered into long-term memory, but only if we practice. Otherwise these

00:00:25.168 --> 00:00:28.728
memories are lost. For example, in the case of a phone number, you may have to

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:31.412
repeat it over and over again in your head until you dial the number, or you

00:00:31.412 --> 00:00:33.380
may forget it.
