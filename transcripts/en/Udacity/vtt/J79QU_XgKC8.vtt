Lauren's right. Now, we're going to move on and talk about the Central Nervous

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:09.736
System Depressants or CNS Depressants. These include the Barbiturates, the

00:00:09.736 --> 00:00:15.143
Benzodiazepines, and alcohol. The CNS Depressants slow activity in the Central

00:00:15.143 --> 00:00:19.767
Nervous System, and the Benzodiazepines and Barbiturates are used medically to

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:26.066
treat anxiety, as well as insomnia. In general, the benzodiazepines and

00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:31.052
barbituates produces effects that are similar to alcohol. In fact, these three

00:00:31.052 --> 00:00:35.910
drug types are behavioral, motor, and cognitive inhibitors. A person may

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.250
respond to a low dose with feelings of relaxation or decreased anxiety.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.352
However, in some people that same dose can produce aggressive and even violent

00:00:44.352 --> 00:00:50.520
behavior. In general, the CNS to presence can cause motor impairment, cognitive

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.910
impairment, slurred speech, disorientation, mental confusion and even amnesia.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.842
We're going to send it back to Lauren to talk about these three drug types.
