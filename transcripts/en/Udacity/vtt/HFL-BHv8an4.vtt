00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.180
Typically, whenever we're working
with an existing Gradle project,

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.830
we'll be using the wrapper,
because that way we can ensure that

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.240
everyone working on the project is
using the same version of Gradle.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.710
For our purposes however, it'd be a bit
of a pain to generate the Gradle wrapper

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.500
scripts for
every single one of these folders, so,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.340
we'll have you use a local
installation instead.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.339
You can find these instructions in the
course repository under

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:24.019
1.02-Exercise-InstallGradle.

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.930
These instructions will have you first
check that you have got a working Java

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:27.940
installation and

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.720
then we'll walk you through
the process of installing Gradle.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.910
Note that if you're on Mac and

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.580
you are a Homebrew user, that's
a very easy way to install Gradle.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.510
Also on Mac, there is the GVM,
the Groovy Environment Manager, and

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.530
that will also automatically
install Gradle for you.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.520
Those are some good
options to check out.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.410
So let's walk through the process
of installing Gradle manually.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.710
First let's check that we have
a working Java installation.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.610
Looks like we're good to go here.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.990
If you don't have a working Java
installation there are instructions for

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.590
how to install that in
the course repository.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.440
Now we need to download Gradle.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.650
Head on over to
Gradle.org/downloads to do so.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.610
We want the complete distribution.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.140
Once we have the Gradle complete
distribution downloaded,

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.720
we need to do a bunch of other
things to get Gradle installed.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.060
We need to move it to an appropriate
place on our machine, our suggestion is

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.480
user local Gradle, and then we also
need to add a few environment variables.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.720
You can do all of this by yourself,
however, if you just paste in this

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.890
giant block of script into your console,
that'll do it all automatically.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.120
All right, here goes nothing.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.930
There we go.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.790
Gradle has been extracted to user local
Gradle, and now we're ready to rock.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.160
By the way,
if that last command complained,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.930
you might need to run it with sudo.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.010
All right.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.070
Let's see if Gradle installed correctly.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.290
Hey, there we go, that's looking good.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.860
Gradle 2.3, ready for action.
