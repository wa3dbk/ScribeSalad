00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.850
We've been talking about the importance
of protecting sensitive data.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.590
Actually, a lot of our sensitive
data is stored in databases.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.530
When you hear about a major data breach,

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.750
chances are that a database
was compromised.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.640
So, in this lesson,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.140
we're going to explore issues
that are unique to databases.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.500
How do we do access control for
data that is stored in a database?

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.230
Are there new kind of attacks that
are possible, and if yes, are there new

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.440
defenses that we need to use to protect
the data that is stored in databases?
