00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.030
Here, the final solutions are 3 plus or minus 3 times the square root of 2.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.588
Great work if you found those answers. The coefficient in front of this x

00:00:08.588 --> 00:00:13.364
squared term is a 1, since it's not listed. So, a equals 1, b equals negative

00:00:13.364 --> 00:00:17.790
6, and c equals negative 9. We substitute the values of a, b, and c into our

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.371
quadratic formula, being sure to use parenthesis around each of the values. So,

00:00:22.371 --> 00:00:26.592
we'll have positive 6 for the negative of b, we'll have 36 for squaring b, and

00:00:26.592 --> 00:00:32.976
then we'll have positive 36 for negative 4acC. Here, the denominator will just

00:00:32.976 --> 00:00:38.367
be 2, 2 times 1. We have 36 plus 36 in our radical, so really, that's 2 times

00:00:38.367 --> 00:00:43.713
36. I leave it like this since I can take the square root of 36, which is 6.

00:00:43.713 --> 00:00:47.997
The 2 stays inside of our radical, and then we simplify it by dividing each of

00:00:47.997 --> 00:00:54.201
these terms, 2 into 6 equals 3 and 2 into 6 radical 2 is 3 radical 2. Another

00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:57.540
way to think about this is we could factor 2 from these two 6s, leaving us with

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.782
this numerator. We cancel the common factors that reduce to 1, leaving us with

00:01:02.782 --> 00:01:06.430
3 plus or minus 3 root 2, our final solutions.
