00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.732
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now that you've had some practice finding equations of horizontal and

00:00:04.732 --> 00:00:10.088
vertical lines, let's try some other kinds of equations. For this problem I want

00:00:10.088 --> 00:00:15.065
you to find the equation of the line that goes through the points negative 2,

00:00:15.065 --> 00:00:20.001
negative 3 and 2, 7. I want you to write your answer in this box in standard

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:25.786
form. Remember standard form is ax plus by equals c. Now remember you're going

00:00:25.786 --> 00:00:31.473
to have to find the slope between these two points before you can find the

00:00:31.473 --> 00:00:34.787
equation of the line. Just try your best.
