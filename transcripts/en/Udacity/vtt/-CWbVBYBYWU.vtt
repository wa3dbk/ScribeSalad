00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.012
Hi, I'm here again with Scott Murray.

00:00:02.012 --> 00:00:04.910
And when you think about the future of data visualization what are you

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:05.760
most excited about?

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.290
&gt;&gt; Can I start with what I'm not excited about?

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.226
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:10.226 --> 00:00:13.611
&gt;&gt; Not excited about more tools, more data.

00:00:13.611 --> 00:00:16.242
That's like, usually I think what people are excited about, but

00:00:16.242 --> 00:00:19.090
it's like every week some new tool gets announced.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.750
And every week, you know, some government releases and some new data set and

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.220
like, it's all very good, but it can just be so

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.485
overwhelming, I think especially for people who are new.

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:31.560
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. &gt;&gt; So I have to say, on one hand, I'm excited about that.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.115
And on the other hand I'm like, not very excited about that.

00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:40.377
I guess what I am excited about is having better resources for

00:00:40.377 --> 00:00:45.370
new people, and, and having like all, so much excitement.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.652
Like just, just getting these new people into the field.

00:00:48.652 --> 00:00:51.910
because kind of like I was saying earlier,

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.480
like everybody brings their own experience, and it's been, you know?

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.588
I think visualization actually has this really long history, but

00:01:00.588 --> 00:01:05.500
it's sort of because it's kind of blowing up in this whole new way just recently

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.701
like with this convergence of, of open data, and tools, and open source, and

00:01:10.701 --> 00:01:15.869
all the sort of things you need to practice at getting more and more accessible.

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.558
Plus of course kind of the, the, the buzzwords of big data and

00:01:18.558 --> 00:01:20.390
like all the stuff we're excited about.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.731
So, all these things have converged to make this like a really hot

00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:25.464
exciting field right now.

00:01:25.464 --> 00:01:30.677
Which is great, but I think we forget that there's this whole history.

00:01:30.677 --> 00:01:34.958
You know, of this field and that this, this history is related to kind of

00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:39.280
representations of information before we started calling it data vis.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.999
And it goes back to, to design and like how we evolved written language, and

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:47.554
you know, hieroglyphics and all this, all this stuff.

00:01:47.554 --> 00:01:51.709
So I think, kind of in the, the early days in this new resurgence of

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:56.683
data visualization, practice was limited to kind of some academics, and

00:01:56.683 --> 00:02:01.359
then a handful of, of really specialized design firms but now it's,

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.686
it's much, much bigger than that.

00:02:03.686 --> 00:02:04.458
So we have lots of people.

00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:07.943
We have people internal at companies who just do data vis for that company.

00:02:07.943 --> 00:02:10.560
We have more and more of these kind of

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.100
boutique design firms that do kind of data design, data visualization.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.532
We have existing firms like design firms,

00:02:17.532 --> 00:02:20.768
graphic design who are getting into doing data.

00:02:20.768 --> 00:02:25.346
And so, and then of course we have like students, and academics, and just kind

00:02:25.346 --> 00:02:29.370
of people who don't fit into any of those categories who are practising.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.260
So I think that's really really exciting, but it's also,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.100
like I said, challenge for us because we have the existing books, and

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.710
resources, and things are great, but not totally adequate because they,

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.500
they address kind of different audiences in, in that vain.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.020
Edward Tufte's books are fantastic, but, like he's a statistician, and

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.130
they're coming from this one point of view.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.060
And I, I still recommend the books to everyone, but

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.930
they don't address all of the latest kind of developments in interactive design.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.200
And, what does this mean translating these ideas to a mobile experience?

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.750
What does this mean translating this idea to a dashboard or a billboard, or

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.200
you know, something in advertisement?

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.853
So, there're all kinds of these new considerations, and

00:03:14.853 --> 00:03:19.529
I guess I'm, I'm excited about us sort of together gradually figuring out

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:22.250
ways to address all those considerations.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.350
&gt;&gt; What are you most excited about when you think about the future of

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.820
data visualization?

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.280
&gt;&gt; I think what we're most excited about at Plotley and

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.720
we think a lot about, is what it would be like to be able to have massive,

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.460
worldwide collaboration in doing data analysis and graphing?

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.985
And so, a big part of what we thought about for

00:03:46.985 --> 00:03:49.740
Plotley, is making everything web-ready.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.260
So, if you already know, let's say,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.040
MatLab, or you're really good at using Excel, we don't think that

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.890
it makes a lot of sense for you to also have to learn how to do web development.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.900
So we've tried to make it so it's really easy to keep using the tools that

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.490
you're using, but then being able to get a web and

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.832
collaboration layer for sharing your work with people from any language

00:04:14.832 --> 00:04:20.160
who are using any different type of technology, any different data type.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.850
And so it can really kind of be a translation layer, because if you have

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.230
really sophisticated, let's say, political scientists, and engineers, and

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.370
data scientists, who are all able to collaborate between their respective

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.870
preferred development languages, and tools, and able to discuss things, and

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:45.790
make reproducible graphs, and data, and work on massive research projects.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.790
We really hope that it would be able to further, you know,

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.730
science and collaboration in really any field.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.575
You know, so we've thought about what if folks from NASA

00:04:56.575 --> 00:05:00.320
were streaming flight data and showing live satellite data.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.420
What if groups that were doing research on cancer were able to share their resu,

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.826
results with the world, so

00:05:05.826 --> 00:05:09.755
anyone can reproduce their work and get involved with what they're doing?

00:05:09.755 --> 00:05:14.075
So experts can collaborate naturally even if they didn't necessarily plan to do

00:05:14.075 --> 00:05:15.390
so from the beginning.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.550
Because if you make data, and if you make graphs, and you make tools available,

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.860
and free, and easy to use, we think there's a lot of power behind that.
