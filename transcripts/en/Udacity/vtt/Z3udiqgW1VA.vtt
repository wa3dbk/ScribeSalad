00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now--what happened is--we set our form action to be google.com/search--

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
we can see here in our URL--and the form added the value

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that we typed in on our form to the q parameter.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Remember--q came from our HTML.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's the name of the input element--it's the name of that text field.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And that's why we keep seeing it in the URL.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Let's go back to our form.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Okay--I'd like you to type something else in the form,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and you're going to tell me what happens.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This time we're going to type in better flight search--and click submit.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Okay--so--what I'd like you to do is go to your form,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
type the phrase "better flight search" into the form, and click submit.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.169
What I'd like you to tell me is what is the value of the q parameter in the final URL?
