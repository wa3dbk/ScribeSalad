00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The next thing is revenue streams. How do you actually make money

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
from your product and service being sold to customer segments?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You know revenue streams basically ask the question what value is the customer paying for

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and then actually as you think about what's the strategy of how long I'm going to capture that value.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Is it I'm going to just have a direct sale or it's a complete transaction based on price?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Is it a free me model where I'm going to give away the product for free

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and hope that some portion convert later.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Is it a license or subscription model?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
That revenue model is different than the pricing tactics.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
That is what is the dollar or pound amount or euro amount that I'm going to be charged.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Again the only way to figure this out is being able to interact with

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
tens or hundreds or thousands of customers so you finally understand

00:00:52.000 --> 99:59:59.000
what the right revenue streams and revenue model is.
