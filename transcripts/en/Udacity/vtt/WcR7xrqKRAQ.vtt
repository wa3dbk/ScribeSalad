00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.910
Okay so the next bunch of links
are about adding navigation to your app.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.020
Things like how do you go from
one activity to another or

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.760
one screen to another.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.420
Now we have the same process as before.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.870
For each link we're about to show,
read the tutorial, and

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.720
create a new Android project to
practice the contents of the tutorial.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.320
And then move on to the next link.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.820
Here we go.
