00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And the answer here is that you should set X1 to true,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
X2 to false, and X3 to false,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and the way to figure this out is,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
at least for me, it was the following:

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So you have to set X1 to true

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
because otherwise this thing here will be false,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and you see we have a number of N's,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
so if this evaluates to zero, the whole formula cannot be satisfied.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So we already know this assignment here,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
which gives us a 1 here and a 0 here also.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Now since we have a 0 here,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
we must make sure that not X2 evaluates to true,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
so we have to set it to false,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and if we set it to false, we get a 1 here, get a 1 here, and a 0 here.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And since this here has been set to 0,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and again we need to make sure that these brackets evaluate to true.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We also have to set X3 to false

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
so that this here becomes a 1,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
which gives us a 1 here as well and a 0 here as well.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And so for the whole thing, this here evaluates to 1,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
this here evaluates to 1 because this evaluates to 1, and this one here as well.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This goes to 1, and this goes to 1 here as well.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And so we have 1 and 1 and 1 and 1,

00:01:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
which satisfies the whole formula.
