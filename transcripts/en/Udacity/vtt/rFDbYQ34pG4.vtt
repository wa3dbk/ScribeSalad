00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In this problem, singly-hyphenated words,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
we're going to test our ability to use the or operator

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and the ability to group regular expressions.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And here we're going to write a regular expression

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that matches 2 types of words, normal words, such as alice and bob,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and also those with a single hyphen, such as super-irvin.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We, however, won't perfectly match a string such as super-mega-irvin,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
so we need to write a regular expression that perfectly matches alice,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
bob, super-irvin but doesn't match super-mega-irvin.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Well, one way to think about it is we have 2 types of regular expressions,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
one that matches normal words, or one that matches a word with a single hyphen.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Let's do one at a time.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
First let's do the one that matches a normal word.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This regular expression will match 1 or more occurrences of lower-case letters.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Okay, let's move on to the single hyphenated words.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
A single hyphenated word has 3 parts,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
a word, a hyphen, and another word,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
so here I match a word, a hyphen, and then another word.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Really I want to match either of these,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and in order to do this, I'm going to have to group them, and in Python

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
we group them using parentheses, and don't forget

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
the silly question mark colon notation as well.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And here we go as a regular expression.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Notice that I listed the hyphenated words first

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
because the way find all works is that it first checks

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
to see if this matches the left side of the operator and then the right side.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And if I'm running find all, I'd rather have it return the hyphenated word

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
super-irvin instead of first checking if the word matches just super,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
then seeing that hyphen doesn't match anything, and then returning irvin.

00:01:55.000 --> 09:59:59.000
I'd rather get the whole thing, super-irvin.
