00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here is the answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Obviously x1 minus L0 is -9, because L0 minus x1 is a measurement of +9.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Let's add this in. We add 1 over here on the main diagonal--1 and 1.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We subtract 1 off the main diagonal just like before--a simple pattern.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Then a 9 over here goes back to 0 but to 9 over here.

00:00:25.000 --> 09:59:59.000
I hope this makes perfect sense to you.
