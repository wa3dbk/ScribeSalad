Another feature of Flexbox that
I found to be really useful,

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.150
is the ability to change the order of
elements, using the CSS order attribute.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.970
For example, when the screen
width is 400 pixels or below,

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:18.840
the elements are shown in
the order of their markup.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.680
Keep an eye on this dark blue div,
and this red div, here.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.250
As the viewport changes size, the order
of the elements starts to change.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.689
To set the order, I just need to add
an order attribute to each element.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.730
This means your content,
can be totally responsive.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.940
In some layouts,
content appears in one order, but

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.420
in other layouts it appears
in a whole different order.
