00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
To try to understand the relationship between edges and nodes in a planar graph

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
we're going to use a result due to Euler--same Euler as before.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
To do that we're going to need another concept about planar graphs.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Here's a planar graph on five nodes.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Again, we have a notion of nodes. We have a notion of edges.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We're also going to now talk about a notion of regions in a planar graph.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Regions are kind of areas that are boxed off in the graph,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
plus the region outside of the graph.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Turns out that's a really useful thing to be able to talk about.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This particular graph has three regions.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We'll right it's got 5 nodes, 6 edges, and 3 regions.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Now, our good friend Euler discovered a fascinating relationship between these values.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
For any planar graph, n - m + or is equal to 2. Really?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Does that work in this case?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Let's check this formula with the values for this particular graph.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We've got n - m, 5 -6 is -1, plus 3 is indeed 2. Interesting.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We're going to figure out why that is in just a moment,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
but let's let you practice first understanding what these regions are.
