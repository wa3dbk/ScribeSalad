00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Search engines are really useful.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
To use them to solve problems like this, we need to know more about to search for.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We'll try searching for union and well, we get a lot of stuff that's not very useful.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We can see that the Philadelphia Union lost its last game.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We can learn about credit unions and Union College--that's not going to work very well.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We could try the same search on a different search engine, put DuckDuckGo,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and it's a little more helpful maybe.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It does give us computer science as one of the choices for unions but what it gives us under that

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is not too helpful for what we're looking for.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We could also try my personal favorite search engine--Search With PETER.info,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and if we search there let's see what we find--world domination plans,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and then we find the discussions on the Udacity forum about this very question.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This is kind of an unusual result and probably not what we should normally be doing.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
What we really should be doing is thinking of better things to search for.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Instead of searching for union, let's add Python to our search.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Let's search for Python in union and now we start already to get very interesting results.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We didn't need to think too hard about what to search for.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Searching for Python and the thing we want to do on Python actually turns out

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
quite a lot of useful information, and we can see the second hit here

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
is actually doing exactly what we want or something very close to it--

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
it's how to find the intersection in union of two list in Python, and if we cook on that,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
we can see some code and it actually has code for doing union.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
One thing we might do would just be to copy that code and I'm going to discourage you

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
from doing that but let's try that first.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
We found this code and this doesn't do quite what we wanted in the question

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
but what I'm going to ask you to do for the quiz is to take this code

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and turn it into something that does what you want.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Let's assume that you did this--you search for how to union two list in Python

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and you came up with this code and let's assume that if you have only taken CS101

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
that there's lots of things in here that might be a little strange to you--having this string here.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
We haven't used docstrings in CS101, so that looks a little strange.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
We haven't seen sets and we've seen lists but we haven't seen anything quite like this.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
There's a lot of mysterious stuff in this code, but let's assume it does what is says it does

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and your question is--could you use this to solve the original problem.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Your goal is to implement a union function that behaves as specified in the original question--

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
which is that modifies the first input to become the union.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So after calling union passing in a and b, instead of getting a result which is the union of the two list

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
as this code does, what you want to do is modify the value of a to contain the union of a and b.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And I should add a note here that says it's a pretty silly thing to do, but see if you can do it anyway.
