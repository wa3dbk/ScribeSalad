00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.880
And this criterion is called Modified Condition/Decision Coverage,

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.750
also called MC/DC. This criterion is very important because

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.330
it is often required for safety critical applications.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.920
For example, the FAA, the Federal Aviation Administration, requires

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.980
for all the software that runs on commercial

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.420
airplanes to be tested according to the Modified Condition/Decision

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.015
Coverage. So what is the key idea behind the

00:00:22.015 --> 00:00:25.270
MC/DC criterion? It is to test only the important

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.710
combinations of conditions instead of all of them, and limit

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.189
the testing cost by excluding the other combinations. And the way

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.950
in which it works is by extending branch and decision

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.860
coverage with the requirement that each condition should affect the decision

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.940
outcome independently. So let's see what this means with an

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.030
example that will also show you how you can reduce the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.940
number of combinations in this way. I am going to

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.460
show you an example of how MC/DC works using this predicate

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.870
which consists of three conditions. a, b, and c, which are all

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.070
in and, so the overall predicate is a and b and c.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.980
The first thing I'm going to do is to show you how

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.370
many test cases we will need to satisfy the multiple condition coverage

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.440
for this simple predicate. Which means, how many test cases we will

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.780
need to test all the possible combinations of true and false values

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.740
for these conditions. So I'm going to populate this table. And as you

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.870
can see, at the end we have eight test cases. Each test case

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.650
tests a different combination of values for a, b, and c.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.200
I'm also showing, for each test case, the outcome of the overall

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.930
predicate. So, for example, if we look at the first one, the

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.200
first test case, will be such that a is true, b is

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.210
true, and c is true. And therefore, the overall outcome of

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.360
the predicate is true. Now let's consider the first condition, a. As

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.300
I said a minute ago, what we want to test are the

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.160
important combination. Which are the comibatinos

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.930
in which a single condition independently

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.610
effects the outcome of the overall predicate. So if we consider a

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.490
and we look at this possible set of this cases. Let's try to

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.850
find two test cases such that the only difference between the two

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.960
test cases is the value of a, and the overall outcome of the

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.790
predicate is different. If we look at the table, we can see

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.920
that this is true for test cases one and five. If we look

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.030
at these two cases, we can see that the overall of the predicate

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.420
in the two cases is true and false, and that the only difference

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.720
between the value of the conditions in the value of a. So

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.990
these test cases satisfy exactly what we wanted. There are two test

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.270
cases in which the value of a independently decides the overall value

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.380
of the predicate. What we do, therefore, is to add these first

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.740
two test cases to our set of tests down here. Now let's

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.520
focus on b and let's try to find two test cases such

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.280
that the value of b is the only value that changes between

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.450
the two test cases, but the overall value of the predicate is

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.980
different, the same thing we did for a. And in this case,

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.610
we can see that if we select test case number one, and test

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.420
case number three, we have exactly that situation. b is true in the

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.250
first case, false in the second one, a and c don't change, but

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.830
the overall value of the predicate changes. And now you can notice

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.720
something else. That even though we selected two test cases, tested two values,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.950
one we already had. So, we only need three test cases overall to

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.730
test a and b according to MC/DC. Now, let's look at our last

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.510
condition, c. At this point, we know the game, so we

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.780
just have to look for two test cases that satisfy our

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.380
requirements. And in this case, one and two are suitable candidates.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.820
And once more, because we already have one, we just have to

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.070
add two to our list. So as you can see from

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.730
this example, we went from having eight test cases needed to cover

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.600
all the possible combinations of conditions to only four test cases

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.880
to satisfy the MC/DC criteria. So let's see where MC/DC stands in

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.510
our substantion hierarchy. This is what we had so far

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.430
in the hierarchy and this is where the MC/DC criterion will

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.930
stand. MC/DC criterion is stronger than branch and condition coverage.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.210
Why? Because it requires every single condition to be true and

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.400
false. And therefore, this section was a condition coverage criteria.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.610
And it also requires every predicate to be true and false

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.425
and therefore, this section is branch coverage. And in addition,

00:03:44.425 --> 00:03:47.790
it's got the additional requirements that the true and false values,

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.330
all the conditions have to also decide the overall

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.190
value of the predicate. So it's stronger. Which is more

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.130
thorough than branch and condition coverage and, as usual,

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.380
also stronger than branch coverage, statement coverage, and condition coverage.
