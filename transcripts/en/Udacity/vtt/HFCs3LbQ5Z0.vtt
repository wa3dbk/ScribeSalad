Two benefits the GeoJSON has over shape files is that it is human readable and

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.650
inspectable, and

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.790
since it's valid JSON it can be parsed by most programming languages.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.070
One downside of GeoJSON however that achieved these two

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.570
things it's often more verbose, resulting in a larger files size.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.970
And neither GeoJSON or shape files actually can encode topographic information.
