00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Megan has a question about security in the real world.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
She saw an ebook company that encrypts the ebook using as a key

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the person credit card number to place reliance presumably on the user

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to decide whether it's safe to share it.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This sounds like a really bad idea to me to be embedding personal information

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
in the ebooks.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The goal here is to watermark, to have the digital content specific to each user

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
in a way that if they distribute copies of it--they put it on a file-sharing site

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
or they abuse the copyright in someway--

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that it can be traced back to them.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
There has been quite a bit of work on using cryptography to make watermarks,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
especially in videos but also possibly in books and images.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
You can embed something that makes each image unique and as hard to remove without breaking the image.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
This is probably much harder to do for plaintext than it is for video

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
just because you can't really modify the text, but you could do things that--

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and this gets a little towards stenography where you're hiding a message

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
inside something that looks like an unencrypted document.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
You could be doing things where you are varying the spacing or you're changing

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
things that don't really affect the content.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Or, in the embedded information in the ebook that you don't actually see when you read it,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
you could be hiding some extra information which could embed the identity

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
of the person who bought the book.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
That would be possibly easy to strip out, so that's something that you need to worry about.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
If you want to use a watermark--in this case it seems like it's a really improper way

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
to treat the customers if they're not knowing this is happening and especially if it's their

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
credit card information that could be used in a way that's abusing the user.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
There are legitimate reasons to want to do watermarking of digital content like this

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and cryptography provides a great way to do it.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
The challenge if you're doing it for something like video is

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
you can do a lot of things to modify the video that might get rid of the watermark.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Simple things like using the lowest bits in each pixel to encode the watermark--

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
well, those are really easy to remove, because you can change all the lowest bits

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
in the pixels without changing what the video looks like.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So there are lots of clever schemes that  try to do things that are hard to remove,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
like changing the timing of black screens between scenes and doing things

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000
that are more pervasive in the whole image but still don't make the content broken.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
There are lots of social issues here about whether you can secretly track people

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and whether that should be illegal or encouraged

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
or what kind of authorization you need to do that.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Then there are interesting crypto issues of if it seems acceptable to do this in some context,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
like when a Hollywood studio is distributing a movie.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
They have a pretty good reason and good understanding of the people they distribute to

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
that they want to keep close track on it and find out if anyone is leaking copies early

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
to put a watermark in those things--to find a way to do that cryptographically

00:03:03.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that can't be easily removed and doesn't damage the content in ways that are noticeable.
