00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So let's apply what we just learned to help complete our interpreter to fill out what it means

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to evaluate statements.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Previously, we had an evaluate function expression.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Now I'm going to make a new function for evaluating statements.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It's going to take the abstract syntax tree and also the environment.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We need to know the values of variables.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
As always by convention, we can get the type of the thing we're looking for

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
from the 0th part of the tuple.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We did all this work in the parser to record it. Let's totally take advantage of that.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Well, 1 possibility is that it's an assignment statement.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Those look something like this.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Here's our statement type, assignment,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and its first argument or the first part of its tuple is going to be some variable name

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that we're assigning to, and then the second part is going to be

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
an arbitrary expression abstract syntax tree,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
so that corresponds to x becomes 3.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So I'll just get out the variable name and get out the right_child abstract syntax tree.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I'll figure out what the new value is by calling evaluate expression

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
because this right-hand side part could be more complicated.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
For example, it could be a binop of a bunch of things,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
so we're going to need to walk down that tree and interpret it--translate it

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
to figure out what it means.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Now we've got the new value,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and we'll just promise ourselves later on we're going to write some new function

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
called environment update that changes the environment so that variable_name

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
now points to new_value.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
This should remind you a lot of the chart update procedure that we wrote before.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
However, there are other types of statements.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
In addition to assignments, there are if-then-else.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
There are typically 3 parts of if-then-else.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The conditional expression--suppose our if-then-else is if x 00:01:48,000
I haven't drawn in the curly braces to save space, but this is the general idea--

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
then our conditional expression is x 00:01:56,000
The then statements are A. The else statements are B.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
But before we go farther, there is 1 complicating factor.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Remember that in JavaScript, you can have multiple statements inside this

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
compound statement block.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So really, we have then statement s and else statement s.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Your mission is to complete this code, and you can assume that there's a procedure

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000
called eval_stmts that takes statements as an argument and an environment.
