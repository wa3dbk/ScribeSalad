So, let's get back to computer graphics and see what a graphics processor can

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.914
really do. Well, guess what, computers are fast, a graphics processor consists

00:00:07.914 --> 00:00:11.830
of specialized computers working in parallel. Let's get some idea of how much

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.104
processing is involved in rendering a full stream. My monitor is 1,920 by 1,200

00:00:16.104 --> 00:00:20.104
pixels in size. I'd like to have a frame rate of 60 frames per second. How many

00:00:20.104 --> 00:00:23.023
pixels must be computed each second to attain this rate?
