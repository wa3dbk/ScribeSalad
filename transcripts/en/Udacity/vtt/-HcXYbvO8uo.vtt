00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.337
These would be my two factors, excellent work if you got this one correct. You

00:00:04.337 --> 00:00:08.703
might have done this in a couple of ways, let's check out one of the methods. If

00:00:08.703 --> 00:00:12.798
we switch the middle two terms we can see that we'll get a common factor of N in

00:00:12.798 --> 00:00:16.933
the first terms and a common factor by P in the second terms. If we factor a 7 N

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:21.546
from the first two terms we'll be left with two M and positive one. And if we

00:00:21.546 --> 00:00:26.142
factor a 5p from the second term, we'll be left with 1 and positive 2m. These 2

00:00:26.142 --> 00:00:30.828
factors might appear different but we just wanted to switch the order of these 2

00:00:30.828 --> 00:00:35.561
terms. Remember addition is commutative. Now that we can see there's a common

00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:39.820
factor of 2m plus 1 in the first term and 2m plus 1 in the second term. We

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.697
factor again which leaves us with our factored form, 7n plus 5p times 2m plus 1.

00:00:44.697 --> 00:00:49.503
But we could have regrouped the terms in another way. I could have grouped this

00:00:49.503 --> 00:00:54.321
first term and this last term together and then kept the middle 2 terms together

00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:58.912
as well. If we factor a 2m from these first 2 terms we'll be left with 7n and

00:00:58.912 --> 00:01:04.001
5p. Now in this last group of terms there's only a greatest common factor of 1.

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:09.429
They don't share any variable factors or number factors. Notice that I have 7n

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:14.966
plus 5p and 7n plus 5p in these two parenthesis. This is the next common factor.

00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:20.042
So, our two factors are 2m plus 1 and 7n plus 5p. Notice that these answers are

00:01:20.042 --> 00:01:24.159
exactly the same. We've just switched the order of the multiplication. This

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.025
first parenthesis represents a number. And the second parenthesis also

00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:31.992
represents a number. So, it would be like 2 times 3, would be the same as 3

00:01:31.992 --> 00:01:34.453
times 2. Our multiplication is commutative.
