00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.680
So, here I have a folder on my computer

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.320
with a bunch of photos. Now, you'll notice that

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.795
the message in these photos is all jumbled up,

00:00:07.795 --> 00:00:10.570
we can't quite read it just yet. Now, if I

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.600
zoom into these photos, you'll notice that the names

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.400
of the photos, they have numbers in them. And it's

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.240
our task to remove those numbers. And I wrote

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.650
a program that does just that. Let me run it.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.325
The output window shows all of the files that were renamed and if I look at the

00:00:28.325 --> 00:00:30.590
folders again, you'll notice that the photos have

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.110
been renamed. Their names don't have any numbers in

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.940
them anymore. Also, if I zoom out just

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.500
a little bit. You'll notice that the photos are

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.450
now revealing a message. Which in this case

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.410
is just, SOME SECRET MESSAGE. Let's build this program.
