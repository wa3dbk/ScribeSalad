00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now let's look at the Kalman filter.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The Kalman filter represents all distributions but Gaussians.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Just like in the last class where we talked about measurement cycles and motion cycles,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.000
the Kalman filter iterates two different things--measurement updates and motion updates.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This is identical to the situation before in localization

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
where we got a measurement and then we took a motion.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Here the max changes, but the basic principle applies.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Let's do a quiz to see if we remember the material from the last class.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
You might remember that one of the two steps, measurement or motion,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
required a convolution and the other one a product.

00:00:47.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Please check the corresponding box.
