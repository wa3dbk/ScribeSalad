00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.233
The root that we need is 2x minus 1. We can get this by multiplying each term

00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:09.320
here by 2. The denominator of our fraction over here. If we set this equal to

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.532
zero, we can double check that it gives us the same root. And, sure enough, it

00:00:13.532 --> 00:00:16.787
still gives us a zero of x equals 1/2. Awesome.
