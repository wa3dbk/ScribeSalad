00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.740
Okay, so
how do these magic hash functions work?

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.780
The purpose of a hash function is to
transform some value into one that can

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.370
be stored and retrieved easily.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.759
You give it some value, it converts
the value based on some formula, and

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.460
spits out a coded version of the value
that's often the index in an array.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.200
Let's go through an example
to clarify this process.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.780
Let's say you're running some big event.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.200
Maybe it's for
people who like a certain type of music.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.820
Everybody who wants to come to the event
needs to buy tickets in advance.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.740
All of those tickets are randomly
numbered, and those numbers are embedded

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.736
in bar codes on physical tickets that
people hand you when they first arrive.

00:00:40.736 --> 00:00:45.560
You need to be able to look up ticket
numbers fast when people check in at

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.800
the event.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.910
Storing the ticket number in one of
those incredible hash functions sounds

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.379
pretty great to you.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.320
You have all of your numbers,
now you just need to come up with

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.480
a hash function to convert them to hash
values so they can be stored easily.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.209
One common pattern in hash functions
is to take the last few digits of a big

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:09.300
number, divide it by some
consistent number, and using

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.920
the remainder from that division to find
a place to store that number in a array.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.179
In this case, the remainder turned
directly into the index of an array.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.259
Why does this strategy work?

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.720
Well, if the numbers we had assigned
to each ticket were 0 to 100,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.880
we could easily store it all in an array
and look them up instantly by the index.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.200
When numbers are big and
random like the ones we started with,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.340
we need some way to convert those
numbers into array indices quickly.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.220
That's how the constant
time lookup works.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.590
You give your number to a hash function,

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.300
which spits out a hash code that
turns into the index of an array.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.220
You can go to your array and
get your original value in constant time

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.390
since an array look up with
an index happens in constant time.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.679
Hm, why use the last few
digits of a big number?

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.650
In most cases the last few
digits are the most random.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.590
If you're assigning your
numbers in numerical order

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.820
The first few digits
really wouldn't be random.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.269
They're more likely to start with a 1,
a 2,

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.170
a 3, etc,
than later numbers like 7, 8, or 9.
