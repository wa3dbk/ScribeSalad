same as the population mean, divided by the standard deviation of this sampling

00:00:07.978 --> 00:00:15.622
distribution, which is the standard error. Sigma divided by the square root of

00:00:15.622 --> 00:00:24.681
n, that's 8.3 minus 7.47. Divided by 2.41 divided by the square root of 50. And

00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:27.244
this turns out to be about 2.44.
