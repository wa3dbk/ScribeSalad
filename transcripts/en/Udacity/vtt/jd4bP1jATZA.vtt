00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.878
Turning on shadows for a scene is pretty straight forward in 3JS. You enable

00:00:03.878 --> 00:00:07.230
the shadow map on the render itself, and tell the spotlight to cast shadows.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.542
For each object you have a choice. You can have it cast or not cast a shadow,

00:00:10.542 --> 00:00:14.253
and you can have it receive or not receive shadows from other objects. For

00:00:14.253 --> 00:00:16.754
example, if you know a ground plane is never going to cast a shadow, you can

00:00:16.754 --> 00:00:21.040
save a little. Processing by not setting the castShadow flag to true for it.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.388
One feature of 3 JS is that you need to set castShadow and receiveShadow for

00:00:24.388 --> 00:00:29.005
every piece of geometry. If you have an object3D that contains three meshes,

00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:32.729
you need to set the flags for each of the meshes. Setting the flags on the

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.337
object3D itself will do nothing. This is actually a constant struggle in seeing

00:00:36.337 --> 00:00:40.270
graph systems. What wins? If I set an attribute on a parent and on a child,

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.491
does the child setting win over the parent or vise versa. 3JS avoids the issue

00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:48.723
by simply not letting the parent have any say. It's tedious to go through every

00:00:48.723 --> 00:00:51.663
object and have to set these flags, especially for something such as the

00:00:51.663 --> 00:00:55.618
drinking bird. Happily, 3JS has a traversal method you can call that will walk

00:00:55.618 --> 00:00:59.672
through an object and all its descendants. Children, grandchildren, and so on,

00:00:59.672 --> 00:01:03.370
and do whatever you want with them. Here's the snippet I use. This code sets

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.025
the cast and receive shadow flags true on every object that makes up the

00:01:06.025 --> 00:01:09.725
drinking bird. It''s actually doing a little bit too much, as setting these

00:01:09.725 --> 00:01:12.409
flags on objects without meshes it doesn't do anything, in other words on

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.821
parents. Here's a better code. This is some real live Javascript, checking if

00:01:16.821 --> 00:01:20.205
an object has a mesh. If it does then the shadow flags have meaning for it, so

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:23.556
we set them. Give it a try now turning on shadows for the spotlight you added

00:01:23.556 --> 00:01:27.650
to the drinking bird scene. I've kindly set up the cast and receive shadow

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.687
flags for the drinking bird itself, but not for the ground plane. I'm also

00:01:31.687 --> 00:01:34.270
leaving it up to you to figure out where the various call to enable shadowing

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.906
go. For this exercise I've also added a little sphere representing the light

00:01:37.906 --> 00:01:41.725
source in the scene. If you move out you'll see it hanging in the air. Doing

00:01:41.725 --> 00:01:43.871
this for your lights is a handy way to get a better sense of where you're

00:01:43.871 --> 00:01:45.069
placing them.
