00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.366
Here's the answer.

00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:08.425
We'll start with the polynomial a and
for this I get the values 2, 5, 2, 5.

00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:11.140
You could have done
the calculation however you liked.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.880
To emphasize that we can view this
process as matrix multiplication,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.560
I've written out
the Vandermonde Matrix here.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.527
For b, we just change the coefficients.

00:00:20.527 --> 00:00:27.389
And we get 3, 5, -1, -3 for
the values of the polynomial.

00:00:27.389 --> 00:00:30.070
Multiplying in the value
domain is simple.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.930
We just multiply the corresponding
values at these inputs,

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.104
and that gives me 6, 25, -2, and -15.

00:00:39.104 --> 00:00:43.977
This gives me a matrix equation
here in terms of the desire

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:48.241
to coefficients of
the product polynomial C, and

00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:53.950
solving this gives me the answer
1 + 2x + x squared + 2x cubed.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.380
Which, you can easily verify is correct

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.160
by convolving those two sets of
coefficients in the normal way.
