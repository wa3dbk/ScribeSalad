00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.918
First, let's take a minute to look at the component life cycle.

00:00:02.918 --> 00:00:05.668
Components are produced by external developers.

00:00:05.668 --> 00:00:09.342
Hence, instead of the normal breakdown between development time and

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:12.216
runtime, there are really three phases to consider.

00:00:12.216 --> 00:00:15.618
Design time, deployment time and runtime.

00:00:15.618 --> 00:00:18.561
At design time, components are specified and built.

00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:21.109
During deployment, binaries are configured and

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.430
deployed into target execution environment.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.340
At runtime, components are instat, instantiated and executed.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.250
As we shall see, major differences exist between

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.590
component technologies depending on when composition takes place and

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.080
whether a repository for the components exists.
