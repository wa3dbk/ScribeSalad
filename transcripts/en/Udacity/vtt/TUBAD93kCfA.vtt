00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Dave:] Can you tell us more about what does it mean for software to be opensource?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
[Asa Dotzler:] For software to be opensource it means a couple of things.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
First, it means that the actual underlying source code to the piece of software is freely available,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that people can acquire that from a website or off of a DVD or in some other form

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and see the underlying source code that makes up that program.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But that's actually insufficient, because opensource also requires

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that not only can people see it but they can do what they want with it.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
They can take that piece of software, make modifications to it,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
develop their own products based on top of that.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
There are different licenses that opensource software operates under

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that have different requirements and responsibilities for those who take that source code

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and make modifications to it.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
At Mozilla with the Firefox browser, our license is called the Mozilla Public License,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and it says you're free to take the source code to Firefox and go build your own browser with it.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
You can do whatever you want to that source code and you can turn it into Walmart-Fox,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
if you're Walmart and wanted to.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
There's no requirement that you pay us for that, that you have any involvement with Mozilla.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
But if you make changes that improve the software that you got from Mozilla,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
you have to return those changes.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
If you take a feature and you make it faster or you add a new feature,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
making the browser more capable,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
you're free to ship that and under your own brand for whatever your own business model is,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
but you have to return those changes.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
This allows Mozilla to take the work that you've done, reincorporate it into Firefox

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and ship a new version that's as good as the version you shipped.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Different licenses behave in different ways.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Our license is pretty generous in that it says you can take our product

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and combine it with other products,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and you don't have to disclose any of your proprietary information.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
You only have to return to the Mozilla Project the pieces of our code that you altered.
