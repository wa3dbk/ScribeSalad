00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.583
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think this point is easier. I know the x and y coordinate are both

00:00:03.583 --> 00:00:07.691
positive, so it's going to be easier to plug in, to this equation. I won't have

00:00:07.691 --> 00:00:11.791
to deal with two negative signs. So for x1, I'm going to put 1. And for y1, I'm

00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:15.875
going to put 2. Keep in my mind, it doesn't matter which point you use. You'll

00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:19.719
still wind up with the same equation. I'm going to multiply both sides by x

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:23.917
minus 1. X minus 1 divided by x minus 1 makes 1. So, I have x minus 1 times

00:00:23.917 --> 00:00:27.950
negative 3 halves. I move the negative 3 halves in front of the x minus 1

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.395
because we usually list constants outside of parentheses first. Im going to

00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:36.968
multiply both sides of the equation by 2. I only need to multiply the negative 3

00:00:36.968 --> 00:00:41.782
halves by 2, because this number will be distributed to both terms. However, on

00:00:41.782 --> 00:00:45.860
this side, I need to multiply 2 to each of these terms. 2 times negative 3

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.248
halves is negative 3. And by distributing this two, I get 2y and negative 4.

00:00:50.248 --> 00:00:54.993
Continuing with distribution I have negative 3x plus 3 and 2y minus negative 4

00:00:54.993 --> 00:00:59.621
on the right. I'm going to try and solve this equation for y, I'm going to get

00:00:59.621 --> 00:01:04.534
it in slope intercept form. Adding 4 to both sides, I get 2y equals negative 3x

00:01:04.534 --> 00:01:09.253
plus 7. I added 4, because remember, I'm trying to get the y alone. I never used

00:01:09.253 --> 00:01:13.892
to seen y on the left side of the equation but this is okay. We can rewrite our

00:01:13.892 --> 00:01:18.632
equation in the end with the y on the other side and this on the right. Finally,

00:01:18.632 --> 00:01:22.750
we divide each term by 2 and we get y is equal to negative 3 halves x plus 7

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.188
halves. This is our equation in slope-intercept form. Notice I've just written

00:01:27.188 --> 00:01:31.057
the y on the left side, and this expression on the right side. Here's my

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:35.168
equation. There's also a quick check here. We want to make sure our slope is

00:01:35.168 --> 00:01:39.617
negative 3 halves. Is that what we found before? We can check and see the slopes

00:01:39.617 --> 00:01:43.428
are both negative 3 halves. So, yeah, we have at least have this part of the

00:01:43.428 --> 00:01:44.250
problem right.
