So you might notice that these quizzes at the end of every single lesson have

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.700
asked you to talk about what you learned in this lesson, to reflect on what you

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.280
learned in this lesson. One of the goals of these final quizzes is to

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.840
facilitate your own metacognition about your learning of this material as well.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.379
So by answering this, you think about your own learning, and

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.680
hopefully improve it for the future. So what did you learn during this lesson?
