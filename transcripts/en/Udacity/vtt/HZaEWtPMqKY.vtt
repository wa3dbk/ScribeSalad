00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.240
Let's have a little bit
more fun with operators.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.760
We'll start by using just
literals to demonstrate,

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.480
but these operators work with variables,
constants, and

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.370
if you're accessing struct property
values like we've seen so far.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.111
First let's add two numbers together and
as you expect, 5 + 3 = 8.

00:00:17.111 --> 00:00:19.427
We can subtract two numbers.

00:00:19.427 --> 00:00:23.608
And notice if we use subtraction
between these two numbers, 5 and 2.5,

00:00:23.608 --> 00:00:27.478
where one is a floating point number,
we get a floating point result.

00:00:27.478 --> 00:00:31.098
And that's because Swift compiler's
smart enough to know the difference

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:34.603
between subtracting two integers here
and getting an integer result and

00:00:34.603 --> 00:00:39.340
subtracting out a floating point value
here to compute a floating point result.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.240
We'll go ahead and do the same for
multiplication and

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.360
division but here's something
that's a little bit interesting.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.920
How come when we divide 5 by 3,
we just get the value of 1?

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.230
Well since the Swift compiler knows
both these literal values are integers,

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.820
when it performs the division it
does not include the decimal part.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.690
Instead, it truncates
the decimal part and

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.220
leaves you with this whole value of 1.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.090
Now let's see what happens with
the dreaded divide by 0 case.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.610
It looks like the Swift compiler
is smart enough to know

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.550
that this is a divide by 0 and
it can't execute this.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.560
But enough with these literals,
let's try some actual variables now.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.540
I created these ahead of time so
I'm just going to paste them in, and

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.880
we have a variable for
the value 5, 3, and 0.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.651
And now we're trying to do the same
5 / 0, or a divide by 0 case,

00:01:27.651 --> 00:01:30.530
but what's going on this time?

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.410
Last time the Swift compiler was
able to detect the divide by 0.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.960
Well this time since
we're using a variable,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.730
the Swift compiler cannot
automatically detect the issue.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.390
Instead, the playground file tries to
run this code, and as you can see,

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.420
the execution's interrupted
because it can't execute this.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.410
And we can tell that the execution of
the playground stopped, because if I try

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.720
to go a line below and do anything, we
can see that it never reaches this line.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.610
It stops right here.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.919
So let's just remove this.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.080
And comment this line out.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.360
There's one more operator I want to
introduce which belongs with add,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.780
subtract, multiply and divide and

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.160
that's the remainder operator,
also called the modulus operator.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.120
Many times you'll hear it called mod for
short.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.680
The mod operator allows us
to perform division and

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.210
then return only the remainder.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.180
And this operator's really useful
when determining multiples or

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.790
if a number's even or odd.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.070
By the way, the modulus
operator is the percent sign,

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.540
and we can see if we mod 10 by
the number 2, the remainder is 0.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.340
So we know that 10's an even number.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.540
Let's try this with an odd number.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.400
And in this case, cause the result is 1,
we know that the number is odd.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.750
But you don't just have to do even and
odd, let's try and example for say,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.400
multiples of 5.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.760
We know that 5 is a multiple of 5,
but 6, 7, and 8 are not, and

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.330
we can see the reminders here.
