00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
As far as I'm concerned, the best answer here is stress testing.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We're not doing regression testing because regression testing always

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
involves taking inputs that previously made the system fail

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and replaying them against the system, and the way I described it that wasn't the case here.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We're probably not doing unit testing because 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the software under test running on this processor,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
even if it's just one part of all of the software running on a car, still has many modules.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It has an operating system. It has some communication software.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It has the actual application functionality, whatever it's doing,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
controlling airbags, and so we're most likely not doing unit testing,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
although if you answered unit testing that's not a bad answer.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
But my personal judgement is that it's not the best one,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and we're certainly not doing white box testing because 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
we haven't considered at all the structure of the software under test here.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This is really a kind of black box testing.
