00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.570
At this point, your share gif
method should be in place and

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.230
connected to the share button.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.590
So your app might look
something like this.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.150
Here's a video of my coworker,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.250
who I accosted while she
was looking at her data.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.950
I add a caption, and
now I can text it to my teammate.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.380
And you can see that in the text
message it appears as a GIF.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.840
So now, we can check off Share the GIF.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.200
Next step, convert a video
from the album into a GIF.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.860
In order to convert a video
from the album into a GIF,

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.900
you'll need to create an action
sheet that has three options.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.190
Record a video.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.040
Choose from existing videos.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.570
And cancel.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.120
To enable the option to
choose from that album,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.590
you'll need to write a method
that launches the photo library.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.810
So let's move on to
create an action sheet.
