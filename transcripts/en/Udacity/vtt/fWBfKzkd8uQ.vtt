00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.220
&gt;&gt; Sure. So once we built the code generator, we built a number of

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.129
supporting tools that were useful in just understanding these assemblies and

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.730
communicating them to to others. One of them is a graphical visualization tool

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.580
that'll let you, let you look at in graph form in a,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.110
in a dot form. One of your assembly specs so that you can see exactly what

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.980
the dependencies are, how the different refinements compose with one another.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.070
That's been really useful particularly as we were developing our [UNKNOWN] to

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.320
begin with, because we've found that over time we could compare these,

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.500
these different visualizations and we could see them getting simpler and

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.190
simpler. So that was very useful. We also did we implemented some code metrics,

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.250
so that we could track how large or small our refinements were.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.520
We, we hypothesized and this actually born out to be true that over time and

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.090
after a lot of use, big refinements will break down into compositions

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.450
of smaller ones and in fact that's happened. And we use code metrics now to,

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.490
to help us find candidates that we should, should go

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.080
kind of proactively dive into. So yeah, there are a number of little tools and

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.430
supports like that, that are pretty useful.
