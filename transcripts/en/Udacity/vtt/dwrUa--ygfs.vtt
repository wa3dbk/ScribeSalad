00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.762
So, how does Google give feedback for
new Google apps?

00:00:03.762 --> 00:00:07.730
Even before internal testing
among employees, or dogfooding,

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.960
each app goes to the Google
User Experience review process.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.230
The goal of this process is to get the
app in front of experienced Googlers to

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.980
focus on various parts of the user
experience, such as design,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.070
interaction patterns,
accessibility, and more.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.120
As we looked into productionizing
Sunshine, we wanted to get some expert

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.710
help with the UI that would
both leverage a broader set of

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.740
implementations skills than we were
able to present in the first course.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.720
And begin to illustrate
a material design concepts.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.320
Of course we turned to Android UX legend
Roman Nurik who has helped many Android

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.970
developers improve the UX of their
applications with direct feedback.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.590
Develop design tools to make
constructing Android UX easier.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.905
And who has contributed DashClock and
Muzei to the Android world.

00:00:48.905 --> 00:00:53.410
[SOUND] Roman, it's so
great to have you here with us.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.793
Now, when you first looked at
Sunshine from Android Fundamentals,

00:00:56.793 --> 00:01:00.077
what are the things that you felt
worked really well in the design?

00:01:00.077 --> 00:01:03.815
&gt;&gt; So, let me take out my phone and
just point them out.

00:01:03.815 --> 00:01:07.701
So, I think that the first thing
that was done really well was just

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:11.980
the use of hierarchy, or
the overall hierarchy of the screen.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.130
Yeah you have your branding on top and
then you have

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.240
the most important piece of information,
the current conditions and

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.100
weather, at the top as well in this
kind of nice, big display type.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.290
And then below that you have the
secondary information, the forecast for

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.130
tomorrow and the next day and so on.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.690
That was one.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.862
I think another that was done
really well is the use of keylines.

00:01:31.862 --> 00:01:36.970
So keylines are essentially these
invisible vertical rules that

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.390
you can use to align
streams of information.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.870
And it felt like specifically the use of
that second keyline, the one where you

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.684
have the brand name, the current
temperature, the dates of the kind

00:01:50.684 --> 00:01:55.060
of later forecast, those are kind of
left aligned to that second keyline.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.940
And I feel like that is
really nice in helping

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.340
visually process the information very,
very quickly.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.040
So I feel like those are probably
two of my favorite aspects of

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.230
the existing design.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.199
&gt;&gt; Tell us a bit about what you designed
in the new production version of

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.560
Sunshine, and why.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.320
&gt;&gt; Well,
I think I'll just talk about one,

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.700
I think that there's one that's
really important here, and

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.530
it's an essential part of material
design, and that's the use of surfaces.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.710
So the first is I felt that, well, with
surfaces, I guess, in the existing app,

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.590
you kind of, I guess the use of
surfaces was all over the place.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.390
On portrait phone screens,

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.860
on landscape tablet screens,
it wasn't really consistent.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.760
It felt like information was being
presented in different ways.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.480
And what's worse, on landscape tablet's,

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.690
you actually had this kind of
massive sea of white space.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.510
And the information was kind
of floating on top of that.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.050
And it felt like the use
of surfaces can really help

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.410
both manage that white space,
and introduce consistency.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.310
And so in the new design,
we use this single elevated white card

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.630
to present the current conditions of,
I guess the current temperature, right?

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.680
And we use that consistently
across phones and tablet's.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.720
And so, that does three things.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.390
The first is that, again, it
introduces consistency across screens.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.964
The second is it that actually
makes it easier to do motion to,

00:03:19.964 --> 00:03:22.980
another big part of
shell design is motion.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.980
It helps you do things like
transition from list to detail.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.670
When you can kind of have a single
object that appears in both and

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.530
transition them,
it's really nice and easy.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.810
And I guess the third is it really
kind of helps you manage space.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.090
On that landscape tablet screen, the
fact that you can have this kind of nice

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.960
big card to present one
major stream of information.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.240
And kind of have everything else fall,
I guess, from outside of that.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.640
It makes a nice use of space, I guess.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.370
I mean just very bluntly,

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.330
it's a really nice use of that
massive screen real estate.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.286
And so it does those three
things really well I think.

00:04:04.286 --> 00:04:08.186
And that's one of the things that we
really focus on in this redesign for

00:04:08.186 --> 00:04:08.838
Sunshine.

00:04:08.838 --> 00:04:12.541
&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Wow, tons of great feedback.

00:04:12.541 --> 00:04:15.003
Like we expected,
we have a really good start.

00:04:15.003 --> 00:04:18.154
But there are some rough edges to work
through before we have a production

00:04:18.154 --> 00:04:20.180
ready user experience.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.120
So, how does that constructive feedback
map to our production quality goals?

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.010
Well, the design feedback we got
around consistency, white space, and

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.150
motion fall under [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.410
Those little details can really
make Sunshine stand out.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.090
When you combine that with
the suggestions Team FixIT has made,

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.530
such as under Simplify My Life, having
Sunshine display useful information,

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.440
even when there's no network
connectivity or poor user input.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.500
And under Make Me Amazing,
having Sunshine open up new,

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.630
extremely useful ways of getting
weather information front and center.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.370
We had some pretty good ideas about
how to start getting us closer

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.590
to the production of Sunshine.
