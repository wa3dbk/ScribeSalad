00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.370
We can avoid the unrecognized
selector error

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.390
by using optional chaining when we call
methods on objects of type AnyObject.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.210
Method calls on objects of type
AnyObject can be treated as implicitly

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.945
unwrapped optionals.

00:00:13.945 --> 00:00:17.865
Here, the call to openDoor
will just silently fail.

00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:22.085
Placing the question mark after openDoor
is equivalent to conditioning on a call

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:25.995
to the method responds to
selector in Objective-C.

00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:28.335
If we want some notice
when this method fails,

00:00:28.335 --> 00:00:31.690
because the method call acts like
an implicitly unwrapped optional,

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.580
we can use if let to handle
two different conditions.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.300
Another prudent alternative for

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.130
handling objects of type AnyObject,
is to cast them to a more specific type.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.460
Since you can't always be sure
what that more specific type is,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.190
it's safest to use the conditional
typecast operator as?, like so.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.300
And if we run it,
we can see that this avoids a crash.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.740
And if we grab the second item in
the array instead of the first,

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.685
the cast succeeds and so
does the call to openDoor.
