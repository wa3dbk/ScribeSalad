00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.930
The final type of data we'll talk about is

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.070
time series data. Time series data is simply a

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.600
collection of observations obtained through repeated measurements over time.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.590
In plain English, a time series is simply a sequence

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.450
of numbers collected at regular intervals over some period

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.500
of time. For example, we might measure the average number

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.600
of home runs per players for many different years.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.020
Time series data is not so different from numerical data.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.800
The real difference here is that rather then having a

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.159
bunch of numerical values which don't have any time ordering,

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.560
time series data does have some implied ordering. There's a

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.170
first data point collected and a last data point collected.
