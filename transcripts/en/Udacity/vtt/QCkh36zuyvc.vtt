00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here's an example of a graph--imagine this is a social network graph,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and we're going to look at the degree centrality of the nodes in the graph.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's take a look at node 5.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Node 5 has a degree centrality of 2 which really just means

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
it has a degree of 2--there's 2 edges coming out of it.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What I'd like you to do is go through the nodes in this network and figure out which node

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
has the highest degree centrality in the network and then write your answer in the box.
