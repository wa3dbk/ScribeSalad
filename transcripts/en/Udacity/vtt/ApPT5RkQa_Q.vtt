00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.620
The first two are equal to negative 1, the 3rd one is equal to positive 1, and

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.788
the last one is something else. We know these first two are equal to negative 1

00:00:08.788 --> 00:00:13.040
since each rational expression contains opposite polynomials. The x terms are

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.284
opposite in sign here, and the y terms are also opposite in sign. So we know

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:21.930
that this fraction can simplify to negative 1. The same is true for this

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.546
fraction. The b squared terms are opposite in sign, the 5b terms are opposite in

00:00:26.546 --> 00:00:31.091
sign and the constant of 1 is also opposite in sign. I didn't show the factoring

00:00:31.091 --> 00:00:34.910
here, but we know that it will equal negative 1 if we remove a factor of

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.398
negative 1 from the denominator and cancel our trinomial. In our third example,

00:00:39.398 --> 00:00:43.666
the y terms have the same sign, and the x terms have the same sign. So really,

00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:47.926
this fraction is the same expression. In this third rational expression, the y

00:00:47.926 --> 00:00:52.592
terms have the same sign, as do the x terms. If we switch the order of addition

00:00:52.592 --> 00:00:57.194
in the numerator, we'll have x minus y divided by the quantity x minus y. We

00:00:57.194 --> 00:01:01.802
know these expressions are exactly the same, so we really have 1 divided by 1,

00:01:01.802 --> 00:01:06.034
or just positive 1. For this last expression, we know it needs to equal

00:01:06.034 --> 00:01:10.570
something else. We can't just square each term and call it a day. We know that

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.308
this is really x plus 2 times x plus 2. When we square a binomial, we get a

00:01:16.308 --> 00:01:21.230
perfect square trinomial. Looking at this numerator and denominator, we know

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.634
that our fraction doesn't equal positive 1 or negative 1.
