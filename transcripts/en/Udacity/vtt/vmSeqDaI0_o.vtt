00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In this case, it's easy--it's this one, because it seems to describe the data almost perfectly

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
whereas the red one has substantially an error as does the green curve even more so.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Let's look at more data, which line would you pick?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The one in the middle, the red one, the blue one, or perhaps any of those.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Perhaps, it is all equally good. It turns out green is the right answer. Let's just look at this.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The blue one suffers no loss for the three points over here

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
but a fairly substantial loss for the other three data points.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Let's call this loss c.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So, the blue curve would have an error of 3c²--if this distance here is called c.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The reason why it's squared is because we have three of those

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and we're using the quadratic distance.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Similarly, the red one has the same problem, 3&lt;i&gt;c² for the red one.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Now, how about the green one? For the green one, we have errors for all six points.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But now, the amount of the error itself is half as big as c. So, we're going to write (c/2)².

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And when you work this out, you'll find that this is 6/4 c² is the same as 3/2 c².

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So, the total error  for the green one, the quadratic error,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
is half as big as it is for the blue one and that's a surprise.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
It has to do with the fact that in a quadratic version of the error,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
large errors count much, much more than small errors.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So, green is the best regression line we can find for this data

00:01:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
over here among the choices I've given you.
