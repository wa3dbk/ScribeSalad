00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.040
So, user research is the umbrella name for

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.230
a wide array of techniques you can use to

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.390
just understand who your users are with the

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.870
goal being to learn to design and develop better

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.210
products. It can run from, in lab testing,

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.760
where you have head-mounted tracking equipment and all kinds

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.775
of sensors to going to field studies where you

00:00:23.775 --> 00:00:25.780
hop on airplanes and go to all the corners

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.490
of the globe. To watching your logs, where you're getting

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.369
data from millions of users. And kind of trying to

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.330
understand what they're doing and how you can do it

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.440
better. Or you can do it much more cheaply, much more

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.510
quickly. And because every little bit that you do, to

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.060
kind of better understand your users is going to be tremendously

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.560
valuable to you. So you can do things like just

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.170
talking to a handful of people. But taking printouts or drawings

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.940
of what you think you're going to build and putting it

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.870
in front of people and getting their responses to it. Like

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.680
lots of little things can help you tease away little bits

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.270
of information about who your users are and how you can

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.200
better work for them. We all think we know ourselves

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.240
pretty well, so naturally if you just kind of base on

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.860
what you know about yourself and what you want, you'll build

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.270
a product that hopefully satisfies at least you. But you also

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.920
cover so many experiences, so many preconceptions, so many assumptions, about

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.370
what this project should be, how it should work, built on

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.700
everything you've gone through with other products before in your life.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.060
You don't share that with all of your users and you

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.520
may not even share the same goals for this product with

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.720
your users. If you want to build something that's really successful, you

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.910
need to understand them, where they're coming from, where they're trying

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.410
to go. And then you can build a product that completes that

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.610
story for them. Even if time is short and you just

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.690
have to make a decision right now and you can't take

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.020
the time to go out and talk to other people, just

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.610
by thinking about that persona, inventing it. Takes you out of

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.180
your own head and starts you thinking about somebody else. So

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.340
it's better to kind of build for that other, even if

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.240
it's not based on hard data than to just bias towards

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.430
your own needs. This was awhile back but I was working on

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.979
a product for, kind of, bloggers who weren't

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.360
bloggers yet. Kind of non-expert bloggers to create posts

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.790
and start sharing things and I wasn't interested

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.560
in blogging as a product at all. So it

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.030
was very much that I had to kind of

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.290
think about users who strongly weren't me. And I

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.090
remember in particular there was this desire from

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.450
users that surprised me that they just wanted to

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.420
record audio for their blogs. They didn't even want to sit down and

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.960
write it, they want to kind of compose these things, they want to be able

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.698
to be out and to go and just. You speak into their phone

00:02:40.698 --> 00:02:43.997
and [SOUND] pop up comes the entry. It's a kind of thing that

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:46.534
I would of never thought about if I had only referred like what

00:02:46.534 --> 00:02:49.340
I would of expected out of that product. I would of assumed, oh,

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.350
I want to spend time crafting this and typing this thing. But its

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.570
turned out to be one of the most satisfying parts of that product

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.380
for users and something that was also a differentiator between

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.250
other that and other products that were on the market.
