00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.650
We're not quite done however, so far we've been in the,

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.160
we've been engaged in building the state chart model. Once the modeling is over,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.930
the resulting stays sharp but still be validated.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.760
There are various ways we could, we could perform this check.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.980
We could hold a review that is get a team of people involved in.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.680
I'll walk through the use cases and make sure that each of the concurrent

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.040
machines is doing what you would expect it to do. You could do model checking.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.970
Model checking is a, is an automated technique where you can

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.710
encode all of the concurrent state machines and any

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.790
questions or tests. You'd like to determine whether or

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.365
not the state machine can ever happen in the state machines and then you can run

00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:56.940
what's called a model checker to determine whether those things can ever happen.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.910
And we could even and this is similar to but he could have a separate,

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.682
we could build a simulator of the execution using some kind of

00:01:06.682 --> 00:01:11.230
state chart interpreter, which probably others as, as well, including going

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.030
back to the users with any questions that arise during this validation process.
