00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.205
So, to answer a question like this, it helps to draw a class diagram. So, we

00:00:04.205 --> 00:00:09.598
have class A, which base class is B. And the way this is typically drawn is to

00:00:09.598 --> 00:00:15.118
show an arrow pointing up from the derived class to the base class. Now, we have

00:00:15.118 --> 00:00:20.320
class C inheriting from A and class D also inheriting from A. And then, we have

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.088
class E inheriting from D. So now, it's easy to answer our questions. So, the

00:00:25.088 --> 00:00:29.833
question. What the subclasses of A is, is any class where you can follow these

00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:35.066
arrows up and reach A so the direct subclasses are C and D. E is also a subclass

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:38.614
of A. The second question, what are the superclasses of E? And that would be

00:00:38.614 --> 00:00:42.680
the, any class we can reach starting from E following the arrows up. And there's

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.338
one more, which you would get a bonus if you got this as well, which is the

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:49.883
object class that's built in. We don't know anything else about B. It may have

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:54.965
other superclasses, but we know it must have object as one of it's superclasses

00:00:54.965 --> 00:00:59.872
because all classes we define in Python eventually reach the object class.

00:00:59.872 --> 00:01:03.840
Finally, which class is inherit from D? There, it's only one class, which is

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.303
class E.
