00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.426
One of the most famous trends is probably one

00:00:02.426 --> 00:00:05.610
you have heard of, it's Moore's Law. Moore's Law

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.720
roughly states that every one and a half to

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.750
two years, we will fit twice the number of

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.580
transistors on the same chip area. So this is

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.276
what technology improvement promises to do. As computer architects,

00:00:19.276 --> 00:00:22.488
we try to translate that into doubling the processor

00:00:22.488 --> 00:00:25.378
speed every 18 to 24 months. So what we

00:00:25.378 --> 00:00:27.338
try to do is, if the technology can give us

00:00:27.338 --> 00:00:30.026
twice as many transistors, we try to translate that into

00:00:30.026 --> 00:00:33.150
doubling the processor speed. We also try to reduce the

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.650
energy per operation to about half it was every 18

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.880
to 24 months. Pretty much. The transistors are now half

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.060
the sizes they used to be, so we try to

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.220
translate that into using half as much energy for the

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.526
operation of the same work. And we try to double

00:00:50.526 --> 00:00:53.810
the memory capacity every 18 to 24 months.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.794
So we can fit twice as many transistors

00:00:55.794 --> 00:00:57.960
on the same chip area. We tried to

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.540
translate that into having twice as much memory, if

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.805
this is a memory chip. Again note that,

00:01:04.805 --> 00:01:08.153
this is what the technology can be expected

00:01:08.153 --> 00:01:10.943
to do and this is what architects are

00:01:10.943 --> 00:01:15.610
expected to do with that technology. That way we

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.920
can plan for what the technology will be able to provide us with, and we

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.320
know what the computer market will expect from our future computers.
