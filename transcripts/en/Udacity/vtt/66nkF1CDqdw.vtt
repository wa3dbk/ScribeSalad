00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.650
The central processing unit on your
computer can do just about anything.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.780
But even the craziest computers' CPUs
only have about eight cores these days

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.158
which isn't enough to render
a complex scene in real time.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.190
Fortunately, your computer and
phone also have say,

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.730
graphics processing unit, or GPU.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.960
GPUs are chips purpose built
to pump out pixels, and

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.630
some can have thousands of cores.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.720
Each of these cores is pretty
limited in what it can do,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.130
though, and groups of these cores
have to work together in a lock step,

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.650
each executing the same
instructions each clock cycle.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.200
So while the GPU is less
flexible than a CPU,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.700
it can spew out pixels
at some absurd rate.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.440
So the code we run on the CPU
determines what we want to draw.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.420
And then we send those
instructions over to the GPU

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.480
which will actually figure
out the pixel colors.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.234
To do this we need a language for
communicating between the CPU and

00:00:50.234 --> 00:00:50.786
the GPU.

00:00:50.786 --> 00:00:52.041
The most common language for

00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:55.760
this purpose is called
the Open Graphics Language or OpenGL.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.842
Smartphones use a slightly scaled
down version of this language called

00:00:58.842 --> 00:01:02.440
OpenGL ES, where the ES stands for
embedded systems.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.390
If in a Microsoft universe
you've ever heard of DirectX,

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.610
that's a language that serves
essentially serves the same purpose.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.570
So to sum up the CPU uses OpenGL
to tell the GPU what to draw.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.330
The GPU builds up the actual
array of colors and

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.140
ships it to the electronics
that run the screen.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.940
Brief aside, I'd be failing
as a nerd if I didn't mention

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.850
that you can actually do far more
with GPUs than just color pixels.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.170
There's a whole field of
general purpose GPU computing.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.750
Algorithms that run on GPUs
need to be very clever

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.170
about how they get those
lock-stepping cores to work together.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.820
But when they do,

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.050
they can be extremely fast, and as is
often even more important these days,

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.140
extremely energy efficient in
terms of power per calculation.
