00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.452
Just like we did last time, let's find where 20 falls on this distribution. It's

00:00:05.452 --> 00:00:10.618
here between 7.8, 1 standard deviation away from the mean, and 22.6, so the z

00:00:10.618 --> 00:00:16.050
score will be somewhere between 1 and 2. Let's find out what it is exactly. So

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.712
we find the distance from the mean, which is now going to be positive and divide

00:00:20.712 --> 00:00:25.618
by the standard deviation. We get that 20 is 1.46 standard deviations away from

00:00:25.618 --> 00:00:31.395
the mean. Now, let's bring up our z table. So like I said before, if we have our

00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:38.463
z square, we'll find the proportion less than that z square. So let's start with

00:00:38.463 --> 00:00:45.597
that. The proportion less than 1.46 is .9279, here at 1.4. And then the top of

00:00:45.597 --> 00:00:54.007
this column is 0.06. So if the proportion less than 20 is 0.9279, then the area

00:00:54.007 --> 00:01:00.964
above it must be 1 minus 0.9279. Because remember, the total area under the

00:01:00.964 --> 00:01:07.273
curve will always be 1. This is .0721, so about 7.21 percent of students have

00:01:07.273 --> 00:01:13.026
gotten more than 20 points per post on average. If you've gotten more than 20

00:01:13.026 --> 00:01:17.814
points per post on average, then you're in the 93rd percentile of students,

00:01:17.814 --> 00:01:22.678
congratulations. Before we move on, I'm going to show you one more way to look

00:01:22.678 --> 00:01:28.687
at this. Since the data is. Symmetrical. Then not means that amount greater than

00:01:28.687 --> 00:01:34.616
1.46 is equal to the amount less than negative 1.46. That means that we don't

00:01:34.616 --> 00:01:40.940
necessarily have to calculate the proportion less than 1.46 and then subtract it

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.486
from 1. We could just find the proportion less than negative 1.46. And we find

00:01:47.486 --> 00:01:54.454
that the proportion less than negative 1.46 is the same thing that we calculated

00:01:54.454 --> 00:01:55.973
before, 0.0721.
