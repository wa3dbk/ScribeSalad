00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.870
So let's see if we can compute
the global and local miss rate.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.100
Suppose we have a level 1
cache that has a 90% hit rate.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.510
What is the local miss rate for
this cache, and

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.280
what is the global miss rate for
this cache?

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.487
And then let's suppose that we also have
a level 2 cache, where we have a hit for

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:25.954
half of the L1 misses, then the local
miss rate of this cache is what,

00:00:25.954 --> 00:00:29.590
and the global miss rate
of this cache is what?
