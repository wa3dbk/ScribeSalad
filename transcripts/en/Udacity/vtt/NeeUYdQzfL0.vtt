00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.810
To really understand objects and classes, it's best to work with lots of

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.490
examples. Let's try another example. And again, it's a great idea if you can do

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:14.170
this together with me. In BlueJ navigate to the pictures project in lesson two

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.200
and you will see here an icon representing a picture class. Let's make an

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.880
object of that class. Again, I will accept the default name, and here is my

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.560
object. What can I do with it? Well you know how to find that out. You right

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.470
click on the object and you get a list of things that tell you the methods.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.650
Let's pick a method and in fact we will pick the method called pick. This

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:47.020
particular method opens up this file chooser here. That lists whatever image

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.160
files happen to be available. You can also navigate to other folders but we'll

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.880
just pick one here. Once you pick a file, a window pops up that shows the

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.450
image. Now let's see what else we can do. Let's call the pixels method. And it

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.575
tells me that this particular image has 104,976 pixels. Okay, that's

00:01:07.575 --> 00:01:14.200
potentially interesting. over here we have method called translate. Let's just

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.174
play with it to see what it does. It wants two numbers. I will just put in 100

00:01:20.174 --> 00:01:27.570
and 200, click on OK. And now look carefully at the planet. as you see, it

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.020
moved. So the method is not called translate because it doesn't translate this

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.840
into Lithuanian. Translation is a mathematical way of saying moving and it

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:49.860
moved it by 100 pixels in this direction and 200 pixels in that direction. So

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.700
this is another great example of an object. The object can do certain things.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.680
The methods tell you what it can do. In the next exercise you get to play with

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.135
objects of the picture class.
