I want you to try a problem very similar to the one we just did. Try solving

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.628
this equation for t. Keep in mind that you may have to factor. First, get the

00:00:08.628 --> 00:00:12.837
t's isolated on 1 side of the equation, and then see if you need a factor, or

00:00:12.837 --> 00:00:16.053
just divide by a coefficient. Good luck.
