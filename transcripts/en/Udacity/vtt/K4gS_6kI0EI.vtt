00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.104
We've been working pretty much solely with polynomial expressions of degree 2

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:08.401
since we started talking about parabolas, like this one right here. However, we

00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:12.370
know from earlier on in the course that expressions can have terms with even

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.790
higher powers. Let's take a second to look at one of those right now. How about

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.375
something like this, x cubed minus x squared plus three x minus three. Now, my

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:25.714
question for you is, can we factor this? Well, we have been talking about

00:00:25.714 --> 00:00:30.116
factoring by grouping a fair amount and we already have four terms here, so

00:00:30.116 --> 00:00:34.362
let's try it out. Maybe it will work. Let's consider the first two terms

00:00:34.362 --> 00:00:38.734
together as a pair. And then the last two terms is a pair. And for each of these

00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:43.024
pairs, please write in the box below it what the greatest common factor that we

00:00:43.024 --> 00:00:46.866
can pull put is. To make my life easier in the future, I'm going to call

00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:49.275
greatest common factor, the initials GCF.
