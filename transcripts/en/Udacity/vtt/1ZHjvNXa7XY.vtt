00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, here's how delta debugging works: first, we split the input

00:00:04.014 --> 00:00:09.938
into n subsets where initially n has a value of 2. Second, if removing

00:00:09.938 --> 00:00:14.000
any of these subsets fails, proceed with this very subset.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This is what we have for our input.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We split the input into initially two subsets,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and if any of these subsets fails, as in here, we proceed with this very subset,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
otherwise, we simply go and increase the granularity,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that is, we double the number of subsets

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and we go again to step one.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Let's try this out on our input over here.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So, at this point we already tried out removing the second half of the input

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and removing the first half of the input.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Neither removal of these subsets would fail,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
so now we have to increase the granularity by coming up with now four subsets.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
This is a 10-character input,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
so each of our subsets will have between two and three characters.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
For a change, let's try removing the first two characters.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Well, no select tag, no failure.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We put them back and remove the three characters.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Still no failure, which gets us an "s ct" tag. No failure.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Now, again we remove the next three characters--ct and the greater tag.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
No select tag, no failure.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Now we remove the last two characters.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
At this point, we have the select tag by itself,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and again we have a failure.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
What should we do in this case?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Should we now go and start again with two subsets,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.646
that is, setting n to 2

00:01:35.646 --> 00:01:39.000
or should we go and set n to the number of subsets we had before

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
minus 1 because there's 1 less?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Experiments show that it's best to stick with a granularity you once have achieved,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
because then you won't have to track back through all the levels of granularity you already have seen.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So, we set n to n-1, which means that in our case we would have three subsets.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
However, we don't want n to be come less than 2,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
because otherwise we'd just have one subset.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So, we set n to the maximum of n -1 and 2 such that n can never fall below 2.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So, at this point, our input is just the select tag.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
It fails, and the number of subsets is 3.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
What is it that delta debugging would do next

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
according to this description of the algorithm?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And what is the next test that delta debugging has to conduct?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Is this the select tag as a whole?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Is this the select tag with the second half removed?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Is this the select tag with the first 3rd removed?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.602
Or is this just ct&gt; that is the last 3rd of the input? Over to you.
