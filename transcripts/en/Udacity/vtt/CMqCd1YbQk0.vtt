00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.955
All right, so in creating your
Hello World Swift iOS app in Xcode,

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:09.316
let's go to File, New, and Project.

00:00:09.316 --> 00:00:13.624
We're going to select Single View
Application, we're going to make sure we

00:00:13.624 --> 00:00:17.521
have the application section
selected under iOS and click Next.

00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:19.270
We're going to type in
the name of our product.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.700
Now this iOS app is your first iOS app,
let's call it PitchPerfect.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.320
You can put in whatever organization
name you would like and

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.180
identifier we're going to
cover that in a little bit.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.280
Make sure the language selected is
Swift, that it's set to Universal,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.860
and you don't need to
use Core Data right now.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.670
We're going to use it
in a later project.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.820
With that, click Next.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.080
Select a location that
you'd like to put it.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.270
For me here I'm just going to
put it straight in the Desktop.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.150
Go ahead and click Create.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.180
Xcode will now create a new iOS
app called PitchPerfect and

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.740
automatically create some needed
files and settings for you.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.830
Here, you can see the iOS app that Xcode
has automatically created for you.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.220
It has an AppDelegate class that will
listen to system events such as being

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.550
called when your app starts,
when you get a memory warning, and

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.500
when your app is sent to the background.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.765
There is also a view controller and
an empty view.

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:09.500
We'll add more to those soon.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.960
For now you can add a single
line into the app delegate to

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.665
a function that gets called
when the app launches called

00:01:14.665 --> 00:01:17.640
applicationDidFinishLaunchingWithOpti-
ons.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.470
This one line of code will print
out Hello World to the console.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.470
So here we are here, and

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.340
we can see that in green Xcode
has highlighted comments for us.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.290
And this function that we're talking
about here is the one where we want to

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.450
add a line.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.568
In the AppDelegate,

00:01:31.568 --> 00:01:35.175
inside the application
didFinishLaunchingWithOptions functions

00:01:35.175 --> 00:01:38.180
we're going to add the line,
print("Hello world").

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.980
Now if you click the Run button
right up here on the top left,

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.950
we're actually going to run
this in the iPhone simulator.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.210
You can see our brand new app
showing an all white background.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.360
In the console you see
the words Hello World.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.382
Five minutes and
you've already created an iOS app.

00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:58.120
Although it won't win any
Apple design awards just yet.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.720
We're going to work to build it and
improve it throughout this course.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.840
First let's take a closer look at Xcode.
