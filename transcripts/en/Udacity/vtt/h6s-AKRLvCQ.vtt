00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.450
Welcome back to the Georgia Tech
Metropolitan Opera where we will be

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.830
singing about Computer Vision for
the rest of the day.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.650
Because I'm, like, going nuts already
recording all these lectures, and

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.230
I have to do something differently.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.900
However, as my children will tell you,

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.990
my singing about anything
is generally a bad idea.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.510
So, let's chat instead.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.650
So last time we were
talking about motion

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.050
this is within this general context.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.200
And we talked about that,
if you're looking locally,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.190
you can't actually tell
the direction of motion of a pixel.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.869
And that was referred to
as this aperture problem.

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.917
Remember this little demo, where we said
that even though the actual thing is

00:00:32.917 --> 00:00:36.333
moving sideways and down a little bit,
you see it as moving upwards.

00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:39.090
Because the only part that
you can see that edge,

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.032
all you can tell is the direction of
motion in the direction of the gradient.

00:00:43.032 --> 00:00:44.486
And we showed that here,

00:00:44.486 --> 00:00:48.980
that that was derived from our
brightness constraint equations.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.033
Where we showed that the u,
v dotted with the gradient

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:57.730
has to be the negative of I t,
that's what that equation says.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.820
But an UV,
any motion who's component perpendicular

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.130
to the edge along the gradient is
the same, would be an acceptable u, v.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.750
So we needed some
additional constraints.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.380
So, last time we talked about int
introducing some global requirement.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.200
We talked about a smoothness
constraint that would allow us to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.210
optimize the solution
over the entire image.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.150
But today,
we're going to look at more local and

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.970
frankly, much more effective or
certainly more commonly used methods.
