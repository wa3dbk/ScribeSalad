Rob just showed us how we can
make things accessible to

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.970
anyone who can't use a mouse or
pointing device.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.130
Whether that's because it's any
type of physical impairment or

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.510
a technology issue or
simply personal preference.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.320
You would have seen that,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.260
while it definitely requires
some care and thought.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.920
It's not a huge amount more work
if you plan it from the beginning.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.100
And once that work is done,

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.960
you're already a long way down
the path to a fully accessible site.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.800
Already, you've made your
site usable by more people

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.290
than if you hadn't addressed
keyboard usability.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.290
And giving your site a more
polished completed feel.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.340
In this lesson,
we're going to build on that work and

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.390
get you thinking about other
accessibility factors.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.020
Like how do we build our websites
to support users like Victor

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.160
who can't see the screen at all?

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.240
We'll start with some background
on assistive technology.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.050
The general term for
things like screen readers.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.890
These are tools that are designed
to help users whose impairments can

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.050
prevent them from accessing
information technology at all.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.450
Next up, we'll take a look at
the general user experience concepts.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.081
We'll build on this to take a deeper
dive into the experience of users of

00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:04.361
assistive technology.

00:01:04.361 --> 00:01:08.586
Then finally we'll move in to how we can
use HTML effectively to create a good

00:01:08.586 --> 00:01:10.172
experience for these uses.

00:01:10.172 --> 00:01:12.827
And we'll see that actually
does overlap quite a lot with

00:01:12.827 --> 00:01:14.050
the way we address focus.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.400
First, let's talk a bit
about assistive technology.
