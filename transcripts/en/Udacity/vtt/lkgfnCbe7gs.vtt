00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.930
Now if you recall from
the beginning of the lesson,

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.360
we talked about three major
ways to estimate value.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.140
One is intrinsic value,
which we just covered.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.490
Another is book value,
which we're going to cover now.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.770
And the other is market capitalization.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.620
So let's take a look at book value.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.570
Here's a classic
definition of book value.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.900
It's total assets of the company.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.190
In other words,
things like property that is owned and

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.800
so on, minus intangible assets and
liabilities.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.240
Intangible assets are things that
are difficult to put a price on.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.820
They're things like the value
of a brand, or a pent, or so on.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.160
Liabilities are a little
bit easier to calculate,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.980
those are just things like
loans that are owed and so on.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.390
So, let's consider what's the book
value for an example company.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.400
Let's say that a company
owns four factories, and

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.960
that each of these factories
is worth about $10 million.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.657
These are assets, and altogether
they are worth about $40 million.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:09.420
Suppose this company also holds
three very important patents and

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.850
each patent is valued
at about $5 million.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.560
The value of these patents
is about $15 million, but

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.030
these are intangible assets
that are hard to price exactly.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.160
Finally, suppose this
company has one large loan.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.170
This would be under the liabilities
column of $10 million.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.874
If we follow this rule that
book value's total assets, so

00:01:35.874 --> 00:01:42.402
total assets are this $40 million
plus the $15 million or $55 million,

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:49.330
minus intangible assets so we just
don't count these intangible assets.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.090
And liabilities.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.900
So all together we've got our total
assets minus intangible assets,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.060
which is $40 million, and
liabilities minus this $10 million, so

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.660
in this case this company's
book value is $30 million.
