00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.396
So basically, exponents give us a convenient notation for showing repeated

00:00:04.408 --> 00:00:08.728
multiplication of a given number or variable or combination of numbers and

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.018
variables. So, knowing that, how would you write 7 times 7 times 7 times 7,

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:17.578
using exponent notation? So, I know that you can evaluate this expression to

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.124
equal just a number without any exponent, but for right now, I want you to make

00:00:22.136 --> 00:00:24.628
sure that you use exponent notation for the question.
