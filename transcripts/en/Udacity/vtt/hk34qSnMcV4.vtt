00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.330
Now that we have seen how pipelines work and how

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.170
they are affected by hazards and dependencies, let's talk about

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.760
how many stages a pipeline should have. In the pipelines

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.800
we have seen so far, the ideal CPI is one. We

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.930
will later, in this course, see pipelines where the ideal

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.280
CPI will be larger than one because they try to

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.490
do more than one instruction per cycle. But regardless, there

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.958
is some ideal CPI that the pipeline should be achieving, and

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:29.086
it boils down to executing some number of instructions

00:00:29.086 --> 00:00:32.960
every single cycle. Now let's consider what happens when

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.650
we add more stages to the pipeline. We get

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.150
more hazards this way. We have already seen that some

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.870
of the dependencies caused a number of stalls to

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.658
flush cycles that depend on how deep the pipeline

00:00:45.658 --> 00:00:48.174
is; for example, if a branch is resolved in

00:00:48.174 --> 00:00:51.030
the second or third stage of the pipeline, we only

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.410
have to flush one or two instructions that

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.497
we have incorrectly fetched. If the pipeline involves

00:00:57.497 --> 00:01:00.577
branches in something like 15 cycle, then we

00:01:00.577 --> 00:01:03.965
will flush 14 instructions when have a branch that

00:01:03.965 --> 00:01:07.220
we incorrectly resolve. So we have more hazards

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.970
when we have more stages. And what that

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.610
does, is it adds more of that CPI

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.595
penalty. So the CPI increases because of that penalty

00:01:16.595 --> 00:01:19.869
that we have when we have a hazard. But

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.687
with more stages, there is less work per stage, which

00:01:23.687 --> 00:01:27.200
means that our cycle time can be decreased. Less

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.180
work per stage means that every cycle there is less

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.550
work to do, which means we can do it in less time, so we can speed up our clock.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.420
We already know the iron law, which says that the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.920
execution time is equal to the number of instructions times

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.997
the CPI times the cycle time. If we have the

00:01:44.997 --> 00:01:48.132
same number of instructions because we're just trying to figure

00:01:48.132 --> 00:01:50.754
out for the same instruction set whether we should have

00:01:50.754 --> 00:01:53.486
a processor that has more or fewer stages. If we

00:01:53.486 --> 00:01:56.660
increase the number of stages, our CPI goes up, which

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.800
increases execution time, but the cycle time drops, which decreases

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.022
execution time. So the number of stages needs to be

00:02:04.022 --> 00:02:07.056
chosen in a way that balances the CPI and the cycle

00:02:07.056 --> 00:02:09.720
time; you don't want to have to few stages

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.828
because then your cycle time will be too long, but

00:02:12.828 --> 00:02:15.714
you don't want to have too many stages because

00:02:15.714 --> 00:02:18.948
then your CPI will be too high. We can plot

00:02:18.948 --> 00:02:21.828
the number of stages here and how execution time

00:02:21.828 --> 00:02:25.170
depends on it, and this is what it looks like.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.514
As you increase the number of stages, the execution

00:02:28.514 --> 00:02:32.390
time drops because you still don't have too many hazards.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.794
But you're improving the clock cycle time. At

00:02:35.794 --> 00:02:39.028
some point, you get fewer benefits from reducing

00:02:39.028 --> 00:02:41.877
the cycle time, and the CPI increase starts

00:02:41.877 --> 00:02:45.132
to hurt. Beyond some point, you are no longer

00:02:45.132 --> 00:02:48.618
shortening the cycle time very much, but you're

00:02:48.618 --> 00:02:51.440
suffering a lot from hazards that are now

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.258
causing dependencies that cause many, many cycles of

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:58.568
stores or flushes. So the bottom of this curve,

00:02:58.568 --> 00:03:01.247
for modern processors, would be at be at something like

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:03.584
30 to 40 stages, which would be a very, very

00:03:03.584 --> 00:03:06.360
deep pipeline. So this would be if you only consider

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.952
performance. So for performance, we want a pipeline that is

00:03:09.952 --> 00:03:12.330
30 to 40 stages deep, but we need to consider

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.992
power. If we have more stages, we are shortening the

00:03:15.992 --> 00:03:19.440
cycle time, so we have more cycles per second. And

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.160
in each of those cycles, we now have more pipeline latches

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.016
that spend energy latching temporary results. So

00:03:28.016 --> 00:03:32.270
power quickly increases with the number of stages.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.970
If we plot power, it does something

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.610
like this. So because of performance and power

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.880
considerations, we want to choose something that

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.722
is not in this performance optimal point. We

00:03:44.722 --> 00:03:49.434
want something that is also power efficient, so we end up with 10 to 15

00:03:49.434 --> 00:03:53.520
stages in modern processors. So again, this is not because

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.540
performance is best when you have this many stages. It's because

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.790
it's the number of stages that balances pretty good performance

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.060
with relatively low power consumption. Or at least manageable power consumption.
