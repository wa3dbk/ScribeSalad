00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.850
Since we want to know how much money 
Grant will have left after one year, we

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.870
need to plug in 12 for n. 
Since n is the number of months that have past.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.470
So m of s of 12 equals 3 million minus 
100,000 times 12.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.770
Simplifying gives us 1 million 800,000. 
So grant will have $1.8 million left

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.249
after one year in business.
