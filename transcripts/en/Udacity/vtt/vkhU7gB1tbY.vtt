00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.490
The Institute of Medicine calls for EMRs
to store comprehensive patient data and

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.140
to use it to provide cognitive
support for providers and patients.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.480
Aspects of this are integration of
patient-specific data where possible,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.850
in order to personalize care.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.780
And the integration of evidence-based
guidelines to improve outcomes,

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.120
reduce costs, and
enhance the safety of care, along with

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.750
the rapid integration of new knowledge
and technology into clinical practice.
