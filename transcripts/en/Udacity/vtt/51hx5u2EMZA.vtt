00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.166
Welcome back. Let's do a quick summary of what you learned in Lesson 7. So we

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:08.825
started with a population, in this case Klout scores. The number in this

00:00:08.825 --> 00:00:16.346
population was 1,048. The mean Klout score was 37.72. And the population

00:00:16.346 --> 00:00:21.900
standard deviation was about 16.04. Then, we know from the central limit

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.940
theorem, that if we took all possible samples, all of the same size, and then

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.060
found the mean of each sample and then graph the distribution of those sample

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.180
means, we would get a normal curve with a mean equal to the population mean and

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.540
a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.490
square root of the sample size. Remember that this is called the sampling

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:53.585
distribution. In Lesson 7, we specifically looked at the sampling distribution

00:00:53.585 --> 00:00:59.259
created from all samples of size 35. So, if we take all samples of size 35 from

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:03.990
this population, we find the mean of each sample, and then we plot the

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.370
distribution of sample means. The mean of the means will be the same as the

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.921
population mean, and the standard deviation of this distribution is the

00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:21.018
population standard deviation, divided by the square root of 35, which came out

00:01:21.018 --> 00:01:25.440
to about 2.71. Remember also, that the standard deviation of the sampling

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.654
distribution is called the standard error. Now, if we plot this sampling

00:01:29.654 --> 00:01:37.478
distribution, it'll look something like this. One standard deviation away from

00:01:37.478 --> 00:01:45.016
the mean would be 37.72 plus 2.71 and minus 2.71. So, we know what the

00:01:45.016 --> 00:01:51.434
distribution should look like of all sampled means of size 35. So then we said,

00:01:51.434 --> 00:01:56.802
what if we get this sample of size 35 and the mean is 40, and everyone in this

00:01:56.802 --> 00:02:01.692
sample uses the app the Bieber Tweeter? The first part of this lesson is all

00:02:01.692 --> 00:02:06.112
about estimating what the mean Klout score would be if everyone started to use

00:02:06.112 --> 00:02:07.272
the Bieber Tweeter.
