00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.902
I know when 4ths of the cake is frosted with vanilla icing and 2 5ths of it is

00:00:03.914 --> 00:00:08.138
frosted in strawberry icing, so I have 1 4th and 2 5ths. I need to add these two

00:00:08.151 --> 00:00:12.130
fractions together to figure out how much of the cake is frosted in total. My

00:00:12.142 --> 00:00:16.373
fractions do not have common denominators. I have 4ths and I have 5ths, so I

00:00:16.386 --> 00:00:20.308
need to get the same size pieces. To find the common denominator, I'm going to

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.824
do the least common multiple method. So, I'm going to list the multiples of four

00:00:24.928 --> 00:00:29.001
and the multiples of five. The smallest number that both four and five go into

00:00:29.013 --> 00:00:33.697
is 20. I could also find out by using my factor tree method. When I think about

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:37.983
the factors that four and five have on common, the only factor that they share

00:00:37.995 --> 00:00:41.766
is one. I know the other factor of four must be four, since 4 times 1 is four.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.735
The other factor of five must be five. Multiplying these together, I still get

00:00:46.747 --> 00:00:52.195
20. So I know I need to change 4ths into 20ths, and 5ths into 20ths. To change

00:00:52.207 --> 00:00:57.575
4ths into 20ths, I need to multiply by 5 over 5. I know this because 20 is the

00:00:57.587 --> 00:01:02.745
5th multiple of four. I also know this because I have to multiply 4 times 5 to

00:01:02.757 --> 00:01:08.152
end up with 20. So 5 times 1 is 5 and 5 times 4 is 20. To change 2 5ths into

00:01:08.164 --> 00:01:13.661
20ths, I need to multiply by 4 over 4. Remember, I'm still multiplying by one. 2

00:01:13.767 --> 00:01:18.897
times 4 is 8 and 5 times 4 is 20. Now, this is great, I can actually add the

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.556
20ths together. I have 5 20ths and 8 20ths. I keep my denominator the same and 8

00:01:24.568 --> 00:01:29.970
plus 5 is 13. So I get 13 20ths. If you chose 13 20ths, nice work.
