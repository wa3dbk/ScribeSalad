00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.310
There was so
much complicated stuff in this level.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.140
You learned all about the structure
of a lib GDX game, and

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.420
now you can draw whatever you want.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.500
However, you may have noticed
that what we've drawn so

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.070
far, doesn't really adapt to
screens of different sizes.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.610
So in the next level,
we'll learn a few more drawing commands,

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.690
but, more importantly we'll
make our game world scale

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.200
to what ever size device
our player is using.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.700
See you there.
