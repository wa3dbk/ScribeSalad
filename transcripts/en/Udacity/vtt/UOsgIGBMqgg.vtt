00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.689
Earlier in lesson three,
we referred to PKI indirect.

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:10.139
This is another highly simplified
representation of direct designed

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.250
specifically to show the dual function
these keys play in security and trust.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.390
Along the top, you see that
the message attachment, which contains

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.100
protected information, is encrypted
using the receiver's public key.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.300
This is a critical point.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.830
Anyone can discover their intended
recipient's public key and

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.910
can use it to secure information they
wish to send to the owner of that key.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.480
Since only the owner should
have the matching private key,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.840
only they can decrypt and
view the message.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.500
That's the essence of PKI for security.
