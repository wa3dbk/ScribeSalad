The fact that the call to double three returns nine instead of six is clearly

00:00:06.614 --> 00:00:13.000
a failure because it is an observable incorrect behavior of the program.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.110
So let me remind you that the failure is conceptually related to the

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.076
behavior of the program, to the way the program acts and not its code.
