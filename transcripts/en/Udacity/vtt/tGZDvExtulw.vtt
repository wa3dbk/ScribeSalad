00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.980
Any truth assignment that satisfies
the clauses we've talked about so

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.850
far specifies how the tableau
should be filled out and

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.250
moreover, the tableau will always
start on the initial configuration and

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.420
end up in an accepting one.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.790
What is not guaranteed yet

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.300
is that the transitions between
the configurations are valid.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.670
To see how we can add constraints
that will give us this guarantee,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.579
we'll use this example.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.460
Suppose that the transition function
tells us that if the machine is in state

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.200
q3, and it reads a 1 then it
can do one of two things.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.870
It can move to state q0, leaving the 1
alone and move the head to the right,

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.670
or it can move to state q4,
write a 0 and move the head to the left.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.310
To translate this rule into clauses for

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.460
our formula,
it's useful to make a few definitions.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.260
First, we need to enumerate
the tape alphabet so

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.810
that we can refer to
the symbols by number.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:00.900
Let's say that the blank is symbol 0,
0 is symbol 1 and 1 is symbol 2.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:07.264
Next, we define the tuple k,
l, k prime, l prime,

00:01:07.264 --> 00:01:13.631
delta to be valid if the triple
of the state qk prime,

00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:19.453
sl prime and
delta is in the set delta of qk, sl.

00:01:19.453 --> 00:01:23.554
That is to say, this has to be
one of the valid transitions,

00:01:23.554 --> 00:01:27.580
given that we are in state qk and
that we read the symbol sl.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.010
For example, the tuple 3,
2, 0, 2, R is valid.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.300
The first two numbers here indicate
which transition rule applies.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.140
And note here that I'm using
the enumeration of the alphabet

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.480
to translate the symbols here.

00:01:43.835 --> 00:01:48.620
3 means state three and
2 means the symbol one.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.760
The last three numbers indicate
the transition being made.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.210
In this case it is in
the set defined by delta.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.410
We're moving to state q0,
we're writing symbol 2, which is a 1.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.990
And we're moving to the right.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.620
On the hand, this transition is endowed,
the machine can't switch to state four,

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.200
write a one, and
move the head to the right.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.380
That's not one of the valid transitions,

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.700
given that the machine is in state
three, and that it just read a blank.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.040
Now there are multiple ways to create
the causes needed to ensure that

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.680
only valid transitions are followed.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.490
Many proofs of Cook's theorem start
by writing out Boolean expressions,

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.170
that directly express the requirement
that one of the valid

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.310
transitions be followed.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.870
The difficulty with this approach,

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.590
is that the intuitive expression
isn't in conjunctive normal form.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.440
And some Boolean algebra
is needed to convert it.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.020
That is to say, we don't immediately
get an intuitive set of short clauses

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.910
to add to our formula.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.670
On the other hand, if we rule out
invalid transitions instead, then we

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.240
do get a set of short intuitive clauses
that we can just add to the formula.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.030
To illustrate, in order to make sure
that this invalid transition is never

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.900
followed, for every step i and position
j, we add a clause that looks like this.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.720
It starts with three literals that
ensure the transition rules for

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.020
being in state q3 and reading
a blank symbol actually do apply.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.240
If the head isn't in the position we're
talking about, the state isn't q3, or

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.770
the symbol being read
isn't the blank symbol,

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.470
then the clause is
immediately satisfied.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.700
The clause can also be satisfied
if the machine behaves

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.460
in any way that's different
from what this particular

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.090
invalid transition
would cause to happen.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.840
The head could move differently,
the state could change differently, or

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.080
a different symbol could be written.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.500
Another way to parse this clause is as
saying if the Q3 blank symbol transition

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.080
rule applies, then this invalid
transition can't have been followed.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.520
Logically remember that A implies not
B is equivalent to not A or not B.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:02.950
That's the logic we're using here.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.760
A being,
does the transition rule apply, and

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.230
B being,
was the invalid transition followed.
