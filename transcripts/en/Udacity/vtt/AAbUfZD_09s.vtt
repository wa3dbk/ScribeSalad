00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.580
So here's an example
of 18 different moves,

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.930
and it's showing you some of the motion
history, motion energy images of it.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.580
So we now have this problem of how
do we recognize motion energy,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.200
motion history images.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.540
Well, these are kind of
gray-scale blobby-like images.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.220
And the good news is even in 1999, there
have been about 150 years, or maybe

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.250
20 years, pick your favorite number, of
computer vision describing gray blobs.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.890
And trying to say,

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.400
okay, I recognize this gray blob as
being different than that gray blob.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.390
And that's basically all we had to do.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.250
So, basically, 1999,
we did some sort of,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.765
what I think of as old style computer
vision we're going to compute some,

00:00:44.765 --> 00:00:47.205
summarization statistic of that blob.

00:00:47.205 --> 00:00:50.615
We're going to compute some features of
that blob that have something to do with

00:00:50.615 --> 00:00:52.795
the distribution of the,
where the pixels are and

00:00:52.795 --> 00:00:57.247
their intensities in the MHI, and we're
going to build the generative model.

00:00:57.247 --> 00:00:59.057
Okay.
There are a couple reasons we were doing

00:00:59.057 --> 00:01:00.097
generative models.

00:01:00.097 --> 00:01:04.777
One is that discriminative models hadn't
become as popular as they had been and

00:01:04.777 --> 00:01:08.467
so Jim Davis' advisor was not
smart enough to tell him to

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:10.410
go make sure you're using
the discriminative model.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.910
I will tell you that people have
subsequently used it, and of course,

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.730
it makes your recognition better.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.710
Generative models also have the nice
properties as we mentioned before,

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.790
that when I come in, if I come up
with a new, aerobics move, right, so

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.990
I want to add one, I just have to
build a model of that category.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.180
I don't have to,
to retrain my entire system.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.060
Okay, whether you use generative or
discriminative,

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.990
the idea is that we're going to
compute these statistics and

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.890
then do the recognition.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.840
So, how are we going to
describe this sentence?

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.870
And this allows me to spend a little bit
of time telling you about some very old

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.900
computer vision work that becomes,
that's still important, and fundamental.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.700
And that's the notion of
the moments of a shape.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.900
So, so some of you from physics, you
know about second order moments, right?

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.810
Axis of inertia.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.010
The moment is the distribution of
matter about a point or an axis or

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.900
something like that.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.835
So in computer vision, the moments
are defined in a very simple way, right?

00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:11.985
So the I J moment, okay,
is just the sum over

00:02:11.985 --> 00:02:17.605
the X Y of the whole image of X raised
to the I power, Y raised to the I power.

00:02:17.605 --> 00:02:23.970
But you're only counting points
where the image is non-zero.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:24.710
Okay?

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.330
So, if I is a binary image,
then this is a one or zero, so

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.030
you're only counting it at
points that are turned on.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.960
If it's a grayscale image, then you're
weighting the point by essentially how

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.240
heavy it is, which is a little bit
like when you do moments of inertia.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.580
If you've got little points
that are heavier than others,

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.490
they add more to the inertia
without the axis.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.940
So these are the moments, and so you can
talk about the second order moments,

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.100
or the first order moments, or
even the zeroth order moments, right?

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.750
What would this be for
the zeroth order moment?

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.500
Well, if I is zero and
J is zero then these are one,

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.850
this would just be counting up
the number of non-zero pixels.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.283
Which means that M
zero zero is the area.

00:03:07.283 --> 00:03:09.350
[NOISE] Right?

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.150
because the area of the picture that's
non-zero, that's just the sums,

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.400
the counting of the non-zero pixels.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.900
All right?

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.250
The problem with regular moments,
of course,

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.950
is that they're sensitive to what
the X and Y position actually is.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:27.910
Right?
So,

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.540
you kind of want the moments of a shape
to be independent of where the shape is.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.170
So there's something called the central
moments that just take X, but

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.000
they subtract off the mean of X, and
Y, and subtract off the mean of Y.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.210
And it is, otherwise just the same.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:50.400
So, that's this Mu P Q, and it's X minus
X bar to the P, Y minus Y bar to the Q.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.130
All right?

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.610
And, you know, what is X bar?

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.700
Well, one way of thinking,
it's the average X, so the average X

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.370
would just be the sum of all the Xs
divided by however many Xs there are.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.070
Well, that's what this is, right?

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.898
X bar is M one zero, the first moment
in X divided by the overall area,

00:04:09.898 --> 00:04:13.285
remember the M zero zero,
same thing in Y.

00:04:13.285 --> 00:04:16.860
So that's regular moments,
but the problem with moments,

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.925
of course, is that they're very
sensitive to a variety of changes,

00:04:20.925 --> 00:04:25.478
so if I scale the image up, right,
obviously, the moment's going to change,

00:04:25.478 --> 00:04:29.004
the area will get bigger,
the distances get, get larger.

00:04:29.004 --> 00:04:31.490
If I rotate it things might change.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.340
All sorts of problems.
