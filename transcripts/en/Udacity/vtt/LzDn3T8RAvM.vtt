00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.100
Back to our networking diagram.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.470
So the HTTP request will include
the URL we just talked about along with

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.770
other bits of information, such as what
action we want to perform on the data,

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.660
information about the device,
making a request, and more.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.090
The whole request gets
packaged up together.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.580
It's like sticking
a message in an envelope.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.110
The HTTP request is like an envelope
with a destination and a return address.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.450
After the request is packaged, Android
offers functionality to help a sender

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.540
message over the network
to the correct web server.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.495
We haven't officially defined
the word network yet, but

00:00:35.495 --> 00:00:37.916
you can think of it as
a digital postal service.

00:00:37.916 --> 00:00:39.397
A network is really just two or

00:00:39.397 --> 00:00:42.727
more computers connected in some
way that let's them communicate.

00:00:42.727 --> 00:00:47.624
And when I say computer, I mean
any computing device like a phone,

00:00:47.624 --> 00:00:49.119
laptop or a server.

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:53.214
The internet is a large scale network
consisting of many computers around

00:00:53.214 --> 00:00:54.210
the world.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.650
And we can use the HTTP
protocol to route our request

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.640
from one computer to the other.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.350
To communicate to a computer on
a different location, we must establish

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.230
communication channel, also known as a
network connection, across the internet.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.760
Then we can exchange messages
with the other computer.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.060
In this diagram, we've represented
USGS as a single computer, but

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.520
keep in mind that they
have a lot of data.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.088
So they probably have a whole group
of computers who are responding to

00:01:22.088 --> 00:01:22.709
requests.

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:27.355
A single computer wouldn't be able to
handle requests from all over the world

00:01:27.355 --> 00:01:29.080
for the US geological data.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.720
At this point,
I want to introduce you to some more

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.450
formal terminology
that you'll often hear.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.970
You can refer to the USGS
computers that are providing data

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.550
as the USGS Web Server.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.911
A web server is simply another
computer or a group of computers on

00:01:46.911 --> 00:01:51.047
a network running a program
that responds to HTTP requests.

00:01:51.047 --> 00:01:55.322
On the other hand, your phone can
be referred to as the client.

00:01:55.322 --> 00:01:58.472
The client requests the information
from the server and

00:01:58.472 --> 00:02:01.100
then displays the results to the user.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.640
Often, many different clients would
be connected to the same server, but

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.050
each client may display
the data in different ways.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.679
For example, a mobile client may show
information that is more convenient to

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:15.030
viewing in a small mobile screen.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.330
A web client on a desktop, for instance,
might show more detailed information

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.220
taking full advantage of
the larger screen size.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.050
Each client sends out
a request to the server.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.751
When the web server receives the
request, it may compose an HTML web page

00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:35.378
to return to the sender for display,
or it might return structured data

00:02:35.378 --> 00:02:39.954
that we can use in an app we're building
in a format such as JSON or XML.

00:02:39.954 --> 00:02:42.666
Once the clients receive
the response from the server,

00:02:42.666 --> 00:02:45.730
they control how the data
gets displayed to the users.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.464
For example, a web browser can
render a web page to the screen or

00:02:49.464 --> 00:02:53.479
a mobile app can parse out the bits
of data that it needs to show useful

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:55.612
information on the device screen.

00:02:55.612 --> 00:03:00.300
In this lesson, we'll zoom in on major
steps for the data exchange process.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.420
First, we'll talk about how
to form a proper HTTP request

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.400
based on the information we want and
from where we want to get it.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.870
Second, we'll send the request to
the server, which will process it and

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.110
figure out a proper
response to send back.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.698
Third, we'll talk about how the client
can process or parse this response and

00:03:19.698 --> 00:03:22.359
convert it into a format
that it understands.

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:27.650
Then lastly, we can update the UI in our
app to show the results to the user.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.470
Before we get into the details
of networking, though,

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.480
there's one constraint on the Android
device that we need to deal with first.
