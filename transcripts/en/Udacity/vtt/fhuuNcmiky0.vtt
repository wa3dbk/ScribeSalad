00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.720
So, a famous example of classical conditioning is the Little Albert study. John

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.460
B. Watson, in 1920, wanted to see if we could classically condition a fear or a

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.395
phobia. So, he used a nine month old baby they called Little Albert. He let

00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:17.430
Little Albert play with the white rat. And Albert loved this rat. He wasn't

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.966
scared of him at all. But then Watson would hit a steel pipe with a hammer to

00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.560
create loud bang.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.861
[NOISE]

00:00:22.861 --> 00:00:25.441
And that would really scare Albert, it would make him cry and feel really

00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:29.125
fearful. And eventually, after several pairings of this loud bang

00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:29.455
[NOISE]

00:00:29.455 --> 00:00:34.570
while Albert played with the white rat, Albert began to fear the rat. So, the

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.622
rat became the conditioned stimulus and the crying and the fear. Albert's

00:00:38.622 --> 00:00:42.500
experienced was a condition response. So, it's sad that Little Albert no longer

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.961
like the white rat that he used to like. But here's the thing it gets worse,

00:00:46.961 --> 00:00:49.950
Albert started to fear things that were similar to the rat, this is called

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.262
generalization. Albert generalized his fear to other furry things such as

00:00:55.262 --> 00:01:00.942
bunnies, dogs, even Watson himself when he wore a rabbit mask. But the mask was

00:01:00.942 --> 00:01:04.840
pretty creepy so I don't blame him. Now, it actually gets worse. Watson never

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.049
extinguished his fear so Albert had it throughout his whole life. There's

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.198
contradictory reports on what actually happened to Albert after the study from

00:01:12.198 --> 00:01:14.924
he was a well adjusted adult to he died at a young age or he lived his life

00:01:14.924 --> 00:01:19.993
with an extreme phobia of all furry things. But we just don't know. So, we

00:01:19.993 --> 00:01:22.907
really don't want this to happen to Greg and have him be scared of the bell so

00:01:22.907 --> 00:01:25.700
life so we need to extinguish his fear.
