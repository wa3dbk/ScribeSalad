00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.660
I'm going to use Flexbox to create
this layout, and then I'm going to

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.960
give you a design mock that I want
you to provide the styles for.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.840
I've got my markup for the HTML here.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.329
The first thing I need to do is set
up Flexbox on my container element.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.178
I need to add display flex.

00:00:18.178 --> 00:00:20.820
And flex-wrap, wrap.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.450
Looking at my layout I can see
that some things are out of order.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:30.090
For example this dark blue box,
is not in the same place down here.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.130
And I want to make sure they are.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.750
Are.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.110
So in addition to setting
the width of each element,

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.710
I need to remember to set the order.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.420
To make things a bit easier for

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.620
myself, I've added the styles in
the order that the elements appear.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.550
The header element is the first element,
and it spans the whole width.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.290
So I'll set the width to 100 and
order to one.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.490
Red and orange are next.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.010
Each looks to be about 50%
of the view point width.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.150
So I'll set width equals 50% and
order to two and three respectively.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.360
In this design, the footer is next at
100% width, and order equals four.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.750
The next line is light blue,
dark blue, and green.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.870
Light blue and green,
each looks like they are about 20% wide.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.090
Dark blue looks like
it's about 60% wide.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.080
So, I'll set order to five, six, and

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.580
seven on each of those
elements respectively.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.600
Let's compare this to our sample.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.440
Looks about right to me.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.120
Let's see how you do.
