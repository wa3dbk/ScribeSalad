Okay, now what if we rolled five dice and then plotted the average of the rolls?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.065
And then repeated this at least 100 times. So here, let's change it to five

00:00:11.065 --> 00:00:18.375
dice, and you can pick 100, or 1000, or 10,000 Anything greater than 100. Do you

00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:24.381
think this distribution of new sample means with n equals 5 be skinnier or wider

00:00:24.381 --> 00:00:29.770
than this distribution when n equals 2? You can take a guess or you can use the

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.543
applet to see what happens.
