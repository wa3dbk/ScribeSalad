00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.969
You've just seen how to add changes to the staging area, so

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:05.920
now let's go over how to create a commit with those changes.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.940
I've just added my changes to cake-recipe.txt and frosting0recipe.txt and

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.970
I'm ready to create a commit for them.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.860
To do that, I'll run the command git commit.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.560
And Git opens the editor I've configured so that I can write a commit message.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.650
In my case, the editor is Sublime.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.780
I'll enter the message Add a cake and frosting recipe since that

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.610
describes the changes that will be present in this commit.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.320
It's standard Git practice to write your commit message as if it were a command,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.670
which is why I said Add a recipe, rather than Added or Adds a recipe.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.610
Next, I save the file and quit the editor.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.130
And I can use git log to see that the commit has been created.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.460
Here it is.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.930
Now if I run git status again, the initial commit note has gone away and

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.730
the only remaining untracked file is chili-recipe.txt.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.510
I'd also like to commit this file in a separate commit and

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.950
I can do that using the same process.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.110
Now go ahead and commit the changes in your reflections directory that you

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.740
previously added to the staging area.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.110
You can do this using the command git commit.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.500
Then continue committing until you have committed all your changes using git

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.850
add, git status and git commit.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.490
What is the output of git status after all your changes are committed?

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.540
Paste the output here.
