00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.029
Most data needs a closer look and at least a few

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:05.590
fixes. For example, this is a picture of my house. Well,

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.390
actually it's not my house it's actually the house next door.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.200
But in it's street map view, Google Maps believes this is

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.020
actually my house. Here's another quick example. So this is the

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.310
Wikipedia page for the Volkswagen Beetle. And probably the most common

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.990
name for the beatle is bug. And you can see here

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.220
that the nickname is bg. It's just a type but a

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.630
great example of the kinds of errors you can get anytime

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.010
humans are involved in producing data. Which is always. Let's take

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.300
a look at one more example before we move on. This

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.660
is some financial data that I worked with several years ago and

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.690
a couple of interesting things to note here. One is that

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.830
this line here is missing values for most of the fields, there

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.000
are lots of reasons why that might be the case, this

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.650
is the type of thing that we've got to look for anytime

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.670
we're dealing with data. Another example here Has to do

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.400
with what assumptions we might have about the dates. If you

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.590
look at these we might assume that this actually means

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.599
August 4th, 2008, certainly if you're an American, that's the type

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.060
of assumption that you'd make. But then we get to

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.340
dates like this and there's another example here, where it becomes

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.000
pretty clear that this is probably a date format In which

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
the day comes first. So we've got to be careful about

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.140
any assumptions we bring with us into a data

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.070
wrangling task. So let's go ahead and spell this

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.440
out. We need to asses our data in order

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.840
to test assumptions about the values that are there. The

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.840
data types for those values and the shape of

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.340
our data. We also need to identity errors or outliers

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.180
in our data. We're going to look at several ways

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.060
of testing our data to see whether there are errors

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.030
present or whether we have data that's really outside the range

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.640
of expected values. And finally, we need to access whether there are

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.890
any missing values within our data. In addition to all of

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.020
this, we also need to make sure that our data will support

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.680
the type of queries that we need to make. The idea

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.100
here is to eliminate surprises leading to bad analysis later. We'll go

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.360
into all of this in lesson three, but before can clean any

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.400
data, we need to make sure we know how to gather data.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.830
And that's what we're going to be looking at in

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.060
the rest of this lesson, and the lesson that follows.
