00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.950
The first one simplifies to negative 4 times the square root of 2, and the

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.390
second one simplifies to 27 times the cube root of 3. Nice work if you got both

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.289
of these correct. Simplifying roots isn't always the easiest, so let's see how

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:18.255
we can do it. We can split up the root of 8 into the root of 4 times 2. We can

00:00:18.255 --> 00:00:21.382
also split up the root of 50 into the root of 25 times 2, and the root of 200

00:00:21.382 --> 00:00:26.426
into the root of 100 times 2. This gives us perfect squares, which allows us to

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:30.445
take square roots in our next line. Now that we're here, we can take the square

00:00:30.445 --> 00:00:33.635
root of 4, which equals 2, the square root of 25, which equals 5, and the

00:00:33.635 --> 00:00:39.176
square root of 100 which equals 10. We multiply the numbers in front of our

00:00:39.176 --> 00:00:44.902
radicals, to get 6 root 2, minus 30 root 2, plus 20 root 2. This leaves us with

00:00:44.902 --> 00:00:49.410
6 minus 30 plus 20 times the square root of 2. When we subtract and add these

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.182
numbers together, we'll get negative 4 times the square root of 2, our final

00:00:52.182 --> 00:00:56.434
answer. For our second problem we want to break up these two numbers into

00:00:56.434 --> 00:01:01.224
perfect cubes. I know 81 is the same thing as 9 times 9 which is the same thing

00:01:01.224 --> 00:01:08.842
as 3 times 3, times 3, times 3. I rewrite 81 using 3 cubed times 3. We do this

00:01:08.842 --> 00:01:11.684
since we know if we have a factor that appears three times we can take it

00:01:11.684 --> 00:01:16.600
outside of the cubed root. So I used my product rule to split up this radical

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.258
into two pieces, and then we take the cube root of 3 cubed, which just equals

00:01:20.258 --> 00:01:25.473
3. For our second radical, we split it up into the cube root of 8, times the

00:01:25.473 --> 00:01:31.722
cube root of 3. Notice that I've rewritten 8 as 2 to the 3rd power. We do this

00:01:31.722 --> 00:01:36.356
so that we can take the cube root of 2 cubed, which gives us 2. We multiply 7

00:01:36.356 --> 00:01:41.170
times 3, to get 21, and we multiply 3 times 2 to get 6. Now we have two

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.703
radicals that have a matching index and a matching radicand. So this means we

00:01:45.703 --> 00:01:50.483
can add them together. We'll have 27 times the cube root of three.
