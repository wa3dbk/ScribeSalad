00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.510
As I said, these reactive systems are hard to build. You probably have heard

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.880
of examples of complex systems getting into deadlock states or

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.960
otherwise freezing up because of the common [UNKNOWN] blowup in

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.710
complexity that occurs from all of the internal things that are going on.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.230
So, you have to spend some time in getting these things right. And

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.410
some kind of behavioral modeling technique, like statecharts, okay,

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.840
can be very helpful to getting that kind of assurance. Besides statecharts,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.800
UML provides other diagrams that can be used for understanding behavior.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.750
Okay, we've already seen these in our review of UML, activity diagrams,

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.120
sequence diagrams, collaborations, use cases, communication, timing and

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.140
interaction overview diagrams. Okay? Outside of UML, there's a couple of

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.770
other behavioral modeling approaches which I'll just mention to you, we won't go

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.922
into it. One of those is temporal logic. If you've heard of model checking and

00:01:04.922 --> 00:01:10.240
model checking tools these are ways of modelling system and

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.280
asking can I ever get into this certain state that I don't want to get into,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.790
okay. Am I ensured that I can't get into it, okay and

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.170
model checking tools can help you get answers to that problem.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.550
Another notation for expressing concurrency is process algebras.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.570
These allow you to specify what things can go on concurrently and

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.630
the reads and write behavior between the concurrently executing activities.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.875
We will be looking further into statecharts, we will do, be doing an exercise

00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:48.670
that ask you to learn the features. This is such an essential part of getting

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.500
models right that want to make sure that you have kind of acquired that skill.
