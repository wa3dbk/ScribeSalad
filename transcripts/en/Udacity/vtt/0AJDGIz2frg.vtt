Now, did you pick up on how I kind of tricked you on that one? There aren't

00:00:03.559 --> 00:00:09.330
sleep spindles or k-complexes in stage three sleep. So both of these are no.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.271
Sleep spindles and k-complexes are only seen in stage two sleep. Here is a

00:00:14.271 --> 00:00:18.977
sleep spindle because it's a short burst of brain activity. And here we see a

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:23.842
k-complex because it's a single high voltage burst of energy. And this isn't a

00:00:23.842 --> 00:00:26.285
sleep spindle or a k-complex.
