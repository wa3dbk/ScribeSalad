00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In our last question, we used a list of tuples to represent a graph

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
where each tuple represented and edge between nodes.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We have an edge between node 1 and 2, an edge between node 2 and 4,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and edge between node 5 and 9, etc.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I want you to think about and write a couple sentences

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
about what are the advantages and disadvantages of representing a graph

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
as a list of tuples.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
There aren't any right or wrong answers to this question.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Just fill in a couple sentences explaining your response.
