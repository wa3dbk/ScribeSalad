00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:04.575
Here we hear from BlueJ. And it would really good idea if you fire up your own

00:00:04.575 --> 00:00:11.100
BlueJ and move to lesson two days as your project. When you open it, you will

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:18.000
see the screen with a Day block here. And this is what gives us objects. Let me

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.680
show you how to make an object. You right-click on it, and you select the line

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.975
that says New Day. You can now give it a name. For right now, we'll accept the

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:34.299
default. Down here, you'll find your first object. This is how BlueJ represents

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:39.610
objects. As little blobs, it's a little-known fact that all objects are red.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.010
And to manipulate an object, you again, right-click on it. You can ask it to

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.185
get the current year. Here's the answer. This particular day is somewhere in

00:00:50.185 --> 00:00:58.540
2013. See when, the month is March, 3, the day of the month, is the 20th.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.870
That's the day that I recorded this lesson. We can make another day object. And

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:12.360
now, let's pick, the first line here. Now, we ask which year month and day we

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.690
might actually want. Let's fill in something. Then, we'll pick a year of 1964.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:24.120
The month of 11 or November, and the day of 28, as I'm sure everyone remembers,

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:32.870
on November 28th, 1964, the first spaceship was, to Mars, was launched. Now

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.810
here, we have another day object. It looks just like the first one. It has a

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.950
different name. But if we wanted to find out anything about it, so we can in

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.120
the same way ask it what's your year, and here it tells us. Now, let's do

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.890
something more interesting. Let's take our first object here and let's ask it

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.340
what day comes a hundred days later. Now, it doesn't look like it, but this

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.000
object now has changed. It has moved itself a hundred days later. Remember, it

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.980
was originally March 20th. Now, when we ask it what's your month, you'll see

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.836
it's June. That makes sense, from March, 100 days is June, or maybe it would be

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:09.604
July. Somehow, this thing knows how to do this computation. How about the day?

00:02:09.604 --> 00:02:14.060
It's June 28th. I wouldn't have known how to do that. Except by tediously

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:25.940
getting out a calendar and counting the days, but our day object knows. How

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.240
does it know? I don't know, and I don't care. It doesn't matter. I can use it,

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.995
as long as I understand what it does for me. So, that's a great example of an

00:02:32.995 --> 00:02:38.700
object. Something that knows how to do a very specific thing, namely to deal

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.530
with calendars, just like the water heater knows how to do very specific thing,

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.475
namely to heat water.
