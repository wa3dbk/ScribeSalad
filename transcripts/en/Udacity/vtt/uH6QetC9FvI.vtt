This is great. We've filled in half of our table already, and we're almost

00:00:03.329 --> 00:00:07.550
ready to set up some equations. But there is something else that we can figure

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.478
out. Let's see if we can figure out Rohan's rate. What expression do you think

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:14.838
we could write here? You'll need to think about the relationship between

00:00:14.838 --> 00:00:20.047
Janet's rate and Rohan's rate to answer this question. Good luck.
