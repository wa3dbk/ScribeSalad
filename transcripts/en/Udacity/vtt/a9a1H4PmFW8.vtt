00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Norvig] Here is the algorithm I was able to come up with.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Knuth calls it Algorithm P.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Other people have discovered it before him, so it's been discovered over and over again.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The idea is you just go through the deck and make 1 swap for each of the index i.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And what we swap it with gives an equal chance

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
for any of the items that haven't been seen yet to occur in position i.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So again, we've got our deck and we're going through 1 at a time

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
looking at each position.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And when we get to a general position i, we're going to swap i

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
with the range from i through to the end.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So we're going to pick out for this element i any one of these elements

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and then swap them.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Say we pick this one. Then we would swap those 2.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And then we would move on to the next position of i.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So the very first element we pick any element in the array,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
swap it into the first position,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
then we look at the second element and pick any element from the second on,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
swap it into that position and so on.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And so we can see that every element in the array

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
has an equal opportunity to appear at each position.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So the qualities of this algorithm that I like is that it's so simple and clear.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
It just says in 1 statement.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It makes it obvious that each location i can have any of the elements of the deck

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
with equal probability.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Now, there's one part of it, I guess, which is not the most clear,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
which is are we exactly right here?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Here we've got N and here we've got N - 1, and that should bother you a little bit.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Do we have this right?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
In general, ranges are tricky in Python

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
because ranges go from--

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
If we say random range from i to N, it's not going all the way up to N;

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
it's only going to N - 1. And the same thing here.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
If we say from range to N - 1, actually the biggest number there is N - 2,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
but there's N - 1 of them because we include 0.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So ranges are always a little bit tricky. We can have these off by 1 errors.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
We want to make sure that we got this right,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and so let's have another quiz.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The quiz is, for that statement for i in range (N - 1),

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
what would happen if we replaced the (N - 1) with an N?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And the options are, would that give us an index error

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
that we've gone too far into the deck and we have the wrong index?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Would it give us a value error from random range?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Would it tell us, "You've got the wrong number in there"?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Would it give us no error but the results would be unfair

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
in that 1 permutation of the deck might be more common or more probable than another?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Or would it give us no error and still be fair but maybe just a little bit slower?
