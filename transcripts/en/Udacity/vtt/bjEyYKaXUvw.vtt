Before we talk about cognitive architectures in more detail,

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.500
first let us characterize what is a cognitive agent.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.030
Now, there are many views of what a cognitive agent is. Here is

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.940
one characterization of cognitive agent which is very popular in modern AI.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.660
A cognitive agent is a function that maps a perceptual history into an action.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.370
So it's B asterisk map into A where the asterisk on P stands for

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:32.759
the history percepts. So this characterization says that one of the major tasks

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.490
of cognitive agents is to select actions. You're driving a car. What action

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.550
should you take next? You're having lunch, what action should you do next?

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.970
You're conversing with someone, someone else, what action should you do next?

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.340
All the time we are taking actions, we as humans. And the question is,

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.040
what should we do next? We base that action in part on the history of

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.980
percepts in that particular situation. So this characterization

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.820
captures the basic notion of cognitive agent in a very concise manner.
