00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.650
How did you specify the state, David?

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.560
&gt;&gt; So, earlier when we were
talking about our goal state,

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.140
we had specified that we wanted
our ceiling to be painted.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.460
And we wrote that as Painted (Ceiling).

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.000
So if in this state
the ceiling is painted,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.950
I'll write that as Painted (Ceiling).

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.950
Earlier in the initial state,
we said that the robot was on the floor.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.310
And now we know that
the robot is on the ladder.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.600
So I'm going to say Robot On Ladder.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.820
And this is an and, so I'm going to join
them with a conjunction right there.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.950
I wasn't giving any other
information about the world, so

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.020
I'm not including anything
else in this state.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.150
&gt;&gt; That's good, David.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.689
In general, if there is information
about the initial state,

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.740
additional information for
example dry ladder and dry ceiling, then

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.660
those associations about the world can
be propagated to the subsequent states,

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.680
provided that no operator in
the middle of this initial state and

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.670
this state actually negates or
deletes any of those assertions.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.040
We'll see more of this in just a minute.
