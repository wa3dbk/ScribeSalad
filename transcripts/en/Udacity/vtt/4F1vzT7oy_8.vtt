00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.788
The solution to this equation is x equals 3 over 26. If you got the answer

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.797
right, you are well on your way. Let's see how we got that answer. Once again,

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:11.838
this is an equation that has fractions in it. Since I don't want to have to add

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.000
and subtract, multiply and divide a lot of fractions, I can clear the fractions

00:00:16.012 --> 00:00:21.830
by multiplying through by the least common denominator. The denominator are 6,

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:27.553
2, and 3. The least common denominator is 6. So, I have to multiply the equation

00:00:27.565 --> 00:00:32.223
through by 6. I'm going to skip this step of showing the individual

00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:37.947
multiplication of the terms. When I multiply 6 times x plus 7 over 6, the six is

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:44.574
cancelled out, and I'm left with x plus 7. When I multiply 6 times 1 half x, 6

00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:51.151
times 1 half is 3, and I have to multiply that by x. When I multiply 6 times 2

00:00:51.163 --> 00:00:57.095
3rds, I get 12 over 3, which is 4. Remember, when I'm multiplying through by the

00:00:57.107 --> 00:01:01.970
least common denominator, I have to multiply the least common denominator by

00:01:01.982 --> 00:01:06.920
every term. And that's every term whether there's a fraction in the term or not.

00:01:07.027 --> 00:01:11.482
So, I also have to multiply 6 times 4x, which gives me 24x. Now that I've

00:01:11.494 --> 00:01:16.078
eliminated all the fractions from my equation, I can combine my terms. On the

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.397
left side, I only have x plus 7. And on the right side, I have 3x plus 24x is

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.875
going to give me 27x. And then, I have the plus 4. The next thing I want to do

00:01:24.887 --> 00:01:29.312
since I like to deal with positive coefficients is to subtract x from both

00:01:29.324 --> 00:01:33.958
sides. Even though there's not a coefficient in front of this x, we know that

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.834
there's a 1 there. So, 1x minus 1x gives me 0 and the only thing I have left on

00:01:39.846 --> 00:01:45.024
the left side of the equation is 7. On the right side of the equation, I have

00:01:45.036 --> 00:01:50.081
27x minus 1x, gives me 26x plus 4. No that my variable is on one side of the

00:01:50.093 --> 00:01:55.616
equation, I want to isolate it by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation.

00:01:55.942 --> 00:02:01.386
7 minus 4 is 3 and that equals 26 x. The last step is to divide both sides of

00:02:01.398 --> 00:02:07.019
the equation by the coefficient of the variable, which is 26. When I do that, I

00:02:07.031 --> 00:02:12.609
know 26 over 26 is 1, so I have x on the right side of the equation and 3 over

00:02:12.621 --> 00:02:17.178
26 on the left side of the equation. Remember, it doesn't matter whether you

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.562
have a number equals x or x equals a number. It's the same thing.

00:02:20.658 --> 00:02:25.051
Congratulations on completing solving linear equations. Now that you've learned

00:02:25.063 --> 00:02:29.379
how to solve linear equations, let's do something a little bit different. Chris,

00:02:29.475 --> 00:02:31.079
what do you have up for us next?
