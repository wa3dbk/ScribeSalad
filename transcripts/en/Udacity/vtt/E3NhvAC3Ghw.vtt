00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.940
Let's return to our scatter plot that summarized the relationship between

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.020
age and mean friend count. Recall that we ended up creating this

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.050
plot from the new data frame that we created using the

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.700
d ply r package. The plot looked like this. As you can

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.170
see, the black line has a lot of random noise to

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.640
it. That is, the mean friend count rises and falls over each

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.950
age. Let's print out some of our data frame to have

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.140
a closer look. As we can see, the mean friend count increases,

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.750
then decreases later. In one particular case, we can see

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.250
that for 30 year olds, the mean friend count is

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.090
actually lower compared to the 29 year olds and the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.910
31 year olds. Now some year to year discontinuities might make

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.770
sense, such as the spike at age 69. But others

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.440
are likely just to be noise around the true smoother

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.300
relationship between age and friend count. That is, they reflect

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.510
that we just have a sample from the data generating process.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.040
And so the estimated mean friend count for each age

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.360
is the true mean plus some noise. We can imagine

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.560
that the noise for this plot would be worse if

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.680
we chose finer bins for age. For example, we could estimate

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.400
conditional means for each age, measured in months instead of

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.840
years. Over the next few programming exercises, you're going to

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.230
do just that. You're going to create a plot just like

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.930
this one with a new variable that measures ages in months

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.510
instead of years. Then you'll plot the conditional mean for

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.210
ages in months, and we'll compare this graph to the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.360
one that you create. To start, you're going to create

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.730
the age with months variable, and save it into the data

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.240
frame. This variable will have each user's age measured in

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.420
months rather than in years. So, if a user is 36

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.060
years old and was born in March, the user's age

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.270
would be 36.75. Try coding this up in R for yourself.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.270
And then once you have the code, copy and

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.980
paste it into the browser and submit. Now, this is

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.330
one of the exercises where the grader will automatically

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.730
check your output. Don't worry if you don't get this

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.970
one right on your first try. It's pretty tough.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.900
I really recommend thinking about ages and people being born

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.070
in different months. How would that affect the variable age

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.990
with months? Working with actual values might help you here.
