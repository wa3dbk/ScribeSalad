00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.390
We've heard a bit about customers
in the last few segments.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.990
Not surprisingly, customers will
play a huge role in the success or

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.800
failure of your business.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.270
Are they giving you money or
aren't they?

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.610
There are a few metrics you should
keep in mind in terms of customers,

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.760
loyalty, retention,
and acquisition costs.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.755
Customer loyalty measures
the performance of your customers,

00:00:24.755 --> 00:00:28.510
how often they purchase,
how often they visit a site,

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.800
basically have they made
your product a habit.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.760
Customer retention then
measures the number of users

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.240
retained in a given time period.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.510
And this is particularly important for
subscription-based models,

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.170
which we'll learn more about later.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.250
You can calculate customer retention
by taking the total number of customers

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.770
at the end of the given period and
subtracting the total number of new

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.280
customers that you got
during that period.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.730
And you divide that all by the customers
that you had at the start of the period.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.000
Multiply that by 100 and
you'll get a percentage.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.760
Customer acquisition cost,
as the name implies,

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.590
is how much you spend
to acquire new users.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.380
You can calculate customer acquisition
cost by taking the total acquisition

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.160
expenses and dividing by the total
number of new users in a given period.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.518
Now, what constitutes good for each
of these metrics is really up to you.

00:01:22.518 --> 00:01:27.570
Obviously, a 100% customer retention
percentage would be ideal,

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.580
but it's also not very likely.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.080
You'll be referring to these
metrics a lot later on,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.140
once you've implemented a monetization
method and are looking to iterate on it.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.000
So take a moment to think about
what success might look like

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.580
for your product.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.340
You'll be referring to these
metrics a lot later on,

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.290
once you've implemented a monetization
number and are looking to iterate on it.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.455
So take a moment to think about
what success might look like for

00:01:51.455 --> 00:01:56.895
your product, what metrics might you
use to measure customer loyalty,

00:01:56.895 --> 00:02:01.125
what percentage of customers do
you reasonably hope to retain.

00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:02.845
