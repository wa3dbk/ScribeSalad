00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.640
Here's another example where we can use out techniques from solving linear

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.700
equations. Again, I'd like you to start out by thinking of e to the x as our

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.404
variable. Once you get it by itself on one side of the equation, you can use

00:00:12.404 --> 00:00:18.688
logs to solve for x. Once you find an answer for x, please round to two decimal

00:00:18.688 --> 00:00:19.951
places.
