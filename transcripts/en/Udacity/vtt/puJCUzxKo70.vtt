00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.841
Any value greater than or equal to negative 2 3rds, but less than or equal to 1

00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:09.640
half would be correct. Fantastic algebra work for getting this one correct. We

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.152
start solving this inequality by rewriting it as an equation. We factor this

00:00:14.152 --> 00:00:19.396
expression to get 3x plus 2 times 2x minus 1. Now we're ready to set each of

00:00:19.396 --> 00:00:24.100
these factors equal to 0 and solve for our values of x. Here, the 0s are the

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.900
values that make this equation equal 0, our x equals negative 2 3rds and x

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.027
equals 1 half. We use the values of x that make this statement equal to 0,

00:00:34.027 --> 00:00:38.305
instead of three intervals on our number line. Next, we want to test each

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:42.676
interval and we'll start here. We'll let x equal negative 1 to get the

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:48.180
statement 3 is less than or equal to 0. We know this isn't true, so our first

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.546
interval is out. If we try a value between negative 2 3rds and 1 half, like 0,

00:00:52.546 --> 00:00:57.690
we wind up with a true statement. This means any number in this region will be

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.074
a part of our solution. Finally, we test a number in the interval III, like 1,

00:01:03.074 --> 00:01:07.662
to get a false statement. We know this isn't true, so this interval is out of

00:01:07.662 --> 00:01:12.431
our solution set as well. We can use brackets at negative 2 3rds and positive 1

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:17.928
half, since we can be equal to 0. So these numbers on the number line would

00:01:17.928 --> 00:01:22.511
work for our inequality and this would be the set in interval notation.
