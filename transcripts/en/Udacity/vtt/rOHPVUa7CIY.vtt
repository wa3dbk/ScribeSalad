00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.060
To find this out,

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.880
we'll take a look at a appending skills.length to the main div on the page.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.160
Looking at the array, we have index zero, index one, index two, and index three.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.210
So, let's go ahead and save this.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.710
Come over to the browser and hit refresh.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.410
And we can see that the skills length is four,

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.270
despite the fact that the last item in the array has an index of three.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.770
So, looking at the question, is the length of an array equal to the last index?

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.230
The correct answer is no.
