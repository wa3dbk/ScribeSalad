00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.669
One light source in 3JS that attempts to simulate the surrounding bounced light

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:07.410
in the scene is the Hemisphere Light. Instead of this light having a particular

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.880
position, it's considered to fully surround the scene with light coming from

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.714
every direction. This is also how you can think of ambient light, but with a

00:00:13.714 --> 00:00:16.721
difference. With a Hemisphere Light, you assign a light color to the top and a

00:00:16.721 --> 00:00:20.396
different color to the bottom. Each object's normals determine the color of the

00:00:20.396 --> 00:00:23.880
light it receives from this light source. If the normal points upward, the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.250
light's color is the top color. If the surface normal points straight down, the

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.547
bottom color. Any direction in between gives a blend of these two colors. The

00:00:31.547 --> 00:00:33.887
idea is that you can assign the top color to be something like the sky, the

00:00:33.887 --> 00:00:37.660
bottom to be something like the surrounding terrain. It's basically a more

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.908
elaborate for of ambient lighting. When we talk about textures we'll see a more

00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:43.909
involved version of this scheme called a Diffuse Map.
