00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's take it from which of these
pieces don't exist anymore.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.000
All right. After you left but before I started,
memcachedb hit a scaling wall,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and it just would not go any further,
the writes just were too fast for it.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Did you guys try adding more memcachedb boxes?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.107
I don't know actually. &gt;&gt;You went
there for that. &gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:00:26.107 --> 00:00:31.000
Memcachedb is not designed for the
heavy load we were throwing at it.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It's basically--it was the memcache code bolted
on top of Berkeley db, which is kind of neat,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but it wasn't really kind of design to
work at kind of our scale or use case,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.646
which is just basically sending as
many queries at it as you could.

00:00:44.646 --> 00:00:47.000
So you guys got rid of this? &gt;&gt;Right.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.261
And replace it with Cassandra.
It's a distributed, NoSQL database.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The way it works is you have rows,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.260
and a row is sharded by it's key to
somewhere in the ring of servers

00:01:04.275 --> 00:01:08.000
so you get automatic sharding
across this entire ring

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
when a row has columns inside of it and
that's where the actual data is stored.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:22.000
This moves to Cassandra and was pretty similar.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I'll let you draw Cassandra there and
I'll explain a little bit more about--

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Remember we talked about with database as you can replicate them where you send

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
the same data to multiple machines, which helps
for load and durability--this kind of picture here

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
or you can shard them which is you send
some chunk of data to one machine

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and another chunk of data to another.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Let's say we are talking about--in this case, we started using this for the precompute stuff first? &gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.707
You've got these listings--every subreddit has
like a hot page and that will be precomputed

00:01:53.707 --> 00:01:57.000
so you can store hot pages for
some Reddits on this node

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and some hot pages for Reddits
on this node and all around.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So, each node is not an exact copy of every other node. &gt;&gt;Right. &gt;&gt;Now, is there some overlap?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Right. It's configurable, but in our case,
we're using a replication factor of 3,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000
which means that if a piece of data lives on
this node, it is also on this one and this one

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and that happens all around the ring.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And why do you do that?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.123
Simultaneously a read can be serviced
from any one of the 3 if we allow it to be,

00:02:29.123 --> 00:02:33.000
which means that if one node is going
slow, we don't go really slow,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.600
and also it means that if anyone
one node just cease to exist,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.000
we wouldn't lose all data for
that segment of the data.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.707
Let's say you have content on this guy, this guy,
and this guy, and you lose this node,

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:50.000
does the content get redistributed? &gt;&gt;No.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000
They're assigned a key space and you have to move
tokens if you want to rebalance the ring.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Okay. That's something that you
as a developer have to do?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Yeah, that's an operational thing
&gt;&gt; Or systems? &gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
One of the things that happens as the team
grows too, as people's role has changed.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
When you're a small website, you are the designer, developer, sysadmin, all in one,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and you guys have a whole team of
operations guys. &gt;&gt;Two. Yeah. &gt;&gt;Okay.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
You have a team of two--they're very good, from what I've heard. They're extraordinarily good.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
When I left, it was me and David
who now works with me at Hipmunk

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.400
basically developers and OPs guys,
and we're better developers

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.000
than we were OPs guys, so that explains some of this.
