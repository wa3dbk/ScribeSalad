00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Narrator] The answer is 1011001,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and the way to get that is to look at the 2 possible messages.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We had for Y 1011001.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:22.000
For N, we had 1001110, and what we want to do is XOR them to figure out the difference between those 2.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The XOR of Y and N is equal to 0010111,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and so this is the value that will flip a Y answer into an N answer.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Now we want to XOR that with the actual message that was sent.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We don't know the key, but we know that

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that message is the result of XORing Alice's message with the key,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and so by XORing those, we get this value 1011001,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and if that's what Mallory sends, when Bob XORs that with the key,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
what Bob will get is the XOR of Alice's message.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Alice's message XOR'd with this value,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
which will flip Alice's message to be the opposite.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The point of this question is to illustrate the malleability of the one-time pad.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Someone who intercepts the transmission can alter it and change the meaning in  predictable ways.

00:01:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This is a very dangerous property for a cipher to have.
