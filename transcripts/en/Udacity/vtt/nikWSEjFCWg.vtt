00:00:00.148 --> 00:00:04.790
For substitution ciphers rather
than trying all possible keys,

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.240
we can use the frequency of letters.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.610
For example, here is the frequency
distribution of English letters.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.800
Now let's do an exercise together.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.118
With the frequency distribution
of English letters,

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:22.024
can we figure out the plain text for
this following cipher text?

00:00:22.024 --> 00:00:26.084
To start we notice that the letter
Q here in the cipher text

00:00:26.084 --> 00:00:28.130
is the most frequent.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.430
And we know that in plain text English,
the letter E is the most frequent.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.546
So, there's a high probability that
Q is in fact the plain text letter E.

00:00:38.546 --> 00:00:42.329
Then we can look at the three-letter
words, for example, here and here.

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.605
Now we know that Q is in fact E.

00:00:44.605 --> 00:00:48.910
So both end in E,
these two three-letter words.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.650
So most likely one of them would be the,
T-H-E.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.390
The other one would be are, A-R-E.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.840
So here we're going to start to use
the knowledge of English language.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.345
In other words,
what are the common words or

00:01:01.345 --> 00:01:05.620
what are the legitimate words in English
to help us uncover the plain text?

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.902
For example,
we can see if we say H is A and R is T,

00:01:10.902 --> 00:01:15.411
then we have a two letter word here, HR.

00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:19.401
In this case, if H is A and
R is T, that would be at,

00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:23.615
which is a commonly used
two letter word in English.

00:01:23.615 --> 00:01:25.152
And also, if H is A,

00:01:25.152 --> 00:01:30.138
then we have this three letter word
that has two letters the same.

00:01:30.138 --> 00:01:33.600
So if H is A, then this can be all.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.140
So we can continue with this process

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.530
by using our knowledge of the English
language to uncover the plain text.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.750
Here we use both the frequency
distribution of the English letters and

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.710
our knowledge of English
words to help us.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.910
If you continue with this process,

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.830
you should be able to uncover
this following plain text.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.040
We will meet in the middle
of the library at noon,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.250
all arrangements are made.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.390
In practice,

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.200
in addition to the frequency
distribution of English letters,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.620
we can also consider the frequency
of letter pairs, or even triples.
