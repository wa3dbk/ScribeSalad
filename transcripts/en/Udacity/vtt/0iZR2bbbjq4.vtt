Well the first problem is that this feature only

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.970
works in mobile, not in desktop. On desktop, you only

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.780
get the normal file open dialogue. Not access to

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.200
the webcam. Secondly, the interface is a file open button,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.910
which is hard to style and make look the

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.390
way you might want it to. And finally, taking you

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.450
to a different application to take a picture or

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.470
record some audio, makes it kind of hard to keep

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.380
a consistent flow in your application.
