00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.323
And the answer is no. Since each of these distances is going to be squared, it

00:00:05.335 --> 00:00:10.517
doesn't matter which order we have the coordinates in. If instead we had x1

00:00:10.633 --> 00:00:15.890
minus x2 and then wanted to square that, well, this is the same as negative 1

00:00:15.902 --> 00:00:21.101
times x2 minus x1. And if we square all of that, we end up getting back to x2

00:00:21.217 --> 00:00:25.727
minus x1, the whole quantity squared since when we squared negative 1, we get a

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.848
positive 1. So, it doesn't matter which point you start with and which point you

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.954
end with when you're finding the distance between two points.
