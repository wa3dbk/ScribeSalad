00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Today's lecture is what have we learned in entrepreneurship for the last 40 years.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
One of the interesting questions is why are you here?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I hope you're here to find out what does it take to go from an idea to a business.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
For the last 20 years if you wanted to know how to go from an idea to a business,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the answer from educators and investors are simply, "Well, go research and then write

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
a business plan and you'll know everything possible to actually start and run your business."

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We now know that advice was simply wrong--not kind of wrong but very wrong.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We now today know something we didn't know before.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We now know the right way to build startups and so this class is about that right way,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but before we get started, let's see how we took the wrong path

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and then see what we now know worse.
