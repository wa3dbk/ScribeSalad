00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.460
After this interesting conversation with Neno, let me start

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.060
the lesson by defining what a software architecture is.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.600
And to do that, I'm going to use two

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.030
seminal definitions. The first one is from Dewayne Perry

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.990
and Alex Wolf. And they define a software architecture

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.940
as elements, form and rationale. In this definition, the

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.300
elements are the what, which means the processes, data,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.430
and connectors that compose a software architecture. The form

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.780
is the how, the set of properties of

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.030
in relationships among these elements. And, finally, the rationale

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.390
is the why, the justification for the elements and

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.440
their relationships. The second definition I want to use

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.710
is from Mary Shaw and David Garland. And

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.480
they defined a software architecture as a level of

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.300
design that involves four main things, a description of

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.860
elements from which these systems are built, the interactions

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.800
among those elements, the patterns that guide their composition, and

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.320
finally, the constraints on these patterns. As you can see, these

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.420
definitions are fairly similar and there are many more alternative

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.870
definitions of software architecture. In fact, if we try to search

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.540
the term software architecture, we get over two million entries.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.670
And if we look at the images in the results of

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.110
the search this is what we get. And I like this

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.120
sort of graphical depiction because it gives you a clear idea

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.300
the software architecture are prevalent concept, given the number of

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.600
results. But they also show you clearly, that software architecture are

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.550
complex entities, if you look at some of these pictures.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.930
And ultimately, they show that software architecture are presented in all

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.700
kinds of ways including in 3D, if you look at this

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.970
picture. We cannot clearly cover all of these definitions in one

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.340
lesson. So what I will do instead, is to introduce

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.750
a very general definition that encompasses most of the existing ones.
