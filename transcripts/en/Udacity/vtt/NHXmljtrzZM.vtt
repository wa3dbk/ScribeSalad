00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So now we talk about one of my favorite topics hypothesis testing.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And the reason why I love this topic is because it's really about decision making.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We talked a lot about data or often called the sample and we used statistics to extract information

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and now we use more statistics to make decisions and the decisions to be binary, be it a yes or no.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And the reason why I like this, I think life is all about decision making.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I think there is no meaning in doing statistics without eventually at least making a decision.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This is the first time in this class, you're going to make an actual decision.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So in this box of pills for weight loss and particularly it says that 90% probability,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
taking these pills, a substantial weight loss is being guaranteed.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Now suppose your job is not to make a decision whether to buy this box or not.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I can promise you in all likelihood why those pills don't work but whether this claim is correct or not

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
so you really care about why the company that sells this product made a correct thing.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And to do so, you talk to people who have taken this medicine

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and you ask question--did you lose weight?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Yes or no and say this is a magical medication.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And 11 out of 15 people tell you yes, but 4 out 15 people tell you no.

00:01:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Obviously, this is not 90%. In fact, what do you think it is in percent?
