00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And for mode the answer is clear.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The answer is 3 because 3 has 3 data points

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and no other value has more than 2.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The median is also 3.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We have 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 10, 11 data points.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Median value will be the 6th data point.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It has 5 above and 5 below, and that happens to be a 3.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The mean is a little trickier to calculate.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We could probably eyeball it as being a little above 3

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
since if there weren't these points over here it would be 3,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
but let's just work it out quickly.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:59.000
1 + 4 + 9 + 8 + 5 + 6 + 11.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And those equal 44.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And we had figured before there were 11 data points,

00:01:06.000 --> 99:59:59.000
so it's 44/11, and that is equal to 4.
