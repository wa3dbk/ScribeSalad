00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.924
Now when Skinner was first studying rats in his Skinner box, he actually made

00:00:03.924 --> 00:00:08.552
his own food pallet's, and that was quite tedious. So he wondered what would

00:00:08.552 --> 00:00:11.880
happen if, instead of reinforcing every level press, he actually spaced out

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.158
some of those reinforcers. And this is how he discovered an entire field of

00:00:16.158 --> 00:00:20.970
study, of schedules of reinforcement. There are many different schedules, but

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.020
the two we'll just discuss briefly here are ratio schedules and interval

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.041
schedules. We have a ratio schedule and I could have a fixed ratio of five,

00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:34.228
which means every fifth response is reinforced. We also have interval

00:00:34.228 --> 00:00:38.072
schedules. Those are time schedules, so I could have a fixed interval of 30

00:00:38.072 --> 00:00:43.384
seconds. That would mean that the first response that occurred after 30 seconds

00:00:43.384 --> 00:00:49.008
was reinforced. Skinner famously compared rats in his Skinner box to humans by

00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:54.668
looking at humans in casinos. On a variable schedule, reinforcement occurs on a

00:00:54.668 --> 00:00:58.562
variable schedule, meaning perhaps after every ten responses, after every 20

00:00:58.562 --> 00:01:04.532
responses. This type of schedule engenders a lot of behavior. You can just go

00:01:04.532 --> 00:01:09.104
to Las Vegas and watch people at the slot machines pulling the levers. They're

00:01:09.104 --> 00:01:13.646
no different than rats pressing levers in their Skinner boxes. Skinner studied

00:01:13.646 --> 00:01:18.409
rats in Skinner boxes. The behavior first has to occur before it can be

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.694
reinforced. We can use shaping, which is reinforcing successive approximations

00:01:23.694 --> 00:01:28.093
to the target behavior. And we can generate different types of behavior through

00:01:28.093 --> 00:01:32.840
schedules of reinforcement. Be sure to read the pdf in the instructor's notes

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.451
on schedules of reinforcement. We're going to talk more about operant

00:01:37.451 --> 00:01:41.751
conditioning, however, this time with another animal, sea lions.
