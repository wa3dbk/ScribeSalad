00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.100
For the single [UNKNOWN] the applicability is fairly obvious.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.060
There must be only one such instance of the class, and

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.670
it's must be accessible to clients from a well known place.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.650
As far as structure is concerned, there is a single class called here,

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.330
singleton class, but it can be whatever name you want to supply.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.790
The singleton class has two particular attributes. One of which is static or

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.390
sometimes called a class attribute. That is, it's an attribute of the class and

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.910
not an instance of the class. Here it's called unique instance.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.640
There may also be whatever data you'd like to have within that singleton

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.440
as other attributes of the class. The singleton class also has some operations,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.130
and one of those operations is a class method.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.770
That class method is responsible for retrieving for

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.160
the client the particular instance which is the only instance of the singleton.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.430
There of course may also be operations within the singleton like there could be

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.080
in any other class for providing access, for example, to the other

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.150
data that's there or doing whatever operations you'd like that singleton to do.
