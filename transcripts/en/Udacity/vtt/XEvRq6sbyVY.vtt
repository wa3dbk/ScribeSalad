&gt;&gt; So with the ABCs with Callie, can you give us an example of how those were

00:00:03.251 --> 00:00:04.705
applied?

00:00:04.705 --> 00:00:09.528
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So once the behavior has been trained, the antecedent is the cue or the

00:00:09.528 --> 00:00:14.942
SD, the stimulus descriptive. Then the behavior would be her putting her head

00:00:14.942 --> 00:00:19.952
back to her back. That's the behaviour, and then the consequence is the bridge

00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:24.270
and the reinforcement. The bridge is a form of reinforcement and then the fish

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.220
being the other, primary form of reinforcement.
