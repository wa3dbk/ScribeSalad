00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.469
About the four write
methods in Firebase.

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:06.610
But it sounds like you want to read
from the Firebase database as well.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.780
It's time to become
fully Firebase literate.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.810
Reading data in Firebase
is all about Listeners.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.129
You set a Listener and then define what
it does whenever it receives new data or

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.930
changes to existing data.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.920
It's always triggered
with initial data and

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.540
then it is triggered again whenever
there is new or changed data.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.535
There are three ways to add
read Listeners in Firebase.

00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:29.830
AddValueEventListener receives
events about changes to data

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.445
at a specific location.

00:00:31.445 --> 00:00:35.260
AddChildEventListener receives events
about changes in the child locations of

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.380
a given Firebase reference.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.370
It is useful when trying to
keep track of lists of data.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.250
The third method is
addListenerForSingleValueEvent.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.587
AddListenerForSingleValueEvent looks
almost exactly like addValueEvent

00:00:48.587 --> 00:00:49.310
Listener.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.420
But it does only one
read when you make it.
