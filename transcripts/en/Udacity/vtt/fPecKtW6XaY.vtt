00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What happens at the depth here?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, we keep dividing it in half until we get down to 1.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We've already spoken about that.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
That is exactly base 2 log. So the depth is base 2 log.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
How many leaves do we get?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
There's one at the first level, then 2, then 4, then 8, then 16.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So in general, it's going to be 2^d.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
But we just said that depth is log base 2 of n.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So that's exactly n.
