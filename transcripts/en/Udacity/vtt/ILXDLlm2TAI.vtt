00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.790
Now that we have one point, let's find some more. The slope of negative 2, since

00:00:04.802 --> 00:00:09.650
negative 2 is the coefficient of the x term, so it is m in this equation, tells

00:00:09.662 --> 00:00:14.535
us that for every one unit we move to the right, we need to move down negative 2

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:19.510
units. Thinking about the point that we already know in the slope, can you name

00:00:19.522 --> 00:00:22.160
another point that should lie on this line?
