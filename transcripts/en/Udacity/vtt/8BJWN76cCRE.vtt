00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.420
And in this problem, a would equal 3. Way to go if you got that one correct.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.830
Since a varies inversely with b, we want to make sure that we put the b quantity

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.618
in the denominator. But for c, a varies directly with it. So we want to put that

00:00:13.618 --> 00:00:17.272
straight across in the numerator. This is perhaps the trickiest part about

00:00:17.272 --> 00:00:20.746
setting up variation problems. And you want to make sure you get it right each

00:00:20.746 --> 00:00:24.723
time. Remember, with inverse relationships. They'll appear in opposite

00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:29.054
positions, whereas with direct relationships, the variables will appear directly

00:00:29.054 --> 00:00:34.409
across from one another. So in my first case, a is 12, b is three, and c is

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:38.882
eight. So I plug in those values. In the second case, we don't know the value of

00:00:38.882 --> 00:00:43.588
a, so I leave that written as a in the denominator. But I do know that b2 is

00:00:43.588 --> 00:00:48.808
equal to six. And c2 is equal to 4. These are the values of b and c in our

00:00:48.808 --> 00:00:53.287
second case. Now that we have this equation, we multiply these two fractions

00:00:53.287 --> 00:00:58.844
together to get 48 divided by 12. We cross multiply to get 144 equals 48a, and

00:00:58.844 --> 00:01:03.374
finally we divide both sides by 48 to get a is equal to 3.
