00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.320
When we see a fractional exponent, we want to think about power divided by

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.194
root. The numerator is the power of our base, and the denominator indicates the

00:00:08.194 --> 00:00:13.612
root we're taking, a square root here. For the second example, we'll still have

00:00:13.612 --> 00:00:18.662
a power of 1 here, and then 3 as the root, the cubed root. Let's see if you can

00:00:18.662 --> 00:00:22.123
put this knowledge of fractional exponents to use.
