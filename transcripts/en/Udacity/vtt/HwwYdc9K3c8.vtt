But there's other things that you can do with regular expressions. But I think

00:00:02.979 --> 00:00:08.326
we're ready for a quiz. So the question is, which of the regular expressions

00:00:08.326 --> 00:00:14.464
shown below is equivalent to the set z, zz, zzz, zzzz, and so on, meaning all

00:00:14.464 --> 00:00:26.067
strings with one or more z's? The choices are z, zz*, zz?z, (zz)*, and

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:30.952
zz?(zz)*. Check all the ones that are exactly equivalent to the set of all

00:00:30.952 --> 00:00:32.333
strings of 1 or more z's.
