00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.270
Our simplified answer is 5x cubed y cubed times the cube root of 2x squared y.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.875
Now that's pretty amazing if you got it right on your first try. If you

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:12.395
stumbled a little bit, that's definitely okay, see if you can find your first

00:00:12.395 --> 00:00:16.827
mistake in the solution video. Then pause it to see if you can work toward this

00:00:16.827 --> 00:00:22.458
answer. We start by simplifying the cube root of 54 and the cube root of 16. We

00:00:22.458 --> 00:00:27.152
want to split this up into 27 times 2. This allows us to take the cube root of

00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:32.740
27, which we know is 3. The same is true for 16. We split it up into 8 times 2,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.650
so we can take the cube root of 8. So for this first radical, we know the cube

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.298
root of 27 equals 3. This 2 stays inside of the radical, since we don't have

00:00:41.298 --> 00:00:45.598
the 2 repeated 3 times. Now we can use power divided by root to simplify our

00:00:45.598 --> 00:00:51.838
variables. For x, we'll have 8 divided by 3, which equals 2 remainder 2. This

00:00:51.838 --> 00:00:55.744
means we'll have x squared on the outside of our radical, And x squared on the

00:00:55.744 --> 00:00:59.650
inside of a radical for the variable y we'll have 10 divided by 3 which equals

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.430
3 remainder 1. This means we'll have y cubed on the outside of a radical and 1

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.790
y or just y on the inside of a radical for the second radical we want to take

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.546
the cubed root of 8 which equals 2. This to just stays inside the radical. For

00:01:15.546 --> 00:01:21.240
the variable x we use power divided by root, this gives us one remainder two.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.365
So will have one x outside of a radical and x squared inside of a radical. For

00:01:26.365 --> 00:01:30.940
y will have two remainder one so y squared on the outside And Y to the 1 on the

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.247
inside. We multiply these numbers together to get 9 x cubed, y cubed over here

00:01:37.247 --> 00:01:45.290
we multiply them as well. We'll have 4 x to the third and y cubed. Notice that

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.499
this term and this term has X cubed Y cubed times the cube root of 2x squared

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:55.448
y. This means that they are like. So really we're just going to do 9 minus 4

00:01:55.448 --> 00:02:01.188
and then multiply it by the trailing variables and radical. 9 minus 4 equals 5,

00:02:01.188 --> 00:02:05.123
so this is our final result.
