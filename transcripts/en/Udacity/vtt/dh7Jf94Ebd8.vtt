Let's try a third problem on working together. It takes Melissa 2 hours longer

00:00:03.906 --> 00:00:08.584
to edit a short film than it takes Carlos, who is a professional editor. If it

00:00:08.584 --> 00:00:13.305
takes them 2 and 4 10th hours to edit a short film as a team. How long would it

00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:18.056
take them to do it alone? Now, before we saw for each person's time to edit the

00:00:18.056 --> 00:00:22.754
film alone, let's find an equation. Enter the equation in here and you want to

00:00:22.754 --> 00:00:26.580
make sure that you use x as your variable. Good luck.
