00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.939
The area under this curve, is 1. Remember that when we have the proportions,

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:11.751
they all add to 1. Likewise, the area under the curve, is equal to the sum of

00:00:11.751 --> 00:00:16.065
all the frequencies in all the bins, which should be 1.
