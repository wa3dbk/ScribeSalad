00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.300
The next type of software process models that I

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.300
want to discuss are Agile Software Development Processes. And this

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.470
is a group of software development methods that are

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.620
based on highly iterative and incremental development. And in particular,

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.000
I'm going to discuss Test Driven Development or TDD. The

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.490
space on the iteration of three main phases. In

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.970
the first one that we mark as red, we

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.350
write test cases that encode our requirements, and for which

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.180
we haven't written code yet. And therefore, they will fail, obviously.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.800
So we're in this sort of red or fail phase. From

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.830
this phase, we move to this phase, in which after we

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.970
write the just enough code to make the test cases pass.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.670
We have a set of test cases that are all passing.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.810
And therefore, we can consider this as the green phase. We

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.930
had enough code to make the test cases pass because the

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.520
test cases encode our requirements. We have just written enough code to

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.940
satisfy our requirements. When we do this over time though,

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.080
what happens is that the structure of the code deteriorates, because

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.100
we keep adding pieces. So that's why we have the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.540
first step, which is refactoring. In this step, we modify the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.724
code, and we will talk about refactoring extensively. We'll devote

00:01:05.724 --> 00:01:08.190
one lesson to it. We modify the code to make it

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.650
more readable, more maintainable. In general, we modify to improve the

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.560
design of the code. And after this phase, we will go

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.670
back to writing more test cases for

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.730
new requirements, write code that makes these

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.870
test cases pass, and so on. So we'll continue to iterate among these phases. And

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.500
also, in this case, we will talk

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.390
about Agile Software Processes. And in particular,

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.250
about extreme programming, or XP, and Scrum

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.349
in more details, in minor course number four.
