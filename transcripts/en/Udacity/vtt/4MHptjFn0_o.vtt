00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.090
So the code that the attacker
wants to craft is basically code

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.680
that is going to launch this command
shell that we're talking about.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.480
And that kind of code
is called Shell Code.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.480
So how do you write Shell Code?

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.920
Well a little bit of expertise comes in.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.750
So the Shell Code as I
said creates a shell,

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.350
which is going to allow you to
execute arbitrary commands.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.950
So any code program that we have,

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.052
the attacker can ask that that
particular code be executed.

00:00:31.052 --> 00:00:35.088
So let's talk a little bit about
how do you craft the Shell Code.

00:00:35.088 --> 00:00:38.760
Say call you're making
to launch a shell,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.310
you can write the code in C for example.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.490
It's a fairly short piece of code,
you're just using one of the calls.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.520
And then let's say you compile
it into assembler instructions.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.530
So once you have assembly instructions,

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.380
remember the shell code
has to be machine code.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.970
Because these are values and
they have to be encoded properly and

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.110
things like that.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.170
These are values that you
are going to store in memory.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.930
That is where your shell code is.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.620
That's where control is
going to be transferred.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.462
So memory is going to
store these binary values.

00:01:10.462 --> 00:01:13.460
So it may look like data, but

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.750
actually it really represents
instructions of codes.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.060
And if your program is instructed
to go execute from there,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.890
then it is going to be a program.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.280
So you really have to figure out
what the instructions are and

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.490
what data those instructions
are going to use when they execute.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.580
And you're going to craft
that as a set of values

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.610
that you load into this part of memory.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.520
And that's going to be based on the
instructional codes of the machine code

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.440
as I've said before.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.690
But the way you can do that
is by writing the code in

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.020
a high level language, Assembler,
translating that to machine code and

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.890
that's how you figure out what is
the ShellCode that you're going to need.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.710
So Shell Code that we going to
place somewhere in memory,

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.645
this is how you're going to get to it.

00:02:01.645 --> 00:02:04.575
Then I say,
we know how to transfer control to it,

00:02:04.575 --> 00:02:07.955
because we modify the return
address when the function ended,

00:02:07.955 --> 00:02:11.835
it will actually go to this
place where the shell code is.
