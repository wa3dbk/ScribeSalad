00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.208
We've been talking about array lists up to now and array lists are very

00:00:03.208 --> 00:00:06.625
flexible, but there are times when arrays are lower level construct are more

00:00:06.625 --> 00:00:13.842
useful. Here is how to make an array of values of type double. As you can see,

00:00:13.842 --> 00:00:16.466
it looks quite different than the declaration of an array list, so let's take

00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:21.450
it apart. Over here is the type, it's an array indicated by these brackets of

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.026
double. This is the variable. Here's the new operator and back here we say we

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:31.247
want to construct an array of ten doubles, so as you can see you put the length

00:00:31.247 --> 00:00:35.602
of the array inside the brackets, unlike with arrayLists, the size of an array

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:39.689
can never change, this array here has been made with ten numbers and it'll

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:47.664
always have ten numbers in it. No more and no less. There's a second way of

00:00:47.664 --> 00:00:51.764
constructing an array that's often very convenient. Here I have again an array

00:00:51.764 --> 00:00:57.399
of floating point numbers. I call it moreValues. And over here I simply put

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.819
enclosed inside braces the values that I want to put in the array. This array

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:06.359
has length five and again it'll always have length five.
