00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.469
Virtualization is an old idea.

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:08.162
It originated in the 60s at IBM when
the norm of computing was that there

00:00:08.162 --> 00:00:13.070
were a few large mainframe computers
that were shared by many users and

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.960
many business services.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.470
In order to concurrently run a very
diverse workloads on the same physical

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.000
hardware, without requiring that
a single operating system be used for

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.816
all of the o- applications for
all of the possible purposes,

00:00:28.816 --> 00:00:34.200
it was necessary to come up with a model
where multiple operating systems

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.880
can concurrently be deployed
on the same hardware platform.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.420
With virtualization,

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.270
each of the operating systems that are
deployed on the same physical platform

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.110
has an illusion that it actually owns
the underlying hardware resources.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.470
Or at least some smaller
portion of them.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.010
For instance,

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.080
the operating system may think that
it owns some smaller amount of memory

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.500
compared to the memory that's actually
available on the physical machine.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.210
Each operating system together with its
applications as well as the virtual

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.170
resources that it pings at us is called
a virtual machine, or VM for short.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.680
This represents a virtual
machine because it is distinct

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.170
from the physical machine that is
natively managed by some software stack.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.750
Virtual machines are often referred
to as guests such as guest VMs or

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.527
also referred to as domains,
like a guest domain for instance.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.320
To support the coexistence of multiple
virtual machines on the same physical

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.550
machine, require some underlying
functionality in order to deal with

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.320
the allocation and the management of
the real, physical hardware resources.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.980
In addition,

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.470
it's necessary to provide some
isolation guarantees across these VMs.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.560
This is provided by
the virtualization layer,

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.710
that is refered to as virtual
machine monitor or hypervisor, also.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.360
There are multiple ways in
which the functionality,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.470
that's required by the virtualization
layer, can be designed and implemented.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.010
And in this lesson we will describe
some of the key virtualization

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.720
related techniques.
