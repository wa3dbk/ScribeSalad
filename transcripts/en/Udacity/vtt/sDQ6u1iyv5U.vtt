00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.938
We've gathered a bunch of information over the last few questions. Here's what

00:00:04.938 --> 00:00:10.840
we know. After 8 hours of exposure to 85 decibel noise, permanent hearing

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.680
damage can occur. When we increase the decibel level from 85 to 100, the power

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:24.110
increases by a factor of 32. And the exposure time before damage occurs is cut

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.400
in half every time the power doubles. So, taking all this into account, how

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.840
long will it take for permanent hearing damage to occur if you're being exposed

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.690
to noise of 100 decibels. Please give your answer in minutes.
