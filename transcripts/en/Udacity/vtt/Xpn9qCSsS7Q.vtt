00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.540
We start the search for

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.740
a deeper understanding,
with the idea of the augmenting path.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.960
Recall that in our original
treatment of the max flow problem,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.990
we were given a flow over some graph,
and we defined the residual network,

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.120
which captured the ways in which we
were allowed to modify this flow.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.320
This included adding backwards edges
that went in the opposite direction from

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.370
edges in the original.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.180
Augmenting paths then were paths
over this residual network

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.070
that went from the source to the sync,
and augmented the flow.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.160
In a network that arises from
a bipartite matching problem,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.270
there are few special phenomena
that are worth noting.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.240
First observe that all intermediate
flows found by Ford-Fulkerson

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.580
correspond to matchings as well.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.030
If there is flow across an internal
edge, then it belongs in the matching.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.760
Also because flows along
edges are either zero or

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.840
one there are no anti-parallel
edges in the residual network.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.140
That is to say either
the original edge is there or

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.900
the reverse edge is there, never both.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.970
Moreover the matched edges are the ones
that have their edges reversed.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.100
Also, only unmatched vertices have
an edge from the source to them,

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.880
or from them to the sync.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.030
Matched vertices have
their edges reversed.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.340
The result of all this is that
any augmenting path must start

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.500
at an unmatched vertex, and
then follow an unmatched edge,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.410
followed by a matched edge,
followed by an unmatched edge,

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.860
until eventually it reaches an unmatched
vertex on the right hand side, and

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.390
then it can follow
that edge to the sync.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.320
This realization allows us to strip away
much of the complexity of flow networks

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.980
and define an augmenting path for

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.400
bipartite matching in
more natural terms.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.100
We start by defining the more general
concept of an alternating path.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.780
Given a matching M,

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.610
an alternating path is a path where the
edges are alternately in M and not in M.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.538
And an augmenting path is
an alternating path where the first and

00:02:08.538 --> 00:02:11.340
the last vertex are unmatched.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.900
For example, in this graph here,
going from this unmatched vertex in L

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.040
to this matched vertex in R back
to this matched one in L and

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.020
then to this unmatched one in R
constitutes and augmenting path.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.070
We use it to augment the matching
by making the unmatched edges

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.679
matched and the matched edges unmatched.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.320
Like so.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.480
This always increases the size of
the matching because before we flipped,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.980
there was one more unmatched edge
than matched edge in the path.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.480
So when we reversed the matched and

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.360
unmatched edges, we increased
the size of the matching by one.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.170
In fact,

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.370
we can restate the Ford-Fulkerson
method purely in these terms.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.030
We initialize the matching
to the empty set, and then

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.380
while there's an augmenting path, we
update the matching to be the symmetric

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.690
difference between the current
matching and the path that we found.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.350
The symmetric difference
includes an element

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.460
if it's in exactly one of these sets,
or alternatively, you can think

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.600
about it as the union of the two sets
minus the things that are in both.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.380
The things that are in both here
correspond to matched edges in the path.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.640
And remember that we flipped
them to being unmatched.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.170
And finally,

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.730
once there are no more augmenting paths,
we simply return the matching.
