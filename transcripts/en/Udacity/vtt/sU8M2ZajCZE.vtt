00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.689
I'll start by selecting the navList by passing in the class .nav-list.

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.450
Then I want the first item in the navList, so

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.430
I use children to get the children of navList, and

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.260
then I use the .first method to make sure I've got the first one.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.390
After that, I want the link in the first one, so I find the a tag inside of it.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.470
At that point, it's pretty simple.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.460
I use the the .attr method to change the href attribute and set it to number 1.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.110
After hitting Test Run, I can see that item number 1 now has a link attached to

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.600
it, which is pretty cool.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.400
Let's just make sure it's the right one.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.360
I'll open up Dev Tools by inspecting this element.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.060
And we can see that yes, this a tag has a href of number 1.
