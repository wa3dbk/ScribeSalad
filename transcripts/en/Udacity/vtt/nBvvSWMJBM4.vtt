00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.166
So great, we've found a factor. How does this help us though? Eventually I want

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:07.166
to get f of x in it's fully factored form, but what do we do with this single

00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:12.310
factor that we already know to find out the other factors? Well, let's think.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.937
If we have a number like 12 and we know that two is a factor of it. Then if we

00:00:16.937 --> 00:00:21.732
divide 12 by 2 we get 6.As what we need to multiply by two to get twelve. So

00:00:21.732 --> 00:00:25.382
that means that all of the other factors must multiply to equal six. Then we

00:00:25.382 --> 00:00:30.664
can also factor six in to two and three. Those are the other two prime factors

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:35.734
of 12. So now we have the full prime factorization of 12. It's just equal to 2

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:39.760
times 2 times 3. So looks like if we divide a number by a factor that's known,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.910
then we get a simplified number in this case, or expression in this case that

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.292
is a product of the leftover factors we're still looking for. That means that

00:00:48.292 --> 00:00:52.800
we shoudl divide this expression by x minus 2. To get one step closer to

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.536
figuring out our other factors. But how do we do this. Well, you'll have to

00:00:57.536 --> 00:00:59.423
wait for the next lesson to find out.
