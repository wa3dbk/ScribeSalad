00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now you will learn about the three Ms in statistics:

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the mean, the median, and the mode.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And these are terms that are really important to know.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
They are useful in looking at data, and they are often confused.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So let me bring clarity to the story of the three Ms.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Let's talk about the first.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We talked quite a bit about house prices,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and here is a list of possible house prices.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The mean is using the exact same formula as in the previous unit.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It's the average of all those prices over here.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Do me a favor and quickly compute it for those numbers over here.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
When you put in the number, don't worry about the thousands.

00:00:46.000 --> 99:59:59.000
It's something between 165 and 190.
