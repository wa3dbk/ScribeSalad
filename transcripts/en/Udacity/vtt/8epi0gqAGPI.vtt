00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.596
Let's look at this study. One group of researchers went to a neighborhood and

00:00:03.596 --> 00:00:06.924
knocked on the front doors of people's houses and asked them to put up a large,

00:00:06.924 --> 00:00:12.325
somewhat ugly sign in their front yard that said drive carefully. 17% of

00:00:12.325 --> 00:00:17.830
homeowners agreed to do so. A second group of homeowners were first asked to

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.601
sign a petition that was to be submitted to state representatives. They would

00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:27.948
promote safe driving after they signed the petition they were then asked to

00:00:27.948 --> 00:00:32.226
install the large of the sign and 55% of them actually agreed to put the sign

00:00:32.226 --> 00:00:36.504
in their lawn, now why is it that 17% of the first group agreed, but 55% in the

00:00:36.504 --> 00:00:45.017
second group agreed and the sign was the exact same sign. This can be explained

00:00:45.017 --> 00:00:50.126
by the specific technique of persuasion called foot-in-the-door technique. And

00:00:50.126 --> 00:00:55.240
this is asking for a small request first, such as will you sign this petition.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.394
And then followed up by a larger request such as, will you put this huge sign

00:00:59.394 --> 00:01:05.190
in your front yard. People use this technique quite often. Perhaps you've

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.440
gotten a request from a charitable organization for a small donation, only to

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.575
find out that you later receive requests for even larger donations. Those

00:01:13.575 --> 00:01:17.064
organizations are using this technique. Or, when I asked you if you liked my

00:01:17.064 --> 00:01:20.136
class, and then I asked you to change your profile picture, this is the foot in

00:01:20.136 --> 00:01:24.800
the door technique. But let's go to Susan for other techniques of persuasion.
