00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.380
I hope that algorithm for incremental concept learning makes sense to you.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.310
Here is another way of visualization that algorithm.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.740
Imagine that an AI agent was given a positive example and the AI agent may

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.530
come up with a concept definition that covers that positive example.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.600
Now let us suppose that the AI agent is given a negative example, and

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.710
this negative example is covered by the current concept definition. Well in

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.040
that case the current concept definition must be refined in such a way that

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.780
the negative example is excluded, while still including the positive example. So

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.460
you can visualize a new concept definition which includes the positive example,

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.010
but excludes the negative example. Now let us suppose that the AI agent is given

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.430
another positive example, in which case the AI agent must revise its definition

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.330
of the concept so that the new positive example is also included so that's

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.160
also covered. So we may revise this concept definition something like this. And

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.650
we can repeat this exercise many times. Imagine there is a negative example and

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.570
the current concept definition covers it.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.500
Well, we can refine it in such a way that a new negative example is excluded and

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.790
so on. We can imagine going through several of these iterations of positive and

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.820
negative examples. Eventually we'll get a concept definition that includes,

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.010
that covers all the positive examples, and excludes all the negative examples.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.750
So again, the problem is the same. Given a small set of positive and

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.500
negative examples, the number of dimensions in

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.730
which the algorithm can do generalization and specialization is very large.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.968
How do, how do we constrain the learning in this complex learning space?

00:01:37.968 --> 00:01:41.512
That's where those [UNKNOWN] and background knowledge come in.

00:01:41.512 --> 00:01:45.940
The [UNKNOWN] guide the algorithm so that it revises the concept definition

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.660
in an efficient manner and the background knowledge helps in that process.
