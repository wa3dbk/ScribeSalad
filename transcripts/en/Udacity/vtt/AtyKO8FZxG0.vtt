Another type of word problem involves ratios. A ratio is a way of comparing one

00:00:04.572 --> 00:00:09.184
quantity to another. For example, the number of dimes to the number of quarters

00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:13.435
in my hand is two to three. This means that for every two dimes in my hand I

00:00:13.447 --> 00:00:17.956
have three quarters. So try and answer this question. How many coins are in my

00:00:17.968 --> 00:00:20.140
hand in total? Choose the best answer.
