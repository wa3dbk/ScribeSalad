00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.310
So we have this equation written in slope intercept form now, which is great.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.519
But it's kind of yucky looking. At least, if you're me, and fractions aren't

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.024
necessarily your favorite thing. There is however, yet another form of a linear

00:00:13.024 --> 00:00:17.178
equation that we can use to rewrite this, and maybe make it look a little bit

00:00:17.178 --> 00:00:21.753
more pleasing. And that is called the general form of, of linear equation. We

00:00:21.753 --> 00:00:26.873
can rate a general form of the general form proven to your equations as Ax plus

00:00:26.873 --> 00:00:31.916
By equals C where A, B and C are all constants. In addition to this, we have one

00:00:31.916 --> 00:00:37.068
more little requirement. One thing that's not allowed is for A and B to both be

00:00:37.068 --> 00:00:42.137
equal to 0. If that was the case of course, this term would be 0. And this term

00:00:42.137 --> 00:00:46.027
would be 0 as well. So we would just end up with the equation 0 plus 0 equals 0

00:00:46.027 --> 00:00:50.122
which maybe true but isn't a linear equation because there are no variables in

00:00:50.122 --> 00:00:54.031
it. What the general form does then, is basically shift everything on the

00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:57.874
variable to one set of the equation and shift all the constant terms to the

00:00:57.874 --> 00:01:02.095
other side of the equation and then of course combine whatever constant you have

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:06.466
into one number. So let's play around with this. Since the coefficient in form

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:10.706
of y doesn't have to be 1, it can be some other constant in general form. Let's

00:01:10.706 --> 00:01:14.695
get rid of these fraction. What I'd like you to do then is to multiply both

00:01:14.695 --> 00:01:18.849
sides of these equation by some number so that there are no more fractional

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:23.484
coefficients or constant terms. Try however, to make this number you multiply

00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:27.516
both sides by the smallest number that you could use to get rid of the

00:01:27.516 --> 00:01:28.250
fractions.
