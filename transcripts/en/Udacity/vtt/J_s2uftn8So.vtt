00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.360
Now that you've jogged your memory a bit about these three types of models,

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.230
let's talk about some specific examples that fit each of them. We're going to

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.450
look at a pretty wide variety of topics. Population growth, carbon dating, and

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.250
sound. Now earlier on in the course, we did talk about population growth, but

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.744
we did this with pandas. Now we're going to do it with humans. Now there's

00:00:21.744 --> 00:00:26.080
pretty great data out there about how many people there are in the world. And

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.170
we're going to check this out all the way from 1800 up through 2011. Let's take

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.410
a look at some numbers. So here's a chart showing how the world population has

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.078
changed in those 200 plus years. In 1800 there were only 1 billion people. And

00:00:42.078 --> 00:00:46.680
by 2011 there were 7 billion. Let's take a look at what this looks like on a

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.440
graph. Looking at how this data is plotted, what kind of model do you think

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.320
that this fits best? Does this look like exponential growth? Does it look like

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.630
exponential decay? Or does it look like logarithmic growth?
