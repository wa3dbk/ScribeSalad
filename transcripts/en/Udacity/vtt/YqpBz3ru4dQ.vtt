00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.106
If your intuition tells you that
the incremental approach of

00:00:03.106 --> 00:00:06.720
the Ford-Fulkerson method produces
a maximum flow, that's a good thing.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.580
Your intuition is correct.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.300
But it's important that it be
correct for the right reasons.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.710
Not all incremental approaches work.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.240
Often in optimization, we get stuck
in local minima or local maxima.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.410
We need to argue either that
we never make a mistake,

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.850
the analysis of greedy algorithms
typically have this feel.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.530
Or we need to be able to argue
that the rules for incrementing

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.350
allows us to undo any mistakes
that we have made along the way.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.980
The latter will be the case for
maximum flow.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.840
The argument we'll make is complex,
and will require us to introduce a new

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.200
notion of a minimum
cutograph along the way.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.900
But in the end it's rewarding, and

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.730
provides an example of how to
find elegance in analysis.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.600
To show that Ford-Fulkerson returns
a maximum flow, we're going to introduce

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.420
the concept of a cut, and then relate
the capacity of a cut to a flow.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.290
Here's a picture of our understanding so
far.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.980
We know that the network will have some
possible non-negative flow values, but

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.080
it's not exactly clear how
high this range goes, or

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.720
where the results of
Ford-Fulkerson fit in.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.630
One observation is that the flow
value can't exceed the capacity of

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.950
edges coming out of the source.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.267
Remember that the flow is defined to be
the sum of the flows over these edges.

00:01:19.267 --> 00:01:23.850
Separating S from T in this way
constitutes a cut in the graph which,

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.690
as we'll see, is an upper bound
on the value of any flow.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.590
It's possible that there will
be smaller cuts as well,

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.400
which will shrink the range of
possible flow values for us.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.440
Even better, however, we'll see that
the flow produced by Ford- Fulkerson

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.430
has the same value as the cut.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.340
And since this cut serves as an upper
bound on all possible flows,

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.590
this flow must be a maximum.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.970
That's where this argument will end up.
