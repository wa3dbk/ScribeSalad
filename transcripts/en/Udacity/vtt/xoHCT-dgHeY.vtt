&gt;&gt; And in coming up to this answer David used some background knowledge.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.190
The background knowledge that he used was that the bricks that were

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.160
in the vertical position in the first example, and the cylinders that were in

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.600
the vertical position in the third example, and the special blocks that are in

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.680
the vertical position in this example. Are all examples of something called

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.720
a block. They can be replaced by each other. So instead of having a brick,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.660
one could have a cylinder, or some other thing that's vertically placed here.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.810
Now, someone else in the class may have a different background knowledge, and

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.120
he or she may not consider this to be an example of a block, in which

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.390
case the answer might be no. The point here being that background knowledge is

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.000
playing an important role in deciding whether or not this is an example of foo.
