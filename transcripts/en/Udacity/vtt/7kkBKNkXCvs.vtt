00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.602
Before we go into more depth about rational expressions, let's recall our

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:08.393
knowledge about fractions. A fraction is a rational number or a ratio of two

00:00:08.393 --> 00:00:13.049
integers. In this case, we have the ratio of five to eight or five eighths. A

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.990
student showed the following work when trying to simplify five eighths. Do you

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.898
think this work is correct, and why? Choose yes or no and then check off either

00:00:21.898 --> 00:00:24.174
reasons that support your answer.
