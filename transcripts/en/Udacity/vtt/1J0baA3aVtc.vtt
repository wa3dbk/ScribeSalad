Hey, Ian, so it's not a big deal, but

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.590
you know how we want Sunshine to
just be the best it can be and

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.560
we've been working really hard to
personalize it and polish it up?

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.760
The thing is, it just doesn't
really make me feel amazing.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.297
&gt;&gt; I don't know, when I get a weather
notification from Sunshine,

00:00:16.297 --> 00:00:20.240
it really makes me feel like Sunshine's
helping me see into the future.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.791
Right, but that's not really taking it
far enough because think of it with like

00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:24.590
notifications.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.095
Sometimes, a daily notification
isn't really enough, but

00:00:27.095 --> 00:00:30.437
then other times you've just have this
same sunny, gorgeous weather every day.

00:00:30.437 --> 00:00:31.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah, good times.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.304
&gt;&gt; Right, so I was talking to Dan,

00:00:33.304 --> 00:00:36.428
and I have some changes that I want to
make that I think will be really useful.

00:00:36.428 --> 00:00:41.745
Something that's a little more now,
and a little less into the future.

00:00:41.745 --> 00:00:43.417
&gt;&gt; Okay, you do that.

00:00:43.417 --> 00:00:47.326
Dan wanted to show me this crazy
redesign of Sunshine he's working on, so

00:00:47.326 --> 00:00:50.312
I'm going to go down there now,
and then go enjoy the sun.

00:00:50.312 --> 00:00:52.004
