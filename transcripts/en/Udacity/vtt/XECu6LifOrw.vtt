Stormborn has a question.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
"Before enrolling here, my only experience with a programming language

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
was a bit of JavaScript.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In JavaScript there are a lot of brackets and semicolons to mark the end of statements,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but there seems to be none of that in Python.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I was just wondering how Python knows that you are done defining your procedure

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and that it should carry on with the rest of the program.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Is it all about the indentation?"

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Thanks for the question, Stormborn.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We notice in Python that the white space actually matters.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
This is different from many languages.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Those of you who have programmed in other languages like Java or JavaScript or C

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
know that you have to have lots of syntax to tell the compiler where statements end

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and where blocks end and begin--

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
where you have semicolons and you have squiggly brackets and you have other things

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
in your code that are really there just to help the compiler know where things begin and end.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
In Python, white space is used for that.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The new lines matter. The indenting matters.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The Python interpreter knows when a block ends based on where the indenting is.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
That's really nice in the sense that it makes it easy to read your code.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
You don't have to worry about adding brackets and things.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
If you look at someone else's code or you look at your own code,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
the structure of the code tells you what the code means,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
because it has to have the same indenting structure as the blocks that are interpreted

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
by the Python interpreter.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
This sometimes causes problems, and this is why many languages

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
don't pay any attention to white space.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
If you copy code between different editors or you change things that change the white space,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
in Python that changes the meaning of your code.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You have to be careful that you don't change the indenting

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
or don't change where the new line breaks are and things like that,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
because in Python that can actually change the meaning of your code.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
It is a handy way of making it clear to the interpreter

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
as well as to a human reading the code--the structure of the code--

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and it saves having to need any extra syntax like squiggly braces or semicolons to do that.
