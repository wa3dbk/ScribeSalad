00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.080
So, the brain is generally
what we're talking about and

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.070
here you have a picture,
the overall view of the human brain.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.600
A friend of mine, Jeremy Wolf, always
said make sure you draw in the nose.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.810
So, okay, so your nose is over there,
your eyeballs here and then there

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.030
are all these various structures,
the cerebellum in the back here.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.090
Behind your head is where a lot of rapid
motor control kinds of things take

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.970
effect, bunch a whole bunch of
structures, all of this crinkly stuff up

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.160
here is the cortex and we'll talk
about that a little bit later.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.600
By the way these little things sticking
out right here called the olfactory

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.630
bulbs, those are the things that
actually go into your nasal cavity that

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.090
does sense of smell, that's actually
a part of your brain that sticks out

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.200
into your into your nose.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.270
And another part of your brain that
sticks out is actually your retina and

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.240
we'll talk about that in a minute.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.720
The parts of the brain I want to talk
about today are, its, this lesson and

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.620
next, of course, are the parts that are
involved with the human vision system.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.180
And those are poorly drawn
here on this schematic.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.765
It's just ugly, but
it's actually much clearer.

00:01:01.765 --> 00:01:04.319
So, again, here we your two eyes.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.190
Okay, okay now your nose is up here.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.058
And, you notice that out, coming out of
each eye is what's referred to as the,

00:01:10.058 --> 00:01:14.060
an optic nerve, and
they sort of cross in this funny way

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.330
at what's referred to as the apt,
the optic chiasm.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.360
They then make, a, a way stop.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.620
They make a stop here, down in here in,
lateral geniculate and

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.370
then the lateral ge, which we'll talk
about, and the lateral geniculate

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.778
has projections up into something
called the superior colliculus.

00:01:31.778 --> 00:01:36.400
And the, most of it, a lot of it goes
to what's called the visual cortex,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.040
and we're going to talk about that.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.400
By the way, we describe these things as
if it's a flow of information going up.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.150
And that's partially because as
computationalists, we like to say, well,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.680
first we do some low-level processing
at the, at the, the detectors and

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.275
the retina and then it goes up to
these weigh stations where various

00:01:53.275 --> 00:01:56.255
kinds of things happen, and
then up for higher level processing.

00:01:56.255 --> 00:02:02.725
The reality is somewhere between 80 and
95% of the projections into,

00:02:02.725 --> 00:02:06.945
for example, the lateral geniculate,
are actually from the cortex back down.

00:02:06.945 --> 00:02:08.565
So the engineers amongst you will say,
oh,

00:02:08.565 --> 00:02:10.574
that's gotta be feedback of some sort.

00:02:10.574 --> 00:02:12.075
Well indeed it probably is,

00:02:12.075 --> 00:02:16.390
and it's still stuff that we're
just slowly getting a handle on.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.090
So take what I'm about to
say with a grain of salt.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.290
In fact, well, take everything I
ever say with a grain of salt.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.140
But in particular,
I'm only going to give you

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.320
a relatively simplistic view of
what's going on in the vision system.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.620
It's also a slightly dated
view because while I'm

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.990
try to be pretty current about
certain computer vision things,

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.310
there's a massive, massive field of
neurophysiology and human vision.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.140
So I'm just going to give you some
of the highlights and it'll give you

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.970
a general overview and I encourage you
to, to read more as we go forward.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.710
One thing to say also before we continue
forward is sort of the anatomy and

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.340
physiology of the brain really reflect
the computational complexity of vision.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.460
So to give you an example, you have
auditory nerves that come from your,

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.505
cochlea that go into your brain and
those nerves, there's two of them,

00:03:04.505 --> 00:03:10.005
one for each ear, and those nerves have
somewhere around 30,000 nerve fibers in,

00:03:10.005 --> 00:03:12.125
in that bundle, okay?

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:17.315
The optic nerve, each one coming out
of here, that has somewhere around

00:03:17.315 --> 00:03:23.745
a million fibers, okay, 30,000 for
hearing, a million for vision from each.

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:26.680
Likewise, and
we'll talk more about this later.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.940
We are going to talk about the visual
cortex, this area back here.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.229
So far, and that you can,
again, you know, plus or minus,

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:37.805
somewhere around 30% of your cortex,
right?

00:03:37.805 --> 00:03:40.330
The cortex being the most recent
part of the brain in terms

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.900
evolutionary structures.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.050
We think of it as being
sort of the human helmet.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.990
Somewhere around 30% of the visual,

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.360
of the cortex is seen to have something
to do with vision, as opposed to,

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.310
say, 3% for hearing and 8% for
all somatic sensory touch.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.170
So, again, the complexity of vision is
not only showing up when you look at

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.390
your problem sets and how, and you say,
how could this possibly work, but

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.290
it is also reflected in the detail
structure of the human anatomy.
