I only need 2 numbers. For example to talk about this point I would indicate how

00:00:06.171 --> 00:00:11.739
far it is along the x axis and then how far along it is on the y axis. I would

00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:17.590
move 2 units to the right and then 4 units up. So this point would be 2, 4. I

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.408
went 2 in the horizontal direction and then 4 in the vertical direction.
