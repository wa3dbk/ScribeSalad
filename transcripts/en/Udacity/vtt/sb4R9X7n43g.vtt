00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.770
So how should you go about thinking about implementing generalization.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.780
You certainly want to be able to take advantage of whatever inheritance feature

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.920
is in your programming language. You just need to stick to certain rules.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.280
Typically, this means that in children classes, you can add features, but

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.950
you don't want to take away features. And you want to really restrict how you do

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:29.110
any kind of overriding, in the child class. When you do want to override

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.350
a method in the child class, make sure that you obey the two following rules.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.810
First of all, when calling that particular method, you want to make sure that

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.350
the child method can accept any arguments that the parents method could accept.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.690
That is, the child has to be as open to inputs as the parent does.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.030
Secondly, the output produced by the child method,

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.920
when given the same arguments that were given to the parent method should

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.910
produce the same result. What we're saying with both these rules is that for

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.750
the same situation in the parent, the child needs to do the same thing.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.870
It needs to be, a special case. Now the child can do more.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.330
If the child is handling a special case of the parent it,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.230
it can deal with that particular special case. It just has to always,

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.520
act as if it is, it is also obeying whatever rules it specified for the parent.
