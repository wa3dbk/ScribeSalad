For the second practice problem, let's try the absolute value of 3 x plus 2 is

00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:11.366
greater than or equal to 5. You can put your answers here and here. I've already

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:16.962
put the union symbol for you. Remember, if you want to type in infinity, you

00:00:16.974 --> 00:00:19.926
have to type in backslash inf. Good luck.
