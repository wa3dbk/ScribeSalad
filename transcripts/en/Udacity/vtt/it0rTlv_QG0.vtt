00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.380
Let us look at the solution for
our reliability and availability quiz.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.440
We had the hard disk that had
three working periods and

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.120
three broken periods
until we threw it away.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.570
The mean time to failure is how long
it works on average before it breaks.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.270
We had it working for 12 and
then four and then 14 months.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.370
So on average,
it worked 12 + 4 + 14 months,

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.009
divided by 3,
because there were 3 figures in between.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.350
And this gives us 30/3 which is 10,
so the answer here is 10 months.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.710
For our mean time to repair,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.670
it's how long does it take to
repair it after a failure?

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.700
And we had a one month, a two month and
the three month repair period.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.700
So our MTTR is simply 1
+ 2 + 3 over 3 because

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.810
we need the average of these three
which ends up being two months.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.140
And finally the availability
is what percentage of time

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.500
was this disk in service
over the entire period.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.260
We can compute this in two ways.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.930
One is what's the main time to failure

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.650
divided by main time
to failure plus MTTR.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.400
Which gives us ten months of service
on average over ten plus two

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.030
months of both service and repair.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.180
This is ten over 12 or 83.33%.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.170
Another way to compute availability
is to add up all the months that we

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.980
were in service and divide them by
the sum of all the months together.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:46.960
In that case, we will get 30 months of
service divided by those same 30 months

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.730
plus the six months of repair,
which is 30 over 36.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.592
And this again gives us
our 83.33% availability.
