00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:00.940
Induction and

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.080
deduction are critical topics to
understand in machine learning.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.962
So let's pause for a moment and go over
them in more detail with a segment from

00:00:06.962 --> 00:00:09.700
Ashok's and
my Artificial Intelligence course.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.500
Note especially, that machine
learning is largely about induction.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.800
&gt;&gt; Let us look at
abduction more closely.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.340
To understand the similarities and

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.852
difference between deduction,
abduction and induction,

00:00:20.852 --> 00:00:24.810
let us look at the relationship
between a rule, cause and effect.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.170
Let's consider a simple rule
like if it is cloudy, it rains.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.663
So it is cloudy is the cause,
it rains is the effect.

00:00:33.663 --> 00:00:36.519
If it is cloudy,
then it rains is the rule.

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:40.310
&gt;&gt; Other example of a rule would
be the rule that Bob hates Joe.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.860
So Bob hates Joe, so
whenever Joe walks in, Bob Leaves.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.670
The cause is Joe walking in,
the effect is Bob leaving, and

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.770
the rule is Bob hates Joe.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.700
&gt;&gt; You've already come across yet
another instance of this particular

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.260
arrangement when we were
talking about flu and fever.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.330
So the rule might be,
if flu, then fever.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.256
Flu is the cause, fever is the effect.

00:01:00.256 --> 00:01:06.010
Now in deduction, in one fundamental
kind of inference we know the rule and

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.990
the cause and
we need to deduce the effect.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.030
So given the rule if it is cloudy,
then it rains and

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.670
given the cause it is cloudy
we can deduce that it rains.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.400
&gt;&gt; Similarly,
in our rule that Bob hates Joe,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.690
we can say that if Joe just walked in,
we can deduce that Bob will leave.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.670
&gt;&gt; Or if the rule is,
if flu, then fever, and

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.070
we know that Ashck has flu,
then we can deduce that Ashok has fever.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.220
This is simply an instance
of modus ponens and

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.790
we discussed this in detail when
we were talking about logic.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.220
Now let us look at induction.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.870
Given a relationship between a cause and
an effect, we can try to induce a rule.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.490
For example, if we observe repeatedly
that when it is cloudy, it rains.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.950
It may be induce a rule.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.120
If it is cloudy, then it rains.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.270
&gt;&gt; Same thing with Bob and Joe.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.980
If we observe repeatedly that
every time Joe arrives Bob leaves,

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.130
we can induce a rule
that Bob must hate Joe.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.660
&gt;&gt; If every time a patient
goes to a doctor with flu and

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.530
a patient has fever, then we can
induce a rule, if flu, then fever.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.270
In case of abduction, given a rule and
an effect, we can abduce a cause.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.570
As an example, given the rule,
if it is cloudy, then it rains, and

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.430
the effect that it is raining,
we can ask ourselves, is it cloudy?

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.187
&gt;&gt; And once again with Bob and Joe,
given our rule that Bob hates Joe and

00:02:28.187 --> 00:02:31.825
given that we just arrived at a party
and we see that Joe is here but not Bob,

00:02:31.825 --> 00:02:35.470
we might be able to abduce that
Bob left when Joe arrived.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.219
&gt;&gt; Or given the rule, if flu then fever
and the fact that Ashok has fever,

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:43.292
we might be able to abduce
that Ashok has flu.

00:02:43.292 --> 00:02:46.650
First of all,
notice that we are back to diagnosis.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.660
Diagnosis as an instance of abduction.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.740
But notice several other properties.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.150
First, deduction is truth preserving.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.830
If the rule is true, and

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.040
a cause is true, we can always guarantee
that the effect is true as well.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.870
Induction and
abduction are not truth preserving.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.320
You may know something about the
relations between cause and effect for

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.150
some sample, that does not mean that
the same relationship holds for

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.190
the entire population.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.956
Induction does not always guarantee
correctness, same for abduction.

00:03:17.956 --> 00:03:20.055
We may know the rule and the effect and

00:03:20.055 --> 00:03:24.336
we may suppose that the cause is true
but that need not necessarily be true.

00:03:24.336 --> 00:03:28.377
It may be the case, if flu,
then fever and Ashok may have fever But

00:03:28.377 --> 00:03:31.760
that does not necessarily
mean that Ashok has flu.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.230
Fever can be caused by many,
many things.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.960
The reason that fever does not
necessarily mean that Ashok has flu is

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.770
because there can be multiple causes for
the same effect, multiple hypothesis for

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:44.380
the same data.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.830
This is exactly the problem
that we had encountered earlier

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.410
when we were talking about
what makes diagnosis hard.

00:03:52.648 --> 00:03:55.030
We said that deduction, induction, and

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.460
abduction are three of
the fundamental forms of inference.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.430
We can of course also
combine these inferences.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.140
Science is a good example.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.818
You and I are scientists,
observe some data about the world.

00:04:05.818 --> 00:04:09.820
Then we abduce some explanation for it.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.300
Having abduced that explanation for
it, we induce a rule.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:22.084
Having induced a rule, now we can use
deduction to predict new data elements.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.230
We go and observe some more.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.650
Again, we abduce, induce,
deduce and we continue the cycle.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.166
Might the cycle also explain
significant part of cognition.

00:04:35.166 --> 00:04:41.883
Is this what you and I do on a daily
basis, abduce, induce, deduce?

00:04:41.883 --> 00:04:42.763
&gt;&gt; In machine learning,

00:04:42.763 --> 00:04:45.310
what we're largely interested
in doing is induction.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.900
Taking some data in which we speculate
cause and effect relationship exist and

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.380
inducing a rule.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.811
The rule actually need to be causal,

00:04:51.811 --> 00:04:54.090
it's a right of the rule's
about correlation.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.010
The important thing is inducing a rule
that will allow us to make sense of data

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.270
in the future.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.980
That rule can then be applied
deductively or abductively.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:01.970
In trading, for example,

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.880
we might apply that rule deductively
to protect what stocks will gain value.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.870
Or abductively to decide where
insider trading has already occurred.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.458
So now that you have
a good grasp of induction,

00:05:11.458 --> 00:05:12.860
let's get back to Charles and Michael.
