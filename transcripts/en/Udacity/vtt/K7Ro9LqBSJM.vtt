00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.699
And as we said before, and that's where the name inverse halt comes from,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.066
inverse halt more or less does the opposite of what halt says the original program will do.

00:00:09.067 --> 00:00:15.399
So if halt says that P1, when run on P1, says yes, then inverse halt will go into an infinite loop,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.232
and vice versa for P2, where halt says that it will not terminate when run on itself.

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:22.900
Inverse halt will actually terminate.
