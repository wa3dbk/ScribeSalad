00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.460
So let's look at each one of these items individually, starting from

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.260
the first one. And here this item has to do with how

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.250
the machine stores the information and

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.240
how the corresponding algorithm is written.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.920
But it has no bearing in the real world. That is, in

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.720
the application domain. Therefore this. Definitely

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.200
belongs to the machine domain, and

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.610
we're going to put a one here. What about a notification of

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.980
the arrival of a message on a smart watch? This is an

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.170
event that is generated within the machine, but it has an effect,

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.480
an observable effect, in this case, in the real world as well.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.780
Therefore, we're going to mark this as three. So this is an

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.460
event. This is something that belongs

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.160
to the intersection between the application

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.480
domain and the machine domain. So it's something that could be in

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.730
the specification. Now what about an employee that wants to organize a

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.850
meeting with a set of colleagues? This is an event that belongs

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.460
to the application domain because it is a fact that it's true

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.290
that exists. In the real world independently from the existence of a machine.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.380
Therefore, we're going to mark this as two.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.890
Finally, the event of a user clicking on a

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.950
link on a web page is an event that occurs in the real world but that has an

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.932
effect also within the machine and, therefore, we're

00:01:01.932 --> 00:01:04.920
going to mark this as three, something that happens

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.730
at the intersection. between these two domains, and once

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.060
more, something that could be in a specification.
