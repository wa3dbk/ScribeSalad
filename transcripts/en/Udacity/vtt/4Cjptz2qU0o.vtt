This condition is evaluated 4 times. This condition is evaluated 4 times. First

00:00:13.593 --> 00:00:23.374
it's evaluated when i is 1. Then we add two to i. So it's evaluated again when

00:00:23.374 --> 00:00:33.281
i is three. And when i is five. And then, one more time, when i is 7. At which

00:00:33.281 --> 00:00:37.329
point, the condition no longer holds and so it skips the rest of the loop.
