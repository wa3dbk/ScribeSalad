00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.390
So, let's talk about the fabrication yield, which is,

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.110
what is the percentage of chips at the end

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.228
that we get to sell. So, the yield is

00:00:10.228 --> 00:00:13.000
the number of working chips we get at the end

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.772
divided by the total number of chips that we

00:00:15.772 --> 00:00:20.090
actually had on our wafer. We will see that the

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.316
size of the chip affects the yield. So, it

00:00:23.316 --> 00:00:25.756
is not only that we get fewer chips when they're

00:00:25.756 --> 00:00:28.074
big but also that a smaller percentage of them

00:00:28.074 --> 00:00:31.365
work. So, let's say this is our wafer. And

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:34.140
the wafer, typically, has a few spots on it

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.321
that we call defects. It is either because the silicon

00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:41.022
was impure to begin with or because there was

00:00:41.022 --> 00:00:44.161
something wrong with the process at that place so,

00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:46.935
in the end, once we get the manufacture wafer

00:00:46.935 --> 00:00:50.877
pretty much through a given manufacture process, there will be

00:00:50.877 --> 00:00:54.128
some number of expected defects per wafer. So,

00:00:54.128 --> 00:00:56.740
let's say this wafer has two defects. let's

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:03.070
say that we divide this wafer into a lot of small chips. So, note that some

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.170
of the chips are not really complete, because

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.940
of the wafer roundness. We can only use

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:16.560
the complete ones. So, this is a good chip. So, we got 62 working chips, and

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.526
2 bad chips. So, our yield, is 62 out of 64, which

00:01:23.526 --> 00:01:29.557
is about 97%. Now, let's start with the same wafer and the same defects, but now

00:01:29.557 --> 00:01:35.370
let's have much larger chips. Now we have six working and two bad

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.644
chips. So, our yield is only 75%. So, not only did we get fewer chips

00:01:41.644 --> 00:01:46.590
out of our expensive wafer, we also get a fewer percentage of them working.
