00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Grid networks are also very important.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
They represent the connectivity pattern you have

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
if you lay out a bunch of things as a grid

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and connect them up, each one to their neighbor

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
sort of street-wise if this was a grid-based city.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Here's a particular example of a grid network

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
with 20 nodes--1, 2, 3, 4 times 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and 31 edges if I counted correctly.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
In particular, there are three edges to go across,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 rows like that,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
so that's 15, and there's 4 edges going down,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and there are 1, 2, 3, 4 rows like that

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
for 16 for a total of 31.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So just to make sure that you understand how to do this,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
imagine we have 256 nodes arranged in a square,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and we connect up the nodes with edges in a grid pattern

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
just like this one here.

00:00:47.000 --> 09:59:59.000
How many total edges do we have in the graph?
