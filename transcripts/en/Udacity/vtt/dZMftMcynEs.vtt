00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.890
The solutions here are 3 plus or minus root 10, all divided by 2. Great work,

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.290
using that square root method, if you got this one correct. We start solving

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.330
this equation by adding 10 to both sides. This leaves us with the square

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.630
isolated on the left and positive 10 on the right. Now that we have something

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.815
squared alone, we can take the square root of both sides. This means we will

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:26.986
have 2x minus 3 on the left. And plus or minus root 10 on the right. We add 3

00:00:26.986 --> 00:00:32.940
to both sides to get 2x by itself and then divide both sides by positive 2.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.266
This leaves us with 1 x in our answer. And again if you really wanted to, you

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:42.556
could split this up into two separate fractions, 3 halves plus or minus root 10

00:00:42.556 --> 00:00:46.240
divided by 2. Either form is the same.
