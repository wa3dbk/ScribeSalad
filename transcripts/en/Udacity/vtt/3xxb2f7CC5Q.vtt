00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.090
&gt;&gt; And that's the point. The point being that often,

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.610
the new problem is not identical to the old problem. And

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.159
when it's not identical, then we have to do some reasoning. We can not just

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:37.345
retrieve something from memory, and use the same solution that was used earlier.

00:00:37.345 --> 00:00:41.368
Case-based reasoning, the phrase case-based reasoning, has two parts to it,

00:00:41.368 --> 00:00:45.310
case-based, and reasoning. So far we have looked at the case-based part,

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.690
where we can just extract something from memory and reuse it.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.200
Now we can look at the reasoning part. Once you have extracted something off

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.320
memory, how can you reason about it, and adapt it, but for the new problem?
