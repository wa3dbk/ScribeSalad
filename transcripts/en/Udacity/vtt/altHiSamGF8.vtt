00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.250
I've mentioned the FragmentManager, 
FragmentTransactions

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.900
in the back stack 
a few times.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.650
Now, take a look
at the documentation

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.500
on the Android developer site, 
and complete the code,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.170
which will replace the contents
of the fragment_container

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.400
with a new instance of the 
Details Fragment.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.810
Keep in mind that this transaction 
should allow the user

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.460
to reverse the transaction 
using the Back button.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.570
And in this case, 
we'll be calling this code

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.000
from within an activity.
