00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's ask you a different question--suppose we're on the fields and we learn how to throw ball.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
On average, we're able to throw it 30 m, but because there's randomness in the ball,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
we have a standard deviation of 5 m.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And now we trained, we improved our performance by 10%.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We didn't just step forward by 2 more meters before we throw

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and that gives us an additional improvement of 2 m.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
For Gaussian outcome like this, how does it affect all µ' and σ'

00:00:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
after both of these improvements are materialized.
