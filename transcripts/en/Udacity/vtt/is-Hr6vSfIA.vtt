Since this is a vertical line, we know that its equation is going to be x equals

00:00:01.932 --> 00:00:03.927
some constant, since every point along this line has the same x-value. Since

00:00:03.927 --> 00:00:05.817
this line goes through the vertex, which has an x value of negative 5 halves,

00:00:05.817 --> 00:00:08.167
the equation this line[INAUDIBLE] must be x equals negative 5 halves. Since this

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:12.199
line goes through the vertex, which has an x-value of negative 5 halves, the

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:16.152
equation in this line must be x equals negative 5 halves. I like to keep this

00:00:16.152 --> 00:00:19.887
idea of the symmetry of parabolas in mind as we move forward. You probably

00:00:19.887 --> 00:00:24.464
already noticed on your own anyway, just from looking at all of our graphs. But

00:00:24.464 --> 00:00:28.304
think about why a parabola would end up with this kind of shape, because of the

00:00:28.304 --> 00:00:31.981
way its equation is written. In particular, think about the fact that the

00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:35.934
expression involving x is of degree 2, and how squaring something might create a

00:00:35.934 --> 00:00:37.718
symmetric pattern just like this.
