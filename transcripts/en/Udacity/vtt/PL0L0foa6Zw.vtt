00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.940
Now suppose Bob wants to
access the printer HP1.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.850
That is, Bob wants to send
a print job to the printer HP1.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.360
His local host sends a ticket
granting service request to the KDC.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.920
The request contains the ticket
granting ticket and a authenticator.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.820
Which is the current
time stamp encrypted.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.360
Using Bob's per day session key, SB.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.650
When the KDC gets the request,
it can decrypt the TGT.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.530
And it knows that it is a valid TGT.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.780
Because only the KDC has the key
to properly encrypt the ID of Bob

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.600
contained in the TGT.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.490
It then uses the key,

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.920
SB, contained in the TGT to verify
the authenticator by decrypting it.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.450
And checking the time stamp is current.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.590
This proves that the sender is Bob,
because only Bob has the key SB.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.272
That can encrypt the current
time stamp properly.

00:00:54.272 --> 00:00:58.690
The KDC then generates a ticket for
Bob to communicate with the printer.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.220
This ticket contains
a session key KBP and

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.250
Bob's ID and its encrypted
using the printer's master key.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.290
Note that a network device such
as a printer has a long and

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.920
random master key configured in.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.475
And it's typically hard to guess or
crack.

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:20.610
Therefore, the tickets for these devices
are encrypted using their master keys.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.040
The KDC sends a ticket granting
service response to Bob's local host.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.700
It contains a session key KBP.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.100
The ID of Bob and
the ticket to the printer and

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.650
it is encrypted using
Bob's private key Sb.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.690
Therefore, only Bob's local
station can decrypt this, and

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.290
verify that it is from the KDC.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.450
Because only the KDC can decrypt the ID
of Bob correctly with the key SP.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:53.190
Because the key sp is embedded in TGT
and only the KDC can decrypt the TGT.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.210
Then Bob's local host can
authenticate itself to the printer.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.230
It can send a message to
the printer containing the ticket.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.800
The authentication request contains
the ticket and an authenticator.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.380
The authenticator is the server text
of the current timestamp encrypted.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.560
Using a share key between Bob's
local host and the printer.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.310
When the printer gets the ticket,

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.260
it can decrypt the ticket using his
master key shared with the KDC.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.610
Because the ticket was
created by the KDC.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.540
And it was encrypted using the share
key between the printer and the KDC.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.590
That is,
the printer can verify that the KBP

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.350
was created by the KDC,
to communicate with Bob's Local Host.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.860
The print server can then use KBP

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.310
to verify the authenticator by
decrypting the server text and

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.780
verifying that the result matches
with the current time stamp.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.330
It then sends a response to
authenticate itself by say,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.060
adding one to the current timestamp and
encrypt it.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.840
Using the share key between
Bob's Local Host and the printer.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.910
And after this, authentication steps,

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.140
then Bob's Local Host can send
a print drop to the printer.
