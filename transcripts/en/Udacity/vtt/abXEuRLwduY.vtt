00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.150
The first app I ever made was for
a bar crawl, for

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.780
a birthday party with a friend.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.200
It was 2009, it was still just
really cool to see your own name in

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.840
a smart phone.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.760
So it had a little picker view inside
it, when you shook the phone the picker

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.530
view would cycle through everybody who
was there and kind of randomly stop.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.926
And I put a little button int he corner,
so

00:00:19.926 --> 00:00:23.920
that you could put your
thumb over it and shake it,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.380
if you're holding it right then it
will come up with the birthday boy.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.402
Whoever's name came up had to drink,
so in the end we could set em up,

00:00:31.402 --> 00:00:32.100
it was good fun.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.170
&gt;&gt; The first app I ever built,
well I actually started before there

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.850
was an SDK, so in 2007 when
the iPhone came out there was

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.110
a pretty good jail break community, and
we were sort of swizzling all the API's.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.720
And I had been an audio developer on
OS10 for years, so I ported one of my

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.090
commercial apps to iOS and it was
just super exciting because this was

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.150
basically a full desktop operating
system on a mobile device.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.380
So the first app was called Idrum,
and we actually did 23 of them

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.330
with different music artists, and
what not and it was really exciting.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.180
We had two of them available
the day the app store opened,

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.920
because we had a pretty
good running start so.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.690
&gt;&gt; The first app that I built
was called ATOM and it stood for

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.400
the Alpha Tau Omega Mobile application
I built for my fraternity in college,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.440
and as fraternity brothers we were
looking for a way to communicate and

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.560
broadcast messages privately in
a way that was kind of like Twitter.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.390
So that's what we did instead of carrier
pigeon, or email or anything like that.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.330
We used this atom map to communicate.
