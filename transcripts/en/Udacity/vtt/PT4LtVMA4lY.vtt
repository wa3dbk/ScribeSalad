00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.410
To make the audio play slowly, I accessed Help and searched for AVAudioPlayer.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.360
Now I read through this and came across a property called Rate.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.970
Now this variable or property is really interesting.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.720
Because it says that its default value of 1.0 provides a normal playback rate.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.381
All right?

00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:21.825
And that the available range for this, is from 0.5 or

00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:26.590
half speed playback, through 2.0 for double-speed playback.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.340
All of this is really promising.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.000
It goes on to say that you must first enable something called,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.170
the Enable Rate Property.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.770
So I can go back to my code, and set the Enable Rate Property to be true.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.390
And then in my action, I can set the rate to let's say 0.5 for now.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.283
Okay, let me run this project again.

00:00:47.283 --> 00:00:50.293
I'm going to go to the second scene one more time, and

00:00:50.293 --> 00:00:52.193
then let's click this button.

00:00:52.193 --> 00:01:01.799
&gt;&gt; My mama always said, life was like a box of chocolates.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.090
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:09.825
Now just for kicks, I wonder what would happen if I changed this rate to 1.5.

00:01:09.825 --> 00:01:11.188
Let me try that.

00:01:11.188 --> 00:01:15.102
All right going to the second scene again.

00:01:15.102 --> 00:01:19.310
&gt;&gt; My mama always said, life was like a box of chocolates.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.920
&gt;&gt; So it seems like rate is working well.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.000
For now, I'm going to go back and

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.980
change the rate back to 0.5 and oh, by the way,

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.400
it's a good practice to stop the audio player before we begin to play it.
