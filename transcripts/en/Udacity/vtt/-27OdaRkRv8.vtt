00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.180
In this lesson we are going to do an example of a refinement.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.590
We will start with a very simple bank account application that allows deposits,

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.590
withdrawals, and queries about the current balance.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.780
Here are some possible requirements.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.070
The user can make a deposit of any positive number of dollars.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.830
The user may make a withdrawal of any positive number of dollars so

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.340
long as at least that number of dollars is currently held in the account.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.760
Their user may request the current value of the bank balance, which is defined

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.940
as the net value of all the deposits made minus the sum of all the withdrawals.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.660
And initially the bank account is empty.
