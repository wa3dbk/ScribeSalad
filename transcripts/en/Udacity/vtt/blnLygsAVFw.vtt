00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.983
I'll just create a couple.

00:00:05.326 --> 00:00:09.160
And it's going to shake the phone.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.138
Do the shake gesture.

00:00:10.138 --> 00:00:13.760
A little weird.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.050
This time the spiders did
flee from the screen, but

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:21.340
instead of spreading out radially from
the center, they crossed over the middle

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.740
to exit off the screen, and
that's not how it should work.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.460
They should be spreading out
radially from the center.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.180
Let's look at that again.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.564
We'll create some more spiders.

00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:33.510
Woah, okay.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.080
It looks like we have another problem.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.550
Maybe the bugs aren't being deleted, but
we'll look at that in just a second.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:49.010
Let's shake it again, and
that's the same problem.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.670
So this is probably related
to the disperse animation.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.170
Let's go ahead and take a look.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.540
So I'll stop at this point,
just need to stop for a second.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.540
So here's the disperse bugs animation,
and

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.120
we can see that we're setting
the off screen position.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.010
And whatever this off-screen position is
being set to, that's what we're trying

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.790
to update the bug frame to is
this new off-screen position.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.531
It's causing the bugs to cross
over the middle of the web.

00:01:15.531 --> 00:01:20.106
So right now we're taking the bugs
center coordinate to calculate this off

00:01:20.106 --> 00:01:24.536
screen position, we're taking the bug
center coordinate, the X, and

00:01:24.536 --> 00:01:28.384
we're subtracting it from the view
center coordinate for X and

00:01:28.384 --> 00:01:33.050
we're multiplying it by -20, and
we're doing the same thing for the Y.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.501
We're taking the bug.center.y,
and then the view.center,

00:01:38.501 --> 00:01:42.870
it's y, and
we're also multiplying it by -20.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.098
So let's try this calculation by hand
and see what it really looks like.

00:01:47.098 --> 00:01:51.498
So let's say that we have this
fictitious view in spider and

00:01:51.498 --> 00:01:55.549
that the spider's enter,
it's X, is maybe 180.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.080
And let's say view centers,
it's X is maybe 150.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.229
And if we subtract these two
values we get positive 30.

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.070
And if we multiply that by
negative 20 we get negative 600.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.600
And with a new center
value of negative 600,

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.670
this would cause the spider to move all
the way from it's position to where it

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.920
currently is across the center to some
point all the way over here on the left.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.320
So think that's our problem.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.890
Instead, I think if we multiply maybe
by a positive value, we can move

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.330
to the right, away from the center
instead of left, across the center.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.390
So let's go back to the code now and
fix this.

00:02:30.515 --> 00:02:34.765
So I'll change these to positive 20's,
and once we build and run again,

00:02:38.655 --> 00:02:43.042
create a bunch of spiders,
and simulate shaking device.

00:02:43.042 --> 00:02:43.842
And nice, there we go.

00:02:43.842 --> 00:02:48.302
All the spiders are now running away
in a radial pattern like we wanted.

00:02:48.302 --> 00:02:50.722
Now there's one last bug
which I think you noticed,

00:02:50.722 --> 00:02:55.620
it's maybe more of a lack of
implementation instead of a bug.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.210
But when we tried shaking the bugs and
then created some more,

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.980
we noticed all these bugs came
running back onto the screen.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.610
So, where are these
extra bugs coming from?

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.610
My thought's maybe we're
forgetting to move them.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.490
So let's just check back in
the visual debug controller.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.860
And see if our hunch is correct.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.920
So we go to the empty bugs from view.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.000
That's where this should be happening.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.180
There we go.
Model that.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.410
I left a message to remind myself, and

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.700
I haven't done it to empty
the bugs from the view.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.420
In this case, I'll forgive you if you
copy the code over from the final

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.020
working version because
that's what I'm about to do.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.840
This should just be a simple fix.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.870
So if we go up, it debugs from view.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.802
Here we go.

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:44.280
Let's put that in.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.401
Try it one more time.

00:03:47.584 --> 00:03:51.880
And create some bugs,
shake them off the screen, and

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.340
then if we create some more,
should be no new bugs crawling back on.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.320
Looks good.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.873
Let's do a couple of different types

00:04:04.873 --> 00:04:10.080
of bugs, just for checking sake.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.960
Shake them off, and
everything looks good.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.160
And that's it.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.350
That's all the bugs that I know that
are in the visual debugging scene.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.519
And I hope you're able to find and
fix all these bugs on your own.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.690
But most importantly, I hope that
your confidence is growing, so

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.670
that you can go forth and
when you're faced with bugs like this,

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.530
or any bugs in your application, you
know what tools are available to you,

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.320
and you can use them to
debug your applications.
