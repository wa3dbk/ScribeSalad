00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.220
As an entrepreneur, when should I
start thinking about the Hook Model?

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.050
&gt;&gt; As early as possible.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.430
Because the idea here is, well,
I'll tell you a personal story.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.335
So I've been at two companies.

00:00:12.335 --> 00:00:17.180
One of my,
at the last startup that I helped found,

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.860
one of the problems we constantly
had was what do we build?

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.530
So, we were big believers in the lean
start methodology of build, measure,

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.480
learn, customer development,
big believers in that.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.460
Still am.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.090
But we always had this challenge
of what do we build next, right?

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.590
This is where all the blood,
sweat, and tears and money all go,

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.850
it's the building.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.510
Testing and learning, measuring and
learning, that's easy, that's fun.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.770
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; It's the building that's hard.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.000
So the question we constantly,
constantly had was,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.310
you know what do we build next?

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.320
Do we build what the VCs
say we should build?

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.950
Do we build what the loudest
customer say what we should build?

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.000
Do we build what people who write into
customer support say we should build?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.070
What do we build?

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.270
And so, what I, what I propose is that
instead of just guessing, or you know,

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.740
taking a shot at, or dot voting,
even, based on what the team thinks

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.720
we need some kind of framework based on
how people actually behave because it

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.840
turns out that just asking people what
they want is not a really great measure.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.680
Because people can only
articulate certain things.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.860
There's all these inarticulatable
needs that drive our behavior and

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.510
people couldn't tell you
actually drive their behavior.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.230
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So instead of just guessing we need

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.490
consumer psychology to help us
build the right things sooner.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.430
We still have to do build,
measure, learn.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.610
We're still going to mess up,

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.180
we're not going to build perfect
products the first time.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.960
The idea is that we can
build the right thing sooner

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.200
by basing what we build on
the foundations of consumer psychology.
