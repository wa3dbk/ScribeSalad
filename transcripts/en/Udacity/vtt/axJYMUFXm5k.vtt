00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.040
Our two equations are y equals 3 x plus 4, which of course incorporates the left

00:00:05.052 --> 00:00:09.988
side of this equation, and y equals 19, which deals with the right side. If we

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.385
have these two seperate equations, but we know that at their point of

00:00:14.397 --> 00:00:19.560
intersection, they share a y value, then at that point, this y and this y will

00:00:19.572 --> 00:00:24.660
be the same. So we can set the other side of each equation equal to each other,

00:00:24.772 --> 00:00:26.985
which gives us 3x plus 4 equals 19.
