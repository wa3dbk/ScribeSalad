We're not going to be able to study indepth

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.590
any of the architectural styles that we just discussed. However, I

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.790
want to at least discuss two representative examples of P2P

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.100
architectures. Because, these are systems that you probably used, or at

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.090
least, you used one of them. And, they will allow

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.590
me to highlight some interesting points. So, as we just mentioned,

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.450
P2P systems are decentralized resource sharing and discovery systems. And the

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.370
two systems that I want to discuss, and that are representative

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.630
of this kind of architectures, are Napster and Skype. And you may or

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.920
may not be familiar with Napster, but I'm pretty sure that you know Skype.
