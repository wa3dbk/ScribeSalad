00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.820
Welcome to Android Fundamentals.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.540
Getting started on Android
is straightforward.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.080
Simply installing Android Studio
and creating a new project is enough

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.910
to have ticked the "Hello World" box
on your Android resume.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.610
But that's not why we're here.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.340
We're also not here to teach you Java

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.212
and we're not going to walk you through
every API in the Android SDK.

00:00:19.212 --> 00:00:22.260
But what we will do
is to help you build a real app.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.765
We'll dig into the fundamentals
of how Android works;

00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:27.050
its patterns and best practices.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.500
Our course is deeply rooted in code,
but this isn't a copy/paste code lab.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.390
We'll teach you the principles you need,

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.780
and help you navigate the hundreds of
resources like sample code, documentation,

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.960
and stack overflow that you'll be using
in your career as an Android developer.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.360
Getting started is easy,
but building something great is harder,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.170
which is why we're here.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.130
We'll work right alongside you,

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.270
and by the end of this course,

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.330
you'll be able to turn
your app vision into reality,

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.230
and you'll build it the right way.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.840
So, in that spirit of collaboration,
we'll begin by telling you

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.010
a little bit about us, and where you'll
be seeing us throughout the course.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.270
Katherine, why don't you get us started?

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.269
Sure.
