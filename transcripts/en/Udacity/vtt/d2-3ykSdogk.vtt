00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.095
This parabola's vertex is centered at 5 comma negative 2. Great work if you've

00:00:06.095 --> 00:00:11.528
found this as the vertex. We start with the basic graph y equals x squared. And

00:00:11.528 --> 00:00:16.915
we can shift all the points down by subtracting 2 from that equation. Think

00:00:16.915 --> 00:00:21.300
about the values of y and how they change. If you know that y equals x squared

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.100
is, then subtracting 2 from x squared will give you a y value that is decreased

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.473
by 2. Next, we shift the graph to the right by 5 units, by subtracting 5 from

00:00:32.473 --> 00:00:38.586
the x term in the binomial. When finding the x coordinate when y equals

00:00:38.586 --> 00:00:42.942
negative 2, we know that this part of the equation, our binomial squared, would

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:48.802
have to equal 0. We know if x minus 5 squared equals 0, then we would have 0

00:00:48.802 --> 00:00:54.825
minus 2. So y would just equal negative 2. That's the y coordinate of our

00:00:54.825 --> 00:00:59.122
vertex. So this means that we set our binomial equal to 0 to get an x

00:00:59.122 --> 00:01:05.430
coordinate of our vertex, have x equals positive 5. Notice again that the sign

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.895
is different for the x coordinate of our vertex than the sign in the binomial

00:01:08.895 --> 00:01:15.725
here. Our vertex has an x coordinate of positive 5, but the binomial has the

00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:21.620
number negative 5. But the sign of the y coordinate is the same. The y

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.975
coordinate the vertex is negative 2, and we see negative 2 at the end of our

00:01:24.975 --> 00:01:26.469
equation.
