Surveys are used a lot in social and behavioral science. In fact, I used the

00:00:04.901 --> 00:00:09.559
education longitudinal study for my masters thesis. I looked at a lot of

00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:14.661
different factors, that might influence student effort in math class. What do

00:00:14.673 --> 00:00:19.550
you think are some benefits of using a survey to do research? It's one of the

00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:25.719
easiest ways to get info on a population. They are relatively inexpensive, they

00:00:25.731 --> 00:00:32.418
can be conducted remotely, or anyone can access and analyze survey results. What

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.423
do you think?
