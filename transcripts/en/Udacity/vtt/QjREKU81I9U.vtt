To understand components better,

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.040
we will now look at some of the issues that component vendor has to

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.360
face when offering a component technology to the marketplace.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.920
The issues that we'll look at are configuration, versioning,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.170
extension mechanisms, callbacks,

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.430
contracts, using objects as components, scaling, and domain standards.
