00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.121
Okay that was a simple case. Okay, and now have to consider the,

00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:07.113
the case in which the vectors do have elements, and

00:00:07.113 --> 00:00:11.430
we're going to also break this down into two more cases, depending on whether or

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.980
not the first elements of x and y are identical. Okay? So

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.330
first case is, yes they are identical. So in this case,

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.330
determining whether X and Y are permutation, boils down to whether or

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.000
not the tails of X and the tail of Y are permutations of each other.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.250
And the tail of a vector is everything except the first element. So we could say

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.380
that, for this case, in order for the output to be a permutation of the input,

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:44.330
the syntax on the. That you see on the slide holds. In particular that says,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.750
if the length of X is greater than 0, that's our special case.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.890
And our second special case was that the value in the first position of

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.950
X is equal to the value of the first position in Y. And the third condition is

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.770
if the permutation if, if the tail of X is a permutation of the tail of Y

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.010
than we can conclude that in fact X and Y are permutations of each other.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.360
So what were doing now we, we handled the case where they were empty vectors and

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.390
said they were permutations and in this case if these three conditions hold,

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.360
they are permutations, okay? The other thing to note, is that, what we've

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.320
defined here. Is a recursive definition. Now I warned you before about recursive

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.160
definitions, often leading to cases where the definition is not meaningful.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.180
Now here I'm going to give you a specific situation in which you

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.920
are allowed to do that. And we're allowed to do that because it essentially is,

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.520
is an inductive argument. Okay? The permutations that we're using

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.130
in our definition, are permutations on the tails of the input and output,

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.410
okay? And the tails are everything but the first element and so they're shorter.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.000
And we also already have handled the case where we got down to 0 length.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.940
So we handled 0 length, and we handled everything in terms of its tail.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.320
We have a well founded induction here. And so

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.490
in fact, our definition of permutation is in fact meaningful.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.895
We couldn't say that, X is a permutation of Y if X is a permutation of Y.

00:02:18.895 --> 00:02:22.700
Okay? That wouldn't be a meaningful induction. But here because we're

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.310
shrinking it at every step, it is in fact a meaningful induction.
