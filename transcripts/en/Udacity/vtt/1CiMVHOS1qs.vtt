00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.890
Applications rely on
the operating system.

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:04.820
So what does it really do for you?

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.320
First of all like I said before,

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.820
the hardware is actually not very easy
to use if you had to use it directly.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.020
If you wanted to program your
applications, and had to work

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.260
with the hardware directly it's
going to be infinitely more complex.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.790
It may be already be hard, but
it's going to be much harder.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:25.210
So what the operating system does is
that it creates easier to use and high

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.600
level abstractions for the resources
that we have that the hardware provides.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.520
For example, we know that
data that must be persistent,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.280
it's stored on the disk in disk blocks.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.380
Well we actually don't directly
work with disk blocks and

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.400
keep track of where on disk a certain
piece of information may be.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.690
We have things called files.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.300
Think of file as a high level,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.280
where we're going to talk about
virtual resources that are created or

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.890
supported by the operating system and
made available to you.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.520
So these high level abstractions
that we can use to access

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.270
more user-friendly
resources in some way.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.910
Make it easier for
us to write our applications, or

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.940
build our applications that are going
to run on this computer system.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.450
Now the resources that
we're going to provide.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.600
The high level resources,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.110
the operating system makes
available to the applications.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.170
Well, they going to be implemented using
the real physical resources that we have

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.500
that the hardware provides to us.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.340
The resources, the physical resources

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.510
are going to be shared across
these different applications.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.990
Obviously when you have
that kind of sharing,

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.040
we need to access those resources
in a controlled fashion.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.400
So the hardware resources are actually
managed by the operating system, and

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.950
access to those is going to
be controlled via it as well.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.740
And that actually is one
of the fundamental reasons

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.520
why operating systems have such
an important role to play,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.830
when it comes to protecting resources
and securing access to them.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.980
The last thing that is really
interesting and we're going to spend

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.260
a good bit of time on that, is all
the different applications or different

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.615
processes going to run on the same
system and share the resources we have.

00:02:11.615 --> 00:02:14.845
The physical resources that
we have between them, but

00:02:14.845 --> 00:02:20.515
the operating system makes each process
believe as if it's the only one running.

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:23.465
And it's able to do that
by providing what we call

00:02:23.465 --> 00:02:26.645
isolation between these
different processes.

00:02:26.645 --> 00:02:31.800
In some sense one process or one
application does not need to be aware of

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.840
another application, unless it
explicitly decides to interact with it.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.050
It's sharing these physical resources,
but think about the operating system

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.020
making sure that what is being used
by one application doesn't get

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.540
used by somebody else, or
another process or another application.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.250
So, having this isolation,
sort of giving each application,

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.060
sort of the feeling that
it is the only one running.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.070
We should say that if they share,
of course, not each process has all

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.410
the resources, so there may be
some performance implications.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.980
But, if you don't worry about
performance, basically each process can

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.020
believe as if it has the resources,
and the computer to itself.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.560
So, the operating system
is actually going to create

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.840
this isolation between these different
applications, which is really important.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.370
Because applications may
not trust each other, and

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.390
if they don't trust each other, they
don't want any sort of interference from

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.770
other processes that
are not trusted by them.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.190
So this isolation that the operating
system provided isolation is actually

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.170
going to guarantee to us that
the process doesn't have to worry about

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.450
other processes, or other applications
that may be there in the system.
