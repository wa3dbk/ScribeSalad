00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.675
We've derived one system of transforming transparency that mostly works. To sum

00:00:04.675 --> 00:00:08.510
up all the opaque objects are rendered first, with Z buffering on, blending is

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.674
then turned on for the transparent objects that follow. Blending takes extra

00:00:12.674 --> 00:00:17.132
time for the GPU to compute, so it's turned on only when needed. Finally, the

00:00:17.132 --> 00:00:20.670
transparents objects are sorted by their destins along the view, and are

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.812
rendered in back to front order. If the camera or objects are moving, this

00:00:24.812 --> 00:00:29.102
sorting has to be done in every frame. This algorithm is in fact with three j s

00:00:29.102 --> 00:00:33.352
implements, you make an object transparent by setting its material. There are

00:00:33.352 --> 00:00:38.699
two parameters to set. The opacity is the f of value used for blending. You must

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.200
also set the transparent parameter to be true. This transparency scheme usually

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.352
works fairly well in practice but there are still quite a few problem cases. One

00:00:47.352 --> 00:00:53.145
problem is inter penetration. Here's the demo showing one transparent block

00:00:53.145 --> 00:00:57.664
moving through the other, give this demo a try. Move the camera around and use

00:00:57.664 --> 00:01:01.685
the slider to position the block. The dot on the center of each object is what

00:01:01.685 --> 00:01:06.260
is used to measure it's distance along the direction the camera is viewing. Once

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.600
you're done with the demo, you'll then answer a question as to what's going

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.073
wrong.
