Now, let's look at mixed numbers with octagons. An octagon is just a shape with

00:00:03.932 --> 00:00:07.925
eight sides. What would be the mixed number and the improper fraction for these

00:00:07.937 --> 00:00:11.825
octagons? You want to think about splitting these octagons up into equal parts.

00:00:11.917 --> 00:00:15.650
You will also want to reduce your answer. So, for example, if I had 5 and 6

00:00:15.662 --> 00:00:20.465
12th, I'd really want to write that as 5 and one-half. I know 6 goes into 6 one

00:00:20.477 --> 00:00:25.785
time, and I know 6 goes into 12 two times. So, 6 12th reduces to one-half.
