00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.524
This is why participants should be randomly assigned to treatment, meaning

00:00:04.536 --> 00:00:09.164
everyone has an equal chance of being assigned to either of the two treatments.

00:00:09.267 --> 00:00:14.052
In theory, randomization makes the two groups similar. On average, for example,

00:00:14.155 --> 00:00:18.635
the groups should be similar in age, the number of males and females, their

00:00:18.647 --> 00:00:23.245
sleep habits, et cetera. And that's why it's good to have a big sample size.

00:00:23.347 --> 00:00:28.040
Randomization works best with larger groups. We'll come back to the benefits of

00:00:28.052 --> 00:00:32.665
larger samples later in this class. Now one more thing before we end this story.

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:37.174
We started this module with the question, If you're preparing for your exam

00:00:37.186 --> 00:00:41.261
tomorrow, should you stay up studying or should you go to sleep? Researchers

00:00:41.273 --> 00:00:45.596
have demonstrated using both observational and experimental studies, that sleep

00:00:45.608 --> 00:00:49.741
is important for memory. Getting a good night's sleep will likely pay off more

00:00:49.753 --> 00:00:53.980
than a couple of extra hours of studying. On the right you'll find a link to an

00:00:53.992 --> 00:00:57.870
interesting story, of you'd like to learn more about this topic. I wish I had

00:00:57.882 --> 00:00:59.205
have known that in college.
