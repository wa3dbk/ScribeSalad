00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In this case since we don't know that there's only three missionaries,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
we need to have both sets of numbers.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We can't just say there's two missionaries on the left;

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
therefore, there's one on the right. We don't know how many are going to be on the right.

00:00:12.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So this six-element tuple would do the job where these two wouldn't.
