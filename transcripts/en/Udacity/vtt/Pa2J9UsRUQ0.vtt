00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.870
F would equal 9C divided by 5 plus 32. Nice algebra skills for figuring that one

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.985
out. We start by multiplying both sides of our equation by 9. This will create a

00:00:10.985 --> 00:00:15.879
fraction. And keep in mind we don't multiply these 2 terms by this 9. This whole

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:21.237
term is distributed to both of them. So we simplify or cancel the 9s here first.

00:00:21.238 --> 00:00:27.404
Next we distribute 5 to F and to negative 32. We add a 160 to both sides, to

00:00:27.404 --> 00:00:31.828
isolate 5 F. And finally we divide by the coefficient of F, which is 5 on both

00:00:31.828 --> 00:00:37.561
sides of our equation. We divide 5 into 9 C to get 9 C 5ths. And we divide 5

00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:42.442
into a 160 to get positive 32. Here's our equation. Now there was a different

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:46.286
way you could've gotten to the same result by dividing both sides here by 5,

00:00:46.286 --> 00:00:50.844
first. Then you would have just add the 32. I think that would've been a little

00:00:50.844 --> 00:00:51.683
bit quicker.
