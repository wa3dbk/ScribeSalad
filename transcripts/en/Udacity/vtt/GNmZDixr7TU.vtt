00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.816
These are the boxes that should have been checked off. We can find curves of

00:00:03.816 --> 00:00:09.130
the graph in three different areas, over here, down here, and up here again.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.997
Let me show you the full version of the graph so you can get a real picture of

00:00:11.997 --> 00:00:17.230
what it looks like. These black curves represent the graph of this function.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.090
It's pretty incredible to think about how different this looks from any other

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.228
rational function we've look at so far. This is just testament to the

00:00:24.228 --> 00:00:27.648
incredible wide variety of graphs and functions we have in the ratinoal

00:00:27.648 --> 00:00:29.602
function family.
