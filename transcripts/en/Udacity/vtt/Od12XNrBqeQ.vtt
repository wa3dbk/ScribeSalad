00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Obviously the p³ cancel out plus -2p² over here plus 1p² over here,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which makes -1p², and we can leave the p intact--we get the expression on the bottom.

00:00:13.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We can factor p out to get p(1 - p). That's the variance of X for arbitrary p.
