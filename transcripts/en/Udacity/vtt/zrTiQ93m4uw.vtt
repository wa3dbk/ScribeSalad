00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.684
This equation represents an ellipse. We want to move this negative 4 y squared

00:00:05.684 --> 00:00:10.459
term to the left hand side of the equation. So we'll add 4 y squared here and

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:16.045
we'll add 4 y squared here. So we'll be left with 27 on the right hand side.

00:00:16.045 --> 00:00:20.758
And 3 x squared plus 4 y squared on the left hand side. We have addition

00:00:20.758 --> 00:00:24.644
between x squared and y squared, so we know we have either a circle or an

00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:29.635
ellipse. And since, we have different amounts of x squared and y squared, we

00:00:29.635 --> 00:00:34.006
know we have an ellipse. And just to check in Desmos, I'll show you that this

00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:35.970
graph is exactly the same.
