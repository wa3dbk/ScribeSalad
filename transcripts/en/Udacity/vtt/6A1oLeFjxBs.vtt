00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.246
Okay. Now, of course, the answer is a bunch of

00:00:02.246 --> 00:00:04.647
hex characters that I'm not going to type here, but I'll go

00:00:04.647 --> 00:00:07.157
ahead and show you in the terminal. Here I've imported

00:00:07.157 --> 00:00:12.807
hash, hashlib. hashlib.sha256 of the string udacity, returning the hex digest,

00:00:12.807 --> 00:00:15.825
is this big long string here. So, if you did

00:00:15.825 --> 00:00:19.523
this, now you know how to take hashes of, of simple

00:00:19.523 --> 00:00:21.990
strings. And, of course, you can send more than simple strings

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.080
in here. And get a hash that in this particular case,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.680
it is 256 bits long. This is the hex

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.260
representation so obviously it's not that many characters. Of course

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.470
you can put whatever you want in here and the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.120
output will be 256 bits cause that's what sha 256

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.230
does, and of course if we were to change our

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.660
string just in the slightest, we get a totally different

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.870
hash outlook, so we can use this technique now to

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.940
solve some problems we are having in our cookie application.
