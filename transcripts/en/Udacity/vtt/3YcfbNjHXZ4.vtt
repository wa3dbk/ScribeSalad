00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.046
First we want to check to see if there's a greatest common factor other than 1,

00:00:04.046 --> 00:00:08.013
1 is the greatest common factor for all three terms, so we don't need to factor

00:00:08.013 --> 00:00:13.722
anything out. We want to find factors of negative 120 that sum to positive 14.

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:18.632
Here's the start of a factor pair list. There are other factors for negative 120

00:00:18.632 --> 00:00:23.110
but I already found the one I need, negative 6 and positive 20. We can check

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.862
this real quick to make sure negative 6 times 20 multiplies to negative 120, and

00:00:27.862 --> 00:00:32.262
that they sum to positive 14. It's best to rewrite 14a with a negative term

00:00:32.262 --> 00:00:38.048
first. We finish out our problem by factoring by grouping, and these are two

00:00:38.048 --> 00:00:42.386
factors, 3a plus 4 and 5a minus 2. That's some great work if you got that one

00:00:42.386 --> 00:00:46.148
correct. If these are giving you trouble, stay with it. The more practice you

00:00:46.148 --> 00:00:50.453
do, the better you'll get at math. As you put in more effort, you will improve.
