00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.640
This argument is x squared minus 2x, and this argument is 15. Great thinking if

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.289
you got these. We know this argument is x squared minus 2x, since we just

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:16.470
multiply x minus 2 times x. We multiply the arguments, when we add two

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.414
logarithms together that have the same base. So x times x equals x squared and

00:00:22.414 --> 00:00:27.471
x times negative 2 is negative 2x. For the right hand side we're going to

00:00:27.471 --> 00:00:31.188
multiple 6 times 5 to get 30 and then we'll divide by 2, since for subtracting

00:00:31.188 --> 00:00:39.298
a logarithm. So 30 divided by 2 equals 15. Remember when we add logs, we

00:00:39.298 --> 00:00:44.050
multiple the arguments and when we subtract, we divide by that number. This is

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.969
how we get a number of 15 here.
