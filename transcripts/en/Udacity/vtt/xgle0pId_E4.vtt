00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
One thing you might have done is look in the Python documentation and hashable here is a link.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If you click on it, you'll get to the glossary that explains what hashable means.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It says that an object is hashable if it's hash value never changes during its lifetime.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
That means it has an underscore hash method and it can be compared to other objects.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
This is still quite a difficult definition.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It's not something that tells you very clearly what's hashable and what's not.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The second part of it is more useful.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It says that all of Python's immutable built-in objects are hashable.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
That makes sense because their value doesn't change.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
They can map to the same object using hash and none of the immutable containers are,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and their examples are one that you should be familiar with, list and dictionaries

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
as immutable containers that are not hashable,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and the reason it's important for things to be hashable,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
well we've seen this with dictionary keys.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
If we want to use a hash function to look up the value of the key,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
well we need to know that that key can't change.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
If it could change when we did our look up in the dictionary,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
if you remember what we did with dictionaries, well we had a key.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
That was the input to some hash function along with the dictionary size

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and that would give us a mapping to some bucket.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
If the hash of the key could change, so if the key was something it could be mutated,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
well the next time we look it up if the key has changed, we're going to hash it,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and we're going to look in the wrong bucket.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So, that's why things need to be hashable to be put in a dictionary. That's the same thing for sets.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And if the value of an item could change, well that would break the representation of the set.
