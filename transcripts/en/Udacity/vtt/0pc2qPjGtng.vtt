00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here's the essence of the TLS handshake.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
To recap, the client initiates with the server.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We're leaving out all the details about selecting the ciphers

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and the extra randomness, which is important for security.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The server sends back a certificate.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The client validates the certificate using a chain of certificates going back

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
to some root certificate that the client trusts,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
selects a random r and then encrypts that using the public key of the server.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The server can decrypt it, because it knows the corresponding private key.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Then they finish the handshake.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Now the client and server can communicate using those shared symmetric keys.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The protocol to do that is the TLS record protocol.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I may have made the mis-impression earlier that once you've established

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
symmetric keys communication is easy and there's nothing left to work out.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
That's not the case. We're going to look at the TLS protocol next,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and indeed it does have some vulnerabilities.
