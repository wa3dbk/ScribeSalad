00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.228
So we know that grant started off with a
certain amount of money from the venture

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.705
capital funders. But then he doesn't just
keep it, he starts to spend it. This means

00:00:08.717 --> 00:00:12.958
that the right choice must take both of
these into account, the money that he was

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.128
given initially and the money that he
spent so far. The second and last choices

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.348
only have one of these two things each, so
that means that neither of them can be

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.508
right. So I'm going to cross them both
out. So that just leaves us with these

00:00:25.508 --> 00:00:29.623
two. Money from funders plus money spent,
or money from funders minus money spent.

00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:34.013
Spending money, actually takes away from
the amount of money that we have. It

00:00:34.025 --> 00:00:38.367
doesn't add to it. So that means that the
third choice, right here, money from

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.438
funders minus money spent must be the
right answer. Now without even trying

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.807
we've actually just done some math. I know
that there aren't any numbers here, but

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:50.836
what we've created is called an equation.
It's called that because of this equal

00:00:50.848 --> 00:00:55.495
sign right here in the middle. Over doing
with this equation is showing that these

00:00:55.507 --> 00:00:59.566
two quantities, the one on the left side
of the equal sign and the one on the right

00:00:59.578 --> 00:01:03.642
side. Are equal to each other, or have the
same numerical value. This is the first of

00:01:03.654 --> 00:01:07.306
many, many equations that we're going to
look at throughout this course. And over

00:01:07.318 --> 00:01:09.910
time you'll learn to do a ton of different
things with them.
