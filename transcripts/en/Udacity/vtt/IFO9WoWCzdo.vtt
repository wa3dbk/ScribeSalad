00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.735
The answer is both the second and the third are true. We have our restaurant

00:00:03.735 --> 00:00:08.750
class, which has, its base class is object, and object has many methods

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.286
including both init, and str. Restaurant doesn't define any attributes but it

00:00:13.286 --> 00:00:17.212
inherits all of the attributes defined by object. What's happening somewhere

00:00:17.212 --> 00:00:21.181
inside print is this object is being converted to a string by calling its str

00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:26.115
method. The self object for str, is this restaurant object. So the self object

00:00:26.115 --> 00:00:29.690
is a restaurant which means its a restaurant instance so that's why the second

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.315
one is true, its also an object instance. Every object that we create is an

00:00:33.315 --> 00:00:37.475
intance of its own class as well as all of the super classes or the base classes

00:00:37.475 --> 00:00:41.320
of that object. So that's why the third one is true also. So there's nothing

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.675
magical or mysterious going on, other than Python implementing a simple object

00:00:45.675 --> 00:00:46.913
system that does this.
