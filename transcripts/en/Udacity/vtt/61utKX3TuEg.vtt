As we did for Eclipse, and IDEs in general, we want

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.133
to start a GIT in a hands on way. So we're going

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:08.425
to start by seeing how to install GIT. And GIT is also

00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:12.440
multiplatform, so you can install it no matter what operating system you

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.980
are using, unless of course you are using some arcane operating system.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.530
But if you are using Linux, for instance, there should be a

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.608
package available that can install GIT for your specific distribution. If you're

00:00:22.608 --> 00:00:25.460
using Mac OS, GIT is also available as part of XCode and

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.270
also as an independent package. Finally, if you're using Windows, GIT is

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.090
available as a package with an installer. In general, you can go

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.290
here to get information about how to get GIT, where to download

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.975
it, how to install it, and so on. So, now what I'd

00:00:39.975 --> 00:00:42.312
like for you to do is to go, get GIT, install it,

00:00:42.312 --> 00:00:45.469
in case you don't have it installed already on your machine. And

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:48.253
after that, you should be able to run GIT from the command

00:00:48.253 --> 00:00:51.120
line. And, that's exactly what we're going to do through a demo.
