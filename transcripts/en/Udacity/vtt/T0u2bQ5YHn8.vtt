00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.150
I added fields to my Set Time object.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:03.840
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.220
&gt;&gt; I added the tab so I can see it here, and I have

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.750
clicked in, and I am ready. I'm

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.340
going to start entering some records. Sound good?

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.190
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.620
&gt;&gt; Alright. What time shall our first band play at?

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.020
Oh, I mean what stage should our first band play at?

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.020
&gt;&gt;

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.027
[LAUGH]

00:00:18.027 --> 00:00:22.300
let's put it at the Udacity stage. And I know that I can go

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.840
into the page layout thing and add those other fields if I wanted but.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.500
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.620
&gt;&gt; Not.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.010
&gt;&gt; Yup.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.860
&gt;&gt; Too concerned right now. Okay. And, what band should be playing?

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.300
&gt;&gt; Search for something. See if they what

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.380
about code? There's gotta be a code band.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.750
&gt;&gt; Code Against the Machines, what about that?

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.185
&gt;&gt; Code Against the Machines for sure

00:00:41.185 --> 00:00:42.700
[LAUGH].

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.400
Right and save. So this is our set time record.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.760
&gt;&gt; Right

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.960
&gt;&gt; For code against the machine, playing the Udacity stage.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.320
&gt;&gt; Right. So we can see how it links to both the stage and the band.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.460
&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's see what happens if I actually click on Udacity

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.710
stage. So this is the stage record, and yeah it's not showing me

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.470
any of the bands that are playing here. Which is unfortunately, because I

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.540
would love it to. It feels like it should be showing me that.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.780
&gt;&gt; So it should be

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.610
showing you that, and it could be showing you

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.310
that. How do you think you could add it there?
