00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.980
So, how would we use a service 
to implement our application?

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.800
Fortunately, we've already done 
most of the work.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.680
We have a content provider
with a content notifier

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.360
that will notify our content observers.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.300
Our FetchWeatherTask already runs 
completely independently of our UI

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.750
Good on us.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.790
Now we can make use 
of that Intent Service

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.960
that Rato mentioned earlier.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.230
With just a few small changes, 
we can get our code working

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.060
with an Intent Service,

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.659
instead of with our
FetchWeatherTask.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:37.660
To start, let's create
a new package for our service.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.243
Then we'll add a new Java class
in that package

00:00:41.243 --> 00:00:44.066
that extends Intents Service.

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:47.570
We hit Ctrl+I to once again, 
add the required abstract method.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.780
And Ctrl+O in order to add the constructor.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.690
Since the service is 
an Android component,

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.583
you guessed it, it needs
to be in the manifest.

00:00:58.583 --> 00:01:01.125
Okay, let's do this.

00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:04.316
Let's finish implementing
the SunshineService

00:01:04.316 --> 00:01:07.061
and call it from ForecastFragment.

00:01:07.061 --> 00:01:09.304
You can start a service 
using an Intent

00:01:09.304 --> 00:01:11.697
with the StartService method.

00:01:11.697 --> 00:01:14.830
It will help to remember 
how to use explicit intents.
