00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.783
Let us try to construct a semantic network representation, for this guards and

00:00:04.783 --> 00:00:09.990
prisoners problem, and see how we can use it to, do the problem solving. So

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.600
in this representation, I'm going to say that each node is a state in

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.660
the problem solving. In this particular state, there happens to be one guard and

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.470
one prisoner on the left side. The boat is on the right side,

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.090
and two of the prisoners and two of the guards are also on the right side.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.040
So this is a node, one single node. So the node captured, the lexicon of

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.740
the semantic network. Now, we'll add the structural part. And the structural

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.400
part has to do with the transformation. That is going connect different nodes,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.090
into a more complex sentence. We'll label the links between the nodes, and

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.960
these labels then, will capture some of the semantics of this representation,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.650
that will allow us to make interesting inferences,

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.040
when it comes time to do the problem solving. Here is a second node, and

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.790
this node represents a different state in the problem solving. In this case,

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.510
there are two guards and two prisoners on the left side.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.260
The boat is also on the left side. There is one guard and

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.860
one prisoner on the right side. So this now, is a, semantic network.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.630
A node, another node, a link between them and the link is labelled.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.740
Note that in this representation, I used icons to represent objects,

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.720
as well as icons to represent labels of the links between the nodes.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.710
This is perfectly valid. You don't have to use words. You can use icons,

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.570
as long as you're capturing the nodes and the objects inside each state,

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.890
as well as the labels on the links between the different nodes.
