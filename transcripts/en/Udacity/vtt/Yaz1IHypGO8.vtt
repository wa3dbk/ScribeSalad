Your next problem is not too tough. The PolygonGeometry function has been

00:00:04.085 --> 00:00:07.880
extended to include a location. This is where the center of the polygon is to be

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.210
located when it's created. Note that the location is passed in as a Vector3. So,

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.318
you'll access the location as shown with location.x, and location.y. You can

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:23.147
ignore the value of location.z. I'm going to. Your program should look like this

00:00:23.147 --> 00:00:24.493
when running correctly.
