00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.660
Our sixth principle, was knowledge-based AI agents make use of

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.340
recurring patterns in the problems that they solve.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.600
These agents are likely to see similar problems over and over again and

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.130
make use of the underlying patterns behind these similar problems to solve them

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.830
more easily. We talked about this first with learning about recording cases.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.290
Here we assumed that we had a library of cases, and

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.180
that the solution to a former case would be the exact solution to a new problem.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.870
Ashok's example of tying shoe laces was similar to this.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.590
When we tie our shoelaces, we aren't resolving the problem of tying our

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.890
shoelaces from scratch. Instead we're just taking the solution from an earlier

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.380
time when we tied our shoelaces and doing it again. We assumed that the solution

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.530
to the old problem will solve this new similar problem. In case-based reasoning,

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.750
however, we talked about how the exact solution to an old problem won't

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.818
always solve new problems. Instead sometimes we have to adapt an old problem.

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:54.660
Here we assumed that there were recurring patterns in the world that would help

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.620
us solve these new and novel problems based on previous experiences.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.940
Even though the new experience is novel, the pattern is similar to a prior

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.480
experience. Analogical reasoning is very deeply rooted in this principle.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.610
Here we explicitly talked about the idea of taking patterns from one problem,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.658
abstracting them, and transferring them to a problem in a different domain.

00:01:13.658 --> 00:01:17.333
Whereas in case-based reasoning, the pattern was within a domain,

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:20.360
here the pattern can span different domains.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.490
In configuration, we assumed that the underlying design, the underlying plan for

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.360
a certain device or product was pretty similar each time. But there were certain

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.020
variables that had to be defined for an individual instance of that object.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.500
In a chair example, the overall design of a chair is a recurring problem,

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.070
they all have legs, they all have seats, they all have backs, but

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.652
the individual details of a specific chair might differ. Now, it might be

00:01:42.652 --> 00:01:45.872
tempting to think that this is actually at odds with the previous principal when

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:49.786
the knowledge-based AI agent's consult a novel problems. Here we're saying that

00:01:49.786 --> 00:01:53.765
knowledge-based AI agents solve recurring problems based on recurring patterns,

00:01:53.765 --> 00:01:58.173
but in fact these are not mutually exclusive. Knowledge-based AI agents

00:01:58.173 --> 00:02:01.535
leverage recurring patterns in the world, but they do so in conjunction with

00:02:01.535 --> 00:02:04.810
the other reasoning methods to allow them to also address novel problems.
