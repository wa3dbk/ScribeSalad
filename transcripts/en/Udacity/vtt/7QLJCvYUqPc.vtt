It was pretty cool visualizing the cars. Let's do something like that for the

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.390
social network. I want to update the constructor for a person object, so that

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.810
when I create a person, it draws the person's picture. This is how it might

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:21.510
look. In person demo, I create three person objects, and I pass in a name of a

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.320
picture, and also a location. And then when I run all of this, it creates this

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.900
picture. Can you update the person class so that it will do this when you run

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.830
the main method in person demo. You will need to take three additional

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.429
parameters in the constructor: a picture name, an x coordinate, and a y

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:41.627
coordinate...
