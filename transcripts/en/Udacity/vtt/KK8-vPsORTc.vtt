00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.973
But there's another way I might have implemented this getFriends method. I

00:00:03.973 --> 00:00:07.336
could just add a toString method to the Person class. If the toString method

00:00:07.336 --> 00:00:12.062
returns the name, then I could implement getFriends the way I did before. So

00:00:12.062 --> 00:00:15.224
here's approximately what I had before, and if I run the tester again, I can

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:19.612
see that the getFriends method is working. This is because when I called

00:00:19.612 --> 00:00:23.498
toString on the arraylist of Friends, it uses each friend's toString method, to

00:00:23.498 --> 00:00:28.213
get it's name. Well, actually just to get a representation of it, which in this

00:00:28.213 --> 00:00:32.952
case, is the name. This implementation will work, so long as I don't want the

00:00:32.952 --> 00:00:38.245
person to return something more than the name, in its toString method.
