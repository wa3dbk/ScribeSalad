00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.540
So why are we interested
in segmentation?

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.350
And what do we mean by segmentation?

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.730
Well by segmentation obviously,

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.970
we're going to segment the image
into a variety of regions.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.680
And the regions that you want to create
depend a little bit on what you're

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.330
actually trying to do.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.980
So, there's this general intuition,
and here we point to this work up by

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.300
the folks out at Berkeley and
Jitendra Malik, and his group.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.020
They really pushed hard on this.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.350
There's this general view
that if I show you a picture,

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.090
like this picture here on the left here,
which has these, bison.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.820
That's what we call them in the States,
or buffaloes, and

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.140
we still have them wandering around,
not in Atlanta, but in general.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.710
The idea is that I should be able to,
you know, if I handed that picture off

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.150
to a, to anybody and I said, draw
a border around the different objects,

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.290
you would get something that looks
kind of like that, all right?

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.100
People would segment and, and the, this
segmentation wouldn't all agree, right?

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.860
Some people might separate out this
little guy here from the grass but

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.800
you can see that this one doesn't.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.490
But in general,

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.520
there'd be a good agreement on
where the different elements are.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.290
And this database that's pointed to,
they recorded a whole bunch of

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.840
segmentations done by people, and
that can be used to train systems.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.420
Here's just another example taken
from a typical American scene here.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.140
In fact,
it even says that it's in Idaho.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.180
And you can see that the,
the regions that were cut out seemed to

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.310
correspond intuitively, what you might
think of as the different object, or

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.780
something more along
the lines of different parts.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.050
Another reason you might want to do
this, is you've got some objects,

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.520
that are sort of the ones you want to
pay attention to against the background.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.880
And you want to focus on the object,
and not the background.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.160
So, here's some examples referred
to as figure ground segmentation,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.850
which is the pulling out of the,
the figure from the background.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.260
And these typically are done in
things that are moving around.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.910
Here we've got some animals playing.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.615
Here's a strange creature
referred to as a young child.

00:01:52.615 --> 00:01:55.916
And the idea is that you'd like to
be able to pull those objects out.

00:01:55.916 --> 00:01:58.498
So if you want to analyze,
like we were doing activity recognition,

00:01:58.498 --> 00:02:00.840
you want to describe just
the movement of the object.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.290
Another way of thinking about
segmentation, again some work that was

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.669
introduced by Malex Group is
this notion of super pixels.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.960
So these two pictures that
you're looking at here,

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.460
you can see that everything is sort of
cut up into these little fragments.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.950
And the idea of these fragments,

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.720
especially take a look at along around
here, right, is that within those

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.520
fragments, everything is sort of the
same, and it's within the same region.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.190
And what that means is, when I think
about further cutting up this picture,

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.280
or processing it, I don't have to
think beyond these little regions,

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.080
which we'll refer to as, well later
in the literature, as superpixels.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.900
Right, the idea is that I go from
having tens of thousands, or

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.750
hundreds of thousands of pixels,
to maybe having hundreds of superpixels.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.710
So that makes the combinatorix much,
easier.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.030
And again, getting these superpixels
is a form of segmentation.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.590
Segmentation extends beyond
just single images of course.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.620
Here we're taking a look at video.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.930
This is actually some work that comes
from here at Georgia Tech done by both

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.060
Professor Erfanisa, Jim Raise and
Professor Jim Raise group here.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.520
And there's this ice skater going along.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.180
And the ice skater is being segmented
and it's not always so easy because

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.350
here, it's showing you against just
ice but obviously it pulls it out.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.010
And you want to be able
to extract it carefully.
