00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.850
So now that we have shown how shortest tour can be stated as a decision problem,

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.350
we still need to show that that problem is in NP,

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.840
and for shortest tour, while it's not really that difficult,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.410
but it's actually a little bit of a hassle, so let's do another quiz here.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.950
Why is shortest tour in NP?

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.720
So basically the question is: If we have nondeterminism,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.600
why can shortest tour then be solved in polynomial time?

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.640
Is it because we can use nondeterminism to guess which vertices

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.180
to put into the shortest tour?

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.920
Is it because once once a shortest tour has been guessed using nondeterminism,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.780
the length of that tour can be checked in polynomial time?

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.960
Is it because nondeterminism can guess a shortest tour,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.320
and by that I mean that we can use the better function to guess the tour here,

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.440
so you would have something like this:

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.480
if better visit vertex A, else visit another vertex next.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.390
Or, do we even have to show this? Because, actually, it's quite obvious.

00:00:54.390 --> 99:59:59.000
So, more than one can be correct. Please tell me which ones are.
