Since you had so much practice with composite functions, in that last lesson. I

00:00:04.772 --> 00:00:08.237
wonder what would happen if we made a composite function by using a function

00:00:08.237 --> 00:00:12.750
and its inverse? These functions have been working pretty well for us so far,

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.770
so let's just keep going with them. Using these two function then, what is f of

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.889
f inverse of x? And what is f inverse of f of x?
