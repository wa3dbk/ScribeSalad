00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.400
&gt;From here on out I'm going to
assume that you want to be a hedge

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.440
fund manager.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.590
And one of your first tasks as a hedge
fund manager is to get investors.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.430
So who might your investors be?

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.480
There are three major types
of investors in hedge funds.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.270
Of course, there's others besides these,
but these are the three main types.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.100
Individuals, in other words, a single
person that wants to invest in a fund.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.580
Of course,
these are typically very wealthy folks.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.610
Keep in mind that hedge funds typically
can only have up to 100 investors.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.070
So they want each of those
investments to be fairly large so

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.070
that they can manage, of course,
a significant amount of funds.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.660
So the individuals who invest in
hedge funds are typically, as I said,

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.070
very wealthy.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.690
Institutions.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.470
What do I mean by Institutions?

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.950
These are things like very
large retirement funds,

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.770
like CalPERS out in California.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.680
These are university foundations like
the Harvard University Foundation or

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.970
the Georgia Tech Foundation.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.970
In other words, institutions,
very often non-profit

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.160
institutions that have a large sum of
money that they need to keep somewhere.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.350
And of course, they'd like to
see an accrual in value, so

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.750
that's one reason they
look to hedge funds.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.510
And finally, funds of funds.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.570
What funds of funds do is they

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.900
group together the funds of many
individuals or institutions.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.290
So for instance, you might be
an individual that could, say,

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.910
invest in one hedge fund, but

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.790
you'd really like to get the advantage
of investing in several funds.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.210
So you might allow your money
to be collected by a manager of

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.760
funds of funds.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.110
And then that manager would gather
together all these assets and

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.730
pick carefully several hedge
funds to invest that money in.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.320
So besides knowing who
your investors might be,

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.380
it's critically important to know
why they might invest in your fund.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.330
How can you present the case
to them that will convince

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.310
them that they should let
you manage their money?

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.190
Here are at least some of
the criteria that folks like this

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.080
would consider before
investing in a hedge fund.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.320
Track record.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.490
So if your fund has a great
track record, that's, of course,

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.780
some of the best evidence that it's
going to continue to work well.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.610
Many institutional investors will
want to see a good track record for

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.310
at least five years before they'll
invest in a particular fund.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.490
Now if you're a young whippersnapper
hedge fund manager and

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.230
you don't have five years yet,
what are you going to do?

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.840
Well, what you can do is simulate or
back test your strategy, and

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.620
investors will consider
these simulations.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.600
But that simulation has
to be backed by a very

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.310
compelling story
describing that strategy.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.540
In other words, you've gotta have
a reason for why this method works and

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.340
it needs to make sense.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.290
And finally, they consider how your
strategy fits within their portfolio.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:21.240
In other words, if your strategy is for
large cap S&amp;P 500 stocks, and they've

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.420
already got that covered with another
fund, they might not consider you.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.680
However, if you, for instance,
are looking at small cap growth stocks,

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.380
and they don't yet have that
part of their portfolio filled,

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.510
they'll give you some more thought.
