There are a lot of times when we want to build

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.800
a reverse index from a data set, to allow for some

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.800
faster searching. If you've ever read some sort of reference book,

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.670
you've probably used an index. So here's a book I like,

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.680
A Brief History of Time. And the subtitle is From the

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.000
Big Bang to Black Holes. So let's say I just want

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.620
to read about the big bang. Well, only thing I can

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.590
do is crawl through all of this text, and look for

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.280
the words big bang. But of course, I'm not going to

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.360
do that. Somebody's already gone through put in the work in

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.720
advance to create an index for me. So at the end

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.920
of the book. I can just go to the index, and

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.910
on the first page we have B, and I see big

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.740
bang. And these are all the pages where I can find

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.160
it. And of course you can do the same thing with

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.620
the web, except instead of numbers, we'd have links to web pages.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.740
This is a common problem, and so there's a design pattern to

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.640
solve. Why don't you take a shot at building your own inverted index?
