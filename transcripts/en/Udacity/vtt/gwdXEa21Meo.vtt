00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.830
As things stand right now,

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.080
the app's templates are just
displaying static HTML.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.020
So no matter which menu item we view,
we always get the same one.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.000
If you recall, every time we generated
a route it updated the router,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.110
created a template for that route and
created a new route file.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.400
In addition to everything
else routes do in Ember,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.260
they're also in charge of
loading the data for that route.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.410
The data, or model, is set or
fetched by this route file.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.070
Let's update our app to
not use static html, but

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.280
instead use dynamic data
set by the route file.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.470
When the URL is /menu,
this line matches.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.130
It calls the menu route and
loads the menu template.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.400
This is what a default
route file looks like.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.240
Some things that are important are that
we have access to the Ember object,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.370
up here, and that when this file is used

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.050
the Ember route class is extended
with an object that we can customize.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.380
A bunch of things happen when a route
is loaded, and Ember gives us specially

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.205
named functions that we can use to
hook into these specific events.

00:01:00.205 --> 00:01:04.620
Ember gives us a number of different
hooks that we can use in a route file.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.870
One of the most important hooks we
can use to gain access to the loading

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.170
of new data is model.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.640
This hook is responsible for
returning the model or data.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.420
Remember what's being
returned is an object.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.580
If this syntax looks weird, it's the
newer style of JavaScript to write this.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.690
Since Ember lives on the freshest
version of JavaScript,

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.310
I'll stick with Ember's standards and
keep my route hooks like this.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.400
I've extracted the data for

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.370
the menu items into a json
file in the public folder.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.020
This file is available
in the instructor notes.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.270
Now, we can use the model hook
to retrieve this data file.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.190
The Ember object has j query
aliased to the dollar, so

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.860
we can use j query to get the file.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.760
Because this is the route model,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.720
the data in the template is
stored in a model variable.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.460
There's a handlebars helper log that
we can use to log out a variable.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.640
Here's that object
logged to the console.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.580
And here are the three menu
items with their data.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.110
Now that we have dynamic data set from
the route, let's update the static

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.490
template with expressions
that will evaluate this data.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.100
First we can get rid of these two and

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.380
leave just this one list
item's HTML structure.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.780
Then let's use that each
helper to loop over the model.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.464
Now it's just updating the static
text with their dynamic counterparts.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.090
These two will change to item.name.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.520
The image here is item.image and
the link will use the item's ID.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.970
Everything still looks the same but

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.390
now it's being dynamically fetched and
displayed.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.010
Great work.
