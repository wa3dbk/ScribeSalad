00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.010
In fact, using electronic medical
records is part of the definition

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.580
of one of the most common forms
of patient centered care,

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.120
the patient centered medical home.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.050
Elsewhere, a key culprit in creating
these coordination problems

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.210
has been paper records.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.640
They can physically be in only one
place and are not easily shared.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.030
Even if shared,

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.930
they may not be easily understood due
to legibility issues or differences

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.740
among physicians in the terms they
use to describe the same thing.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.630
Most of Marla's specialists
use paper records.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.390
Until recently here in the US
most physicians used them.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.290
This is rapidly changing because
of the new federal policies

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.780
we'll explain in lesson two.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.270
Electronic records and
data sharing can help coordinate care.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.430
Here's data from a recent survey
of physicians who are using

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.750
these technologies, and
they substantially agree that it helps.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.320
Improved communication,
more available data.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.300
Interestingly and importantly, both
PCPs and specialists with electronic

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.680
records say care is more coordinated and
communications are improved.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.990
Presumably because data is now
immediately available when and

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.690
where it is needed, as a majority
of these physicians reported.
