But this simplification to 3 5th wont be true for every value of X. There is

00:00:04.585 --> 00:00:09.363
actually one value of X that makes it not true. What value do you think it is?

00:00:09.363 --> 00:00:12.908
You'll want to think back to what you know about fractions and what you know

00:00:12.908 --> 00:00:16.914
about their denominators. Take some time to think, and when you're ready, put

00:00:16.914 --> 00:00:17.853
your answer here.
