00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.690
The same brainstorming sessions there are no bad ideas. Fair enough,

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.580
but at some point you have to call out the ones

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.070
that some counterproductive or incoherent. The first idea here is in

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.790
that category since it makes no sense at all. The input to

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.900
a fragment shader is the point inside a triangle, typically produced

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.085
by triangle set up. The application doesn't feed service points the

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:21.925
GPU. It provides triangles. Even if it fed such points the

00:00:21.925 --> 00:00:25.270
GPU, these points would not normally be properly placed on the screen.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.710
That's something the vertex shader does. Transforms the triangle to screen

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.159
coordinates, so forget idea number one. The second idea is a

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.870
good one, if we know early on that the fragment is

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.390
visible, then we don't have to use the fragment shader at all.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.734
GPUs take advantage of this and so perform the Z-depth test

00:00:40.734 --> 00:00:44.210
early. So, saving not executing that fragment shader's program. This type

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.460
of speed up is called Early-Z, after the fragment is computed,

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.520
its then put into the Z buffer and color image as usual.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.790
However, there's a little subtle catch with this idea, if

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.150
the fragment shader, itself, actually changes the Z-depth value passed

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.840
in. Then you can not safely check this Z-depth before

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.460
running the shader program. That said, about 99.44 of all

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.530
fragment shaders never touch the Z-depth. In fact, in web

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.390
GL it's not currently possible. Though this has been proposed

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.100
as an extension. This third idea of making each core

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.250
be usable as either a vertex a fragment shader is worthwhile.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.390
This in fact ia how modern GP is architected. Vertex and

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.810
fragment shaders are close enough together and functionality that a single core

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.480
can be used as either. This is called a unified shader.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.970
An advantage for the fragment shader bottleneck problem is that such course

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.150
to be allocated on-the-fly. If fragments of piling up, cores are

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.240
assigned to them. If vertices are queued up, cores are moved to

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.250
this area. The first solution doesn't change anything as far as the

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.390
fragment shader goes. The same number of pixels will be covered and

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.120
generate fragments so that the fragment shader still has

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.650
to work as hard. Where's the end, adding more triangles

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.080
means more strain on other parts of the pipeline, such

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.160
as the vertex shader. So, this idea causes more overall

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.172
[UNKNOWN],

00:01:51.172 --> 00:01:52.178
not less.
