Now actually, when you try to compile the code, you'll get an error. The error

00:00:05.693 --> 00:00:10.908
is somewhat curious. It says that gasInTank might not have been initialized.

00:00:10.908 --> 00:00:14.504
So, the error here was that gasInTank, by putting the word double here, has

00:00:14.504 --> 00:00:19.959
turned into a local variable. Not the instance variable that we intended. Let

00:00:19.959 --> 00:00:22.960
me show you another useful way of thinking about instance variables.
