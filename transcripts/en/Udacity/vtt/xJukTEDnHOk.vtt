00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.090
Consider the following set of events on node N1 and node N2. N1 is sending a

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.460
message and the act of sending the message,

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.380
the event associated with that is F. And

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:17.000
A is the act of receiving the same message on node N2. And B is another event on

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.200
node N1. Textually follows this send event. And G is another event on node N2.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.530
Textually follows the receive event G. Now the

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.090
question for you, what can you say about the

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.960
relationship between the events A and B? What

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.590
can you say about the relationship between these two

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.430
events A and B? I'm going to give you

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.450
three choices. The first choice is A happened before

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.460
B, so I'm going to say that is the first

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.620
choice. The second choice I'm going to say is B

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.580
happened before A. And the third choice is neither.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.020
And it's okay if you get it wrong, it's

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.900
just to, sort of, prime the pump for the

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.610
next concept that I'm going to describe to you.
