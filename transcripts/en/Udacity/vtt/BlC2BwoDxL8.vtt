00:00:00.202 --> 00:00:02.518
And of course it stops. So, no, is the right

00:00:02.518 --> 00:00:04.378
answer. But the bizarre thing is, it’s going

00:00:04.378 --> 00:00:06.149
to have an angle, like this one over here,

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:12.984
this might be 101.374819 and so on. And

00:00:12.984 --> 00:00:16.526
this number truly has probability zero. So

00:00:16.526 --> 00:00:18.632
whatever the outcome is, that specific

00:00:18.632 --> 00:00:21.590
outcome will be unlikely, so unlikely as

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.436
probability zero. And this is one of the

00:00:23.436 --> 00:00:25.404
bizarre things about probability when you

00:00:25.404 --> 00:00:27.819
go to continue spaces. In continuous

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:31.254
distributions, every outcome has probability

00:00:31.254 --> 00:00:34.285
zero. And that might sound entirely counterintuitive

00:00:34.285 --> 00:00:38.285
and it is, but it is important to understand.
