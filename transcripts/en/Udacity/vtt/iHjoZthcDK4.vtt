00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.900
This brings us to the end of the lessons
about Google Analytics and Tag Manager.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.520
Hopefully now you know how to add the
code to your app to send tracking data,

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.730
whether you send it directly to Google
Analytics, or send it via Tag Manager.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.720
I've barely scratched the surface in
terms of the data insights you can get

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.180
from Google Analytics.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.220
There's so
much more to say about how to slice and

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.190
dice the data, get custom segments,
send reports, and get custom views.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.740
Our friends over at Google Analytics
Academy have more courses you can take

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.330
focused on to use your Analytics
data to understand and

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.100
improve the way your app is used.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.420
And that's what tracking your
app's usage data is all about.
