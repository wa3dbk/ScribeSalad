00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.779
This statistic here is for a one sample t test. This is just like the z tests

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.681
you learned in lesson nine. It's a one sample t test because we only have one

00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:16.170
sample, with mean x bar. For the first part of this lesson, we'll focus on one

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.170
sample T tests and then later we'll focus on comparing two samples. We want to

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.460
know if the population that this sample comes from is significantly different

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.702
than the population with this mean. Therefore, the null hypothesis is that the

00:00:31.702 --> 00:00:37.418
population mean is equal to some specified value. Mu naught, and the

00:00:37.418 --> 00:00:42.410
alternative hypothesis can be either that mu is less than mu naught, greater

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.610
than mu naught, or just not equal to mu naught. When we calculate the t

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.450
statistic, the numerator is the difference between the sample mean and this

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.350
value, where the sample mean is the point estimate for the population mean mu,

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.310
and the denominator measures the amount of difference between the population

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:07.144
mean and mu naught That we would expect by chance. Again we have our alpha

00:01:07.144 --> 00:01:11.634
levels which are written in the column headers of the t table. The t table

00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:16.420
tells us the t critical values that mark the cut off point for the alpha

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.955
levels. If our t stastics is greater than these t critical values. Or if we get

00:01:22.955 --> 00:01:27.180
a negative T statistic that is less than the negative T critical value cutting

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.663
off that alpha level, then we can reject the null.
