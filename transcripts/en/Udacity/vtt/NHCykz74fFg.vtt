00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now for both physical and mobile channels, there's an art to building a minimum viable product.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Just think about this, an MVP is not a minimal product.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
An MVP is not like, well, we only have three weeks so we cut off the featured list here.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
That's not what an MVP is--an MVP is based on interaction and iteration

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
in understanding customer's needs and pains and gains.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And if all you're doing is cutting off the featured list, then you clearly haven't run the process.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Sometimes we get, but my customers really don't know what they want.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I'm creating something so new and getting out of the building is just a waste of time because if I

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
show them my solution, they're not even going to know what problem I'm talking about.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We're going to be talking about the problem of market type in a subsequent lecture

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but there's a case called the new market where you're right,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
customers have never seen an iPhone before or never seen a new product before.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
In that case, you still want to get out of the building, but instead of asking them about features,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
you actually want to understand how are they spending their time now

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and what solutions are they using to solve their pains and gains.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And so we'll talk about market type later but when you hear people say,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
but my customers don't know what they want, just park that for a while,

00:01:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
because that's not an excuse to stay in the building and keep adding features.
