00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.706
When working through this problem, here's some important points to note. One,

00:00:02.706 --> 00:00:06.807
write down all of your work as you do it. Two, write down and label all the

00:00:06.807 --> 00:00:10.098
values, every intermediate step. You're going to need the values throughout the

00:00:10.098 --> 00:00:16.166
example. And throughout, round every answer to two decimal places. Even when

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:19.468
you're working through a problem, if we're doing these problems for real. In

00:00:19.468 --> 00:00:22.775
other words, these are actual data from an actual research study. We wouldn't

00:00:22.775 --> 00:00:26.646
round to two decimal places throughout, because that adds a rounding error. But

00:00:26.646 --> 00:00:29.748
just for the sake of you understanding how to work these problems and interpret

00:00:29.748 --> 00:00:34.256
them, two decimal places is fine. Here's the start of our problem. According to

00:00:34.256 --> 00:00:39.272
the Gallup organization, US families reported spending an average of $151 per

00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:44.363
week on food in 2012. Now, although, this data came from a sample, we're going

00:00:44.363 --> 00:00:48.608
to pretend that this perfectly represents the whole population. So we're just

00:00:48.608 --> 00:00:54.270
going to assume that this is mu. Make sure you write that down, mu equals 151.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.620
Now, imagine that there's a food cooperative. We'll call them Food Now, and

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.469
they want to reduce their cost of food for their members. To do so, they

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.108
implement some cost-saving programs. This could include things like, buying

00:01:06.108 --> 00:01:08.170
from local growers, and so on.
