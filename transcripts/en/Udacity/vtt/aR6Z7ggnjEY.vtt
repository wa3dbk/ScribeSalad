00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.280
Okay so let's tease out some of the details here. What

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.370
I'd like to do is assemble a complete record for carrier

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.198
and airport for all of the data maintained in this database.

00:00:08.198 --> 00:00:12.980
Okay. So what' I'm talking about here is doing the necessary queries

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.330
against this site. In this case I would need to do

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.040
two queries for each carrier and airport pair. And end up with

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.080
a table of data that looks something like this. Now I

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.140
may decide to store it as a table or JSON. The format

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.960
doesn't matter here. So much is the data wrangling

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.870
from the site. Okay. So, for every carrier and airport

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.840
in a given month, I want to know both

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.680
how many departures and arrivals there were for that airline.
