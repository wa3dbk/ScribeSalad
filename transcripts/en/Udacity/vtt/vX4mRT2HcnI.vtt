00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.040
So let's see what does it
take to have a good cache?

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.150
Or what are the properties
of a good cache?

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.860
We want our system to have a good
average memory access time, or AMAT.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.080
And this is the access time to
memory as seen by the processor.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.630
The AMAT is equal to
the cache's hit time,

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.380
how quickly can it return the data
when we do have a cache hit,

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.700
plus how often do we have a miss,
times the miss penalty.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.210
We want the AMAT to be very low,
the lower the better.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.750
This means that we want the hit time to
be low, which means we want a small and

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.750
fast cache because that will
contribute to having this be low.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.800
We want a low miss rate, which means we
want our cache to be large and/or smart.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.870
If it's a large cache, more stuff will
fit in it, so we will miss less often.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.900
Or if it's smart, it will know better
what to keep inside, so, again,

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.860
we will have fewer misses.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.110
The miss penalty for simple cache is
simply the main memory access time.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.500
This is going to be very large,
usually tens or

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.270
even hundreds of processor cycles.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.160
So really when we are designing caches,
we're trying to balance the hit time and

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.780
the miss rate.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.820
Small and fast versus large and
intelligent, and

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.400
intelligent typically
means slightly slower.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.330
So some caches can be extremely small
and fast, have very good hit time,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.670
but sometimes that's at the expense
of having a larger miss rate.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.950
Some caches will have
a relatively large hit time but

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.280
extremely low miss rates so that we
can reduce the overall contribution

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.400
of main memory accesses that contribute
a lot each time we have them.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.900
Sometimes we also talk about miss time,

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.420
which is the overall time it
takes to have a cache miss.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.980
A miss time is simply the hit time
followed by the miss penalty,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.120
because we try to find what we
have in the cache but fail, and

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.250
then we still have to
pay the miss penalty.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.750
We can also think about miss time is the
memory access time when we are missing.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:14.770
So miss rate is one.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.310
So again, it will be the hit
time plus the miss penalty.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.992
So another way to write the AMAT
expression would be to say that it is 1

00:02:22.992 --> 00:02:25.910
minus miss rate times the hit time.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.050
So this is how often do we have
the hits times the time for the hit.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.670
Plus how often do we have
the misses times the miss time.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.480
Usually we want to use this expression,

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.710
simply because the miss time typically
includes checking whether what

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.665
we have is in the cache followed by
whatever we need to do on a miss.

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:49.870
So somehow, every time it will
have the time it takes to hit but

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.900
sometimes we will also
pay the miss penalty.
