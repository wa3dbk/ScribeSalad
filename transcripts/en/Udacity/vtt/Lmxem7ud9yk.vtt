00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.380
I'm not going to talk about
cross-validation here, but

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.850
if you've never encountered
it in your curriculum,

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.290
I'd strongly recommend
that you learn about it.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.230
I am spending time on this because
it's essential to deep learning

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.810
in particular.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.340
Deep learning has many knobs
that you can tweak, and

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.770
you will be tempted to
tweak them over and over.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.240
You have to be very careful about
overfitting on your test set.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.110
Use the validation set.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.630
How big does your validation and
test sets need to be?

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.240
It depends.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.330
The bigger your validation set
the more precise your numbers will be.
