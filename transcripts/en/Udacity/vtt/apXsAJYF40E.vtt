Before we wrap up this lesson, we are going to talk about power. Remember when

00:00:04.486 --> 00:00:08.410
we talked about type two errors. This was failing to reject the null when we

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.876
should have. We don't want to make type two errors. Which is basically when we

00:00:13.876 --> 00:00:18.840
fail to find treatment affects when they actually exist. Since research is so

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.440
time consuming and expensive, we need to make it more likely that we find

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:28.171
statistical significance when we should. We do this by increasing power, there

00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:32.380
are a lot of things we can do to increase power and I bet you can guess some of

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.727
them, if we are testing the effects of different drugs like we did in the last

00:00:36.727 --> 00:00:43.987
example. Do we want to test more or less peopel do we want to give each drug to

00:00:43.987 --> 00:00:50.326
very similar or very different groups of people. And finally, do we want to

00:00:50.326 --> 00:00:56.696
test a small or large dose of the medication. This is assuming that we'll still

00:00:56.696 --> 00:01:00.531
be safe in the amount of the drug that we give the subjects.
