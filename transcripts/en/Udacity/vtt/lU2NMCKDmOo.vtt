00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:06.140
So the answers are Discrete Event
Simulation and Agent-Based Simulation.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.630
You would justify that
choice by explaining that

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:16.020
these are techniques that are useful for
modeling workflow and process.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.058
Which of course is the objective or
the technique that would be

00:00:20.058 --> 00:00:23.560
used in trying to optimize the workflow
in a suite of operating rooms.
