00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.380
There are several other properties in fault tolerance

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.389
in addition to dependability. One of them is

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:10.184
reliability, and unlike dependability, which is the property

00:00:10.184 --> 00:00:12.047
of the system that we can trust it

00:00:12.047 --> 00:00:15.635
to perform its function, reliability is actually something

00:00:15.635 --> 00:00:19.928
we can measure. To measure reliability, we consider

00:00:19.928 --> 00:00:21.982
the system to always be in one of

00:00:21.982 --> 00:00:25.440
these two states. The normal state is the service

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.200
accomplishment state, so the system is providing

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.470
the service that we want it to provide.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.650
The other state is service interruption. So

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.570
this is, at this time, the service is

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.420
not providing, it's not accomplishing the service that we expect from it. So

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.870
reliability can now be defined by measuring continuous service

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.870
accomplishment. A typical measure for reliability is mean

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.200
time to failure or MTTF. And that basically

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.110
is how long do we have service accomplishment before

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.960
we get into the next service interruption. So it's not enough, for example,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.702
that over the past two years the

00:01:07.702 --> 00:01:10.449
system has been in service accomplishing for one

00:01:10.449 --> 00:01:13.114
year. If we have a system that

00:01:13.114 --> 00:01:16.216
accomplishes service for a month, then is interrupted

00:01:16.216 --> 00:01:18.790
for a month, then accomplishes service again

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.232
because it's been fixed, then it's again

00:01:21.232 --> 00:01:25.390
interrupted for a month, in that case, the main time to failure will be one

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.751
month. That's how long you have of

00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:31.771
continuous service accomplishment, on average, between periods of

00:01:31.771 --> 00:01:35.800
service interruption. Another popular metric related to

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.010
this is the availability. Availability measures service accomplishment

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.630
as a fraction of overall time. So reliability measures how long do we get

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.462
service accomplishment until the next failure. Availability

00:01:51.462 --> 00:01:54.558
measures what percentage of time were we in

00:01:54.558 --> 00:02:00.830
the service accomplishment state. So if the system on average was half in this

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.997
state and half in this state, then availability will be 50%. 50% of the time,

00:02:06.997 --> 00:02:11.238
the system was accomplishing service. But reliability

00:02:11.238 --> 00:02:13.870
will be on average how long each of

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.006
these accomplishment states lasted until we saw the

00:02:18.006 --> 00:02:21.840
interruption. So for example, if you have one

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.670
year of service followed by one year of service interruption you get 50% here,

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.190
you get one year here. If you get one month at a time for two years you get

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.127
50% here, but you get one month here

00:02:35.127 --> 00:02:39.096
instead of one year. So for availability, in

00:02:39.096 --> 00:02:41.680
addition to the mean time to failure, we

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.188
need to know the mean time to repair, or

00:02:44.188 --> 00:02:46.468
MTTR, so this is once the system has

00:02:46.468 --> 00:02:49.736
service interruption how long does it last until it

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:53.568
goes back to the service accomplishment state. And

00:02:53.568 --> 00:02:57.800
then our availability is the mean time to failure.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.280
How long did it function properly at the time, divided by the overall

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.150
time, which was the mean time to failure plus the mean time to repair.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.953
After that, you're back in the accomplishment state. So this is how long we

00:03:10.953 --> 00:03:14.541
had both service accomplishment and service interruption,

00:03:14.541 --> 00:03:17.270
and this is just the service accomplishment.
