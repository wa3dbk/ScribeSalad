00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.383
This one works in this case, but you could imagine cases where it wouldn't

00:00:03.383 --> 00:00:07.124
work. For example, what if the wall was very thin and actually is just right in

00:00:07.124 --> 00:00:11.484
here, then this wouldn't work anymore. Now however, the swept area does work no

00:00:11.484 --> 00:00:15.982
matter how fast the rocket is moving. The swept area will still collide with

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:19.520
anything that is in the rocket's path between the two time steps, which is

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.480
really what we're looking for.
