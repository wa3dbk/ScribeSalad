00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.260
You might have been wondering this whole time how exactly is D3 data driven.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.890
And when do we manipulate our graphic based on our data?

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.870
Well without using Dimple JS we have to be rather explicit and

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.380
a little bit more verbose.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.700
But are afforded much greater flexibility.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.160
And you could pose a chart as a question like this.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.600
How do I draw circle for

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.500
every row of my data at the appropriate place on my axises?

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.750
And the most natural answer to this question, at least in java script,

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.220
is exactly that, a for loop.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.150
Again how do I draw a circle for every row of my data?

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:46.040
Well, we could iterate through every row in our data and

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.220
for each row draw our circle with the value of that row.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.770
And while this is partially pseudocode,

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.800
this could be a perfectly sensible way to think about drawing a chart.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.210
Dependent on data in a very JavaScripty way.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.830
Notice how we have to be very explicit and procedural in how we

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.890
tell the computer to draw a circle for every row in our data.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.370
But this seems a little bit cumbersome especially if the structure of

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.010
our data changes.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.260
We want to use a different data file.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.190
We want to draw a different shape altogether.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.200
Or if we want our chart to adapt to some interaction from the user.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.210
Very early on when I introduced D3 I

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.730
told you that one of the strengths of the library it's declarative syntax.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.120
Or rather you tell D3 what you want rather than how you want it to do it.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.260
Again in a pure JavaScript approach.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.350
We have to be very procedural with the computer and

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.000
specify step by step what it needs to do to create our chart.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.260
With D3 on the other hand we simply specify what we want,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.030
circles, data in an SVG element.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.960
And D3 figures out how to best draw our chart.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.630
And one of the most mystical, yet powerful,

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.300
features of D3 is the data bind, performed through the .data function.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.250
The data variable here is the same data variable that's passed to the call back

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.405
of our data loading function, such as D3.json, D3.csv,

00:02:24.405 --> 00:02:28.170
or D3.tsv which loads our data file.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.230
And if we inspect what data actually is, which we'll see in a little bit,

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.480
just as with our dimple example, it's simply a JavaScript array.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.050
Filled with JavaScript objects that represent our external file we loaded.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.440
Again, this chaining syntax is hopefully very familiar to you now.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.650
Each subsequent function gets called on the previous return value,

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.860
transforming the object as it gets passed down the chain.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.270
The first statement here find the SVG element on the page which we want.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.468
And since there's only one, we simply need to use select.

00:03:00.468 --> 00:03:06.290
We then sub-select all the circles contained in that SVG element but

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.480
let's pause here.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.020
This is usually where it breaks down for people.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.120
How can you select circles when if this is our first time drawing this

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.390
chart there won't be any circles on the page until we append them?

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.020
What are the circles that we're actually selecting.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.210
Well if we simply select circles when there are none we get the empty selection.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.020
Well then you might be asking,

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.940
if it's an empty section how can you bind data to nothing?

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.450
Well, I would argue, you bind the data to the circles that will be there.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.140
Well, this might seem somewhat circular reasoning, no pun intended.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.600
But let's break down and

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.860
really understand what's going on in this snippet of code.
