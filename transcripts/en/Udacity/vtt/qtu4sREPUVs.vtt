00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.170
At this point you experienced and
are starting to build mastery in

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.680
a lot of the key ideas that
underline all of programming.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.010
And what that means is,
now you have options.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.610
The point of the rest of this noun
degree is to expose you to what some of

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:13.280
those options are.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.670
Because there is a ton of cool
things you can do at this point.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.070
Now, because we're gong for exposure,
and not mastery, we're going to go

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.860
quick, and there's going to be times
where that feels really overwhelming.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.340
On top of that, when you go
to the forums and you ask for

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.930
help, there's a good chance a coach
may not even know the answer.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.620
That's to be expected.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.970
Instead, you should expect to get advice
about how to solve problems in general,

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.740
rather than specific
answers to your question.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.740
Good luck, and have fun.
