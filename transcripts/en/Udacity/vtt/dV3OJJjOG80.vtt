00:00:00.242 --> 00:00:02.305
So let's look at those results.

00:00:02.305 --> 00:00:09.455
On my laptop we had a maximum number of threads running of 2048 out of a maximum possible of 2048.

00:00:09.455 --> 00:00:13.621
This means that as long as we have enough thread blocks to fill the machine,

00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:17.922
enough thread blocks to run on all the SMs, then we should get 100% occupancy.

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:23.660
On the other hand, the Fermi GPUs that Amazon uses and that Udacity runs on were limited to

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.400
a maximum number of threads running at 1024 out of a maximum possible of 1536,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.004
and this means that we're going to achieve at best 66% occupancy, okay,

00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:38.442
so occupancy refers to the percentage of threads that are actually running versus the

00:00:38.442 --> 00:00:41.544
number of threads that actually could be running.

00:00:41.544 --> 00:00:47.717
There's a useful tool that's a spreadsheet in the CUDA tool kit installation called the CUDA Occupancy Calendar

00:00:47.717 --> 00:00:52.890
that let's you just plug in your numbers and see how your kernels are going to perform in terms of occupancy

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.991
on all the various GPU's that have existed over time.
