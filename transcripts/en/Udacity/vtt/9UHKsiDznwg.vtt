00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.730
Now, we talked earlier in this lecture about kind

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.130
of the, the basic approaches to Scaling. We said, the

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.500
first one was optimize the code. And when we're

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.050
talking about a database we're probably not optimizing code but

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.930
this, this was, this stage of thinking means, you

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.820
know, have the appropriate indexes. You know, make sure the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.190
query is sane. You know, make sure you're only querying

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.350
for things that you actually need. If the query's simple,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.420
and all those types of things. We're not going to do that here,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.730
because our query is actually very simple, and Google App Engine makes our

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.320
indices for us. But this is always the first thing you want to

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.330
check. If the index App Engine makes isn't optimal for the query you're

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.910
running, you may have to make something by hand. You should always start

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.770
here. You know, the first step is limit the work the database needs

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.710
to do in the worst case. Let's assume we've already done that, because

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.640
we have, for ASCII chan. Something else

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.540
we talked about was, adding more machines.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.380
We don't really have control over that, in this particular situation

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.450
App Engine manages that for us. If you're not using App Engine,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.360
maybe you need to add more machines. Maybe you need to start

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.970
doing replication, or sharding, or those techniques. Now, if you've ever tried

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.510
to do those techniques on your own you know, that they're very

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.390
difficult, they're very complex. An this is usually, adding more machines when

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.240
you're talking about a database, is kind of the last resort for

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.950
scaling. Something else we talked about was using big machines again we

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.050
don't have a whole lot of control over that in App Engine. I

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.590
think you can upgrade machines a little bit but, you know, let's, let's

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.460
say we're, we're, we're done messing with that, or maybe we're tired of

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.110
paying for database queries, an we just want to get to the, the fun part.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.590
The, what we're going to spend this lecture talking about, we' re just cache

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.810
it. A very simple thing we can do after we've optimized the database,

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.200
and we don't want to fiddle with more system administration is Cache this query.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.960
You know in ASCIIchan the front page

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.840
of ASCIIchan only changes when somebody submits.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.960
So that means it's a good opportunity to Cache what we

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.460
actually store. And that is what I'm going to do right now,

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.710
is add a little bit of Cache to ASCIIchan. Okay, you

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.070
all remember ASCIIchan, it's online at ASCIIchan.com. You remember how it works

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.910
we can type in a title and then we can draw

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.790
some ASCII art or in my case Paste it. And when

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.560
you submit the art you see a listing of all the

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.050
previous arts submitted to ASCIIChan. The way this works in the code,

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.560
when you do a get on ASCIIChan, when you call

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.795
this function called render_front, which is defined here. Okay, so this

00:02:11.795 --> 00:02:14.530
render_front function, basically, what it does is it runs this

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.430
data star query, written in Gql, that looks up the ten

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.520
most recent pieces of art. So limit ten, that's how

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.350
we know we're looking up ten. Order by created descending, so

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.940
that orders them by the time they were created. This

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.220
where ancestor equals art key is a data store technique for

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.610
basically insuring your query is consistent. I kind of wanted to talk

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.460
about that in unit 3 but things seem to be getting a

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.380
little complex. If you read the data store docs you, and kind

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.100
of search for the word consistent, you will see what this technique is

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.210
referring to so anyway not super important for our purposes so you

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.370
know why that's there, it's not required. If I got rid of this

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.950
at our scale, this site would behave exactly the same. So then

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.650
what we do is we actually run that query, remember, this just defines

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.770
the query. When you iterate over the query, or in my

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.000
case turn it into a list, that's when you actually go

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.790
to the database and, and get the results back. Remember I

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.170
turn it into a list here so that I don't accidently run

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.780
the query twice when I iterate over it again here, and

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.430
then again when we actually render the page. I just want to

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.410
run the query once. So, what we want to do is cache

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.860
this query because our front page isn't going to change very often. Most

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.020
Users come to ASCIIChen and just look at the front page.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.700
We don't need to hit the database over, and over, and

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.500
over again every time a user does that. That's just going to

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.140
cost us money, you know, waste Google's resources, and generally just make

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.610
the world a worst place, so. First thing I'm going to do,

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.310
is I'm going to pull out this piece of code into it's

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.770
own function so it's a little easier to manage. Okay, I'm

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.880
going to call this function Top arts. It's not going to take any parameters

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.070
because we're just returning we know what the query's going to be,

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.020
the query's going to be the same every time. Okay so all I've

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.490
done is I've created this function top_arts and I copied this code.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.040
Actually I cut this code from render_front and moved it into this

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.860
function and then we we make the query, we run the

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.950
query, and then we return the result. And then in render front,

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.240
we just call the top arts function, so everything should behave as

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.440
it did before. We can go ahead and give that a test.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.920
Here's a front page with our art, and if I were to

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.040
reload this page, we see that nothing's changed. So, nothing big there,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.040
we didn't expect anything to change, and nothing did, okay? So let's

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.010
go back to the code and start making our improvements. Now, one thing

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.340
we're going to want to do is we want to have a way

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.560
of telling ourselves when we're actually running this query so we can actually

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.710
test to make sure our code is working. Now I am not

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.610
a Google App Engine pro, but I am going to add a little

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.360
statement like this. Login.error and we will say that this

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.200
db query. This will print in our error console, the string

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.410
db query. Now normally you should use login.debug for this

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.190
purpose. But the debug mode in app engine is driving me

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.620
nuts right now. So, this'll be a little bit easier

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.230
for me to demonstrate. I'm going to have to also import the

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.270
logging module for this to work. I'll go ahead and do

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.570
that, just import logging. So, this should print in the console,

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.400
every time we run a DB query. And let's see if that

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.020
works. So, here is ASCIIchan and I am going to hit reload on

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.080
this page and I am going to go to the terminal, and you

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.190
can see that I am printing error and DB query that is my

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.660
string and we can also see the browser fetched slash which is the

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.450
actual request to asciichan, and also the request of favicon since I haven't

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.100
created it. Just 404s. So now we have this printing and we can

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.580
see that everytime I reload the page in the browser and we get

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.600
these lines again and I see we get the words DB Query, right

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.350
before the request. What we want to do is we want to get rid of

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.010
these words without just commenting out

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.830
the logging statement. Okay, so let's add

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.700
some caching and we're going to use the same algorithm that we used on that

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.970
quiz that, that you guys just

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.090
implemented. We're going to create a dictionary and

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.030
we're going to call it cache. Now, we have to have a key to cache,

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.090
I usually like to store my keys in a variable. In this case

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.780
I'm just going to call the key Top. This is how we're going to store the,

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.890
how we're going to reference the result of this query

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.510
in our cache. And then I'm just going to change we're

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.760
just going to rewrite this function to use the caching

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:06.230
algorithm. So if key in cache, arts equals CACH key.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.070
Else, we want to run our query. So, we run

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.540
our query in the out statement and of course we

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.490
want to store the result of our query in

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.670
the cache. And then we return our arts. Okay, so,

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.950
pretty simple change. Now we're caching the result of this one query.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.230
Let's see if it works, we go to our browser, I hit

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.420
reload. The page loads with no error, so that's good. And then

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.310
I go to my console and I see that it printed out

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.220
DB QUERY, and has the results. Now if I were to reload

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.720
this page again again, no error. And I go back to the

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.170
console, and I can see that we made a, a second request.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.170
Here it is, GET slash, but this time there's no DB QUERY. So

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.310
if I were to go to our front page and hit Reload

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.270
Trust me that I'm doing it. You can kind of see it

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.730
blinking a little bit over and over again and then, I go

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.990
back to the console, I can see a bunch of requests that

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.140
note, DB queries. That's pretty cool, huh? So now our front page

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.265
is a lot faster, let's submit a new piece of art to

00:07:01.265 --> 00:07:04.440
ASCIIchan here, or at least, my local ASCIIChan. It's going to be a

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.430
picture of beer, looks like it's from Hofbra House. I click submit,

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.040
huh my beer did not appear I still have

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.690
my original art from before. What do you think happened.
