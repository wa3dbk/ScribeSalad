00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.910
As the program runs, it will be building
up internal data stores for keeping

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.420
track of all the variables that are
available to different function objects.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.330
And I'm going to picture that
stuff over here on the right.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.250
This will be a diagram or
a picture of our in-memory system.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.940
Since each new run of
a function is supposed

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.540
to operate in complete isolation
from all the previous runs,

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.250
a new execution context should be
created every time you run a function.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.725
Thus, for each lexical scope
there may be many in-memory

00:00:29.725 --> 00:00:33.095
scopes created during execution,
or there may be none.

00:00:33.095 --> 00:00:36.915
It all depends on how many times you
run a given function in your code.

00:00:36.915 --> 00:00:40.895
To examine execution contexts,
we'll need to actually run this program.

00:00:40.895 --> 00:00:42.827
So let's simulate that here.

00:00:42.827 --> 00:00:45.597
The yellow arrow will point
to the position in the code

00:00:45.597 --> 00:00:49.567
where our simulated interpreter has
reached, sort of like a debugger.

00:00:49.567 --> 00:00:53.147
Before this first line of code even
runs, the interpreter will start out

00:00:53.147 --> 00:00:55.940
by setting up an execution
environment for you.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.140
The first step will be to create
an in-memory global scope context

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.310
to hold all of the global variables.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.110
So let's visualize that
execution context data store

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.260
off to the right here.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.270
We'll use a similar color as the lexical
scope region that it relates to.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.230
Here, our interpreter is building up
a storage system for the global scope.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.720
The yellow border is around the
interpreter's current execution context.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.690
That is to say,

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.460
whichever one the interpreter
starts its variable lookups in.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.600
So far, the global context
is the only one that exists.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.140
So of course, it's the current scope.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.080
As the first line of code runs,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.730
the interpreter builds up a new key
value mapping inside of the execution

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.290
context, in order to keep track of the
value that is bound to the name, hero.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.250
The aHero function randomly
generated the value Gal,

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.560
which will be stored
in the hero variable.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.970
Like the line above it, this line
implies a simple assignment operation.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.020
Now the value being assigned is
a function that spans several lines.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.510
But the interpreter's going to ignore
all the red and the blue code for now.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.470
They will only get run when
the function is actually called.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.900
So, that line of code has the effect
of adding a new key value pair

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.880
to our global scope context.
