00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.372
Your organization has done a few trials looking at treating post traumatic

00:00:04.372 --> 00:00:09.276
stress disorder with MDMA. And a few questions, one, why MDMA out of all the

00:00:09.276 --> 00:00:12.772
drugs, to use, if you could address that first.

00:00:12.772 --> 00:00:18.800
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Actually the, the last surviving person with legal permission to give LSD

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.674
was a Doctor Bostians in Holland. And he worked with LSD with concentration

00:00:24.674 --> 00:00:29.360
camp survivors. And a lot of the concentration camp survivors, not were only

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.496
Jews, but Dutch resistance fighters, and they later became part of the Dutch

00:00:32.496 --> 00:00:37.490
Government. And they protected him, and there was a book that was written by an

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.740
Isreali holocaust survivor who went to the Netherlands to receive LSD as part

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.868
of his treatment. And the book is terrific. It's called Shivitti, A Vision. But

00:00:46.868 --> 00:00:50.733
it's very difficult to read. Not only because he's sharing some of the things

00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:54.373
that happened to him during the concentration camp, but because LSD itself is

00:00:54.373 --> 00:01:02.002
very challenging. And MDMA on the other hand is gentle in a profound way. So,

00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:05.404
when they tried to figure out what would be the drug that would be most likely

00:01:05.404 --> 00:01:08.860
to make it through the system first and become approved as, as a medicine with

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.382
psychedelic drug would make it first. And then also, what clinical conditions

00:01:15.382 --> 00:01:19.504
should we pick? And so, I spent a lot of time strategically trying to evaluate

00:01:19.504 --> 00:01:24.710
that. the reason why MDMA, I think, is the top choice is because it's not that

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.728
fundamentally different from our normal way of processing. That people when

00:01:30.728 --> 00:01:34.433
they take MDMA, they don't have the same kind of challenge to their logical

00:01:34.433 --> 00:01:39.230
train of thought. So, we felt that MDMA would be something that psychiatrists

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.049
and psychotherapists would be more willing to experiment with on their own. So

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.757
that they could be more effective therapists. And then, MDMA, because of the

00:01:48.757 --> 00:01:54.238
way that it reduces fear reactions, it's got an ideal treatment for post

00:01:54.238 --> 00:02:01.349
traumatic stress disorder. It works really well. And also there's not a lot of

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:05.636
effective treatments for PTSD out there. Zoloft and Paxil are the only

00:02:05.636 --> 00:02:10.560
medications that are available. And they are marginally effective. Most people

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.249
say they're not very effective at all. And then, there's a lot of

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:17.901
psychotherapies that have been developed, like prolonged exposure. And they

00:02:17.901 --> 00:02:22.664
work in a significant group of people. But there's a lot of people for whom the

00:02:22.664 --> 00:02:27.784
available treatments don't work. So, all of that came together. And the other

00:02:27.784 --> 00:02:32.269
thing about MDMA, we, we call it our aikido strategy of research, which is that

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:39.088
there are hundreds of millions of dollars, about $300 million. We estimate have

00:02:39.088 --> 00:02:45.265
been spent on scientific studies about what's bad with MDMA. And they're all in

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:48.017
the public domain, and they've been funded by governments in the world since

00:02:48.017 --> 00:02:53.109
the middle 80s to try to justify prohibition. And, because of that, we're a

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:57.780
small non-profit. If we had to think about making a drug into a medicine and we

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.358
had to spend 300 million on safety studies, we, we'd never get it. So, we're

00:03:02.358 --> 00:03:06.648
taking all of this energy to demonize MDMA and turning it around, and saying we

00:03:06.648 --> 00:03:12.766
have an incredible information about the safety profile. So, in a way, we

00:03:12.766 --> 00:03:16.246
want to focus on demonized drugs that have been used by tens of millions of

00:03:16.246 --> 00:03:21.338
people illegally. Because the FDA, when they approve a drug, it's been approved

00:03:21.338 --> 00:03:27.058
on the basis of several thousand people, at the most. But the 100,000 risk that

00:03:27.058 --> 00:03:31.470
happens, somebody dies from this or that. Or like allergies to penicillin, or

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.124
aspirin. People die from those things. But you don't find it in the context of

00:03:35.124 --> 00:03:39.234
working with a few thousand people. So, with MDMA, where it's been used by

00:03:39.234 --> 00:03:44.076
millions and millions of people, we know the risk profile. So, it was a

00:03:44.076 --> 00:03:48.236
combination of the gentleness and the profound nature of MDMA and it's effect

00:03:48.236 --> 00:03:53.433
on fear. And there's a disease, PTSD, that's accepted by FDA, and there's an

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:59.046
excellent measure, the CAPS, the clinician administered PTSD scale. And what's

00:03:59.046 --> 00:04:02.822
really good is that the progress that people make therapeutically is mapped

00:04:02.822 --> 00:04:08.089
very carefully by the CAPS, in contrast to work with end of life. So that we

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:12.184
have people so the whole work was psychedelics with LSD and Psilocybin and

00:04:12.184 --> 00:04:17.945
MDMA, for end of life, it's more difficult to make that into a medicine.

00:04:17.945 --> 00:04:22.040
Because when people become ready to die, that's not so clearly captured on the

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.946
state trade anxiety inventory or measures that have been used by the FDA to

00:04:25.946 --> 00:04:32.026
approve drugs for anxiety. So, it's, it's a combination of all these factors

00:04:32.026 --> 00:04:37.716
that lead us to think about MDMA as our drug and PTSD as our condition. So,

00:04:37.716 --> 00:04:41.746
that's our basic model and people, because of what we're trying to do, meaning

00:04:41.746 --> 00:04:45.962
making this drug into a prescription medicine and because there's such concerns

00:04:45.962 --> 00:04:52.805
about the risks of MDMA, we've decided to work with the hardest cases. So, we

00:04:52.805 --> 00:04:56.120
work with people that are chronic PTSD, which means they've had it for at least

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.264
six months. And once somebody has had PTSD for six months, they're not likely

00:05:00.264 --> 00:05:04.281
to get better on their own. And we work only with people that have failed on

00:05:04.281 --> 00:05:07.609
other treatments, so we were with chronic treatment resistant, people with

00:05:07.609 --> 00:05:13.301
PTSD. Our first study mostly women, survivors of childhood sexual abuse, had

00:05:13.301 --> 00:05:16.795
PTSD an average of over 19 years. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Wow.

00:05:16.795 --> 00:05:20.890
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And had failed on multiple courses of drugs and therapy. And over 80% of them

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:26.015
no longer had PTSD at the end of the, two months after their last MDMA session.

00:05:26.015 --> 00:05:30.214
So, the setting, we call it our psychedelic bed and breakfast. It's [LAUGH]. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [LAUGH].

00:05:30.214 --> 00:05:36.140
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It's a really beautiful, it's actually, it's an office that used to be a home.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.691
So, it's, and it's an area of Charleston, South Carolina that's been renovated,

00:05:39.691 --> 00:05:44.470
so it's all commercial. But it has a kitchen in it. It has a place for a night

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.930
attendant to spend the night. we let people bring in some of their family

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.242
members, if they want to at night. we tend to let people at the end of the day

00:05:53.242 --> 00:05:58.398
bring their family members in also, if they wanted a the therapy session. And

00:05:58.398 --> 00:06:00.424
it's a male-female co-therapist team. So, the essence of their model is this

00:06:00.424 --> 00:06:08.160
two person team because they're there for eight hours. And the other, you know,

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.092
they can take breaks a little bit to go eat or go to the bathroom. But we want

00:06:12.092 --> 00:06:16.388
one person there always with the subject. And then, the idea of the male female

00:06:16.388 --> 00:06:20.158
team is that if we can sort of model successful communication lot of people

00:06:20.158 --> 00:06:24.160
have not had you know, supportive parents or their relationships haven't been

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.362
so good. And also, for safety. Some women have been raped or something, to have

00:06:30.362 --> 00:06:36.012
just one person there. You know, a man therapist is kind of risky also. So, for

00:06:36.012 --> 00:06:40.230
all these different reasons, we have a male female team. We're experimenting

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.365
now, where one of the team would need to be a licensed psychiatrist or

00:06:43.365 --> 00:06:47.782
therapist. And the other could be a student learning to be a social worker or

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:52.960
learning to be a psychologist or psychotherapist. And so, that accomplishes two

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.965
things. It reduces our costs, so that, because we're able to fund this only

00:06:56.965 --> 00:07:01.314
through donations. But it also provides a way to train the next generation of

00:07:01.314 --> 00:07:02.528
therapists.

00:07:02.528 --> 00:07:05.549
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Can you talk a little bit about the properties and how you can use that

00:07:05.549 --> 00:07:08.941
therapeutically and why kids say it's a psychedelic, what they're trying to

00:07:08.941 --> 00:07:11.190
experience?

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.940
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I think there's a, maybe it will help to describe the difference between

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:20.654
LSD and MDMA. And so, there's a way in which LSD dissolves the ego, dissolves

00:07:20.654 --> 00:07:26.690
the, the control structures of our brain. And then, people are sort of flooded

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:31.222
with more material that they've been trying to suppress. And then, also they

00:07:31.222 --> 00:07:34.699
can have the sense of connection, where a lot of information that they've

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:39.496
suppressed. Once the things come to the surface, they can feel more connected

00:07:39.496 --> 00:07:43.034
and the sense of unity is what then is the epitome, sort of the mystical

00:07:43.034 --> 00:07:48.150
experience. So, the classic psychedelics lead more towards this kind of

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:53.064
psychedelic mystical experience. MDMA, on the other hand, strengthens the ego,

00:07:53.064 --> 00:07:58.206
it strengthens self acceptance. And it doesn't challenge the ego. But you

00:07:58.206 --> 00:08:01.846
become so comfortable in yourself that you can become less self-centered in a

00:08:01.846 --> 00:08:08.143
way and see the wider world. there was a linguist at Harvard that was looking

00:08:08.143 --> 00:08:13.752
for reading the transcripts of our sessions. And she did an analysis. And she

00:08:13.752 --> 00:08:17.596
figured out how to tell who got the placebo and who got the MDMA, in a way that

00:08:17.596 --> 00:08:22.795
none of us noticed. And what she figured out is at one point or another the

00:08:22.795 --> 00:08:27.668
people who got the MDMA asked the therapists how they were feeling.

00:08:27.668 --> 00:08:29.792
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh. [LAUGH].

00:08:29.792 --> 00:08:32.438
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So that you, you're more attenuated to the other, which is why its so good for

00:08:32.438 --> 00:08:36.847
couples therapy or couples for relationships. The other thing is that MDMA

00:08:36.847 --> 00:08:41.089
stimulates oxytocin and prolactin. So, the hormones of nursing of bonding of

00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:45.115
love, of relationships are stimulated by MDMA, so people feel more related and

00:08:45.115 --> 00:08:51.032
more connected. Which is why we're starting a new project for MDMA for autistic

00:08:51.032 --> 00:08:52.208
adults.

00:08:52.208 --> 00:08:53.712
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Wow.

00:08:53.712 --> 00:08:56.226
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And it's not, I mean logically, it makes sense. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Mm-hm.

00:08:56.226 --> 00:08:58.978
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But what really started us is that they're in the age of the Internet, there's

00:08:58.978 --> 00:09:01.515
all of these people who are doing all these different drugs and posting

00:09:01.515 --> 00:09:06.470
reports. And there's a large number of reports on the internet of people who

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:10.010
are Asperger's or autism who took MDMA on their own and could understand

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:13.918
emotions and could communicate better.

00:09:13.918 --> 00:09:14.649
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Fascinating.

00:09:14.649 --> 00:09:18.477
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And there's a woman Alicia Danforth, who's speaking at the conference, who did

00:09:18.477 --> 00:09:22.305
her PHD dissertation on contacting all those people as many where she could

00:09:22.305 --> 00:09:28.980
identify and ask them how MDMA was useful to them. And on the basis of that,

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.052
we've designed a protocol and we've submitted to the FDA we should be hearing

00:09:32.052 --> 00:09:35.076
any day now or next week whether the FDA will accept this protocol or whether

00:09:35.076 --> 00:09:40.680
they want us to make some changes. But we feel pretty good that the FDA will

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.605
say yes.

00:09:41.605 --> 00:09:45.259
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But I think the application of MDMA to Autism to people that don't know how to

00:09:45.259 --> 00:09:50.666
read emotions in others and don't really understand their own emotions. Its a

00:09:50.666 --> 00:09:53.704
tremendous opportunity, and I think a lot of it has to do with this hormonal

00:09:53.704 --> 00:09:55.760
release aspect of MDMA.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.063
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right, excellent. Well, fascinating stuff. Thank you so much for your time we

00:09:59.063 --> 00:10:00.230
really appreciate it.
