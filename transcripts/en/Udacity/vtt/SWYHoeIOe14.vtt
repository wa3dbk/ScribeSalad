Athena's $300 is going to be multiplied by 1 plus the interest rate written as

00:00:05.273 --> 00:00:11.767
a decimal, so 0.05. And that multiplying is going to happen four times, since

00:00:11.767 --> 00:00:17.632
interest will be compounded four times in four years. We can, of course, use

00:00:17.632 --> 00:00:25.559
our wonderful calculator to multiply this out. 1 plus 0.05 is just 1.05. And

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:35.910
this raised to the 4th power is this quantity. We want to multiply that by 300.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.707
That gives us 364.651875. Rounding to cents, that gives us $364.65.
