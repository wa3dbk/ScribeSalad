00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.618
Let's summarize what we've learned in the past few quizzes. We can finally fill

00:00:03.618 --> 00:00:07.974
in the last detail of our rational zero theorem. If some polynomial, f of x

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:12.414
has, rational zeros, then they will be of the form x equals plus or minus a

00:00:12.414 --> 00:00:17.200
positive factor of the constant term of f of x, over a positive factor of the

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:24.892
leading coefficient of f of x. Now if we call this rational zero p over q, then

00:00:24.892 --> 00:00:30.550
p and q only have a common factor of 1. In other words, we have to write these

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.935
zeros as fractions in lowest terms, or in simplest form. So, as we saw in the

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:39.717
previous quiz, instead of having 2 over 6, we need to write 1 over 3 instead,

00:00:39.717 --> 00:00:45.650
or else we'll mess up our factors. Provided that these requirements are met,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.412
especially that p over q is in simplest terms, then q x minus p will be a

00:00:49.412 --> 00:00:54.762
factor of f of x. You'll have plenty of opportunities to practice using the

00:00:54.762 --> 00:00:59.693
rational zero theorem in our question section, after this lesson. Great job.
