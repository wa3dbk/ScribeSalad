00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.950
So far, we've seen how a developer might interact with the

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.689
file system to the positioned based or cursor based aisle. It's

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:09.186
also possible, however, to interact with a file in a way

00:00:09.186 --> 00:00:12.250
that let's us treat it just like memory. As before, we

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.440
begin by opening a file with the open procedure. Instead of

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.880
using read and write on the file, however, we call mmap.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.780
This returns a pointer to a region of memory that we

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.390
can manipulate in our code. And eventually, whatever changes we make

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.730
to the memory, get reflected in the file. When we're done with the file, we

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.430
call munmap, which syncs the contents of memory with the file and then frees up

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.620
the memory. And lastly, we can close

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.160
the file as before. Again, I'm skipping over

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.820
most of the details here so that you

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.630
can learn them through a little programming exercise.
