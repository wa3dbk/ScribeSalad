00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is cool! You made it! You now understand the very basics of hypothesis testing.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We talked about critical regions. We talked about null hypothesis.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We defined the critical region in the one-sided test and in the two-sided test.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And assuming that the null hypothesis was correct is the actual outcome

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
fell into the critical region, we become suspicious and reject the hypothesis.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Whereas, if it was 95% consistent with the null hypothesis,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
we'd be okay and that's the essence of hypothesis testing.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Next time we'll tie this concept together with confidence intervals

00:00:44.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and some of the more advanced statistic concepts we've learned when sampling from data.
