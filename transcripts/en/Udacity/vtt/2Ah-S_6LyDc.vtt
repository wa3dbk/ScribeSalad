That was a lot of new information, let's take some time to digest it before

00:00:03.358 --> 00:00:08.505
moving on. What will happen if I tried to declare a variable house of type

00:00:08.505 --> 00:00:14.220
house and then create a new dog and try to put that into the variable house.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.999
Will, the program declare a variable of type house and store a new dog in it.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.794
Will we get an error in compatible types because dog is not a kind of house? Or

00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:27.590
will we get an error dog is abstract cannot be instantiated?
