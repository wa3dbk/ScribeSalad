Pete, this has been a really
fun whirlwind tour of

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.570
everything somebody would need
to start developing responsibly.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:06.689
&gt;&gt; It has.

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.290
We've learned to the basics of
well-sized elements for mobile.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.390
Using breakpoints and

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.650
media queries, to change the page
layout for different devices.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.000
Common responsive design patterns, and

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.910
we've gone into some advance techniques,
like minor breakpoints.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.170
At this point,
you've got all the tools and

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.480
concepts you need to build
amazing responsive sites.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.520
&gt;&gt; You know, and I think it's fair to
say that, all you need now, is an idea

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.520
for a site, and some time to let your
content inform your responsive design.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.470
&gt;&gt; Go build something awesome.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.880
Good luck, and have fun.
