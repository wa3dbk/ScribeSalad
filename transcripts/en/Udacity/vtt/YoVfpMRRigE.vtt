00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.410
Today we'll talk about frames. Frames are a very powerful and

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.260
very common knowledge representation. Frames are our first step,

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.230
a basic unit towards building a creative common sense reasoning. They'll also

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.930
come up in several other topics, such as understanding. We'll begin by talking

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.560
about the function of frames, what are they useful for, and what makes them so

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.000
useful. Then we'll talk about several properties of frames. We'll relate

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.180
the knowledge representation of frames with other knowledge representations,

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.170
such as semantic networks and production systems. And finally, we will

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.730
show how frames can be very useful for sense-making. For story understanding.
