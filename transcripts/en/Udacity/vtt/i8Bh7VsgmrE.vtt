00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.185
So for this quiz, I want you to play around with the code and the web server and

00:00:03.185 --> 00:00:07.128
see if you can figure out how it's working. And then, to modify the server code.

00:00:07.128 --> 00:00:11.472
So, when the search query is something that's not found in the corpus, like

00:00:11.472 --> 00:00:16.552
wisdom. Instead of seeing none as the response, we want to see a search like try

00:00:16.552 --> 00:00:21.090
searchwithpeter.info. And as a reminder, when you modify the code, you might

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.100
need to restart the server. So you should remember to kill the current server

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.940
using Ctrl-C and then restart the server when you change the code to make sure

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.387
it's running the code that you actually have. I know I haven't explained

00:00:32.387 --> 00:00:35.524
everything in this code yet and there are some things you haven't seen before

00:00:35.524 --> 00:00:38.839
here. But I think, if you play around with a little bit on your own, you should

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:41.156
be able to figure this out enough to be able to do this.
