It took Grant a while to process the
orders that he had gotten from the school,

00:00:04.427 --> 00:00:07.830
and from Mr. Belvedere, but in the end, he
finally had a moment to relax. He had

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.298
visions of little children running around
with glasses, wipers, and nozzles, and of

00:00:12.298 --> 00:00:17.436
course, of his new friend. What a nice old
man. He felt so excited and so satisfied

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.794
that, pretty soon, his products would be
keeping the glasses of people all over the

00:00:21.806 --> 00:00:26.708
world nice and clean, but he realized he'd
left out one major detail. He hadn't yet

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.209
set the price for his wipers or for his
nozzles. In terms of the equation that we

00:00:31.221 --> 00:00:35.269
came up with for his total future
earnings, he hadn't picked a value for w

00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:39.931
yet, or one for n. Remember that w is equal
the price per wiper blade set and n is

00:00:39.943 --> 00:00:44.958
just equal to the price per nozzle. Grant
thought long and hard about how much he

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.006
wanted to charge for each wiper blade set
and for each nozzle. But finally, he came

00:00:50.018 --> 00:00:55.452
to a decision, he set the price per wiper
blade set at $30 and he set the price per

00:00:55.452 --> 00:01:01.295
nozzle at $12. Now, these might look like
kind of steep prices, but, hey, Grant had

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:04.943
worked really hard on both of his products
and they're actually pretty intricate

00:01:04.955 --> 00:01:08.656
designs. Takes a lot of work to make
nozzles and wipers this small that aren't

00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:10.441
just going to break their first use.
