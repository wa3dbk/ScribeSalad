00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And now for a quiz. There is some input which still produces output with HTML markup.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So we still had the bug in this code.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Is this foo in bold HTML markup, is it same as above but with foo in double quotes,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
or is it the same as the first but with the quotes outside of the text,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
or same as the first one but with the HTML tag names enclosed in double quotes.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Try it out for yourself.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Which of these still includes HTML markup in the output of remove HTML markup.
