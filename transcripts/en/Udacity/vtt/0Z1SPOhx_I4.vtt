00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.000
The first part of the answer
is that we're trying to map

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.165
a CNF formula into a 3-CNF one.

00:00:06.165 --> 00:00:09.570
We're trying to show that
3-CNF is as hard as CNF.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.020
So that if we could solve 3-CNF,
we would solve CNF as well.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.430
The such that part is a little subtle.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.180
It's important to realize that the 3-CNF
formula we get doesn't have to be

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.130
logically equivalent to the general
CNF formula that we put in.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.210
As we'll see,

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.210
it won't even make sense to talk about
having the same truth assignment

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.830
satisfy both formulas, because they'll
have different sets of variables.
