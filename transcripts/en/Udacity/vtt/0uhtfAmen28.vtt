00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.391
The answer is c, this red curve. To figure this out, we could plug a few values

00:00:04.391 --> 00:00:08.747
for c into our equation and find the corresponding values for p. Those c and p

00:00:08.747 --> 00:00:13.339
values will be the coordinates of points on this graph. So, this is interesting.

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.692
As we could have guessed from our equation, since we have a c squared term, we

00:00:17.692 --> 00:00:21.792
have a parabola. This is going to give us a great opportunity to use some of the

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:25.223
skills that we learned in the last few lessons, and also some new ones.
