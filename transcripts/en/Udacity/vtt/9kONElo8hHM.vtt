00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.130
Here are Greg and Lauren and they both have a problem, or a stressful event.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.860
Their shoes are untied. Greg thinks about strategies he can use to change this

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.156
situation to reduce the stress. He could buy elastic shoes so he never has to

00:00:12.156 --> 00:00:16.734
tie his shoes again, he could tape his shoes so that they won't come untied. Or

00:00:16.734 --> 00:00:21.260
he could tie his shoe. These are ways in which he could change his situation to

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.176
reduce the stress of having an untied shoe. Here Greg focused on his problem

00:00:26.176 --> 00:00:30.529
and changed his situation. This is called, problem-focused coping and it

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.844
involves looking at the situation and changing the situation that caused the

00:00:33.844 --> 00:00:38.575
stress. Lauren on the other hand, had a different way with coping with this

00:00:38.575 --> 00:00:40.270
some what trivial event.
