Let's go through another example. A dermatologist has developed a drug to get

00:00:04.348 --> 00:00:10.145
rid of acne. Let's call their drug drug A. He tested it out on six people.

00:00:10.145 --> 00:00:14.237
After four weeks, the following proportion of acne had disappeared from these

00:00:14.237 --> 00:00:27.979
subjects. Faces, 40%, 36%, 20%, 32%, 45% and 28%. A competing dermatologist

00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:32.509
also developed a drug to get rid of acne, which we'll call drug B. She tested

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.516
it on five people. After four weeks, the following proportions of acne had

00:00:37.516 --> 00:00:49.927
disappeared from these subjects faces. 41%, 39%, 18%, 23%, and 35%.
