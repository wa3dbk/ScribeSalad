00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.505
In the last section we worked with multiplying and dividing fractions. We did a

00:00:04.517 --> 00:00:08.824
lot with fractions. Let's continue and see what else we can do. Here's our third

00:00:08.836 --> 00:00:12.991
chocolate math problem. You want to frost a cake for a party. You frost 2 5ths

00:00:12.742 --> 00:00:16.409
of the cake in vanilla icing and 1 4th of the cake in strawberry icing. What

00:00:16.421 --> 00:00:20.608
fraction of the cake is frosted? You might not know what to do with these two

00:00:20.163 --> 00:00:23.723
fractions and that's okay. I want you to go ahead and take a guess. You can put

00:00:23.735 --> 00:00:27.195
your answer in these 2 boxes here, the numerator up top and the denominator in

00:00:27.207 --> 00:00:30.644
the bottom. You also want to write down your answer, we're going to come back to

00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:33.417
it later, and you can see how your thinking might have changed.
