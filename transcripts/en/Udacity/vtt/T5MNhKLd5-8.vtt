00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840
And the answer here is no. So a non-deterministic RAM.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.090
If it's running the same cod on the same input, it will always return the same solution

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.110
because this if better function here, although we don't know what it's going to do.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.740
It still behaves in a consistent way and this is actually quite important

00:00:17.740 --> 99:59:59.000
because non-determinism is not the same thing as randomness.
