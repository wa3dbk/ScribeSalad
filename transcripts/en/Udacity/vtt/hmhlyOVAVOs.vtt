00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.340
Cool, let's take a look at a solution to the parsing

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.320
CSV files exercise. We're going to begin here by opening the file. The

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.510
next thing to note is that we're going to read the first

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.180
line of that file, and split it using the common character as

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.350
the delimiter. This will give us a list of values that

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.990
we can use as keys for each one of the data items

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.430
that we pull out of this file later on. Okay, we're

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.320
then going to loop through the lines of the file. We'll break out

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.270
of this loop once we've processed ten lines. For every

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.920
line up to that, we're going to split the line, again using

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.050
the comma as the delimiter, and then we're going to initialize this

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.980
empty dictionary. Now, the entry each time through is going to

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.110
be this data item that we'll construct using the keys

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.320
that we got from the first line of the file, and

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.870
the individual field values that we just got here. We going to

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.670
loop through the fields and using enumerate, we'll get a index

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.740
value in addition to the value for each item

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.740
in this field's list. That would allow us to access

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.430
the appropriate value in the header to use as

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.230
a key for that particular field in our entry or

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.450
data item. And then we'll use the corresponding value

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.890
as the value for that particular field. Now note that

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.510
in both cases we're using the strip method here

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.990
in here in order to pull off any extraneous white-space

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.910
around either the header value or the individual value for

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.940
this line of the file. This is our first example

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.130
of data cleaning which is another major theme of this

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.750
course. In Excel files or .CSV files, a lot of times

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.700
you'll have Garbage white space that surround values. You don't

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.280
really notice them or care about them in the file

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.550
itself. But, when you're processing them in Python, they can

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.830
make a big difference especially if you're doing comparisons between values.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.080
So, it's always a good idea to use strip. Okay,

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.630
finally, we're going to append that one data item to

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.170
our data array. So that it's included in the list

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.530
of items that we return from this function first file.
