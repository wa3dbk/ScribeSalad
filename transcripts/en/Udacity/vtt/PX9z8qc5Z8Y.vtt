00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.030
So let's start by looking at how we might implement this as simply as possible,

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:09.399
and we're going to begin by thinking about this computation as working on an N by N matrix.

00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:12.662
The N bodies on the X-axis here are the source of each force,

00:00:12.662 --> 00:00:17.078
and the N bodies on the Y-axis here are the destination of each force.

00:00:17.078 --> 00:00:19.555
The source and destination objects are the same objects, of course.

00:00:19.555 --> 00:00:22.058
This is just how we're organizing the computation.

00:00:22.058 --> 00:00:24.740
So the matrix element at the position X,Y

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.213
represents the force that source element X exerts on destination element Y,

00:00:30.213 --> 00:00:33.267
and what we want to do is calculate the total amount of force

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:36.480
from all source objects on each destination object.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.150
This formulation of the problem exhibits a lot of parallelism.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.680
Each of the N-squared forces can be computed in parallel.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.983
We just load the parameters of the source and destination thread to do one particular computation,

00:00:48.983 --> 00:00:52.360
and compute the force, say, using gravitational attraction.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.864
This requires specifying parameters for each object.

00:00:54.864 --> 00:00:58.830
For gravity, this would be, say, the mass and the position, X, Y, Z.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.998
Then each object, say object Y, must add up all N forces that act on it.

00:01:03.998 --> 00:01:07.830
Then, we have to calculate N reductions of N forces also in parallel.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.835
Since we want to run this computation on tens to hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of elements,

00:01:12.835 --> 00:01:15.721
we can see that we have a lot of parallelism to exploit.

00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:18.226
In this case, the computation would be very straightforward.

00:01:18.226 --> 00:01:23.286
We will now see that if we run it in this way, we would be making poor use of our memory bandwidth,

00:01:23.286 --> 00:01:29.130
so if we assume that all of our N-squared force computations running in parallel must go to global memory,

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.682
how many times must we fetch each element as a function of N?
