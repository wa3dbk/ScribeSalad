00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.820
Now in some applications you might have the need for many small scans

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.708
instead of 1 large scan.

00:00:05.708 --> 00:00:08.321
We've said before that when you launch a kernel on a GPU,

00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:10.551
you want to have lots of work to do in that kernel.

00:00:10.551 --> 00:00:13.871
So it doesn't make a lot of sense to launch a scan kernel separately

00:00:13.871 --> 00:00:16.293
on each one of these small scans.

00:00:16.293 --> 00:00:21.870
Instead, we're going to pack these scans together as segments inside 1 big array

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.790
and then have a special scan operator that scans each of the segments independently.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.375
Typically to indicate where segments begin in an array

00:00:29.375 --> 00:00:34.108
we use a second array that has 1s for segment heads and 0s for non-segment heads.

00:00:34.108 --> 00:00:35.447
Let's do an example.

00:00:35.447 --> 00:00:38.388
So if you'll recall, exclusive sum scan on an array

00:00:38.388 --> 00:00:43.188
simply takes the running sum of all elements that come before the current element.

00:00:43.188 --> 00:00:47.766
So the sum of all elements before 8, for instance, is 28.

00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:51.533
Now what's different about a segmented scan is that we have a normal array,

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:57.126
but what we do is we're marking with these large lines here boundaries between these segments.

00:00:57.126 --> 00:01:02.240
So when we call a segmented exclusive sum scan on this array,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.344
what it's going to do is take separate scans of each of these 3 segments.

00:01:07.344 --> 00:01:13.751
So the result is the scan of 1, 2, the scan of 3, 4, 5, and the scan of 6, 7, 8.

00:01:13.751 --> 00:01:18.921
And so the way that we're going to represent these segments is with segment heads

00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:24.415
so that we have a second array the same length as the input array that marks where segments begin.

00:01:24.415 --> 00:01:27.328
So a segment begins here with the number 1,

00:01:27.328 --> 00:01:31.337
a segment begins with the number 3, and a segment begins with the number 6.

00:01:31.337 --> 00:01:32.834
So to make sure we're on the same page,

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:34.906
we're going to take the same array we did last time

00:01:34.906 --> 00:01:37.497
where we computed an exclusive segmented sum scan

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:43.739
and instead you're going to fill in the result of an inclusive segmented sum scan on this input array.

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:48.977
If you'll recall, an inclusive sum scan is going to be the sum of all elements

00:01:48.977 --> 00:01:52.223
that came before in the segment as well as the current element.

00:01:52.223 --> 00:01:54.350
So why don't you fill in these 8 boxes?
