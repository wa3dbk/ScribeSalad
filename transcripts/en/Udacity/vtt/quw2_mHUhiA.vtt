Humans have evolved such that we can learn language easily from our verbal

00:00:03.528 --> 00:00:06.984
communities, and it is easy to overlook the revolutionary effect that human

00:00:06.984 --> 00:00:10.440
language has had in our evolution and development as a species, as well as our

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.934
ability to communicate and pass on knowledge from generation to generation.

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:21.088
There is a regular sequence in which we acquire language Beginning with cooing,

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:24.932
then babbling, one-word utterances, and finally, by age three we speak in

00:00:24.932 --> 00:00:30.110
grammatical sentences. The case study of Genie demonstrates that there are

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.004
critical periods for acquiring language. And after that window of opportunity,

00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:39.086
language acquisition is very difficult. We also discussed an important

00:00:39.086 --> 00:00:42.782
principle of science and that not all scientists always agree an explanations

00:00:42.782 --> 00:00:47.248
and theories. In particular we saw how Skinner and Chomsky had different

00:00:47.248 --> 00:00:52.066
explanations for language, a behaviorist view or a nativist view. We covered

00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:56.728
the psychology of thought in cognition. And discussed how we represent ideas

00:00:56.728 --> 00:01:00.823
both visually and verbally, and use concepts, categories and hierarchies to

00:01:00.823 --> 00:01:06.400
organize our thoughts, and to understand our world. We discussed different

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.752
kinds of reasoning, deductive and inductive, and how critical thinking can make

00:01:10.752 --> 00:01:17.424
us better consumers of information and ideas. Finally, we demonstrated how we

00:01:17.424 --> 00:01:21.392
use mental shortcuts, or heuristics, in making decisions, and how those can

00:01:21.392 --> 00:01:25.311
help, but sometimes bias our decision-making.
