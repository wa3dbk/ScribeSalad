00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.448
&gt;&gt; Let's say you're debating whether or not to get a social networking account.

00:00:04.448 --> 00:00:09.140
So you look at distributions of salaries of a sample of 1,000 people with social

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.826
networking accounts and a sample of 1,000 people from the general population,

00:00:13.826 --> 00:00:18.677
which may include people that also have social networking accounts. If this is

00:00:18.677 --> 00:00:23.487
distribution 1 and this is distribution 2, fill in the blanks here with either

00:00:23.487 --> 00:00:27.902
the less than sign, greater than sign, or equals sign. What do you think?
