00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.780
Now as you can tell, Box2D is a fantastic library and the best part is it's

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.374
actually free use. And then we can go download it off the internet and put it

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:11.448
in our game. The author's only ask one thing though in their licensing. That

00:00:11.448 --> 00:00:15.815
you give them credit for using their work. Now back to GDC 2011, a very popular

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:21.247
mobile game developer who is actually using Box2D in their game. But actually

00:00:21.247 --> 00:00:25.417
forgot to credit the Box2D authors. This actually came to a head at GDC, when

00:00:25.417 --> 00:00:29.668
the very popular game makers were actually on stage during a panel. Some lonely

00:00:29.668 --> 00:00:32.951
representative actually stood up in the audience and asked them a question from

00:00:32.951 --> 00:00:37.712
the crowd. Asking them what physics engineer are you using, to which they

00:00:37.712 --> 00:00:41.784
responded, Box2D. The individual then said hey, did you know that licensing

00:00:41.784 --> 00:00:46.006
actually requires you to give attribution to them? They said didn't know that,

00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:49.950
and he said cool. My name's Aaron Cotto, I wrote the library. Would you be

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.530
willing to give me credit? Of course, the person said let's talk afterwards.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.258
The point is this, all that open-source software out there comes with some

00:00:57.258 --> 00:01:00.660
license. So before you actually go grab it, make sure that you read through

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.440
their licensing terms very, very carefully. And that you're abiding by their

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.384
using in a proper, legal way. Otherwise, you might get an angry Aaron Cotto

00:01:08.384 --> 00:01:10.410
showing up at your next GDC talk.
