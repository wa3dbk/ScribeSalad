00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.627
To work out your brain a little, say, we have two coordinate systems with the

00:00:04.627 --> 00:00:09.830
same origin. The first uses the architect's scheme, X goes east, Y goes north, Z

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.151
goes up. The second uses minrcraft's current system of X goes east, Y goes up,

00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:20.566
and Z goes south. If I have a point 10, 24, 13 in the architect's system, what

00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:24.430
is this point's location in the minecraft's system?
