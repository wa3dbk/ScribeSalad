00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.920
One of the most important things we want you to learn

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.290
from this course, is to develop the eye of a designer. So

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.050
you should be walking around the world, looking all the time.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.190
Looking at things around you. Judging. Saying that's a really good example.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.930
Or ooh, that's a bad example. But when you do this,

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.270
it's really good to document it Not only for your own benefit,

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.440
because you want to show them to other people. You might want

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.810
to show them to clients. You might want to give a talk.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.970
And illustrate the points. So you have to have pictures.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.119
And the pictures have to be effective. Show exactly the

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.780
point you're trying to make, and tell a story. So

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.640
it may take several pictures of the same object, to

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.240
tell the story. So, in this next assignment, we're going to

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.500
cover that. So let's start off though, with what it

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.620
takes to make a good picture. First of all the

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.990
camera. You know, doesn't do any good to have a great

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.090
camera if it isn't with you. So the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.830
most important aspect about a camera is, have it

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.750
with you. So take a look at this one.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.860
Cellphone camera. It's always with you, that'a a virtue.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.340
The problem is, it's not really a good camera.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.200
It can't be, it's just too small. So if

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.890
you want to take a picture, and the object is

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.270
really small. And you want to enlarge it. Nah,

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.940
cellphone camera isn't good enough. But, in an

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.420
emergency this is the best camera to use.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.380
I use it all the time. The really best camera would be something like this. This

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.580
is a single lens reflex. It takes high

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.590
quality pictures, it's a very big detector. High

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.250
quality lens. But it's big, it's bulky. So

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.060
I myself, don't use it. I would love to.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.680
But I just can't imagine carrying it with me all the time. So I

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.936
compromise. I carry a medium-size camera. Carefully

00:01:51.936 --> 00:01:56.460
chosen, so it's of the highest quality. Yet small enough though, that it will

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.920
fit in my pocket. Or, it fits in a bag on my

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.850
belt. Has a good lens. Has a fairly large sensor.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.800
So it takes high quality pictures that I can blow up. And all the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.640
pictures, in the design of everyday thing

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.180
that I took, were taken, with this camera.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.300
Second point. Take lots of pictures. Don't take one

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.070
picture. And don't sit there and just try to take

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.990
one or two. Professionals might take hundreds of pictures just

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.760
to get one. So take lots of pictures from different

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.700
angles, different zoom lenses. Closer, further away. And with

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.650
different lighting. Don't use flash. Flash wipes out all the

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.940
details. But make sure turn on all the lights. And

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.750
maybe use a piece of white paper as a reflector.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.320
Do whatever you can do, to light it as well as you can. Naturally.
