00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.210
I just want to give you some context as to where we are before we move forward.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.710
We have seen examples of different narrative structures and

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.340
what effect they have on our overall visualization,

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.920
including both author-driven and reader-driven narratives.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.840
And we've also seen what flexibility and power interactivity affords us

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.630
when creating a customized graphic that we want our readers to explore.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.830
And we have seen how to add context to our World Cup visualization, but

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.230
in doing so, have learned that both a line plot and

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.080
a scatter plot may not be the best form to convey our data story.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.320
In this lesson, we will further iterate on our graphic and

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.080
continue this process of sketching to arrive at our final visualization.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.320
The first step in this process will be to add geographic context to

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.620
our visualization by plotting our data on a map.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.200
And throughout, I'll show you how to enhance an author-driven narrative

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.930
by leveraging temporal effects through animation with D3.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.480
And we will finish by creating the mouth of the martini glass structure by

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.770
allowing a reader to explore a graphic interactively, in addition to

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.440
being able to drill down and inspect data at a much more finer grain.
