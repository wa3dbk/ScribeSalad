We know the new area c squared, is equal to the old area, a squared plus b

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:08.688
squared. This of course Pythagoras' theorem, but the reason why it worked in

00:00:08.688 --> 00:00:13.733
that proof was because the areas of the 4 triangles did not change. In other

00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:17.273
words the light blue area that we had for a squared plus b squared, was the

00:00:17.273 --> 00:00:23.385
same after we rotated the triangle. After we rotate the 4 orange triangles the

00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:28.650
light blue square is still the same area. It's just need recombined to form c

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.370
squared the new area.
