00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.800
We've seen distribution with one radical, let's try multiply two binomials

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.843
together. These binomials contain a radical in each one. This one has the

00:00:08.843 --> 00:00:12.869
square root of 2 and this one has the square root of 7. When we multiply two

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.460
binomials, we want to distribute each term in the first parentheses to each

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.156
term in the second parentheses. So we'll multiply 3 times 2 and 3 times root 7,

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:29.513
and then we'll multiply root 2 times 2, and root 2 times root 7. We want to

00:00:29.513 --> 00:00:34.730
simplify any radicals that we can and combine like terms if possible. So try

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.380
this one out, and don't worry if you don't get it right on your first try. We

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.676
haven't even done one like this. If you think back to multiplying polynomials

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:46.630
though, you just might figure it out. Good luck.
