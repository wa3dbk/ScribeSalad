00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.120
In addition to using the media
attribute on a linked style sheet,

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.000
there are two other ways you
can apply media queries.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.090
You can embed them with an @media tag,
or

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.080
you can embed them with an @import tag.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.980
For performance reasons,
you definitely want to avoid @import.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.410
It's pretty expensive and perf matters.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.820
You'll need to weigh the costs
between linked CSS and @media.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.940
With linked CSS,
you've got many small files, but

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.790
many HTTP requests,
where as with @media,

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.880
you've got fewer requests, but the files
tend to be a little bit bigger.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.970
Any filter that meets the criteria
of the resulting CSS block,

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.600
will be applied using the standard
CSS rules of precedence.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.030
That means when the viewport
is less than 500 pixels,

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.780
no styles are applied but above 500
pixels my body color becomes orange.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.490
And above 800 pixels,
not only do I have the orange text, but

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.600
I also have the blue background.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.970
I'm pretty sure that also means, I've
got some pretty bad taste in colors.
