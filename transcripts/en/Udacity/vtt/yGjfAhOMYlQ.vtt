Option a goes in the first blank and option b goes in the second blank. That

00:00:04.992 --> 00:00:09.984
means that this sentence reads, this function takes the length of one cut, in

00:00:09.984 --> 00:00:15.006
other words x here, as input, and gives the volume of the box as the output. We

00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:19.620
can actually see that from the way that our equation is written. We have x here,

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.795
as the input, inside the parenthesis, next to the function name. And, the name

00:00:23.795 --> 00:00:28.840
of the function is V. And the function itself represents the volume of the box.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.265
So, that is the output.
