00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.140
Let's take a quick quiz on packet switching versus circuit switching. Which of

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.110
the following are characteristics of packet switching

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.830
and circuit switching: variable delay, busy signals,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.410
sharing of network resources like an end-to-end

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.680
path among multiple recipients, and dedicated resources

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.000
between the sender and receiver? Each of

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.570
these options, only has one correct answer.
