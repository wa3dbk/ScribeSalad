00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's a pretty good answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We definitely want to match single words and then you can possibly have 1 hypen

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and then you can have more letters if you like.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This regular expression definitely matches well-liked.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It also matches html--maybe the h, t, and m will match the first part,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and the l will match the second part.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It definitely rejects a-b-c and a--b.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
However, 1 problem with this regular expression is that it does not accept

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
single letter words like "a" or "i".

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
To see why, just look at these 2 plus signs.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This requires 1 or more letters here and 1 or more letters there,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
That's at least 2 letters.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We might be tempted to fix it up by making 1 of these a star,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but now we mistakenly accept things like just "-a".

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
No letters here, the hypen, and then some more letters--

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
well, that didn't work.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
What if I try to make the other one a star?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Well, dual problem--now we'll mistakenly accept things like "a-".

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Well, this is a bit of a challenge.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
What we really want is for this hypen and the second word to be grouped together,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and either they're both there or they're not.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It's as if I really want this question mark to apply to both the hyphen

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and also the [a - z]+.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We don't know how to do that yet, but you'll get a chance after we've learned how

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.891
to fix this up in the homework.
