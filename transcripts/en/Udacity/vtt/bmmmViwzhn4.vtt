00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.867
Let's press on with this function we were working with before. Now I've talked

00:00:03.867 --> 00:00:09.190
before about 0's or roots of functions. We know that these are values of x that

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:15.368
when substituted into our function make the function itself f of x equal 0. So,

00:00:15.368 --> 00:00:19.616
for this function in particular If we know that f of a equals 0, then what

00:00:19.616 --> 00:00:25.525
numbers can a equal? What values can it take on to make this true? Please write

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:29.263
your answers in this box and separate them with commas.
