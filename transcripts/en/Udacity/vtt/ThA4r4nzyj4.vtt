00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.850
So what exactly does GeoJSON look like especially once we load it in with d3?

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.920
Just as with our previous charts, we simply set up our margins, our width and

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.780
our height and we append an SVG element this time with class map to our page.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.010
And now we can put in a debugger, so we can pause execution and

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.050
expect what geo data looks like and the structure it has.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:29.100
As you can see here we've loaded our globe.html file, that we were just

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.900
looking at in the browser and execution has paused at line 22 in the debugger.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.970
Looking at what geo data is you can see here.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.250
There is a JavaScript object with top level keys,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.780
type with value feature collection and features that corresponds to an array.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.360
And again, another one of the benefits of using geoJSON is that it

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.530
simply a JSON file that we can pass around like any other.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.190
In this case, we can even load it in with

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.790
d3's standard JSON data loading function, and when we inspect it in our console,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.250
we can see here the Crowoop console treats it like any other JSON and

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.420
gives us this nested structure to inspect through.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.370
We can see here that in the features array there's 177 items.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.180
Each of which it's self is an object that has a geometry key and properties key.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.940
The properties in this case as a single key

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.000
value pair is the name of the country.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.820
In this case the first one is Afghanistan.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.070
What makes GeoJSON unique is it's shape extensions.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.580
Here we can see each country has a geometry key

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.180
that corresponds to an object that both has coordinates and the type,

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.330
in this case the geometry of a country is a polygon, as we can see here.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.810
And coordinates is an array of values, or

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.370
rather an array of arrays of two elements or

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.130
pairs of coordinates representing the longitude and latitude of the country.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.770
One thing to note here, and it's not explicit,

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.750
is that longitude actually comes first, in this case what's labelled with zero,

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.000
and latitude comes second, what's labelled as one here.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.050
And that's just a quirk of the format.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.280
And there's geometry object that has coordinate points and the type,

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.910
polygon represents the border of a country, in this case, Afghanistan
