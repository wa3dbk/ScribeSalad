00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.210
The first sentence is definitely false. Prescriptive architecture

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.530
and descriptive architecture tend to diverge as systems evolve,

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.960
and sometimes, even when the system is first developed,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.680
as we will see in some of the upcoming

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.340
examples. Conversely, the second sentence is true. By

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.150
adding unnecessary elements to the architecture, architectural drift can

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.470
transform an otherwise clean architecture into a complex sub-optimal,

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.960
and often ugly, architecture. The third sentence is false.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.540
Architectural erosion and architectural drift are, indeed, different phenomena.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.940
But they both result in a less than ideal, and

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.160
in some cases, highly degraded architecture. And the fourth

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.600
sentence is also false, as we discussed a minute ago.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.050
Just tweaking at the code is very unlikely to

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.930
improve the code. Quite the opposite, actually. The best way

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.420
to repair a degraded architectural design is to first, understand

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.110
the current architecture, and then, try to fix it in

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.280
a more principled way.
