00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.878
So, first, I have some terminology. This is called an infinite loop, and it's

00:00:02.878 --> 00:00:06.221
pretty clear why. The loop just keeps on going forever. Let's see what

00:00:06.221 --> 00:00:09.104
happened. We compute the interest. And actually, that's the same computation

00:00:09.104 --> 00:00:13.140
that we had before. It's perfectly normal. We increment the year. We print out

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.044
the result. And you've seen this happening over and over. So the problem must

00:00:16.044 --> 00:00:20.233
have been with the condition here. Hm. We wanted to keep one going, while the

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:24.112
balance didn't reach the million dollars. It clearly overshot the million

00:00:24.112 --> 00:00:26.964
dollars, so the problem must lie in here and why don't you give it a try to fix

00:00:26.964 --> 00:00:28.189
it.
