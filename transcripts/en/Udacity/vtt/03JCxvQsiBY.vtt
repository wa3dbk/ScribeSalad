00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.140
So what's a different representation?

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.770
Well it's nothing more
recent newer approach,

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.090
it's what's referred to as point clouds.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.360
And point clouds are essentially,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.210
you take all of your depth
pixels that you hit.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.920
And you say, aha that's a little,
we used to use the word voxel,

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.170
that's a little voxel of stuff.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.110
And I'm just going to hang
it out there in space and so

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.100
I would get this constellation
of points that's just a cloud.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.110
Okay, now I actually can't
see inside surfaces, so

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.970
it's maybe a cloud that I
can only see the outside of.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.900
But if I had like another camera and
I knew how those cameras were related.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.240
I could take the points that it saw and
stick them out in the same cloud area.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.820
And eventually, I would have this
big point cloud of depth points and

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.170
it would be a lot easier to reason
about the geometry of those.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.680
Now of course,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.640
when we do this that point cloud sort of
doesn't know how it got created, right?

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.920
So did I look at it from here or
did I look at it from there?

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.690
So, I don't have that free
space information anymore.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.270
So point clouds of course,
have their advantages and disadvantages.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.860
The biggest one is probably that
it's viewpoint independent, right?

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.040
So, because it's viewpoint independent,
I can

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.170
merge different point clouds as long as
they're in the same coordinate system.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.670
And I can actually reason
more about the geometry.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.770
The disadvantages include,
so for example it's not,

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.090
it might not be very dense, right?

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.720
And in depth image,
I've got depth everywhere.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.110
Point clouds,
whatever points I got, I got.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.230
And if I want to know what's
the depth going this way,

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.130
I might not know the answer,
I just know about these set of points.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.720
And so fundamentally, you've also
lost this free space stuff, okay?

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.860
Because you don't know how we,
so I have a point right here,

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.690
I don't know if it was viewed
from this way or from this way.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.410
If it was viewed this way, I know that
all these pixels along this ray are free

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.110
from here to over there, I don't have
that representation in point clouds.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.080
The other thing is as I get
further away essentially my cloud,

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.520
each individual pixel that I see is
taking up a bigger and bigger voxel.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.810
So the point cloud density, sorry,
the point cloud resolution, you know,

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.830
how big is a point cloud, point.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.730
The resolution is determined by
how far way from the depth sensor

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.145
I observe that point, so
nearby ones are tight little points,

00:02:21.145 --> 00:02:24.940
further back, they're bigger voxels.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.900
But I didn't tell you yet
about the biggest advantage,

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.840
the biggest advantage about point
clouds is the point cloud library.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.790
There's all this code out there and
it continues to grow, called PCL for

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.850
the manipulation of point clouds.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.210
And so, that's code you don't
have to write, all right?

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.050
So, it allows you to operate on depth,
just not worrying about

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.060
the details of the bookkeeping
about these depth representations.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.570
So that's, that's really a huge element.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.310
And one might even say if it wasn't for
the PCL, the Point Cloud Library,

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.730
point clouds would not be
nearly as popular as they are.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.075
Eh, here's a, [COUGH] here's
a pointer to, what's the website?

00:03:03.075 --> 00:03:05.410
Pointclouds.org, all right?

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.665
Which tells you something, right?

00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:09.160
.org, this is open source.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.010
So it continues to, to grow,
and continues to improve.
