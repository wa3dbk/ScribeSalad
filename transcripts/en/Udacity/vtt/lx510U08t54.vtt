00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.950
Now that we've uploaded a few screens,

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.590
let's make a click-able
prototype out of them.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.380
To do this, simply click on any
screen within your project.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.020
This will bring us
into the console mode.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.550
The console mode has four
options at the bottom.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.290
Preview, build, comment,
and history mode.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.580
For this section, we'll only focus
on the preview and build mode.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.360
Click on the build mode to begin
creating prototype hot spots.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.930
In the build mode, go ahead and
use your cursor, and drag and drop.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.680
Over an area of your image
to create the hotspot.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.050
This will open a window where you can
choose the destination for that hotspot.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.340
You can choose a gesture or
a transition.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.750
Once you've created that hotspot,
go ahead and hit Save.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.240
And to preview whether or
not this interaction works,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.060
I'm going to go back to the preview
mode and there you have it!

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.400
I've just created
the very first hotspot.
