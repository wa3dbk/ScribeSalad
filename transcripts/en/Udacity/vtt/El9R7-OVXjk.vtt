00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.100
So, we're looking for Katrina's speed alone, that would be without the current.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.162
We know when she goes upriver or upstream, she goes 15 miles. So this distance

00:00:09.162 --> 00:00:12.622
is 15. She has to come back to her original starting point, so that means she

00:00:12.622 --> 00:00:17.002
has to go another 15 miles. To get back where she started. That would be her

00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:22.000
distance downstream. We know the speed of the current is 5 miles per hour, but

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.635
we don't know Katrina's speed. It's x. So, if Katrina is travelling downstream,

00:00:27.635 --> 00:00:31.891
she travels faster. So that would be x which is our speed plus the current

00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:36.274
which is 5. If Katrina is traveling upstream she's fighting the current, so

00:00:36.274 --> 00:00:41.523
she's going slower. So that would be x minus 5. Whenever we work with these

00:00:41.523 --> 00:00:45.588
motion problems and a current. We'll always add or subtract the current to

00:00:45.588 --> 00:00:50.538
whatever speed our person or object is going. So in this case Katrina's speed

00:00:50.538 --> 00:00:54.160
was x. So we need to add the current for her downstream speed and subtract the

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.728
current for her upstream speed. Now we're ready to find expressions for the

00:00:58.728 --> 00:01:03.931
time. We know the time is distance divided by rate. So going upstream we'll

00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:10.050
have 15 divided by x minus 5. And going down stream we'll have 15 divided by

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.593
the quantity x plus 5. Now this was pretty tough, so if you got at least part

00:01:14.593 --> 00:01:16.550
of this right, great work.
