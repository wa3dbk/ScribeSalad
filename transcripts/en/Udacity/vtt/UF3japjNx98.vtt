00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.108
So let's blow up our sampling distribution a little bit. So we have three

00:00:04.108 --> 00:00:11.500
critical regions. The smallest one has a probability greater than this z score

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:18.857
of 0.01, and this z score here is 3.08. And remember that the middle of the

00:00:18.857 --> 00:00:22.783
distribution, the mean, has a z score of zero. Then our second smallest

00:00:22.783 --> 00:00:27.402
critical region is point zero one. So that's the probability of being greater

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:33.270
then this value, which you found was about two point three two. And then our

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.880
biggest critical region is point zero five. So that's the probability greater

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.700
than a z score of 1.65. The z scores corresponding to these alpha levels are

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.113
called the z critical values. So we'll find our sample mean. Calculate the z

00:00:51.113 --> 00:00:55.984
score, and the distribution of sample means, or the sampling distribution. And

00:00:55.984 --> 00:01:00.422
then look to see where this mean falls. Let's say it falls in the critical

00:01:00.422 --> 00:01:05.128
region, any of them, that means it's unlikely. If it falls out here in the

00:01:05.128 --> 00:01:08.956
green region or the smallest critical region, we'll report the smallest alpha

00:01:08.956 --> 00:01:12.784
level, because that means our sample statistics are really different from the

00:01:12.784 --> 00:01:18.119
population parameters. And therefore there's strong evidence of an effect from

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.528
whatever treatment was imposed. For example, say we take some sample mean from

00:01:23.528 --> 00:01:29.600
some sample size n and then we calculate the z score. So remember we subtract

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.580
the mu and then divide by the standard deviation of the sampling distribution.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.430
And let's say that we get the z score is 1.82. We would say that this is

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.185
significant at p less than 0.05. And that's because if we look at where this

00:01:45.185 --> 00:01:50.280
z-score falls on the distribution, it falls in between 1.65 and 2.32. So this

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.533
z-score, 1.82, is somewhere in this red region. Meaning that the probability of

00:01:55.533 --> 00:02:04.510
having obtained this sample mean is less than 0.05. But it's not less than

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:11.619
0.01. So it's only significant at probability, or p, less than 0.05. And

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:15.473
remember 0.05 is the alpha level.
