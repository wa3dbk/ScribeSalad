00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.710
Before we look at some examples,

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.220
there are few things that we need to consider when compiling threads.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.350
First make sure to include the pthread header file, pthread.h, in your main

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.690
file that contains the pthreads code, otherwise your program will not compile.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.210
Second, make sure to link your program with the pthreads library by

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.280
passing the lpthread flag at compile time.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.680
On certain platforms, the better option is to use a pthread instead as a flag,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.980
which tells the compiler to link the pthreads library as well as

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.630
to configure the compilation for threads.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.790
If you don't link the library your program may not report

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.590
certain compilation errors at compile time, but it will still fail.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.200
And finally, it's always a good idea to check the return values on

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.640
common functions like when you're creating threads,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.400
creating variables, initializing certain data structures.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.155
This is a good programming practice in general, but it's extra useful when

00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:57.690
dealing with, all the [INAUDIBLE] of writing multithreaded programs.
