Now that we have our x-y tables, graphing is super easy. In fact, we have way

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:09.084
more information than we need. We know that we only need two points to draw a

00:00:09.096 --> 00:00:13.667
straight line. And, we have six for each of these equations. Anyway, please

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.517
identify which of these three graphs goes with each number brand. Put the number

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.206
of the brand corresponding to the line that ends first up here in this box. The

00:00:22.218 --> 00:00:25.921
line that goes with the second arrow in the second box and the company that goes

00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:29.687
with this third line in this third box. I know that the difference between these

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.378
lines are subtle but just pay careful attention to the differences between the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.636
equations and how you think that affects the way that they're graphed.
