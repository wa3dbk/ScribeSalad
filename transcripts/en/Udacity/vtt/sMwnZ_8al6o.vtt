00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.100
A system cannot fulfill its purpose until it is

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.727
deployed. And deploying a system involves physically placing the

00:00:06.727 --> 00:00:09.960
system's executable modules on the hardware devices on which

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.490
they are supposed to run. So when you do that,

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.132
you're basically mapping your components and connectors to specific

00:00:16.132 --> 00:00:19.810
hardware elements. Here in this diagram, for instance, I'm

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.160
showing the same components that we saw in the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.400
previous diagram, but we see them deployed on a laptop,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.620
which is depicted here in this way, and on two

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.820
smartphones that are represented here, or PDAs, if you wish.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.730
So why do we this, why do we create

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.540
a deployment perspective for our architecture? Well, because the deployment

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.710
view of an architecture can be critical in assessing whether

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.920
the system will be able to satisfy its requirement. Because

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.860
doing this mapping allows you to discover and assess other

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.840
characteristics of your system that you might not have considered

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.440
up to now. For instance, using a deployment view like this

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.030
one and knowing the characteristics of the hardware devices, one might

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.056
be able to assess the system in terms of available memory.

00:01:00.056 --> 00:01:02.610
Is there going to be enough memory available to run the system,

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.140
for example, on this device? Power consumption. Is the power consumption

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.270
profile going to be larger than what the device can handle?

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.580
Or again the required network bandwidth. Does the system have enough

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.170
network bandwidth to enable the required interactions? And so on. So all

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.140
of these characteristics, all of these qualities, you can assess when

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.730
you do this final mapping of the components to the hardware elements.
