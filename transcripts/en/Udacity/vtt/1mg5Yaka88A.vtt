00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.130
So, let's say that we had these five instructions, and for now, all that matters

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.340
for write of the write dependencies is, which registers are we writing to.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.690
So let's say that the first instruction is writing to R1,

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.098
it's computing some result, it doesn't really matter what it is.

00:00:12.098 --> 00:00:16.810
And then the second one is writing to R4. Then we have R7 and R8 being written.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.610
And then the fifth instruction is also supposed to write to R4, so

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.230
we will see that the problem will be with the second and the fifth instruction

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.790
writing to R4. So what can happen is, let's say that there is a,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.410
read after write dependence between the first and the second instruction. So,

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.640
what's now going to happen is, there will be some cycle, let's call it cycle 5,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.030
in which R1 is going to execute. R4 cannot execute.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.200
It has to wait. And it will execute here in cycle 6.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.210
Meanwhile these instructions will execute, because they don't have any

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.890
dependencies. Now in our five stage pipeline what's going to happen is basically

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.540
this instruction is going to move to the mem stage where it doesn't do anything

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.690
because none of them are really memory instructions. And then so will these. And

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.150
then what's going to happen is in the next cycle this instruction will write

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.940
this results. So now, R1 gets written. This instruction is also going to write

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.030
this results, so R7 is going to be written. This one writes R8, and

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.770
this one writes R4. However the second instruction has executed here so

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.060
it is going to go to the MEM stage here and write the result here and

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.730
it is going to be R4. So if you look at what is the final result in R4.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.750
The final result in R4 is whatever was the last thing written to it,

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.570
which is going to be this value. But it should have been this value.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.500
Because when the program that wrote this they wrote it this way so that they

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.340
could expect that our R4 would retain the value from this fifth instruction and

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.780
not from the instruction. So basically the programmer wanted this to become

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.790
temporarily this. But then take a new value here and

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.060
that's kind of the last value after these five instructions.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.270
But that didn't happen. So that is a problem. Why is it a problem,

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.360
I mean why did it occur? Well because this instruction got delayed, so

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.150
we have executed these two instructions out of order.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.230
This is the second instruction and it writes in the eight cycle.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.180
This is the fifth instruction, but it writes in the seventh cycle. So

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.100
basically we have basically written the result in the wrong order. Our I mean,

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.040
it's, it's an order different from the order in which they were supposed to

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.070
execute in the program. So in order to fix this, one solution will be. So

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.840
to fix this, one solution would be to not have this instruction write the result

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.930
here. Instead it would have to be stalled here and here. And finally, write

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.910
this result here. So a real processor might, see in some way, needs to figure

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.700
out how to do this. Because these rights need to happen in the correct order.
