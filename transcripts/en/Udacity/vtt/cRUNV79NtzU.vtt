00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.492
The discriminant of a problem is the expression b squared minus 4ac, now have

00:00:04.492 --> 00:00:09.042
you got this right, awesome job and if not, seriously don't worry about it all,

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:13.742
this required a tone of critical thinking. Now the reason that this expression

00:00:13.742 --> 00:00:18.227
determines the number of roots in our problem Is that, first off, we're taking

00:00:18.227 --> 00:00:22.537
the square root of it. And secondly, we're both adding and subtracting this

00:00:22.537 --> 00:00:26.852
number from negative b. Let's continue talking about this, since it's pretty

00:00:26.852 --> 00:00:29.078
subtle and seems to be a little complex.
