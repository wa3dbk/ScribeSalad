00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.960
Okay Michael do you have an answer?

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.290
&gt;&gt; I have an answer indeed.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.130
&gt;&gt; Okay, what's the answer?

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.880
&gt;&gt; Okay, maybe I don't have an answer indeed.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.300
But I have I have the ability to compute one.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:09.800
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.130
&gt;&gt; I'm, I'm doing some math.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.730
&gt;&gt; So why don't you walk me through the math you're doing.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.333
&gt;&gt; I got .32776.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.065
&gt;&gt; That is correct Michael.

00:00:18.065 --> 00:00:22.630
&gt;&gt; Woo-hoo. That was trickier than I thought.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.770
&gt;&gt; Okay well, show me what you did.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.640
&gt;&gt; Alright, so the

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.370
first thing I did is I said, okay, well this

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.740
is not so hard, because, from the start-state, if I

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.810
execute up, up, right, right, right. Each of those things

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.785
works the way it's supposed to do independently with probability .8.

00:00:38.785 --> 00:00:43.710
&gt;&gt; Yep. And so, .8 raised to the 5th power, gives

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.800
me the probability that that entire sequence will work as intended.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.030
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And what is .8 to the 5th? Do you know?

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.010
&gt;&gt; 32,768. with a decimal point in front

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.120
of it, because you know, powers of 2.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.080
&gt;&gt; Wow. That is correct. But I notice that 32768

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.030
is not 32776. No they differ by a little smidge.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.780
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.360
&gt;&gt; So this is what occured to me next is,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.260
is there anyway that you could have ended up falling into

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.510
the goal from that sequence of, of commands not following the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.090
intended path. So since actions can have unintended consequences, as they

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.740
often do.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.700
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.510
&gt;&gt; I was going to ask okay, so if I go up in the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.960
first step, there's a probably .1 that I'll actually go to the right.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.580
&gt;&gt; Yep. From there, if I go up, there's

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.820
a 10% probability that I'll actually go to the right.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.960
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.410
&gt;&gt; From there, the next thing I do is take the

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.709
right action, but that can actually go up with some probability, .1.

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:37.495
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yep.

00:01:37.495 --> 00:01:41.280
&gt;&gt; And then another .1 to get to for

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.000
the next right action to actually cause an up to happen.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.750
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. And then finally, that last right might

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.760
actually execute correctly and bring me into the goal. So

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.270
I could go underneath the barrier, instead of around the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.610
barrier with that same sequence. It just isn't very likely.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.230
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well how unlikely is it?

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.008
&gt;&gt; Alright. So I did .1 times .1 times .1 times .1

00:02:02.008 --> 00:02:06.760
times .8. huh, so the .1 to the 4 times .8 and

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.480
that's right so this is the probability that the, 4 of the sequences, 4 of

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.600
these go wrong. In fact exactly the first 4 go wrong. And the last one goes

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.270
right. Right. And that's equal to, some

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.930
very, very small number. And when you add

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:32.050
it up. You end up with .32776. In fact that's equal to 0.00008. And that's how

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.330
you get that number and that's correct. And you'll

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.890
notice that this this sequence happens to work out to

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.460
be the second sequence that, we had options for. Yeah,

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.780
the other thing that took us to the goal, right.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.890
&gt;&gt; Was exactly the probability of executing that action

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.230
executing that sequence of transitions given the first command.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.990
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I think it would work the other way, too. No,

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.700
it wouldn't quite work the other way. If you had done the sequence

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.350
right, right, what is it? Right, right. Up, up right?

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.210
&gt;&gt; In order for that one to work out, you'd add .8 to the

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.660
5 and working. And, for it to work out wrong but work out right, the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.750
right would have to send you up and then the ups would have to send

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.900
you right, and then, yeah, so it would actually work out to be the same.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.910
&gt;&gt; So no matter which of the two sequences you came

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.710
up with, they would have the same probability of succeeding. Neat.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.620
&gt;&gt; Nice. That's actually kind of cool. So, good

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.020
job, Michael. Very good job on the quiz. A

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.150
lot of people forget this part. And, in fact, if

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.160
you forgot that part, and got, just this part

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.080
right, we actually let you pass. But it was wrong.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.750
&gt;&gt; I was kind of expecting you to get

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.660
it wrong, but I'm glad you got it right too.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.810
&gt;&gt; Thank you Michael, I appreciate your faith in me.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.527
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:03:42.527 --> 00:03:45.060
&gt;&gt; I wrote the quiz. Actually, I stole this from a book,

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.350
&gt;&gt; Oh. which, whose little words are now showing

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.640
up in front of you, exactly where you can

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.760
go through the details of this quiz. Okay, alright, Michael. So you

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.300
might ask yourself why I brought this up, and the reason I brought

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.770
this up is because, what we did in the first case where we

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.900
just came up with the sequence up up right right right, is we

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.130
sort of planned out what we would do in a world where

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.150
nothing could go wrong. But once we introduced this notion of uncertainty, this,

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.500
this randomness, this stochasticity, we have to do something other than work out

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.750
in advance what the right answer is, and then just go. We have

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.320
to do something a little bit more complicated. Either we have

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.300
to try to execute these, and then every once in a

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:23.360
while, see if we've drifted away. And then re-x, re-plan, come

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.310
up with a new sequence wherever it is we happen to end

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.760
up, or we have to come up with some way to

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.860
incorporate all of these uncertainties and probabilities. So that, we never

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.230
really have to think, rethink what to do in case something

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.070
goes wrong. So, what I'm going to do next is I'm going to introduce

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.290
the framework, that's very common, that people use as a

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.560
way of capturing this stuff, capturing these uncertainties directly. Okay?

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.550
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.110
&gt;&gt; You ready?

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:49.510
&gt;&gt; Excellent.
