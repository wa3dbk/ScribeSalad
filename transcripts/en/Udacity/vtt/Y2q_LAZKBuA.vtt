00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.663
The center is at negative 2,3, since we take the opposite signs in the

00:00:03.663 --> 00:00:08.680
parentheses. The opposite of positive 2 is negative 2, and the opposite of

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:14.696
negative 3 is positive 3. This is our h and our k. The value of a is the square

00:00:14.696 --> 00:00:18.844
root of 25, which equals 5, and the value of b is the square root of 36, which

00:00:18.844 --> 00:00:25.012
equals 6. Great work if you got these three correct. Now, what's even more

00:00:25.012 --> 00:00:29.638
important is your graph. Let's see if yours will match mine. We'll start with

00:00:29.638 --> 00:00:33.851
an ellipse, as usual and it will be centered at negative 2, 3. Negative 2 in

00:00:33.851 --> 00:00:38.966
the x direction, positive 3 in the y direction. We move 5 units left and right

00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:45.310
from the center, and 6 units up and down from that center to form our ellipse.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.030
Now, we draw in our dashed rectangle around our ellipse, and then we draw in

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.900
the two diagonals. Now we're ready to create our hyperbola. The x squared term

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.403
comes first. So we know our hyperbola will open left and right. We'll split our

00:01:00.403 --> 00:01:04.123
ellipse in half and we'll flip the two ends out, so that way we get the graph

00:01:04.123 --> 00:01:08.610
of our hyperbola. Nice work if you got this graph.
