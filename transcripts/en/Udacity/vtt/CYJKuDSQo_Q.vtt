00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.119
&gt;&gt; That's good David.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.980
So the de Morgan's law is saying that when we try to distribute negation

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.840
over the predicate inside the parentheses that are connected with a conjunction,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.540
then the conjunction becomes a disjunction between the negations of the pre,

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.460
predicates. The same would have been true if we had a disjunction here.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.550
When we distribute the negation, it would have become a conjunction here. David,

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.630
before we go ahead further, let's remember why we are trying to do all of this.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.920
So do you recall we said in the beginning of the lesson that a logical agent

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.740
will have a knowledge base, and then formal rules of inference that will apply

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.600
on these sentences as knowledge base. The knowledge base itself may be coming

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.290
from many places. Some sentences in the knowledge base may be boot strapped into

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.830
the logical agent. Other sentences may be coming from perception. Now when we're

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.600
trying to apply these rules of inferences to the synthesis of the knowledge base

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.910
it is sometimes very useful to rewrite the sentences in different forms. And

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.140
that's what we are trying to do.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.340
These properties will allow us to rewrite the sentences in such a way that we

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.780
can in fact apply the rules of inferences that we will see in a minute.
