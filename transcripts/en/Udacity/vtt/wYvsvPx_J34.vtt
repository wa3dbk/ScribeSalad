00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.636
Alright. Before we get started on the class project,

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:07.376
this lesson's assignment will allow you to get comfortable with

00:00:07.376 --> 00:00:09.960
the type of work that data scientists do using

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.800
a small and classic data set. This data set describes

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.010
the riders on the Titanic and a bunch of

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.340
information about them. For example, what class they were in,

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.650
whether they were male or female, how old they

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.500
were, etcetera. Over the course of the assignment, you'll build

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.670
a few different models. The models will

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.510
start out simple, but they'll get increasingly complex.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.210
To see if using data science, we can

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.790
predict who will survive and who won't survive

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.990
the Titanic tragedy. This may sound complicated, but

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.210
don't worry. We'll give you plenty of help.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.360
This assignment is meant to get you in

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.430
the habit of thinking like a data scientist.
