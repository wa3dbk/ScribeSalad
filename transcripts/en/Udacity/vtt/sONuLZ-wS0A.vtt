00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.496
So, I've already showed you one convention
that we use when we simplify terms. We put

00:00:04.508 --> 00:00:08.638
the constant factors at the beginning of
the term. When we do that, it makes it

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.957
easy once we simplify because we end up
with one coefficient and then all of the

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.965
variable factors after it. People also
tend to put the variable factors in

00:00:16.977 --> 00:00:21.048
alphabetical order. So, if you wanted to
do that, we could say that this also

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.865
equals 30rst. In order to make the change
from 30srt to 30rst, we had to remember

00:00:25.877 --> 00:00:30.034
the commutative property of
multiplication. Since we were allowed to

00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:34.419
switch the order of r and s without
changing the value of this term. So, the

00:00:34.431 --> 00:00:39.232
order that variable factors are written in
is just another convention in algebra.

00:00:39.335 --> 00:00:43.955
It's just something that's useful for us
to use, but it doesn't change the fact

00:00:43.967 --> 00:00:48.155
that this version of the term that we had
initially is mathematically equivalent to

00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:50.475
either of these other two simplified
versions.
