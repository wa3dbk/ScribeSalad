00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.290
So, to summarize what goes on in the new

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.950
way we are doing the RPC between the client

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.570
and the server. During the actual call, copies through

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.260
the kernel is completely eliminated. Right? It's completely eliminated because

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.350
all of the argument-result passing between the client and

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.250
the serving is happening through this A-stack which is

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.690
mapped into the outer space of the client and

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.800
the server. And so the actual overheads that are incurred

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.170
in making this RPC call is this client trap and

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.380
validation by the kernel that this call can be allowed

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.500
to go through. And switching the domains I told you

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.050
about this trick of doctoring the client thread to start

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.770
executing in the server procedure. That is really switching the

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.460
protection domain from the client address space into the server

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.480
address space so that you can start executing the procedure

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.190
that's visible only in this address space. So that is the

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.590
switching domain in the second overhead.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.490
And finally, when the server procedure is

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.310
done executing, the return trap. That's the

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.150
third explicit cost. So three explicit costs

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:09.460
associated with the actual call. The first explicit is the client trap and, and

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.000
validating this BO. And the second explicit

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.260
cost is switching the protection domain from

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.910
the client to the server so that you can

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.250
start executing the server procedure. And the third explicit

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.940
cost is when we have this return track to

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.540
go back to the client address space. So those

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.990
are the explicit costs. But we know, having done

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.230
a lot of work on the operating system structure

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.740
early on, that there are implicit overheads that are

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.690
associated with switching protection domains. The implicit overhead is

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.020
the loss of locality due to the domain switching that's

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.690
happening. When we go from the client address space to

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.000
the server address space, we are touching, of course we

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.160
are touching some part of the address space, are going to

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.690
be in physical memory and therefore in the caches of

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.780
the processor. But, there's a lot of stuff that may

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.810
not be in the caches of the processor. So, there

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.930
is going to be a loss of locality due to the domain

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.020
switch that, that may happen. In the, in the sense that caches and the processor

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.170
may not have all the stuff that the server needs in order to do its execution.
