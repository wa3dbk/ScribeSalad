00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.300
The first thing I'll modify in my
project.py file is this app.route,

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.030
such that we can respond to GET and
POST requests.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.220
Similarly to when I edited a menu
item the next thing I'll do

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.990
is find the item I want to delete.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.180
In my if statement I'll check again
to see if it's a POST request,

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.000
delete the item, and
redirect back to my main menu.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.790
And if it's a GET request,
I'll go ahead and

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.670
render that deleteMenuItem.html file
with the item I want to delete.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.990
Solutions for this challenge
are available in the Instructor Notes.
