00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.060
I don't want to focus on the CSS code above or the data loading below.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.980
For this example I only want to focus on the draw function.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.400
If you're curious about what exactly the CSS or

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.870
the data loading functions were doing, I suggest reading

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.990
through Mike Bostock's tutorial, which is linked to in the instructor notes.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.950
We have already seen many of the functions that Mike uses in his tutorial.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:34.780
We have scales and range, select and attributes, a domain, and also .text.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.870
The first two lines define the width for the chart and the height for the bars.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.640
A second chunk of code here creates a linear scale and

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.460
sets the range to be zero to the width of our chart.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.850
If you think about these values of zero and width, it makes perfect sense.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.330
We don't want any of our data points to get placed past zero on our chart, or

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.880
in the negative region.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.250
Nor do we want any data points to extend beyond the right

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.269
most edge of our chart.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.480
A subtlety of this code here is that while I've labeled it

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.990
as the x-axis scale and while the variable of storing is x, there

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.220
is nothing specific to this code or its functions which define it as the x-axis.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.360
We will see later that how we use it, however, creates the x values.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.720
The third group of code sets the width on our SVG chart element.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.740
If you remember we hard coded into the HTML an SVG element that had

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.350
the class chart.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.180
So, here we're selecting that chart with d3.select and

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.810
then changing the width attribute to the width variable.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.770
In this case, 420.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.300
Keep in mind that this code corresponds to the blue bars I showed earlier, and

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.880
the blue bars extended from left to right horizontally according to

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.670
the value of the data.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.530
On line 28 here the call to the domain method on X

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.800
has quite a lot of things going on with it.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.030
First off, X was created above here as a linear scale.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.100
Remember, however, what I said earlier about d3's chainable syntax.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:22.580
Even though d3.scale.linear.range is a method call, it returns the scale object.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.760
So x is actually a scale and not a range.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.760
So this call here is actually calling domain on the scale of x.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.620
The domain of our data represents the min and max of our data values.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.800
You can see here that we simply hard code a value of 0 as

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.960
the minimum of our domain.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.440
The d3 max function takes our data as the first argument and

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.510
a function to call on that data as a second argument.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.080
Notice here that the function takes a single argument, d.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.770
What gets passed to this function is actually every datum, so a single piece of

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.500
data, from our data array, and the function gets executed once for each.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.420
So inside of this function,

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.910
d actually corresponds to a single data point and we get its value.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.990
The reason we need to pass a function is that d3,

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.230
being the data-driven library it is,

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.100
could have different ways of defining the max of the domain for a given data.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.440
So this function, passed as a second argument, allows a generalized max function

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.480
to work no matter what your data looks like or what the structure is.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.210
Inside this function, you simply need to return whichever value from each

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.980
data point you want to use as the value to compare in the max calculation.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.030
Notice also that we don't store the return value of x.domain in any variable.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.680
This is because both domain and

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.550
range mutate the internal state of the scale object,

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.150
setting some properties on the object itself rather than returning a value.
