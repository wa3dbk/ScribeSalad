00:00:00.277 --> 00:00:02.685
And in my calculation A is 2. And, the reason

00:00:02.685 --> 00:00:05.434
is the normalizer over here is a half, from

00:00:05.434 --> 00:00:08.411
three to three and a half. To multiply a half

00:00:08.411 --> 00:00:12.091
with 2 gives us the area of 1 which is what

00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:15.041
we want to have for density. Now, what’s

00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:19.382
interesting here? A is larger than 1. Probabilities

00:00:19.382 --> 00:00:21.128
are never larger than 1. They are bound to the

00:00:21.128 --> 00:00:23.642
above by 1. But, densities can be larger than 1.

00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:26.598
In fact, if this package were to arrive between

00:00:26.598 --> 00:00:29.566
3 minutes and 3 minutes and 1 second, then

00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:33.433
this would be 60 because there are 60

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:36.170
seconds in a minute. So, it is possible that

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.224
densities become larger than 1; that’s a bit

00:00:38.224 --> 00:00:40.607
confusing if you think it was probability. But

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:43.277
, you should know that this is the case.
