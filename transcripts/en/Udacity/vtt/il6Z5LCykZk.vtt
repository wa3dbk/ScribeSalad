00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.480
So let's start off by looking at
affine transformation as an example of

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.560
something we want to understand and
figure out all the parameters for.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.490
This would be an equation,

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.670
we would basically have these eight
parameters that would change to

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.209
create an affine warp which basically
means is now have an image like this.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.650
Which after transformation or
warping would appear to be this way.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.480
So an affine transformation basically we
are combining linear transformations,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.150
the ones we looked at, that were
the you know the rotation scaling and

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.310
all of that stuff, with translations.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.110
So in essence, this this image
is now moved over here and

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.205
it's also been warped.

00:00:35.205 --> 00:00:39.111
[SOUND] The properties of an affine
transformation are that origin does not

00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:40.629
necessarily map to origin.

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.369
For example, this could be
the original origin of this image,

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:45.660
we've translated it and then morphed it.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.910
Lines map to lines if you notice,
all lines are still lines here.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.940
They've just changed a little bit but
they're still lines.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.250
And similarly,
parallel lines all remain parallel.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.490
These are the basic properties
of affine transformations.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.630
And one thing, if you noticed,

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.480
this could be achieved by actually
modeling these six parameters.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.250
So, parameters a, b, c, d,
e, f, I have six parameters.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.880
So in essence this is a six degree
of freedom on our presentation and

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.670
once we do this now,

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.340
we can actually figure out the
transformation going from here to there.
