00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.192
&gt;&gt; With this in mind, your next assignment requires you to use the data file

00:00:03.192 --> 00:00:06.417
you've parsed to render the few images on the screen. You're going to need to

00:00:06.417 --> 00:00:09.686
fill out the two functions below to properly draw images on the screen. Now,

00:00:09.686 --> 00:00:13.272
before you get started, let's talk about something real quick. Note that, before

00:00:13.272 --> 00:00:16.820
now, your artists were actually generating assets referencing loose files. And

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.778
artists create some sort of texture, they put it on disk, and then they

00:00:19.778 --> 00:00:23.766
reference an object to that texture. Well, of course, there's a post-process.

00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:27.182
We've all crammed that all into a small little box, and we now have a missing

00:00:27.182 --> 00:00:30.788
correlation. The artist file still is going to reference the loose asset. But

00:00:30.788 --> 00:00:34.215
we've got it sitting around in a larger texture. How do we make a connection

00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:38.161
between the two? The drawSprite function needs to fix this. It assumes that it's

00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:41.943
going to be given a spritename, which represents the name of the loose asset

00:00:41.943 --> 00:00:45.787
file as well as the position X and position Y on where it wants to render it on

00:00:45.787 --> 00:00:49.432
the canvas. Since we're just given a spitename, we need to map where that

00:00:49.432 --> 00:00:53.232
spritename exists inside of the atlases that we've loaded. Now, for your

00:00:53.232 --> 00:00:57.097
benefit, we're going to help you out with this. Taking a look at the top of the

00:00:57.097 --> 00:01:01.123
file, we define a global dictionary object that represents every sprite sheet

00:01:01.123 --> 00:01:05.424
that's been loaded. In the load function for sprite sheet, we go ahead and add

00:01:05.424 --> 00:01:09.712
this sprite sheet into the global array, setting the sheet name as the key for

00:01:09.712 --> 00:01:13.587
the dictionary element. What this will allow you to do is when you're given the

00:01:13.587 --> 00:01:16.997
spritename inside of the draw function, you can iterate through all of the

00:01:16.997 --> 00:01:20.462
sprite sheets and for each sprite sheet, determine whether or not the given

00:01:20.462 --> 00:01:24.062
spritename exists in the sprites that have been defined for that sheet. This

00:01:24.062 --> 00:01:27.857
should be pretty straightforward since we've already covered the defined sprite

00:01:27.857 --> 00:01:31.628
function and you already have a list that includes a name. Once the drawSprite

00:01:31.628 --> 00:01:35.340
function figures out what atlas this given sprite is actually in, it can pass

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.342
that data to drawSpriteInternal, handing off the sprite information, what atlas

00:01:39.342 --> 00:01:42.996
sheet its coming from, as well as the position X and Y that was given to us from

00:01:42.996 --> 00:01:46.750
drawSprite. Drawspriteinternal should actually do the heavy lifting of

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.650
positioning the element, and drawing it to the world, taking advantage of the

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.490
draw image API that we just covered with all of its new fancy bells and whistle

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.230
parameters.
