00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.860
So one of the brilliant things
designers do is produce designs.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.010
They can also help you with one
of the other more important parts

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.910
of the process,
which is choosing between those designs.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.190
So, Jonathan,
what are some best practices for

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.410
making decisions between
designs using user feedback?

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.941
&gt;&gt; Sure, I like to think of it as three
sort of different general areas of your

00:00:19.941 --> 00:00:25.000
designs, when you're thinking about how
to structure your app or your website.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.400
So we have information architecture,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.730
which is sort of the way that things are
structured, and the sort of the flow.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.580
There's also interaction design,
which is whether or

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.860
not it's easy to find a button
on your page or your app.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.380
And then there's also the design
element or the visual design.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.750
The visual design allows a user
to give feedback on the appeal,

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.550
or the color scheme, or
other elements within your design.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.360
So thinking a bit within
these three general areas

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.480
gives you sort of the ability to sort
of ask the questions that you want to

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.300
get good feedback from your design.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.070
&lt;&lt; Okay, so as an example we had

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.970
feedback in our original paper prototype
that our structure was confusing, you

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.720
just couldn't actually check things off
in that from information architecture.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.490
And then we also had feedback that the
frequent action button was good size,

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.460
and so
that would be like interaction design.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.140
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; And

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.250
then we also had feedback that our
check boxes were hard to find, or

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.180
not visually appealing.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.990
And so that would be visual design.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.580
&gt;&gt; Correct.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.220
Yeah.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.670
All those elements combined
together I think are essentially

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.350
the concept or
some experts call the conceptual design.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.230
But all those aspects are fundamental
to the design of your app.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.080
And you want to be thinking about all
three as you are developing your app.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.590
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.850
So let's say we've got
a designer who's given us

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.580
two different visual designs for
an element.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.060
Let's say they've given us a button
that is designed one way and

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.660
a button that is designed another way.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.070
How would we go about using user
research to choose between those?

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.220
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.220
So you can do two types of studies.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.320
One, you can run through
a group of users, like two or

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.160
three users where you show button A then
you show button B and you ask for

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.070
them to provide feedback on that set.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.580
Then in a separate study,
you can do it for

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.890
a separate group of users
showing button D, then button A.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.000
You can compare your notes from both
of those studies to find out which

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.840
is the best button to use.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.010
&gt;&gt; And do users tend to prefer
the one they see first generally, or

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.110
the one they see last generally?

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.280
Or is it not as clear as all that?

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.760
&gt;&gt; It's not always that clear and
simple.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.020
Oftentimes you want to get
a user's initial reactions.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.300
But showing them close together
really helps give them

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.710
a visual cue to telling you whether or
not it's something they really enjoy.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:55.660
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.280
One of the things we just used
as an example was there's button

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.900
A and there's button B.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.470
What happens if the designer gives
you five or ten button designs?

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.700
Do you still test all of those at once
or do you test just two at a time?

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.090
I think it's really important to be
thinking about can the user achieve

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.780
what you're intending them
to achieve with your design.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.730
So, it can be ten buttons or
it can be 15 buttons, but

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.600
can they achieve what the intended task
or objective is with your designs?

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.350
So, if the designer presents you
with many different buttons,

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.650
it may be helpful just to kind
of trim it down a little bit.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.420
But, if you have that many buttons in
order to achieve the intended task,

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.860
you may still need to test on all of
those buttons being available there.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.300
&gt;&gt; So it sounds like it's best to

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.790
compare these buttons
in separate studies.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.500
It also sounds likes it's best to think
about all three levels of design,

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.750
when you're thinking about
alternate designs for your app.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:00.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
That's right.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.900
And I think you sort of hit
the nail on the head when you say,

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.280
thinking about all three levels.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.450
Thinking about all three levels
really encompasses the heart or

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.260
the concept or the conceptual
design aspect of your app.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.000
You should really be doing something

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.040
that enables a user to do
something that they love to do.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.500
And that's really the heart
aspect of your app.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.520
Something that I always really
enjoy talking about too.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.920
&gt;&gt; Awesome,
thank you again for coming in.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.760
I appreciate it.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.260
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
