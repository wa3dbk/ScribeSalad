00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.605

00:00:18.605 --> 00:00:20.020
John Stasko.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.010

strength of the relationships between

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.230
the staging of prostate cancer here and

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.060
the specific medications and other
treatments used by their physicians.
