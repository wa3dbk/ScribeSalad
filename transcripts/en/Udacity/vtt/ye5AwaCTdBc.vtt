00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.200
When we use any manmade tool or device,
we typically look to its form and

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.810
design to give us an idea of
what it does and how it works.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.429
A classic example is a kettle.

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:12.602
I can look at this kettle and recognize
that the handle side is the one I'm

00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:14.890
meant to grab,
even if I've never seen one before,

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.167
because I've seen the same basic shape
on things like coffee mugs, pots,

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:19.912
pitchers, and various other things.

00:00:19.912 --> 00:00:21.197
It serves a practical purpose.

00:00:21.197 --> 00:00:24.756
It's shaped so I can comfortably get
my hand around it, and it's insulated.

00:00:24.756 --> 00:00:28.285
But also, the fact that I've seen many
similar handles before gives me a visual

00:00:28.285 --> 00:00:29.440
clue here.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.226
After all, I could probably pick
the kettle up by the spout if I really

00:00:32.226 --> 00:00:34.680
wanted, although I'd probably
end up burning myself, and

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.571
it'd be pretty tricky to
pour water out of it.

00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:38.476
When it comes to graphical
user interfaces,

00:00:38.476 --> 00:00:41.140
affordances still represent
the actions we can take.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.299
But now they moment of far is cool
since there's no physical object to

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:45.093
interact with.

00:00:45.093 --> 00:00:49.860
Some classic examples of technology
affordances are buttons, you will be

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.790
hard pressed to find any software UI
without at least one button on it, and

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.059
sliders from scroll bars to
playback controls to price limits.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.250
Something I like to think about is how
real world objects get translated into

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.890
purely visual metaphors to
create those affordance cues for

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.040
graphical user interfaces.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.800
For example, you can clearly see
a button on a keyboard reflected in

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.700
a button element and a checkbox on
a ballot paper in a checkbox element.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.620
While some graphical UI
influences may not be immediately

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.680
obvious to new users, for example,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.490
someone new to computers might need to
experiment to learn to use scroll bars.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.630
People generally learn the visual cues
quickly with little or no training.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.180
Well designed affordances enable people
to do something with as little training

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.780
as possible.
