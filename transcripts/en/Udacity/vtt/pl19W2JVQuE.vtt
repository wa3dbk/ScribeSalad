00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.745
For all the trinomials we've factored so far they had a Greatest Common Factor

00:00:04.745 --> 00:00:08.434
of 1. We haven't had to pull out a Greatest Common Factor first yet. Whenever

00:00:08.434 --> 00:00:12.814
we're given a trinomial we should first look to see if there is a Greatest

00:00:12.814 --> 00:00:16.166
Common Factor. What do you think is the Greatest Common Factor for this

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:21.730
trinomial? Write that answer here. Then I want you to factor the GCF from this

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.334
trinomial. You should have a GCF on the outside and then three terms in

00:00:26.334 --> 00:00:27.533
parenthesis here.
