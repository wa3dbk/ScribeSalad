00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.410
Here's an example of phase one.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.550
Both sides have
a pre-shared secret key and

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.310
they use Diffie-Hellman to establish
a new shared key, and they use

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.660
the pre-shared key to authenticate
this newly established shared key.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.940
Here's how it works.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.110
First the initiator sends to
the responder the crypto that

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.130
it proposes to use,
along with the cookie.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.770
The cookie can be easily
computed by the initiator and

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.730
can be easily verified by responder.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.360
For example,
this cookie can be computed as a hash

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.800
over the initiator's IP address and
the current time stamp together.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.520
The cookie is used to prove that
the initiator has done some computation,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.370
is serious about following
through the protocol.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.250
In general, cookies are used to mitigate
denial of service attacks where

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.050
an initiator can send a lot of requests
to a responder at no, or little, cost.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.360
The responder then sends back its
choice of crypto algorithms and

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.150
its own cookie to the initiator.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.519
Second, here YI and

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.640
YR are the property components of the
Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and NI and

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.280
NR are the Nonce values of
the initiator and the responder.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.540
Third, both the initiator and responder

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.550
compute the same shared key according
to Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.820
And other keys for the IKSA,
fourth they then exchange hash values

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.640
to authenticate the newly established
key using their pre-shared secret key.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.440
The hash is computed
using the information

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.480
that they have just exchanged
along with the pre-shared key.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.270
We will explain this shortly.
