The study that showed the critical importance of attachment bonding in social

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:10.240
stimulation and development is the Tiffany Field's 1979 study. She studied

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.750
newborns who were whisked away from their mothers right after they were born.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.078
Either cause they were born prematurely or they were too small or they were at

00:00:18.078 --> 00:00:22.359
risk of not surviving. She got permission from a hospital to do an experiment

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:27.077
where she has two groups. So, half the babies that were preterm or at risk

00:00:27.077 --> 00:00:32.208
received the standard care. And that treatment was removal from mom, and

00:00:32.208 --> 00:00:36.766
isolated in a germ-free incubator. The other half of the preterm at risk babies

00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:41.274
received the new treatment. This was 15 minutes of skin to skin touching and

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:44.239
stroking from the nurse, every single day.
