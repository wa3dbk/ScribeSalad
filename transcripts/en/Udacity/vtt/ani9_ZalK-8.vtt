Hi. I'm here with Jonathan and Ryan again of Zipfian Academy.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.640
And I want to take a step back before we dive too much into

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.530
detail about data visualization.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.820
I really want to get your guys' insight into sort of the background of

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.700
students and what it takes to be successful in creating data visualizations.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.190
So I guess for you, Jonathan,

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.840
what sort of things do you want students to now after their time at Zipfian?

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a great question Chris.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.230
And seeing so many students work on so many projects here at Zipfian coming from

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.040
a diverse set of backgrounds I would say the most common hang up I

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.530
see with students is focusing too much on some complex analysis, or

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.200
optimizing some model without thinking about the larger process as a whole.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.700
And I often like to tell my students your greatest insight is only as good

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.790
as your ability to communicate it.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.660
So if you spend weeks optimizing a model to be 99.9% accurate,

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.230
but don't think about how someone might use it or derive some value from it,

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.670
it's basically useless.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.290
&gt;&gt; Oh, interesting.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.620
And for you Bryan I guess what sort of things do you think students need to

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.960
know in order to be successful in creating data visualizations?

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah I think data visualization is really interesting because it's

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.770
both an art and a science.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.430
So, students not only need to know how to code, to work with the libraries, and

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.560
explore your data, but you also have to have a really good sense of visual

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.110
design and storytelling to craft something that's compelling to the audience.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.490
We're going to cover both aspects in this course, in order to students to

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.380
think really critically about the visualizations that they create.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.020
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.790
Thanks so much guys.
