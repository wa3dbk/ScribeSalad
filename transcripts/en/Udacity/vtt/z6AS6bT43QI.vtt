00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.778
Sometimes we might run into inequalities that are not in slope intercept form.

00:00:04.778 --> 00:00:09.487
We can handle these inequalities much like we did linear equations. We can try

00:00:09.487 --> 00:00:14.184
and solve this inequality for y. First I subtract x from both sides, to get

00:00:14.184 --> 00:00:19.324
negative 4y is less than or equal to negative 12 minus x. I'm going to rearrange

00:00:19.324 --> 00:00:24.029
the terms here. So, I'll have negative 4y less than or equal to negative x minus

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.632
12. Notice that the sign in front of the term stays with it. The x is still

00:00:28.632 --> 00:00:33.333
negative, as before. And this 12 is still negative, as before. Finally, we

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:37.959
divide every term by negative 4. Here's where we need to be very careful. We're

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:42.323
dividing by a negative, and this is an inequality symbol. Just like from before,

00:00:42.323 --> 00:00:46.695
we know we need to reverse the inequality sign. The other thing we want to watch

00:00:46.695 --> 00:00:50.797
out for are the negatives on the other side. A negative divided by a negative

00:00:50.797 --> 00:00:54.895
makes a positive, and the same is true here. So we're left with, y is greater

00:00:54.895 --> 00:00:58.376
than or equal to 1 4th x plus 3. And don't forget about that 1 as the

00:00:58.376 --> 00:01:02.308
coefficient in front of x. That's how we can get positive 1 4th. Now that we

00:01:02.308 --> 00:01:06.491
have this inequality, we can graph it just like before. We'll start by plotting

00:01:06.491 --> 00:01:10.370
the line. Then we'll determine whether or not that line should be dashed or

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.822
solid. And finally, we can determine the region by using a test point. We plug

00:01:14.822 --> 00:01:19.596
in a point to see if it makes the inequality true. If it does, we want that

00:01:19.596 --> 00:01:22.330
region. If not, we'll take the other one.
