00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.530
A heap is another specific type of tree
with some of its own additional rules.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.300
In a heap, elements arranged in
increasing or decreasing order

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.260
such that the root element is either the
maximum or minimum value in the tree.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.360
There are two different types of heaps.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.700
Max heaps and min heaps that
capture those two situations.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.100
In a max heap, a parent must always
have a greater value than its child so

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.570
the root ends up being
the biggest element.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.720
The opposite is true of min heaps, a
parent has a lower value than its child

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.600
so the root is the minimum element.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.260
Heaps don't need to be binary trees, so
parents can have any number of children.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.860
Operations like search, insert and

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.820
delete can vary a lot based on
the type of heap we're discussing.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.490
Here, I'm going to focus
on a max binary heap.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.500
We're going to keep
the two children rule and

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.309
the root will be the maximum element.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.990
In addition,
a binary heap must be a complete tree,

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.660
meaning all levels except
the last one are completely full.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.570
If the last level isn't totally full,
values are added from left to right.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.500
The right most leaf will be empty
until the whole row has been filled.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.850
In this heap,
a function that gets the maximum value,

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.615
also called peek,
happens in constant time.

00:01:20.615 --> 00:01:23.250
Let's see what search looks like.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.750
Should we start our search by
going to the left or the right?

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.720
In a BST, we knew which direction to
go at each step by doing comparisons.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.330
Here there's no guarantee either way.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.520
Thus, searching ends up being a linear
time operation since normally,

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.590
we can't rely on tricks and
we'll end up searching the entire tree.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.720
One thing to note is that we can
actually use the maxi properties to our

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.720
advantage in a search.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.210
For example, we can quit our search
immediately if the element we're

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.800
searching for is bigger than the root.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.460
In general,

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.199
if our node value is bigger than
the one we're comparing to, we don't

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.500
need to check anything in its sub-tree
since we know that it's the biggest.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.160
The worst case remains but
in the average case,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.160
we don't actually need
to search every element.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.490
The average case is
closer to n over two but

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.220
that's still approximated
to linear time.
