00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.560
So in order to learn about programming, we need to learn

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.820
new language. This will be a way to describe what we want

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.109
the computer to do in a much more precise way than we

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.150
could in a natural language like English. And it's a way to

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.830
describe programs that the Python interpreter can run. One of the

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.810
best ways to learn a programming language is to just try things.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.460
You can try that in the Python interpreter that's running in your

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.380
browser. Let's, for example, try running print 2 plus 2 plus. In

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.530
English, someone could probably guess that the value of 2 plus

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.049
2 plus should be 4. In Python, when we try running

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.390
this, we get an error. And the reason we get an

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.190
error is that this is not actually part of the Python

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.390
language. The Python interpreter only knows how to evaluate code that's

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.570
part of the Python language. If you try to evaluate something

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.120
that's not part of the Python language, it will give you

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.480
an error. Errors look a bit scary, the way they print out.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.960
But there's nothing bad that can happen. It's perfectly okay to

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.050
try running code. If it produces an error, that's one of

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.840
the ways to learn about programming. The error we got here

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.670
is what's called a syntax error. That means that what we

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.730
tried to evaluate is not actually part of the Python language.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.790
Like English, Python has a grammar that defines what strings are

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.970
in the language. In English, we can make lots of sentences

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.610
that are not completely grammatical, and

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.560
people still understand them, but there's

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.770
some underlying grammar behind the language. Those of you who are

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.110
native English speakers, might have learned rules like this in what was

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.960
once called grammar school. Those of you who learned English as a

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.810
second language, probably learned rules like

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.560
this when you were learning English.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.200
So, English has a rule that says you can make a

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.760
sentence. By combining a subject with a verb, followed by an object.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.470
Almost every language has a rule sort of like this. The order

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.560
of the subject and the verb and the object might be different,

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.500
but there's a way to combine those three things to

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.370
form a sentence. The subject could be a noun. The object

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.080
could also be a noun. And then each of these

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.130
parts of speech, well, we have lots of things they could

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.840
be. So a verb could be the word eat. A

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.650
verb could also be the word like, and there are lots

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.350
of other words that the verb could be. A noun could

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.130
be the word I, a noun could be the word Python,

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.032
a noun could be the word cookies. The actual English

00:02:10.032 --> 00:02:13.740
grammar is of course, much larger and more complex than this.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.650
But we can still think of it as having rules like

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.380
this that allow us to form sentences from the parts of

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.000
speech that we know, from the words that make those

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.060
parts of speech. The way we're writing grammars here is a

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.150
notation called Backus-Naur Form. And this was invented by John Backus.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.410
So John Backus was the lead designer of the Fortran programming

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.980
language back in the 1950s at IBM. This was one

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.050
of the first widely used programming languages. And the way

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.210
they described the Fortran language was with lots of examples

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.810
and text explaining what they meant. And this is a shot

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.670
from the actual manual for the first version of Fortran.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.440
This works okay, many programmers were able to understand it and

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.330
guess correctly what it meant, but was not nearly precise

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.660
enough. And when it came time to design a later language,

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.090
which was the language called ALGOL, it became

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.730
clear that this informal way of describing languages

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.320
wasn't precise enough. And John Backus invented the

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.420
notation that we're using here to describe languages.
