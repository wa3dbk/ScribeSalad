00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.615
For this problem, a grocer wants to mix pounds of raisins with pounds of nuts

00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:07.708
to get a trail mix. He's wondering how much of each he should use to make the

00:00:07.708 --> 00:00:11.220
trail mix. So, we know we're going to need two variables, r will stand for

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.360
pounds of raisins he'll use and n will stand for the pounds of nuts he'll use.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.970
The trail mix will contain both the raisins and the nuts. So, if we add up the

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.994
pounds of the raisins, and the pounds of the nuts, we'll get our total pounds

00:00:22.994 --> 00:00:28.124
of trail mix. I can use these variables to write my first equation. The pounds

00:00:28.124 --> 00:00:32.216
of raisins r, plus the pounds of nuts n, should equal 15, our total amount of

00:00:32.216 --> 00:00:37.174
trail mix. For the second equation, we know that the cost of raisins plus the

00:00:37.174 --> 00:00:42.068
cost of the nuts should be the total cost of the trail mix. Our raisins are

00:00:42.068 --> 00:00:46.094
charged at $3.50 per pound, so if I take $3.50 per pound times the number of

00:00:46.094 --> 00:00:52.503
pounds of raisins, I'll get my cost of the raisins. The same is true for the

00:00:52.503 --> 00:00:58.202
nuts. We have n pounds of nuts times $2.00 per pound. So this is my cost. The

00:00:58.202 --> 00:01:02.788
trail mix is going to cost $2.66 per pound. But we need to figure out how much

00:01:02.788 --> 00:01:07.024
pounds in total we have of trail mix. If we used r pounds of raisins and n

00:01:07.024 --> 00:01:12.988
pounds of nuts, then our total pounds of trail mix would be r plus n. This last

00:01:12.988 --> 00:01:15.932
part is probably one of the hardest steps in this problem, but if you remember

00:01:15.932 --> 00:01:18.876
that you are making the trail mix from pounds of raisins and pounds of nuts, it

00:01:18.876 --> 00:01:23.717
should make sense. I'm going to solve this system using substitution, since I

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:27.733
can easily sub with one of these variables. If I subtract r from both sides,

00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:32.540
I'll get n is equal to 15 minus r. Now I can perform substitution. I'll take 15

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.816
minus r and plug it in for n in my second equation. I could also take 15 minus

00:01:37.816 --> 00:01:42.902
r and plug it in for n right here in the equation. But I already know the value

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:48.290
of r plus n. I know r plus n is equal to 15, so I can replace this entire

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.241
parentheses with 15. Replacing this parentheses with 15 will be much simpler

00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:58.761
than replacing this n with 15 minus r. Because here we'll get a number instead

00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:04.264
of a bunch of variables. Next, I group my like terms together. Then I subtract

00:02:04.264 --> 00:02:08.839
30 from both sides to get 1.5r is equal to 9. Finally, we divide by the

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:13.000
coefficient of r to get r is equal to 6. R showed for the number of pounds of

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.695
raises we used, so really this is 6 pounds. The pounds of raises and the pounds

00:02:17.695 --> 00:02:21.850
of nuts should add up to 15. So, using some mental math, or solving an

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.961
equation, we can get n as equal to 9 pounds, the pounds of nuts. As always,

00:02:26.961 --> 00:02:31.089
let's go back and make sure these answers make sense. Our pounds of raisins was

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:36.090
6, and our pounds of raisins was 9. So, the grocer had 6 pounds and 9 pounds,

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.299
which did indeed total 15 pounds. Next we can replace 6 for r and 9 for n to

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.835
determine the cost and make sure that our second equation is true. So, we

00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:50.375
replace each of the variables, and then I multiply each of these numbers

00:02:50.375 --> 00:02:55.976
together, making sure to add 6 and 9 before multiplying by $2 and 60 cents. So

00:02:55.976 --> 00:03:00.812
we have 21 dollars plus 18 dollars equals 39 dollars so yes this equation is

00:03:00.812 --> 00:03:03.060
true as well
