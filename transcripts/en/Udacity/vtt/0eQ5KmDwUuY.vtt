00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.393
Building a relationship with an investor
is just like building a relationship

00:00:03.393 --> 00:00:04.216
with a colleague.

00:00:04.216 --> 00:00:07.622
It's something that fosters
over a long period of time and

00:00:07.622 --> 00:00:10.887
you get out of it what you're
willing to put into it, and

00:00:10.887 --> 00:00:15.610
you can't think of investors as people
you go to when there's a crisis.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.160
You have to think of them as people
you can go to on a regular basis and

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.920
share ideas and get feedback and
react to that feedback.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.330
And you can't, you have to figure out
how to balance doing exactly what

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.520
the investor says verses taking your own
path and figure out where that fits.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.050
If you always do exactly
what the investors say,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.470
that's probably not a recipe for
success.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.800
Likewise if you ignore all of
the advice that you're getting,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.010
that's not going to work out very well.
