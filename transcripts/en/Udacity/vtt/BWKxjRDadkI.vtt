00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.450
So now we're ready to finish the Web Crawler. And remember

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.600
what we want the Web Crawler to do. So, we have

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.420
a seed page, and we're assuming we know some seed page

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.460
to start with. And the seed page has some links on it.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.920
We want to be able to find those links, and we

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.330
know how to do that now. We're going to get them to

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.670
list, and then we're going to follow those links. So we'll follow

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.390
the links. To new pages, and those new pages might also have

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.180
links, and we want to follow those links. So

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.560
in order to do this, we need to think about

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.240
two things. We need to keep track of all

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.950
the pages that we're waiting to crawl, and we'll introduce

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.090
a variable, tocrawl, to do that. And what tocrawl

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.840
will be is a list of pages left to crawl.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.580
So, initially it'll just be the seed page. Once

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.410
we collect the links on the seed page well it

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.130
will include those links as well. Once we finish crawling a

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.990
page, we don't want to keep it in tocrawl anymore. And

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.270
as we find new pages to crawl, they'll be added to

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.280
the tocrawl list. The other variable we want is to keep track

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.660
of all the pages that we've crawled. At the end of

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.400
our crawl, this is the result. We want to know all the pages

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.980
that we found. That will be stored in the variable we'll

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.480
call crawled. So let's walk through an example of how this should

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.280
work on the sample site.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.280
So I'll make the seed page, www.udacity.com/cs101x/index.html, that's

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.900
this page here. That means when we start

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.440
to crawl, we want tocrawl to be this

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.990
index page. And I'm going to stop writing out the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.060
full URLs, just writing out the final part.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.050
because all the pages we crawl will be

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.150
on our test site. So tocrawl will be

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.030
the list containing just one element. The index.html page.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.730
We haven't crawled anything yet, we're just getting started, so

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.430
crawled will start out as the empty list. The next

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.040
thing we're going to do is crawl this page, so

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.490
we'll get all the links on this page. That means

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.510
we've crawled the index page, so that will now be

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.710
added to crawled. But when we looked at the links

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.030
on the index page, we found three new links on

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.030
that page. We found a link here, which goes to crawling.html.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.840
We found the link here, which goes to walking.html.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.470
And we found the link here that goes to flying.html.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.810
So the new value of tocrawl, after crawling this page,

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.070
will have those three links in it. The next thing

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.150
we want to do is take one of those links

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.520
and crawl it. The order actually matters a lot in

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.200
terms of getting a good crawl. Let's assume for now

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.970
that we'll do just do the last one first. So,

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.880
we'll do the link fly. That links to

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.930
the flying page. Here is the page there. So,

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.060
we are going to crawl the page flying.html. This

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.880
page doesn't have any links. If you're not sure

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.980
why squeamish ossifrage is the magic words, I

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.790
would encourage you to DuckDuckGo or Google that. And

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.890
now we've finished crawling flying, so that's going to

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.115
be added to the crawled list, which already had

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:05.260
index.html, we don't lose that. We're going to add the

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.410
new one, which is flying, to that list. And

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.980
we finished crawling it so we don't want to crawl

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.410
it again. Let's remove it from the tocrawl list. Now,

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.800
after we're crawled flying, we have two more links

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.950
left in our tocrawl list. We have two links

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.400
that we've crawled. So let's try another link. Let's

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.280
suppose we follow the crawling.html link. And we follow crawling.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.150
We get to this page. So, to follow crawling, we're

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.620
going to follow the same algorithm we did with flying. Alright, so

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.940
that removes this link from the tocrawl list, adds it

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.100
to the crawl list. So, we're done crawling, crawling. And now

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.870
we want to add to our tocrawl lists all the

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.170
links that we find on this page. Well, we found the

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.400
link, kicking, which goes to the page, kicking.html So we're going to

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.260
add that to our list of pages to crawl, and now

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.640
we keep going. And we're going to keep going.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.600
We'll follow kicking. We find that kicking does not

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.980
have any links. So that would add kicking

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.678
to the crawled list and remove it from the

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:08.090
to crawl lists. And we're going to keep going

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.380
until we have no more pages to crawl. So

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.750
let me describe that process a little more formally

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.190
and then I'll ask you a question about it.
