00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:05.420
Chi-square test for goodness-of-fit look at how well our observed values match

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.950
our expected values for a certain variable. For example, this variable could be

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.340
your response to the question do you like ice cream? Response one would be yes.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.830
Response two would be no. But of course there might be a whole number of

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.230
responses for a particular variable like which season do you prefer? In that

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.695
case there would be four responses, spring, summer, winter, fall. But

00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:34.820
chi-square tests can also help us determine whether or not two variables are

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.910
independent. In a chi-square test for independence, instead of just having the

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.828
observed and expected values in the two rows, we'll be looking at the number of

00:00:44.828 --> 00:00:50.020
participants or subjects who answered response one for variable one. And

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.710
response one for variable two or the number who answered response two for

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.980
variable one and response one for variable two, etcetera. We're going to

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.560
illustrate the chi-square test for independence with a real research example.
