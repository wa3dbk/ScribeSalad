00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.280
Optionals are also necessary for
downcasting in swift.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.520
Here's what I mean by downcasting.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.240
Occasionally objects are labeled
as members of a particular class.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.820
But can also act as
a member of a subclass,

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.160
to downcast is to cast such an object
as an instance of its subclass.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.850
You'll see a lot of downcasting
with optionals when you start

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.060
interacting with classes like UI
storyboard and the app delegate.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.540
But let's start with a simpler example.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.330
Here we have a beverage class with two
subclasses, hot drink and cold drink.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.740
We also have an array of beverages.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.190
Because there are both hot drinks and

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.970
cold drinks in this array,
the array must be of class beverage.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.040
There are no mixed type arrays in Swift.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.230
Let's say we wanted to loop through
the array of beverages, And

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.240
generate a message that will
offer each of the drink choices.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.760
When we loop through the array,
each item will be treated as a beverage.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.620
But we really want our message
to be more specific than that.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.920
It would be better if we could cast a
beverage as a hot drink or a cold drink.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.819
Before offering a drink to a guest.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.180
Now, there are two points here
I'd like you to remember.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.260
First focus on this piece of code here.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.440
When we grab a drink from the array
we don't know whether it can be

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.400
cast to a cold drink or not.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.040
So we use an optional cast
with an as question mark.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.270
Also known as a type cast operator.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.970
By casting the item from the array
as an optional ColdDrink,

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.990
we're saying this item could be
a ColdDrink or it could be nil.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.620
Here's the second point
I'd like you to remember.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.160
As we know, optionals can't be
used until they're unwrapped.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.690
So if you use the as question
mark typecast operator,

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.240
you also have some unwrapping to do.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.700
Just like we've done previously with
other optionals we can use a flat.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.880
Remember that the if let construction
checks to see if an optional

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.060
has a value.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.410
If it does have a value
this code gets executed and

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.720
we can use cold drink in our message.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.210
If it doesn't have a value
the ELSE block is executed, and

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.910
the beverages cast as a hot drink.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.150
And here in the sidebar we can
see those custom messages.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.360
But let's not forget about
the exclamation points.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.360
Although they are risky
they can also be convenient

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.100
in cases where we're confident about the
identity of the object being downcast.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.030
Let's say we're a coffee shop.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.660
We only serve hot coffee.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.300
But for some reason a method from an
Apple library is returning in array of

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.450
items of class beverage.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.360
If we never deal in cold drinks,

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.210
we might boldly downcast
beverages to hot drinks using as!.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:41.010
As we know, optionals with exclamation
points automatically unwrap.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.800
So our downcasting work is done.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.000
No if let required.
