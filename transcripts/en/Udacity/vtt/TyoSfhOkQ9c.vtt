00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.080
One of the mistakes that
people often make is to

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.970
only test their site's
performance on the desktop.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.550
Because desktops are significantly
more powerful than mobiles,

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.910
it means you can miss performance issues
that only show up when on device's CPU,

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.470
memory or connectivity constrained.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.350
What you want to do is where you can,
test on real devices.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.820
If you have an Android device,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.630
you can use the same Chrome DevTools
you know and love from your desktop.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.390
So I can start it, interact, stop,

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.510
and you can see I got a timeline
that I can work with.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.610
If you don't have an Android
device available,

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.570
you can check out
the instructor notes below for

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.610
how to use the emulation
settings in Chrome DevTools.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.780
Remember though, that the performance
characteristics of simulators and

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.370
emulators are wildly
different to a device itself.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.440
So while it's good for getting used to
the workflow, you'll need to test on

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.190
the device itself to make sure that you
don't have any performance issues there.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.100
In the next video, Peter Lovis is
going to show you how you can use

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.870
Chrome DevTools with
your Andriod device.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.270
If you already know, just skip ahead.
