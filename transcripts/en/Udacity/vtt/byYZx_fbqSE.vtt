00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.400
Let us now look at a different problem, not a 2 by 1 matrix problem but

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.720
a problem called the guards and

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.770
prisoners problem. Actually this problem goes by many names, Cannibals and

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.120
missionaries problem, the jealous husbands problem and so on. It was first seen

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.070
in a math text book about 880 and has been used by many people in AI for

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.800
discussing problem representation. Imagine that there are three guards and

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.790
three prisoners, on one bank of the river and they must all cross to

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.750
the other bank. There is one boat, just one boat and they can only take one or

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.900
two people at a time, not more and the boat cannot travel alone.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.330
On either bank, prisoners can never outnumber the guards, if they do they will

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.080
overpower the guards. So, the number of guards must at least be equal to

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.020
the number of prisoners on each bank. We'll assume these are good prisoners.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.340
They won't runaway if they're left alone. Although they might beat up

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.490
the guards if they outnumber them. That's the beauty of this class.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.230
We lead with real problems, practical problems. We also make up problems to

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.160
help illustrate specific things. I think you're going to have fun with this one.
