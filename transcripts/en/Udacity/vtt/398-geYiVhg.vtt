00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.310
We covered a lot in this lesson.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.770
Now you know how to send specific
hits to Google Analytics for

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.440
screen views, events, steps in
the shopping process, and timing data.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.090
I also talked about
tracking exceptions and

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.310
crashes, as well as tracking
how users download your app.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.200
But what if you want to send
completely different kinds of data that

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.670
the amazing engineers
at Google Analytics

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.400
hadn't thought of when they
created the dashboard and API?

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.680
Well, they're ahead of you.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.100
They knew they couldn't anticipate
every possible use case, so

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.360
they added the ability for

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.070
you to add your own custom metadata
when you send hits to Analytics.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.750
You'll need to configure custom metrics,
or dimensions, in the Analytics admin

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.620
dashboard and then attach the custom
data when sending the hit in your code.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.690
I'll leave you to read about that
in the developer documentation

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.840
when you are ready to try it out.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.360
But, now,
let's go learn about Tag Manager.
