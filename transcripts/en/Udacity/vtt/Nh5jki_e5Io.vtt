00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.397
So now I want to have a quiz to see that you understand multiple inheritance and

00:00:03.397 --> 00:00:07.230
see where it can get tricky. So suppose we add an init method to both the Black

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.006
Bear and the Discerning Bear classes, and that init method is going to use

00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:15.294
super, passing in the Black Bear here, passing in Discerning Bear here, calling

00:00:15.294 --> 00:00:18.997
init, but adding to the name. Black in front of a Black Bear and Discerning in

00:00:18.997 --> 00:00:22.802
front of a Discerning Bear. Then, we'll define Discerning Black Bear with two

00:00:22.802 --> 00:00:26.822
based classes, the Discerning Bear and the Black Bear and no attributes defined

00:00:26.822 --> 00:00:30.393
inside the Discerning Black Bear. Then, we'll create an instance of the

00:00:30.393 --> 00:00:33.928
Discerning Black Bear passing in Mortimer as the name. And I'll give you five

00:00:33.928 --> 00:00:36.886
choices, it could be Mortimer, it could be Black Mortimer, it could be

00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:40.099
Discerning Mortimer, it could be Black Discerning Mortimer, or it could be

00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:43.483
Discerning Black Mortimer. What do you think Mortimer's name will be?
