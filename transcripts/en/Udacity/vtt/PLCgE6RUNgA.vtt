00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:07.294
Log base 5 of 9 is equal to log base e of 9 over log base e of 5. Or in other

00:00:07.294 --> 00:00:12.982
words ln of 9 over ln of 5. Now, it's time to bring out our calculator. So we

00:00:12.982 --> 00:00:19.531
plug in ln of 9 divided by ln of 5. And here we go, we get the same decimal

00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:27.415
that we did before. 1.36521238897 and continuing. This is, of course, rounded.

00:00:27.415 --> 00:00:31.767
Great. The important thing is that this number is equal to what we had when we

00:00:31.767 --> 00:00:37.682
converted to base 10 instead base e. That means that regardless of what we set

00:00:37.682 --> 00:00:41.626
b our new base equal to, the original expression log base 5 of 9 has this

00:00:41.626 --> 00:00:44.669
value. Awesome.
