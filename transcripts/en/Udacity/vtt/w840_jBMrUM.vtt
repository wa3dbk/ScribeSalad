00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In lecture we showed that a * b = xy + z.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We need to solve for z, substituting in values

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
for a = 63, b = 12, x = 20, and y = 12, plus z.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Finishing the rest of the math, we get that z = 516.
