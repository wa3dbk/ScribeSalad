00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.167
This graph represents y equal to negative x to the third. Just like in the

00:00:04.167 --> 00:00:07.401
previous quiz with the parabola, changing the sign in the leading coefficient

00:00:07.401 --> 00:00:11.673
simply flips the graph upside down. Note that for y equals x cubed, like we

00:00:11.673 --> 00:00:15.650
said before, the graph is starting way down low on the left and reaching up way

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.605
high to the right. Since y equals negative x cubed is going to have all the

00:00:20.605 --> 00:00:24.448
opposite function values that y equals x cubed has, it starts really high on

00:00:24.448 --> 00:00:29.190
the left and reaches way down low on the right.
