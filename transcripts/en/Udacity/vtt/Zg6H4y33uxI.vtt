00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's talk about a final implication of the interaction between testing domains

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and trust relationships between different entities.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's say we have some sort of an interface here,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and on both sides of it we have people we trust.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Here's me, here are some of my teammates.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And so the question we have to ask is can I trust my teammates,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and can my teammates trust me to always generate inputs when using the various APIs

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that remain within the domain of those inputs?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And of course the answer is generally no.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
In fact, I probably can't even trust myself to always generate inputs

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that are within the domain of acceptable inputs for APIs.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And so what this brings us to is the idea of defensive coding--

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that is to say, error checking--for its own sake to detect internal inconsistencies,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and this is something that we'll get to a little bit later during this unit.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So overall, testing software by calling into the APIs that it provides is fairly straightforward.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We just make calls into the API and look at the results.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But something inconvenient about real software is that software doesn't just provide APIs,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
it also uses them.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
What I mean here is that the software under test 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
is going to be issuing calls into libraries and getting return values into the operating system

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and into virtual machines such as the Python runtime.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So let's take, for example, just for the next couple of minutes

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
the idea that the software under test is something like a web browser.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
One thing we can do is test the web browser using the APIs that it provides--

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that is to say, using its graphical user interface--

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and not worry about testing it with respect to the APIs that it uses.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And so what kind of APIs is the web browser using?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
For one thing, it's talking to the network, 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
it's talking to the hard disk through the operating system,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
it's talking to all sorts of lower level interfaces.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And sometimes those APIs don't act as we would expect.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Just as a simple example, let's take the case where our web browser is storing cookies--

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
here I'm trying to draw a chocolate chip cookie--

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
onto the hard drive of the local computer.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Most of the time during testing, we expect the storage and retrieval of cookies

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
to operate perfectly normally.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
But what happens if, for example, the hard disk is full 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
when the web browser tries to store a cookie?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Does the web browser crash?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Does it mangle its internal state in some fashion and become impossible to use?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Or does it gracefully stop storing cookies for that session

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and, for example, wait until there's more disk space free 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
before it starts to store cookies again?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Of course we'd like our web browser to do the right thing, whatever it is,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
but on the other hand, we need to actually test this.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
If we just hope that the software does the right thing,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
then one of the golden rules of testing is we shouldn't ever just hope that it does something;

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
we need to actually check this.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So the problem is that we have this fairly awkward problem

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
where we don't actually control how the operating system responds 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
to calls that we make.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And what I mean by that is the awkward thing here 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
is that we don't actually have direct control 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
over how the operating system responds to calls that we make.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So we can't easily just make storage of a cookie file fail.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Rather, we would have to do something like create a full disk partition,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
arrange for our web browser to store cookies there, and then see how it responds.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And so in this particular case, creating a full disk partition is awkward, but we could do it,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
but there are plenty of cases where lower level software has failure modes

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
that we really can't easily simulate, regardless of how hard we work.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
So what we're going to do now is go back to our friend the UNIX read system call.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Let's take another quick look at the UNIX read system call.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And so this is our UNIX process's read from files,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and so of course real UNIX programs are issuing calls to read constantly,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
maybe hundreds of times per second.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And so earlier, we were concerned with the domain of the read system call--

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
that is to say, the set of possible valid arguments to the read system call--

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and now we're concerned with the range

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
because now we're not testing the UNIX operating system anymore;

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
we're testing a program that runs on top of the UNIX operating system.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And so it's the response of the operating system back to the process that concerns us here.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
We can see here that read returns the number of bytes read from a file,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
but there's an interesting fact here that read is allowed to read 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
less bytes than you actually asked for.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So it's going to return some number between 0 and count,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
but we don't know what number it's going to return.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Another thing that read can do is just fail outright--

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
that is to say, it can return -1 to the application--

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
but it turns out that there are a whole lot of different reasons for that kind of a failure.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
We can see here that there are at least 9 different error conditions that read can return.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
We have EAGAIN, EWOULDBLOCK, EBADF, EFAULT, etc.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And the point is for the application that's calling read,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
the operating system can return any of these values,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and these values aren't all semantically equivalent.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
The application might have to do different things depending on which of these values it gets.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And the point is it might be very hard as people testing the web browser

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
to actually make the operating system read call return all of those different values.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And until we've tested it with all of those different values,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
we're left with software whose behavior we probably don't understand,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and, therefore, it's software that hasn't been tested very well.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And so I'd like to tell you that there's some really great solution to this problem,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
but there really isn't.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And the fact is that a lot of real programs that run on operating systems

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
aren't prepared for some of these odder, stranger responses

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
that the operating systems can deliver,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and, consequently, when those things happen, the software malfunctions.
