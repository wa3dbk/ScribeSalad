00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.420
7 and 8 were the correct answers. Fantastic job factoring if you got those

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.907
correct. When we start to factor a quadratic Equation we should look for the GCF

00:00:09.907 --> 00:00:14.918
first. All the coefficients are even, so we can remove a 2. If we factor a 2

00:00:14.918 --> 00:00:20.220
,we're left with a squared minus 15a plus 56. Now we want to find factors of 1

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.262
times 56. At sum to negative 15. This top number's positive, and this bottom

00:00:25.262 --> 00:00:29.784
number's negative. This must mean my two factors have to be negative. Negative 7

00:00:29.784 --> 00:00:35.894
times negative 8 is positive 56. And negative 7 plus negative 8 is negative 15.

00:00:35.894 --> 00:00:40.692
Since the coefficient is 1 I can use these two factors in my factors. Next we

00:00:40.692 --> 00:00:46.489
set each factor equal to 0. We know 2 does not equal 0. So 2 is not a solution.

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.794
When we solve these two equations we get a is equal to 7 and a is equal to 8.
