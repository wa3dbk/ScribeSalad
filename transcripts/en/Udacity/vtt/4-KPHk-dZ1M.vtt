00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.610
Okay, we're starting course two on congestion control and

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.520
streaming. And we'll first talk about congestion control. In

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.010
particular, what is congestion control and why do we

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.840
need it? Simply put, the goal of congestion control

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.720
is to fill the Internet's pipes without overflowing them.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.400
So to think about this in terms of an

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.140
analogy, suppose you have a sink. And you're filling

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.130
that sink with water. Well, how should you control

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.340
the faucet? Too fast and the sink overflows.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.390
Too slow and you are not efficiently filling up

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.260
your sink. So what you would like to do is to fill the bucket as quickly as

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.350
possible without overflowing. The solution here is to

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.670
watch the sink. And as the sink begins to

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.400
overflow, we want to slow down how fast

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.250
we're filling it. That's effectively how congest control works.
