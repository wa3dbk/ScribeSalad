00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.115
Of all the work we've done to get equations in vertex form, I think we're very

00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:10.502
well equipped at this point to help Grant deal with his profit better. Remember

00:00:10.502 --> 00:00:15.622
the equation we came up with before P equals -200 C squared plus 18,400 C minus

00:00:15.622 --> 00:00:21.035
133,200. Remember that here P stands for Grant's profit in dollars and C stands

00:00:21.035 --> 00:00:26.216
for the price that he sets for each wiper set also in dollars. So considering

00:00:26.216 --> 00:00:30.648
this curve, what is the maximum profit that Grant can make? And what wiper set

00:00:30.648 --> 00:00:33.806
price does he need to pick in order to gain that profit.
