00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Look closely--both axis are logarithmic and you can see as the step size increases by a factor of 10,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the error increases by a factor of 10⁵.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Remember, forward Euler was of order 1, Heun was of order 2. This is the solver of order 5.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Read this the other way around as you shrink the step size by a factor of 10,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the error decreases by a factor of 10⁵--that's a huge gain and you can see that this solver,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
when it takes steps of 3 minutes around earth gets back to where it started within just millimeters.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This is quite an efficient method. It's called the Runge-Kotta feedback method.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Now assume that with all these strange numbers we mistyped one--

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000
mainly we didn't enter 56,430 but we entered 56,431.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Let's look at the result. This doesn't look that great anymore.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We've got an error that's well above 1 km, so getting these numbers right,

00:01:01.000 --> 99:59:59.000
which among other things belong to verification.
