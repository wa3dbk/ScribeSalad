00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.856
One way to change how many times a texture repeats is to modify the UV

00:00:03.856 --> 00:00:07.998
coordinates of the square. This is a bit intrusive, you have to modify the

00:00:07.998 --> 00:00:13.025
geometric mesh itself. 3JS has an alternate solution. It allows you to set two

00:00:13.025 --> 00:00:17.913
parameters on the texture called repeat and offset. These define a transform

00:00:17.913 --> 00:00:21.472
for the texture coordinates themselves. Repeat is essentially a scaling

00:00:21.472 --> 00:00:26.480
operation saying how many times a texture should repeat across the surface.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.360
Offset is a translation adding to the uv coordinate after scaling. Varying the

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.639
offset shifts the texture. One use of this parameter is that you can animate a

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:38.018
texture. For example, if you have a river, you can make the water flow by

00:00:38.018 --> 00:00:42.946
slowly changing one texture coordinate over time. Here you can see the effect

00:00:42.946 --> 00:00:46.384
of changing the repetition. If you repeat a texture too much, it becomes fairly

00:00:46.384 --> 00:00:50.585
obvious that it's being repeated. There are advance solutions such as using

00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:55.014
long tiles to break up this repetition. See the additional course materials for

00:00:55.014 --> 00:00:56.290
more on this topic.
