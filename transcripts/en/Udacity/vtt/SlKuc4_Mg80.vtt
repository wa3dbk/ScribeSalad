00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
So remember at the beginning of this unit when I introduced you

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.090
to nondeterminism and the "if-better" function?

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.310
And we also talked about simulating the if-better function

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.680
and how this takes exponential time to do?

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.320
And I imagine your first reaction to this might have been

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.070
a mild version of "So what?" or even "This is ridiculous."

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.580
But now, think what this means in the context of NP-completeness.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.020
If, for any NP-complete problem, you find a deterministic algorithm

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.100
that runs in polynomial time, then you have also found a way to simulate

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.410
a nondeterministic RAM in polynomial time,

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.780
which would mean that a normal, deterministic RAM without the if-better function

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.240
is just as powerful as one that has this function.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.710
Which, of course, seems a bit strange because our intuition, of course, tells us

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.300
that having this if-better function is super, super powerful

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.940
and should somehow make a difference.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.390
So the cool thing is, there's only 2 possibilities.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.810
Either all NP-complete problems can be solved in polynomial time,

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.640
which would essentially mean that P=NP.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.240
So any problem that can be solved in polynomial time on a nondeterministic RAM

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.420
can be solved in polynomial time on a deterministic RAM.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.950
Or, in other words, a deterministic RAM is just as powerful as a nondeterministic one.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.200
Or it could be the other case, and that is no NP-complete problem

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.220
can be solved in polynomial time.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.870
So P≠NP.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.940
There are certain problems that you can solve in polynomial time

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.230
if you have the if-better function available, but you can not solve them

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.490
in polynomial time if you don't have this function.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.230
So basically, you'd say P≠NP is the same as saying that

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.790
the if-better function is really powerful.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.580
So which one is it? And that question is the famous P vs NP problem.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.150
Because the thing is, we don't know. Nobody knows.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:04.230
Asking this question here, if P=NP or P≠NP, is a problem that is decades old,

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.120
and yet nobody has been able to figure it out.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.290
Now, given how powerful this if-better function is, remember when I introduced it to you?

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.330
It seemed like this magic function that could solve all of our problems.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.210
Many computer scientists nowaday believe that P≠NP,

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.670
but nobody has been able to prove it.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.790
On the other hand, also nobody has been able to find

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.930
a polynomial time algorithm for any single NP-complete problem,

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:39.150
despite, literally, thousands of practically-relevant NP-complete problems being out there.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.140
Now let's think a little bit of how you could resolve this question.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.570
So how could you show that P=NP or P≠NP? And we'll do that as a quiz.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.580
So I'm going to give you a number of accomplishments or things that you could do,

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.240
and I would like you to tell me what that would show.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.890
So, for example, if you found a polynomial-time algorithm for an NP-complete problem,

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.550
would that show that P=NP, would that show that P≠NP,

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.600
or would that show nothing interesting?

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.140
And what if you found an algorithm that solves an NP-complete problem

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.740
in polynomial time on average?

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.750
So not worst-case running time, but average-case running time.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.640
And what about if you showed that the most efficient algorithm for clique

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.280
requires exponential time, on the deterministic RAM, of course?

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.230
Would that show that P=NP, P≠NP, or something else, or we don't know?

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.710
What if you showed that the vertex cover problem has an exponential number

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.750
of potential solutions that any algorithm has to go through?

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.780
What if you were able to reduce the clique problem to the shortest path problem?

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.530
So shortest path is finding the shortest path between 2 vertices in a graph.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.810
What if you were to reduce clique to the problem of finding the shortest path

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.000
between 2 vertices in a graph?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.230
Or what if you could show that any shortest path problem in a graph

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.140
can be solved by solving clique in a transformed graph?

00:04:11.140 --> 99:59:59.000
So please make your selection. Which ones are correct?
