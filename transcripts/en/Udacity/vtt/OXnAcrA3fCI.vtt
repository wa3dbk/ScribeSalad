00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.420
Let's look again at our code for computing the largest

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.220
value. We duplicate the lines asking the user to enter a

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.770
value. Can we avoid this special case for entering the

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.040
value the first time? What if, instead of initializing largest with

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.260
the first double, we initialize it as 0? Will this

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.080
work? Yes, it will work. It will fail if only one

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.820
input is provided. It will fail if the data set

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.060
contains 0. Or it will just fail for some data sets.
