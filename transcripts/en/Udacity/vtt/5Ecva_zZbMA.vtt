00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.625
The least common multiple of A and 4a squared is 4a squared. To make the

00:00:04.625 --> 00:00:09.839
denominator in the second fraction equal that, we need to multiply both the top

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:14.920
and the bottom fraction by 4a. Remember, this is the same as multiplying by 1,

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.027
so it's totally kosher to do within an equation. Written as a single fraction

00:00:20.027 --> 00:00:23.289
then, this is B squared minus 4ac over 4a squared.
