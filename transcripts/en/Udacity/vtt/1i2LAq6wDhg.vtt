If you got 12 pounds, nice work. When approaching this problem, we can think

00:00:04.256 --> 00:00:08.550
about combining the like terms or the like weights on one side. I can combine

00:00:08.562 --> 00:00:12.870
the m's as like terms, so I'll have 3 m on this side and 2 m on this side. I can

00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:17.052
also combine the 200 and the 50. These are both like terms since they're just

00:00:17.064 --> 00:00:22.281
numbers. 200 and 38 are also like terms. I can add those weights together. So, I

00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:28.257
have 238 plus 3 m is equal to 250 plus 2 m. I have 238 plus 3 m is equal to 250

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:34.693
plus 2 m. We know we can remove weights from both sides so we can take off a 2

00:00:34.693 --> 00:00:40.917
m, from here and here. I remove 2 m from the weights and 2 m from the weights

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:46.069
over here. So, I'm just left with 238 plus m equals 250. I want to think of

00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:51.383
about getting m alone. I want to isolate this variable. I want to figure out how

00:00:51.395 --> 00:00:56.463
much this weighs. So, I should remove 238 pounds from both sides. We could

00:00:56.475 --> 00:01:01.933
easily think about removing 200 and 200, and then removing 38, and removing 38

00:01:02.132 --> 00:01:05.920
from 50. So, we know one way m is equal to 12 pounds. When looking back at our

00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:09.730
work, we should always remember that we're trying to isolate m. You want to

00:01:09.742 --> 00:01:13.385
remove the variable from both sides and remove constants from both sides.

00:01:13.477 --> 00:01:17.275
Eventually, we want the variable on one side and constants on the other. We

00:01:17.287 --> 00:01:20.865
could have done this in a reverse order and maybe you did it a little bit

00:01:20.877 --> 00:01:25.500
differently. That's okay. We just want to make sure we are performing the same

00:01:25.512 --> 00:01:29.335
steps and reasoning through our results. When solving the equation, we always

00:01:29.347 --> 00:01:33.083
want to start off by combining like terms. This helps us know what to remove

00:01:33.095 --> 00:01:36.860
from both sides of the equation. We could have removed the numbers from both

00:01:36.872 --> 00:01:40.529
sides of the equation first. That's okay. We just need to be consistent and

00:01:40.541 --> 00:01:44.227
always remove or perform the same operation on both sides of the equation at

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:44.709
each step.
