00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.680
Now that we understand how
hardware-supported protection levels can

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.160
be used, we can start explaining how
virtualization techniques can be

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.800
developed that achieved our goal to
efficiently at near native speeds

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.710
allow execution of virtual machines

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.220
on top of these basically
identical virtual platforms.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.220
First, guest instructions are executed
directly by the hardware.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.070
That's important thing to know.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.170
The virtual machine
monitor does not interfere

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.990
with every single instruction that is
issued by the guest operating system, or

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.910
its applications for that matter.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.770
What this means is that just like the OS
doesn't interfere on every single

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.305
instruction and memory access, here the
hypervisor does not interpose itself on

00:00:45.305 --> 00:00:50.860
every single operation and every single
memory access performed by the guest.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.250
As long as the guest
operating system and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.840
its applications operate within
the resources that were allocated

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.850
to them by the hypervisor,
then everything is safe.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.270
The instructions in those cases
will operate at hardware speeds and

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.680
this will lead to efficiency of
the virtualization solution.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.600
Whenever a privileged instruction gets
accessed, then the processor causes

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.370
a trap, and control is automatically
switched to the most privileged level,

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.000
so to the hypervisor.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.130
At this point the hypervisor can
determine whether the operation is to

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.690
be an allowed or not.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.450
If the operation is an illegal
operation and it shouldn't be allowed,

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.910
then the hypervisor can perform some
action like to terminate the VM.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.110
If the operation is, should be allowed,
however, it's a legal operation,

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.990
in that case, the hypervisor should
perform the necessary emulation so

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.020
that the guest operating system is
under the impression that it actually

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.240
does have control over the hardware.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.640
So from the guest perspective, it should
seem as if the hardware did exactly what

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.220
it was expected to do
given the instruction.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.400
In reality, however,

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.140
it was the hypervisor that intervened,
that potentially executed

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.730
slightly different set of operations
in order to achieve that emulation.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.130
This trap-and-emulate mechanism is
a key method in which virtualization

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.870
solutions rely in order to achieve
efficient CPU virtualization.
