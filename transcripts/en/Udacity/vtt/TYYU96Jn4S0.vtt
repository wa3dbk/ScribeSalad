00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.610
To prevent unauthorized use of a device,
a user can use passcode or touch ID.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.510
Touch ID is the fingerprint
sensing system

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.710
that makes secure access to
the device faster and easier.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.540
That is,
it provides a degree of convenience.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.900
By setting up a device passcode,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.340
the user automatically
enables data protection.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.710
iOS supports four digit and
arbitrary length alphanumeric passcodes.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.260
To further discourage brute
force passcode attacks,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.420
the iOS interface enforces
escalating time delays

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.970
after the entry of an invalid
passcode at the last screen.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.720
Users can choose to have
the device automatically waived if

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.950
the passcode is entered incorrectly
after ten consecutive attempts.
