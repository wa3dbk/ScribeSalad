00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.170
David, what did you come up with?

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.480
&gt;&gt; From the beginning,
we start with A or something.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.170
So as long as A is true,
then we know the result is true.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.430
We don't even care about the rest of it.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.785
When A is false,
then we need to look at B and the not C.

00:00:13.785 --> 00:00:18.278
Because this is an and, we need
both B and not C to both be true.

00:00:18.278 --> 00:00:21.295
So, when B is false, we can go ahead and
say this is false over here.

00:00:21.295 --> 00:00:25.745
And when not C is false, we can go
ahead and say this is false over here.

00:00:25.745 --> 00:00:28.925
Not C is false, if C is true,
so this is also false.

00:00:28.925 --> 00:00:32.055
So, our only other answer that's
true is that row right there.

00:00:33.205 --> 00:00:36.790
&gt;&gt; So, as you can see, this can
become very complicated very quickly.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.540
But David did get the answer to the
truth value of this particular sentence,

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.340
based on the truth
values of the predicates

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.680
that are inside the sentences.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.840
So in principle now, we can see how we
can compute the truth value of very,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.960
very complicated sentences
returning logic.
