00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.060
I'm back here with Pete Koomen again.

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.540
And Pete, I let you talk a little bit
about the user experience and what is

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.230
was so important for Optimizely to get
right about your user's experience

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.590
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.750
So when we started Optimizely,

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.130
we set out to make an A/B testing
platform that anybody could use.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.660
And, in fact, our slogan was A/B
testing you'll actually use.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.792
And we weren't the first people
to build an A/B testing platform.

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:29.483
People have been A/B testing, frankly,

00:00:29.483 --> 00:00:34.950
since the days of mail catalogs,
back in the early 1900s.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.200
The approach that we took to it was that
products are out there that let you do

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.964
this, but they were really hard to use.

00:00:39.964 --> 00:00:44.828
And for that reason most people just
weren't doing this kind of optimization,

00:00:44.828 --> 00:00:46.290
and this insight came.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.500
My co-founder spent nine months or

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.898
ten months working on
the Obama campaign in 2008.

00:00:51.898 --> 00:00:54.168
And he was the Director
of Analytics there, and

00:00:54.168 --> 00:00:57.000
he ran a bunch of A/B tests for
the campaign.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.920
And those tests resulted in
a lot of additional money and

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.950
a lot of additional volunteers
being captured by the campaign.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.650
And the insight coming out of it was,
hey,

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.700
this is really valuable, but boy that
was tough, that was a pain in the ass.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.140
And so that was kind of
the insight that we started with.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.840
And we just thought, there's
probably an easier way to do this.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.751
And so our approach from the outset 
was this is a problem that's,

00:01:19.751 --> 00:01:21.800
oh sorry, this is something
that's already out there.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.920
It's our job to make it much,
much easier, and so

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.780
we had to focus on the user.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.048
And we built a way to create and
run an A/B test in a very visual way.

00:01:32.048 --> 00:01:34.714
We tried to design it in
such a way that a marketer,

00:01:34.714 --> 00:01:37.772
who didn't have an engineering
background, could do.

00:01:37.772 --> 00:01:39.449
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So you would definitely say it was

00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:42.762
more of like a painkiller idea to
solve someone's pain point around

00:01:42.762 --> 00:01:45.275
using A/B testing platforms
than anything else.

00:01:45.275 --> 00:01:46.191
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:50.691
So, and in fact what we discovered was
that the pain that was there was so

00:01:50.691 --> 00:01:54.817
significant that most people
just weren't using this product.

00:01:54.817 --> 00:01:57.761
And so at the outset, our biggest
competitor was not some other company

00:01:57.761 --> 00:02:00.865
trying to sell a product, our biggest
competitor was non-consumption.

00:02:00.865 --> 00:02:01.635
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And

00:02:01.635 --> 00:02:05.465
these companies just they'd heard about
A/B testing and some of them had tried

00:02:05.465 --> 00:02:07.355
it, they just never were able
to get it to work for them.

00:02:07.355 --> 00:02:09.195
And that's what we tried to solve.
