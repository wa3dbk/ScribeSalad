00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.110
A common answer we've heard from our
students when we asked them about

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.790
the word delegate is that it
made him think of a relationship

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.720
between a manager and an employee,
or parent and a child.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.600
Perhaps you've also experienced a
situation where work has been passed on

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.270
or delegated to you.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.010
In iOS delegation works
much the same way.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.089
But it can be between
any types of objects.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.580
It really just means getting one
object do the work for the other.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.120
In the case of AV audio recorder it
does not know anything about our view

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.810
controllers or even your app.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.520
It does know that once it finishes
recording it can inform the other class,

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.782
our record view controller
that it's finished.

00:00:40.782 --> 00:00:42.570
The delegate,
the record view controller,

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.890
could then do the work of whatever needs
to be done with the recorded audio.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.840
In this way you can use AV
audio recorder as a tool

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.040
to just record the audio and
it calls out to its delegates.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.260
The record view controller
to do something with it.
