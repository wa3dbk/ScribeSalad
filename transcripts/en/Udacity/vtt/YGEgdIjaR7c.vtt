00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520
So the expected running time is O(4/3)^n&lt;i&gt;n raised to the power of some constant&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.930
divided by a polynomial of n, and actually, we can combine these two terms here

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.150
because this is a polynomial of n and this is a polynomial of n,

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.460
which we can simply write as n to the power of some constant.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.220
Now, finally, let's see if you remember the use of O notation correctly.

00:00:22.220 --> 99:59:59.000
What does that equal.
