00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.566
What formula describes what you did. To find the number of standard deviations

00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:12.939
each values from the mean. Let's go over a values X. So in the case of me, X was

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:19.028
63. In the case of Andy X was 54. Was it Mu minus X. Or did we do X minus Mu. X

00:00:19.028 --> 00:00:25.492
minus Mu times sigma. X minus Mu divided sigma. Mu minus X times sigma. Or did

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:31.069
we do mu minus x divided by sigma? Now remember that in the last two quizzes you

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:36.712
got a positive number. So we're just looking for the formula that describes the

00:00:36.712 --> 00:00:39.980
positive distance that we were from the mean.
