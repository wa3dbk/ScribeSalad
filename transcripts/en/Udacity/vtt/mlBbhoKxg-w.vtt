00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.809
We can rewrite this trinomial as a perfect square, x plus 1 squared. And we can

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:12.903
rewrite this trinomial as y plus 2 squared. And finally, we add the constant

00:00:12.903 --> 00:00:17.782
terms on the right hand side of our equation to get positive 9. This is our

00:00:17.782 --> 00:00:19.919
equation for our circle.
