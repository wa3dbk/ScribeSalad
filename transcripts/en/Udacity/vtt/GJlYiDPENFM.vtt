00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.900
As a quick reminder, UML classes are depicted as having up to

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.210
three compartments, separated by horizontal lines.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.150
The top compartment, typically, has the name of the class in it.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.980
The middle compartment has the attributes of that class; the instance variables.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.510
And the bottom compartment has the methods or operations that class provides.
