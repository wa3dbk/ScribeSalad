00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.951
So, are we happy with our Fried Python? Writing the code that we did, answering

00:00:03.951 --> 00:00:07.761
the last question. And if you're becoming a tasteful programmer, which I hope

00:00:07.761 --> 00:00:11.301
all of you are, you should be recoiling in horror with what we just did and

00:00:11.301 --> 00:00:15.340
smoke should be coming out of your ears. Anytime you see a lot of cutting and

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.226
pasting or copying code like this. That should raise alarm bells, if not, make

00:00:19.226 --> 00:00:22.902
smoke come out of your ears, literally. And it should tell you that there's

00:00:22.902 --> 00:00:27.060
something really bad about the abstractions you have. Previously, we've seen

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.820
this with procedures. If we had a lot of copies of code that were doing the same

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.788
thing or very close to the same thing, what we should do is take all those, turn

00:00:34.788 --> 00:00:38.756
them into a procedure and maybe have a parameter that generates the slightly

00:00:38.756 --> 00:00:43.070
different behaviors that we needed. This was procedural abstraction, a way to

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.510
reuse code by using procedures and to use parameters to specialize the behavior.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.755
That's not quite what we need here, what we need is a similar kind of

00:00:50.755 --> 00:00:52.469
abstraction that works on types.
