00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And the answer is adults.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
To see this, let's look at how the data is spread out along this scatter plot.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We can see that from the mean somewhere right around here

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
the spread between the high and the low points is something like this,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
whereas for children's heights the spread looks more like--

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Looking at ranges doesn't really tell you what the standard deviation is,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
but they are both measures of spread,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and when there aren't really outliers such as in this case, they tend to tell you the same thing.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And then just looking at the data,

00:00:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
it looks pretty clear that it's spread out more in this direction than in this direction.
