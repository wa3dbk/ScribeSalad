00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.405
So we simply take the difference between

00:00:02.405 --> 00:00:06.738
the vertex's entry in the R array and its neighbors entry in the R array,

00:00:06.738 --> 00:00:09.579
and that's going to show how many neighbors this particular entry has.

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:12.483
So it's just R of V plus 1 minus R of V.

00:00:12.483 --> 00:00:17.112
Earlier, we said the R array was 1 longer than we needed, and this is the reason why.

00:00:17.112 --> 00:00:20.915
So what's the starting point of the next vertex? Subtract my starting point.

00:00:20.915 --> 00:00:24.168
So in our example, node 1 has 3 neighbors, 5 minus 2,

00:00:24.168 --> 00:00:27.002
and node 3 has 1 neighbor, 6 minus 5.

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:32.064
So the new frontier then has a maximum number of 3 plus 1 nodes in it.
