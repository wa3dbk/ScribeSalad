00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.970
We'll have 5i, 3i root 2, 3i root 3 and 4i root 3. Great effort if you got at

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.823
least one of those correct. For the first one we simply take the square root of

00:00:10.823 --> 00:00:15.722
25 which is 5 and the square root of negative 1 which equals i. For our second

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:20.910
one we'll split up negative 18 into 9 times 2. times the square root of

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.496
negative 1. We know the square root of 9 equals 3, and the square root of 2

00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:29.400
needs to stay as the square root of 2, since 2 can't be simplified. We've

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.684
replaced the square root of negative 1, with i, leaving us with 3 times i root

00:00:33.684 --> 00:00:39.387
2. We use similar thinking to get to this third one, we'll have 3i root 3. And

00:00:39.387 --> 00:00:43.163
finally, for this last radical, we'll break up the square root of negative 48

00:00:43.163 --> 00:00:48.343
into 16 times 3 times the square root of negative 1. We know the square root of

00:00:48.343 --> 00:00:51.629
16 equals 4, and the square root of 3 stays as the square root of 3, since this

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.955
can't be simplified. We replace the square root of negative 1 with i and then

00:00:56.955 --> 00:01:02.667
multiply 4 and i to get 4i root 3. Our final answer. There are of course other

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:06.703
ways to simplify this last expression this would be the quickest.
