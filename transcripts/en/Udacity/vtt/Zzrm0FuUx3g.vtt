00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.900
So now let's try our hand
at the moesi protocol.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.140
Suppose we have three cores
maintain moesi coherence.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.630
And the variable x starts
out by only being in memory.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.380
So it's not in any of the caches.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.120
So we have our three cores C0,
C1 and C2.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.190
And the first access that
happens is read x on core zero.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.510
What is the new state of this block in
the cache that belongs to this core?

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:36.920
Next C1 does read X, what is the new
state of the block on this core and

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.720
what is the state of this block on
C0 after C1 is done with this read?

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.980
Now C2 does read x.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.080
What is it's new state for this block?

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.100
And what is the new state of
this block in C1's cache?

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.070
Or does it just stay the same?

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.535
And finally C1 there's a write to x.

00:00:57.535 --> 00:01:00.873
What is the new state of
the block in C1's cache?

00:01:00.873 --> 00:01:03.565
In C2's cache?

00:01:03.565 --> 00:01:05.254
And in the cache of core C0.
