00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.200
Let's continue our exploration of rational expressions. This time I'm going to

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.000
show you 4 rational expressions and I want you to find the one expression that

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.815
is not equal to the other 3. In other words you want to try and either to

00:00:12.815 --> 00:00:16.473
simplify these to be positive 1 or negative 1 or you want to rearrange them to

00:00:16.473 --> 00:00:21.060
make them look like each other. Be sure to chose the odd one out. The one that

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.253
looks different.
