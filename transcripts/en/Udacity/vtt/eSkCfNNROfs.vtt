When answering the last quiz, i called these points very different letter names.

00:00:04.535 --> 00:00:08.693
But when we look at this formula for slope, it's not really clear how d and b,

00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:13.098
or c and a are related to one another. I think that one thing that might help us

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.347
is if we renamed the coordinates of these points, so that they indicated what

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.377
each coordinate actually is . Instead of A,B I'm going to call this coordinate

00:00:24.389 --> 00:00:30.085
x1, y1, and this point is going to become x2,y2. Using this new notation, we can

00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:34.375
change our formula for slope. I like this form much better. To me it's way more

00:00:34.387 --> 00:00:38.685
clear now that this quantity on top is the difference between two y coordinates,

00:00:38.782 --> 00:00:43.080
and this one in the denominator is the difference between our two x coordinates.

00:00:43.177 --> 00:00:47.295
Now note that the y coordinate of the second point comes first in the numerator,

00:00:47.392 --> 00:00:51.746
and the x coordinate, the second point, comes first in the denominator. The

00:00:51.758 --> 00:00:57.097
question I have for you now, is, does it matter which point, when I find in the

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:02.267
slope between points I call x1, y1, and which one, I call x2, y2. In other

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:07.620
words, if I switch the position of the ones and twos in this equation for slope,

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:10.334
would I get the same slope as my answer?
