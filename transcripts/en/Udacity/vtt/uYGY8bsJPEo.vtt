00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.300
We call that defense in depth principle.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.610
We need multiple layers
of defense mechanisms.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.940
That is, we need detection mechanisms
even after we have deployed

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.520
prevention mechanisms to detect
attacks that can be easily prevented.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.010
That is, there are always
some attacks that we can not

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.060
simply keep out of our networks and
systems.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.070
We have discussed firewalls,
which are prevention mechanisms.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.470
Today we will discuss
detection mechanisms.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.980
Typically, these mechanisms
are the intrusion detection systems.
