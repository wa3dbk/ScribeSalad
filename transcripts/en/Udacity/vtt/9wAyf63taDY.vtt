So let's quickly look at the crondon xml configuration

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.380
file, where we set up the cron job, to

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.575
run the set announcement function. So the URL, it's

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:13.000
/crons/set_announcement, basically just the task to the servlet that

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.130
runs the task. And a description, it's kind of optional,

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.210
but very helpful. And the schedule is every one

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.730
hours. It's not every one hour, it must be

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.750
every one hours. And then if you had more cron

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.100
jobs you would just add more cron entries and fill

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.360
them in, etc. And that really is it for cron jobs.
