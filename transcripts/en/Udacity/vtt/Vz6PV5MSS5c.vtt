Let's look at another example of cognitive dissonance and see how to help

00:00:03.834 --> 00:00:09.145
decrease the discomfort caused by cognitive dissonance. Let's say we have a

00:00:09.145 --> 00:00:12.866
person who is cheating on her lover. Can you think of examples that fit into

00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:16.258
each of the three categories that we discussed that might help decrease that

00:00:16.258 --> 00:00:21.852
discomfort caused by the dissonance? First, how might the person change her

00:00:21.852 --> 00:00:27.400
behavior. Well one thing she could do is end the affair. Second, she could try

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.184
to justify her behavior. For example, perhaps she says that she's not hurting

00:00:31.184 --> 00:00:35.440
anybody by having the affair. Third she may try to change her ideas or her

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.298
thoughts in order to justify her behavior. For example, maybe she says, I'm

00:00:41.298 --> 00:00:46.369
pretty sure he cheated on me, or if he can cheat, I can cheat. Now, before I

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:50.027
move on to the next area of social relations, I'd like you to think about any

00:00:50.027 --> 00:00:53.567
personal experiences that you have had that have resulted in cognitive

00:00:53.567 --> 00:00:58.965
dissonance. What did you do to try to decrease the uncomfortable feelings that

00:00:58.965 --> 00:01:00.460
you experienced?
