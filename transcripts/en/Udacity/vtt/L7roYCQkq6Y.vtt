00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.049
Let us do another exercise. This is actually an exercise we've come

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:08.770
across earlier, however this exercise has an interesting property.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:14.600
Often the world presents input to us, for which there is no one single right

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.960
answer. Instead, there are multiple answers that could be right.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.591
The world is ambiguous. So, here we again have A is to B, C is to D, and

00:00:23.591 --> 00:00:27.670
we have six choices. So, what choice do you think is the right choice here?
