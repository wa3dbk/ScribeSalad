00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.034
Now since i is just another number, like all other numbers i to the 0 power is

00:00:05.034 --> 00:00:10.033
just equal to 1. This may seem a little bit funny, because 1 is a real number.

00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:14.827
But I think this is more a testament to the fact that i and all other imaginary

00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:19.311
numbers are in fact numbers, i to the first power is just i, i squared is i

00:00:19.311 --> 00:00:24.301
times itself. Which means we're multiplying the square root of negative 1 times

00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:28.992
the square root of negative 1, that should just give us negative 1. Now i cubed

00:00:28.992 --> 00:00:32.902
is going to be i squared times i. So we have negative 1 times i which is

00:00:32.902 --> 00:00:37.421
negative i. Interesting. So we only have ones and i's, the positive and negative

00:00:37.421 --> 00:00:41.749
versions over here. Let's see what happens in this column, i to the fourth

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:46.448
should be i to the third times i again. That means we're multiplying the square

00:00:46.448 --> 00:00:50.909
root of negative 1 by itself and then taking the negative of that number. So

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:55.815
this is negative, negative 1, which is just equal to 1. But that's funny, that's

00:00:55.815 --> 00:01:00.205
the same as i to the 0, i to the 5th is i to the 4th times i. So 1 times i which

00:01:00.205 --> 00:01:04.313
is i again. That's the same as i to the first. And we can see the pattern

00:01:04.313 --> 00:01:08.786
continues for i to the sixth and i to the seventh, so it seems like when we take

00:01:08.786 --> 00:01:13.279
powers of i, the numbers that they're equal to alternate in a cyclic way. We go

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:16.418
from 1 to i to negative 1 to negative i back to 1 and so on. I think this

00:01:16.418 --> 00:01:20.696
pattern is really interesting, and keeping this in mind is going to help us

00:01:20.696 --> 00:01:24.928
remember the relationship between real numbers and imaginary numbers.
