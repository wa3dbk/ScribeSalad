00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
Now the hardest part is done.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.870
We have a problem we know to be NP complete,

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.600
and that problem SAT.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.930
So from now on, showing that other problems are NP complete

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.670
will get a lot easier,

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.540
because we don't have to go through this

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.560
laborous process n coding machines anymore

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.590
It will just suffice to show that SAT

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.130
can be reduced the the problem we're looking at.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.430
So we can use SAT to show other problems

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.370
to be NP complete now,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.460
and once we have shown these problems to be NP complete,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.590
we can use them as well to show

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.610
again, other problems to be NP complete,

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.300
so we are basically building this whole tree of NP complete problems

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.270
using SAT as a c problem

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.490
and it will just suffice to show these

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.370
reductions here; we do not have to

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.080
do the same tedious steps of Boolean formula n coding anymore,

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.240
because we already know SAT to be NP complete now.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.960
So let's take 1 step back now

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.490
with our next quiz.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.910
What happens if you show one NP complete problem

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.790
to be solvable in polynomial time?

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.630
And by solvable in polynomial time, of course,

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.870
I mean on a deterministic RAM.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.770
Would that mean that some problems in an NP

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.330
can be solved in polynomial time?

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.620
Again, we're talking about a deterministic RAM here.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.880
Would it mean that all NP complete problems

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.150
are solvable in polynomial time?

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.460
Or would it mean that all problems in NP

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.630
are solvable in polynomial time?

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.090
And again, more than 1 of these answers here can be correct,

00:01:23.090 --> 99:59:59.000
so please check every statement that is correct.
