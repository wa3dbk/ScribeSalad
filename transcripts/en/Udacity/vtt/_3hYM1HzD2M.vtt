00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let me summarize some observations that we made in this unit about the complexity of models.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
For instance, in the SIR and SEIR models, we worked with fractional population numbers.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We didn't care whether or not the numbers of persons are integers.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
In the SEIR model, we used an average amount of latency.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We did not build in a fix delay and we assumed perfect mixing.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
There is no geographical distribution, there is no age distribution, there are no isolated towns.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
One of the advantages of the simple models we looked at in this unit is that we were able to derive

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
general statements such as the existence of Herd Immunity.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Of course, we have to be careful.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
A general statement about a cartoonish model may not be that helpful, and the simple equations

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
that we've got from these models are helpful in may ways.

00:00:48.000 --> 99:59:59.000
For instance, when it comes to working with implicit methods such as the big foot Euler method.
