00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.790
And as you can see here,

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.280
as the animation draws to an end, the buttons show up on the left side.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.570
So the first part of adding interactivity has been completed.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.500
Now we need to actually allow the user to click our buttons.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.390
Here, we are still in the conditional that clears our interval.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.090
And once we've created our buttons, we want to attach some event.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.850
If you're not familiar with JavaScript events,

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.410
there's many ways to do them with native JavaScript.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.620
But most libraries out there allow you to interact in some way with user events.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.750
The most common library, and what might have driven its rise to fame, is jQuery.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.510
Where it made it effortless to attach events and

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.500
functions to elements on the page.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.030
But there's many other libraries.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.310
In our case, the most notable D3 which implements a similar style of

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.020
adding events to given HTML elements.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.860
In this case, we've created our buttons.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.500
And with those, we want to enable some interaction on a click event.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.850
The syntax for this is to call the on-function.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.840
With some D3 selection, in this case, our buttons, in the first

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.810
argument is the event that you want to trigger your callback function.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.980
In this case, we want to attach the click event to our buttons, but

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.750
there's many others, some of which I've included in the instruction notes for

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.550
this video, such as mouse over.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.570
Mouse out.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.520
And even custom events, and any other event that JavaScript itself supports.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.070
The second argument, to on is the function you want to run.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.930
When the given event happens on your element.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.640
Sometimes you might see it refer to as the event handler.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.070
The argument D passed to the event handler function is the same D

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.249
that gets passed to most assessor functions in D3.

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:54.190
That being the data.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.180
So in this case d, when a button is clicked,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.280
corresponds to the year that was clicked.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.860
In our case, when a user clicks on a button of the given year,

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.080
we want to call our update function with d, or rather.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.030
The year of the button that was clicked such that the map updates.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.770
The line above that I've written is D3's way

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.070
of accessing the element that was clicked on.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.810
In this case we use a D3 select but we pass it the special JavaScript variable.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.660
This.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.700
There's a lot of confusion around when and what this actually represents, and

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.090
again I've linked to some many good resources in the instructor notes, but for

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.910
the case of what we would encounter in this course,

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.640
this most always represents the element itself that was clicked.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.480
In this case, the HTML button, and the reason I'm accessing this, or

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.065
rather, the button clicked, is because I

00:02:50.065 --> 00:02:55.210
want to indicate to the user in some way what button actually was clicked?

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.030
In our case we want to indicate visually to the user and

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.250
provide some immediate feedback about what button they clicked and whether or

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.880
not that click actually happened.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.240
And in this case we're going to update the styles and

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.690
change the background to be blue.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.510
And the color of the text to be white, also to make it smoother and more

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.760
aesthetically pleasing, we can add some animation and transition to this effect.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.300
Going back to our browser, we can refresh the page.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.940
And we see our buttons as they were before, now let's try clicking on one.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.320
If you noticed, I clicked on the year 1958, the map has updated,

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.490
the circles moved, and also the year and the titles changed.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.260
But also the stylings on the buttons have changed.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.760
Let's compare the year 1958 to the year 1994.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.000
Again we can see the update happening.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.580
But one quirk is that now both buttons are blue.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.520
And every successive button we click stays blue.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.540
Do you know what might be happening here?
