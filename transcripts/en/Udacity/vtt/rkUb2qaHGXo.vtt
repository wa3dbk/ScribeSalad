00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.690
Before we turn to finding
a faster algorithm for

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.540
finding a maximum matching,

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.010
there's a classic theorem related to
matchings that we should talk about.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.260
This is the Frobenius-Hall theorem.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.540
For a subset of vertices,
say x, we'll use n of x to

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.930
indicate the union of the neighbors
of the individual vertices in x.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.950
If we consider this graph here then the
neighbors of the orange vertices will be

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.400
the green ones.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.250
Note that the fact
that if we call this x,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.320
then the size of the neighborhood
of x is larger than x.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.260
That this bodes well for the possibility
of finding a matching for

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.460
all the vertices on
the left hand side here.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.320
At least, there's a chance that we
will be able to find a match for

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.899
all these vertices.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.600
When this is not the case however,
as seen for

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.050
these three vertices here,
then it is hopeless.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.030
Regardless of how we
matched the first two,

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.130
there will be no remaining
candidates for the third vertex.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.250
We can make this intuition precise
with the Frobenius-Hall theorem,

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.940
which follows from the max matching
min vertex cover argument.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.970
Given a bipartite graph G partitioned
into L and R, there exists

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.990
a matching of size L if and only if for
every X with is a subset of L,

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.840
the size of the neighborhood of
X is at least the size of X.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.160
The forward direction
is the simpler one.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:29.370
Let M be a matching of size L, and we'll
let x be a subset of the left hand side.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:36.230
We let y be the vertices on the right
hand side that x got matched to.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.870
Clearly, y is the same size as x, but

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.930
then y is also a subset of
the neighborhood of x, and hence,

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.740
the size of the neighborhood of
x Is at least the size of X.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.130
The other direction is
a little more challenging.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.370
Suppose not.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.820
We'll let M be a max matching,

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.140
with cardinality strictly less than
the cardinality of the left-hand side.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.310
We let H be the set of vertices
reachable from an alternating path

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.100
from the unmatched vertices in L.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.860
This is the same picture
used in the max, matching,

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.640
min vertex cover argument.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.070
There's at least one unmatched
vertex here by our assumption.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.180
Well then the neighborhood
of the left hand side of H

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.990
is equal to the right hand side of H.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.870
But this left hand side must be strictly
greater because there's at least

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.950
one unmatched vertex.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:29.450
If you like,

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.680
you can think about the matched vertices
on either side canceling each other out.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.730
And we're left with some non-0 number

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.060
of unmatched vertices
on the left hand side.
