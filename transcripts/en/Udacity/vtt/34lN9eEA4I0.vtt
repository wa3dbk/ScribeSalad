00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So the first thing to observe is that no non-tree edge can be a bridge.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
They have to be the green edges not the red edges, and why is that?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Well, the red edges are the ones that get added for a node

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that had already been reached by some other path.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So the red edges can't be bridge edges it's because deleting the red edge--the node

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
from both sides of these were reachable from the beginning some other way.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Next, we can test whether or not a given node is in the subtree rooted at--at some node W,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
pretty simply using the numbers that we've already calculated.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Post order of W, the number of descendants of W, and the high and low values and why is that.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So when we go to do the post ordering at W, we go it down here,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
we number somebody, then we number everybody, then we number W itself.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The post order number of everyone in here has to be less than the post order of the value of W

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
but the total number of numbers in these set they're all--they're all continuous, they're all in order

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and the total of numbers--numbers in this set is blue is the number of descendants.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So black minus blue is one smaller than the smallest number in this collection.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
That property is kind of obvious, perhaps, but we were almost there.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The only way that this edge is not a bridge is if there's some non tree edge

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
that takes us out somehow and connects to something else in the tree.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Now what would happen to the H value or the L value if we had one of these edges.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Remember the H value and the L value were defined specifically to be

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
well, you follow a bunch of green edges and then you follow one red edge.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Well, if a red edge takes us to in a sort of in the left of this tree, then the in order value is going to be

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
outside of this range and it pretty good will be too small and that we'll tell us

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
that we've link to something outside to the left.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
If we link to something outside to the right then the H number is going to be bigger than

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
the in order value of W and similarly if we hop up to high that same thing happens it's because

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that the blobs in here, the nodes in this blob all have exactly the values in here.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Anything that connects outside of their is going to

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
cause either the H value or the L value to pop outside of this range.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So with those values in hand, we have a very easy test to see whether or not

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
there's some red edge that will actually connect up the graph in a way

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
that this is no longer a bridge and that's all we need to do.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Now in the homework, I'm going to ask you to actually carry out this test on a real graph.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Actually code it up and it's not terrible but it is a little bit tricky.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
You have to be very careful to figure out how to compute the post order values

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
the number of descendants H and L without taking a lot of running time in the graph.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Really needs to be able to do it essentially with

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
one or two sweeps through the set of all the nodes and edges in the graphs.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
But you can do it--I have confidence.
