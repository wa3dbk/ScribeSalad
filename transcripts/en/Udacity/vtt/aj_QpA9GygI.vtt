00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.210
For this solution, I'm showing you the GG plot code to

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.420
create the scatter plot of price versus time. Now, I've added

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.670
geom jitter here. So, that way, my points will show up

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.520
a little bit transparent. And I'll color them with an orange

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.390
hue. Looking at the plot, we can that the modal or

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.400
the most common prices, seem to be increasing over time. We

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.470
also see some lower price points scattered about the graph. These

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.550
may be due to sales or, perhaps, buyers using coupons that

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.960
bring down the price of yogurt.
