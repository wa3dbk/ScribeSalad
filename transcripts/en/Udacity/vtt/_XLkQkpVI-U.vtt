00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.719
You've only just begun playing with
object oriented programming in Ruby.

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.689
Already, you've seen how this can
be a powerful programming technique

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.030
to help your applications scale without
letting your code become unreadable.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.760
In future lessons,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.130
you'll explore ways to explore
classes that are even more powerful.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.021
Let's move on.

00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:17.589
Unless you object.

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:21.110
Object, get it?
