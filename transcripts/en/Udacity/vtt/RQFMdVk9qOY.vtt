00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.053
Well as we'll see, the correct answer is actually 21 trillion, which is 16 factorial.

00:00:05.053 --> 00:00:07.032
Let's see how that works.

00:00:07.047 --> 00:00:09.679
So here I'm just going to run this program in my terminal,

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:13.889
and as you can see, the blocks complete in some basically random order:

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.087
block 7 completes, then block 6, then 1, then 0, and so forth.

00:00:18.087 --> 00:00:20.833
If I run it again, I get a different order

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:23.460
and a different order and so forth.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.596
You'll find that the blocks executed in a different order every time,

00:00:26.596 --> 00:00:31.108
which is where that number 16 factorial comes from.
