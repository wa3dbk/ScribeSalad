00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.969
Okay, in this lesson we will talk about spam

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.650
or unwanted commercial email. Now, you might not think

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.400
that you receive a lot of spam but the

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.560
fact of the matter is that most of it goes

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.720
to your spam folder. So one might think what's

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.720
the problem? Well, in fact, spam remains a scourge for

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.180
network operators. In particular, someone has to design the

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.690
filters that separate the good traffic from the bad traffic.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.280
Additionally, even if email is classified as spam,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.400
if it's accepted for delivery, the internet's mail

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.190
protocols dictate that the server has to keep

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.690
the mail. Because it's told the receiver that it

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.350
has accepted the mail. This creates the potential

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.740
for spam to consume a significant amount of

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.330
storage space on email servers. Finally, spam can

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.700
create security problems for users who receive spam emails.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.360
If the spam messages contain a payload that could

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.850
be harmful such as malware or a phishing attack,

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.270
or an attempt to steal a user's private or

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.170
sensitive information, such as a password. Now even though

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.830
you don't see the mail because of these filters,

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.760
something like 95% of all email traffic is spam.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.510
Some reports from the Anti-phishing Working Group suggest that

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.160
something like one in 87 emails was a phishing

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.260
attack and there's something like 50,000 unique

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.460
phishing attacks in a month. A common approach

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.180
for getting rid of spam messages is to

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.720
filter. In other words, prevent the message from

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.520
reaching the user's inbox in the first place. Now this begs the question of how

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.870
to differentiate spam, or the bad messages, from

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.370
ham, or the legitimate messages. There are three

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.760
different ways to construct filters. One is content-based. In

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.820
other words, you can look at what's being said in

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.440
the mail. For example, if the mail contains particular words,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.820
such as Viagra or Rolex, a content-based filter might pick

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.630
up on those terms and decide to filter the mail.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.740
Second, a filter might make a decision about whether an

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.920
email message is spam or ham based on the IP

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.229
address of the sender. This method is often called blacklisting.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.360
Third, we can construct filter based on behavioral features,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.970
or how the mail is sent. So for example,

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.410
if the mail is sent at a particular time of day, or if it's sent in a batch of

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.420
emails that are all roughly the same size, then

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.150
we may be able to figure out that a message

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.840
is likely spam simply based on the sender's sending

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.654
behavior. Now each of these approaches are complementary, but content-based

00:02:33.654 --> 00:02:37.275
filtering and IP-based filtering each have problems.

00:02:37.275 --> 00:02:40.270
Content-based filters are relatively easy for attackers

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.820
to evade. A recent large commercial mail operator recently told me that he saw

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.620
something like 80,000 different spellings of Viagra.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.840
But additionally, messages can be carried not

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.480
only in texts, but in images, Excel

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.760
spreadsheets, or even mp3s or movies. Therefore,

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.870
spammers can easily alter the features of an email's content and adjust those

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.940
features and change them to evade content based filters. On the flip side, those

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.530
maintaining the filters suffer a relatively high

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.860
cost because the filters must be continually

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.890
updated as content changes and the means

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.880
of carrying the content become more sophisticated.
