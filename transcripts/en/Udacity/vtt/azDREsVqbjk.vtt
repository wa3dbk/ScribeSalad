00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.620
After a series of various steps, all of which you're pretty familiar with, we

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.046
end up with a final answer of z equals negative 3. And of course, it's super

00:00:09.046 --> 00:00:13.479
important to check our answer. We just plug negative 3 in to the left side of

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:18.159
the equation and negative 15 over negative 3 is indeed equal to 5, which is what

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:20.892
our right-hand side equals. So we're good.
