00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.549
Phase one is the pre data, or menu data. This is the first set of screens the

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.742
user sees and needed to be loaded immediately. In GRITS, all of our menu assets

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:12.774
are defined and positioned in HTML. So the browser will handle loading of these

00:00:12.774 --> 00:00:17.040
assets as part of parsing and processing the HTML file for presentation. Since

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.064
these assets are defined in a DOM, their loading is handled by the browser's

00:00:20.064 --> 00:00:24.076
page parser and handler. So, we don't have to do anything explicit here. Once

00:00:24.076 --> 00:00:28.288
the user hits Join Game, we enter into a new phase. We must load all the

00:00:28.288 --> 00:00:31.387
scripting data that's used by the game. The data hasn't been defined by the

00:00:31.387 --> 00:00:34.555
DOM. As such, we need to issue commands to our asset loader to fetch that

00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:38.793
information and wait until it's been loaded. It's worth pointing out that the

00:00:38.793 --> 00:00:42.777
game scripting and menu scripting are really two separate code bases. Which is

00:00:42.777 --> 00:00:46.110
why we load the separately, as well. The scripting code will load up the object

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.360
definitions, systems, physics, et cetera, and all of the other things we need

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.000
to run the game. But not needed during menu browsing. So here is a list of

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.648
scripts that we use inside of GRITS. What we'd like you to do is pass the array

00:00:58.648 --> 00:01:02.008
of file names, to the asset manager as a batch operation to load all of the

00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:06.922
data. After the batch is entirely loaded call window.alert to notify the player

00:01:06.922 --> 00:01:08.840
that the files are loaded
