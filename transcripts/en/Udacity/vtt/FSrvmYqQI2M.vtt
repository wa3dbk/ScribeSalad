00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.630
If our Y intercept is A, and our slop is B, then we get that Y hat equals A

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:15.000
plus Bx and Bx plus A. This means that when X is zero, the Y value equals B

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.110
times zero plus A. And since anything times zero is just zero, y hat equals a.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.830
The y intercept is always the y value when x is zero
