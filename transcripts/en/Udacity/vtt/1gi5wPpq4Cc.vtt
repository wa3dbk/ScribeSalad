00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.570
All right. So, person who's adept at manipulating Bayes Nets

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.916
would know that this chain rule idea, this probability of X

00:00:06.916 --> 00:00:09.000
and Y can be written either as a probability of

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.590
X times the probability of Y given X. Or as the

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.640
probability of Y times the probability of X given Y,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.720
actually correspond to two different networks. So which of these two

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.530
networks corresponds to the fact that the probability of x and

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.650
y, the joint probability of X and can be written as

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.600
the probability of Y times the probability of X given Y.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.320
&gt;&gt; Go.
