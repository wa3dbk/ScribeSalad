Okay, did you get that working? If so, good job.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.380
Let's go ahead and test everything. I'll show you my

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.690
solution. Here we are, fizzbuzz.html. All we had to do

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.090
is extend base.html, surround our content with the block content

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.260
and end block, and all is well. And so it's

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.500
basically the same thing that we did here in our

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.060
shopping list html. And our base html doesn't change at

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.150
all, neither do our handlers,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.500
still rendering fizzbuzz.html and shopping_list.html.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.159
And the benefit of this is, if I change my base template to be more exciting

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:37.630
and then I go to the browser. And I reload this page, we get our exclamation

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.345
marks, and if I go, get away from

00:00:39.345 --> 00:00:41.630
fizzbuzz, we also have our exclamation marks there

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.650
as well. So, we changed one file and

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.890
then our entire website changed along with it.
