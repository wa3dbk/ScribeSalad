We know x should be replaced with positive 3. So I replace x with positive 3 and

00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:10.597
this x with positive 3, y is negative 7. So we replace both of these y's with

00:00:10.597 --> 00:00:15.545
negative 7. 2 times 3 is 6, and 3 times negative 7 is negative 21. If I add

00:00:15.545 --> 00:00:22.058
these two together, I get negative 15. And look at that, this side does check. 5

00:00:22.058 --> 00:00:27.272
times 3 is 15. And 2 times negative 7 is negative 14. If we add these together

00:00:27.272 --> 00:00:32.034
we get 1 which is equal to 1. Great. We know we have the right solution.
