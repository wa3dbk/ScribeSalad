00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
If we want more confidence, we could also look at the documentation and the challenges.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If we don't know what we're looking for, well the documentation won't tell us

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We can see that we have union that returns a union of the sets.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
What we don't see yet is update and now, given that we found update and guess what it did,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
we can see this description, not the most clear description

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
to know for sure that it does what we want.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We could do some more searches.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Let's see what we got when we search for Python and update.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Well, we got some discussion here, we're looking at the dictionary update.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Let's make sure we are looking for the set update and we get some more documentation.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This is going back to what we're looking for probably not the most useful thing.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And now searching for update, we see this documentation, the same that we saw.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It is updating the set adding elements from all others.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So, I think it is easier to understand what something does by experimentation

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
than by reading the documentation.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
You should be open to using both approaches and combining them with looking at example code

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and trying things own your own.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So, for the final quiz of this mini unit, your goal is to modify crawl_web

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that was part of the web crawler that we developed in CS101 to use set objects

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
for tocrawl and crawled instead of using list.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
You should make your search engine simpler and remove the need for the separate union function.
