00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.520
So we've talked about problems with content-based filtering.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.300
What about IP blacklists? Well, first, the way an

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.670
IP blacklists works is that when a sender

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.540
sends an email to the receiver the receiver sends

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.420
a query for that IP address to a

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.620
blacklist or a DNS-based blacklist sometimes called a DNSBL

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.400
such as spamhaus. Depending on whether or not that

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.710
IP address appears in the blacklist the receiver can

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.010
then decide to accept the message or, if the

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.430
IP address turns out to be on the blacklist,

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.560
the receiver can decide to terminate the connection and

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.990
not even accept the mail in the first place,

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.470
thereby saving the operator the trouble of even having

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.280
to store the message. The third approach is to

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.460
filter a message on how it is sent. In

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.950
particular, we can look at such features as the geographic

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.680
locations of the sender and receiver, the set

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.320
of target recipients, the sender's upstream ISP or

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.910
our inference as to whether the sender is a member of a botnet or a network of

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.640
comprised hosts that are doing the bidding of

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.360
some command and control server. Now the challenges

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.580
of buildling a filter around this notion is

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.640
first, understanding network level behavior and second, building classifiers

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.480
using network level features to execute the filtering.
