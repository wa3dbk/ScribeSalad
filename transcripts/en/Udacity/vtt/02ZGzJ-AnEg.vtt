00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.513
For a tilted cylinder we were able to look at and think about what axis to

00:00:03.513 --> 00:00:07.061
rotate around. However we usually won't be able to do this. If I gave you two

00:00:07.061 --> 00:00:10.850
arbitrary vectors and said quick what's the axis of rotation? Best of luck to

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.291
you, I sure couldn't do it. Happily there's an easy way to get the axis of

00:00:14.291 --> 00:00:18.056
rotation and it's called the cross product. In three.js you call it like this,

00:00:18.056 --> 00:00:22.088
it takes two vectors as its inputs, and the result is put into the vector three

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:26.285
itself. The third vector is in fact the axis of rotation or at least one of

00:00:26.285 --> 00:00:29.605
them. The direction is determined by the right hand rule. You wrap your hand

00:00:29.605 --> 00:00:33.509
from the first vector, in this case the cylinder to the second vector, in this

00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:37.365
case the y axis. This then points along the axis of rotation. If we computed the

00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:41.141
cross product of these two vectors in the opposite order we would go from the y

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:45.010
axis to the cylinders vector. And we would get the opposite rotation axis.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.650
Recall how the dot product gives us the cosine between two vectors, the length

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.122
of the cross product result is in fact proportional to the sine of the angle

00:00:52.122 --> 00:00:55.656
between the two vectors. There is one special case I'm going to point out and

00:00:55.656 --> 00:00:58.824
its kind of a headache. If the cross product gives back a vector that is of

00:00:58.824 --> 00:01:01.944
length 0 or nearly so then the two vectors are either pointing in the same

00:01:01.944 --> 00:01:05.503
direction or in directly opposite directions. You can use the dot product of the

00:01:05.503 --> 00:01:08.675
two vectors to figure out which, if they point in the same direction, then

00:01:08.675 --> 00:01:12.516
you're done. You don't need to rotate at all. If they point in exactly opposite

00:01:12.516 --> 00:01:16.954
directions, then you need to rotate 180 degrees. However, the rotation axis

00:01:16.954 --> 00:01:21.553
you'll get back from the cross product is actually 0,0,0, which is no axis at

00:01:21.553 --> 00:01:24.870
all. At this point, you basically need to choose some arbitrary axis that is

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.920
perpendicular to your vectors and use that for rotation, or just form the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.047
rotation matrix directly. Here for example I use the x axis since I know y is

00:01:32.047 --> 00:01:35.528
going to be perpendicular to it. See the additional course materials on a good

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:39.282
way to solve this problem in general. The mathematical notation for a cross

00:01:39.282 --> 00:01:43.395
product is this, a big X. The length of the vector produced by the cross product

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:47.171
is equal to the sign of theta, that's the angle between the two vectors, times

00:01:47.171 --> 00:01:51.450
the length of A. Times the length of B. The cross product itself is computed by

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.017
multiplying neighboring elements of the two vectors' coordinates. For the x

00:01:56.017 --> 00:02:01.794
coordinate, we multiply Ay times Bz and then subtract Az times By. For the y

00:02:01.794 --> 00:02:07.536
coordinate we multiply Az times Bz minus Ax times Bz. I like to do this kind of

00:02:07.536 --> 00:02:11.636
x cross thing here as we did before. So I tend to take this and wrap it around

00:02:11.636 --> 00:02:18.116
to this side. So it's Az times Bx, and Ax times Bz. For the last coordinate we

00:02:18.116 --> 00:02:23.104
do the same thing, Ax times By minus Ay times Bx. At the end we have a vector

00:02:23.104 --> 00:02:26.594
that describes the axis of rotation from one vector to the other. And in fact

00:02:26.594 --> 00:02:30.728
this vector will be perpendicular to both of these two. Oh, and one more thing.

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:33.754
If you want to use this vector later you probably going to want to normalize it,

00:02:33.754 --> 00:02:35.509
because its length will be pretty obscure.
