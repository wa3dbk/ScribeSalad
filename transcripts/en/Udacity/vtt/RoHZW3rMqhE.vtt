00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.075
The shocking truth is that the squares marked A and B are actually the same

00:00:04.075 --> 00:00:08.476
shade of gray. If you don't believe it, here's a bit of proof. An image where

00:00:08.476 --> 00:00:12.853
two vertical bands with the same shade of gray are overlaid on the image. So,

00:00:12.853 --> 00:00:18.170
you can see here and here that these gray bars, they're all the same intensity.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.852
And that they're also the same intensity as this A and this B square. So, these

00:00:23.852 --> 00:00:28.576
are all the same gray, believe it or not. If you still don't believe it, you can

00:00:28.576 --> 00:00:32.668
print out the original image and cut out squares A and B and hold them up next

00:00:32.668 --> 00:00:36.117
to each other. See the additional course materials for where to get these

00:00:36.117 --> 00:00:41.284
images. As professor Adelson notes, this illusion proves that the visual system

00:00:41.284 --> 00:00:45.270
is not a very good light meter, but that's not its purpose. Our visual system

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.230
tries to compensate for shadows and other distractions so that we can properly

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.483
perceive the nature of the objects in view.
