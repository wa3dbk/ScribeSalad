00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.950
So let's look at our Tomasulo's Algorithm quiz solution.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.090
Does it issue instructions in program order? Yes it does. Instructions come

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.470
from the instruction buffer in program order, and that's the order in which we

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.110
are going to issue them. You cannot issue instructions out of order.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.020
So this is true. We don't select it because the question is, which is not true.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.108
It dispatches instructions in program order, no it doesn't!

00:00:26.108 --> 00:00:29.060
Instructions can [INAUDIBLE] be dispatched outside of program order,

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.410
that's why this is an out of order processor. So, this is definitely not true.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.760
And then, it writes results in program order. Not necessarily. Again,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.420
results can be written in the order in which they are produced, and it works for

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.240
that. So this is not true. So basically the one that is true is one.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.470
The other two are not true so we selected two and three as not true.
