00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.130
To illustrate explanation-based learning, let us begin with an exercise.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.750
Imagine that you want to transport soup from the kitchen to the dining table.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.680
Unfortunately, all of the usual utensils you use to

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.330
transport soup are unavailable. They're dirty, or just not there.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.960
So you look around, and you see some objects in the vicinity.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.560
Here is your backpack, here is a pitcher, here is a box, here is your car. And

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.910
you wonder which one of these four objects could you use to transport soup from

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.370
the kitchen to the dining table. Well, which one would you use?
