00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.840
The standard deviation is the population standard deviation divided by the

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:12.014
square root of n, where n is the size of each sample that we're taking. So this

00:00:12.014 --> 00:00:24.369
is 16.04 divided by the square root of 35, which is about 2.71. Good job.
