00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.904
In this exercise, the vertices themselves are not the problem. The first

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:07.058
triangle is the one that appears on the screen. You can verify this by

00:00:07.058 --> 00:00:10.260
commenting out this triangle and seeing that nothing then appears. The second

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.150
triangle is then the one that's causing problems. We've been told the triangle

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.690
disappears when culling is turned on, so it's probably the vertex order. By

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.790
swapping any two of these indices. You reverse the order of the triangle. Here

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.740
I've swapped the first two. Doing this solves the problem and gives us the right

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:27.333
answer.
