This is an African pouched rat. They're particularly good at detecting TNT and

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.996
landmines. They're trained using something called tea eggs, which have TNT in

00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:16.491
them. TNT is an explosive found in many land mines. If the African pouched rats

00:00:16.503 --> 00:00:21.702
were able to find the tea eggs. They were given a food reward. But if they

00:00:21.714 --> 00:00:26.386
scratched near tea eggs that did not contain TNT, then they did not receive a

00:00:26.398 --> 00:00:31.335
food reward. Scratching near the tea eggs was considered the indicator response.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.377
The researchers found that the training was very successful in teaching the rats

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:41.265
to detect real landmines in the field. This was measured by the number of meters

00:00:41.277 --> 00:00:47.021
of land cleared by explosives. And by the number of landmines that they found.

00:00:47.145 --> 00:00:50.453
Based on this study, what can we say is true?
