00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.410
So now we've found the balance after one year for Grant's account and the

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.778
balance after two years. What we're going to do now is something that we

00:00:07.778 --> 00:00:12.145
haven't really done in this course yet. I'm going to ask you to make a

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:16.652
hypothesis. This just means that you're going to come up with an idea and we'll

00:00:16.652 --> 00:00:22.073
see if it's right pretty soon. This is something that mathematicians do all the

00:00:22.073 --> 00:00:26.499
time. They look at examples, look for a pattern, guess what the pattern might

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:32.625
mean, and then test their guess to see if it's right. If it's wrong, it's not a

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:37.943
big deal. They try again with a new guess. So the question I have for you is,

00:00:37.943 --> 00:00:43.648
what does the two here mean? Where does it come from, and what does it stand

00:00:43.648 --> 00:00:50.224
for? Think about what might be going on, in general, with these equations. And

00:00:50.224 --> 00:00:54.863
see if you can predict the pattern without working anything out. Write your

00:00:54.863 --> 00:00:59.389
guess in this box. Just so you know, this is not going to be graded.
