The distance of negative 3 to 0 is just 3 units and the distance from 0 to

00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:07.835
positive 5 is 5 units. Remember, when we want the distance from 0, we want the

00:00:07.846 --> 00:00:11.980
absolute value of a number. Absolute value is always positive. If you got that

00:00:11.992 --> 00:00:16.059
right, great work. You really remember your stuff from Unit 1. If you're a

00:00:16.071 --> 00:00:20.113
little bit fuzzy, that's okay. You can always look back at content to review

00:00:20.125 --> 00:00:23.760
what you've learned. As you progress through this course, you'll often see

00:00:23.772 --> 00:00:27.217
material that we've already covered. Math tends to build upon itself and it's no

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:30.536
different from Algebra. Be sure to go back to previous content if you're ever

00:00:30.548 --> 00:00:32.345
unsure. Reviewing can always help you out.
