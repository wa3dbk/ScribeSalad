00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.059
So let's dig a little deeper into sort
of how we're going to implement some of

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:06.040
those functions, or those features.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.288
First of all, we have to protect
the data that is used by the operating

00:00:09.288 --> 00:00:11.482
system, or
the transferred computing base.

00:00:11.482 --> 00:00:13.664
It must protect itself.

00:00:13.664 --> 00:00:17.650
Remember, one of the requirements we
had is that it should be tamper proof.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.220
So, no one should be
able to tamper with it.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.570
And that's only possible when
it is able to protect itself,

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.730
against that kind of tampering.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.660
So let's talk about some
security features of

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.610
the trusted operating
systems that you have,

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.000
in terms of protecting data and
other kind of resources.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.270
So one thing that we address
in these kinds of systems,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.130
is what is called object
reuse protection.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.107
Think of various kinds of objects or
resources, a memory pages, for example.

00:00:46.107 --> 00:00:47.199
Disk blocks.

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.331
And so what happens when you allocate
a memory page to one process.

00:00:51.331 --> 00:00:53.651
That process completes and
then goes away, and

00:00:53.651 --> 00:00:56.209
then that page is allocated
to a different process.

00:00:56.209 --> 00:01:00.082
But what happens if that page had
some sensitive data that belonged to

00:01:00.082 --> 00:01:01.390
the first process?

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.330
This also applies to disk blocks for
persistent data.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.140
When a file is deleted, we may free up
certain blocks where the file data was

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.390
stored, and these free blocks are free
to be assigned to somebody else.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.208
And they could be, but there may
be data already in these blocks.

00:01:17.208 --> 00:01:18.415
In fact, there is.

00:01:18.415 --> 00:01:23.086
The one thing we can do, if we
are concerned about having trust in

00:01:23.086 --> 00:01:28.190
the system, is that when a process
is allocating either disk blocks or

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.477
memory, then we should
be aware of the fact,

00:01:31.477 --> 00:01:36.790
that something could be left behind
in these reusable resources.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.770
Well, what can we do if
something is left behind?

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.557
If this the system is trusted,

00:01:41.557 --> 00:01:44.800
it can zero out these object
before they get reused.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.000
So before the memory block is given
to the new process, we make sure that

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.640
it doesn't haven access to the data
that was stored in that memory block or

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.590
page by the last process.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.370
We can zero it out.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.890
If we're talking about a file deletion,
or data that's written out in the disk,

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.330
we can override it with various
patterns of zeros and ones.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.870
And we have secure deletion,
for example.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.796
And that's basically writing it one or
more times with some garbage, random

00:02:12.796 --> 00:02:17.744
zeroes and ones, to make sure that all
data that was there is no longer there.

00:02:17.744 --> 00:02:20.402
And you can sort of carry it
even further for example,

00:02:20.402 --> 00:02:23.237
when you discard your disk,
do you actually destroy it,

00:02:23.237 --> 00:02:26.034
do you degauss it, or
you can do physical destruction.

00:02:26.034 --> 00:02:30.786
Because one of the things order a number
of years ago, a bunch of students at MIT

00:02:30.786 --> 00:02:35.322
actually went to some place, and bought
some old PCs at almost no cost, and

00:02:35.322 --> 00:02:38.274
then pulled out the discs
in those machines, and

00:02:38.274 --> 00:02:40.941
they contained all
kind of sensitive data.

00:02:40.941 --> 00:02:44.867
Because even if you, either people
don't delete files, even if you delete,

00:02:44.867 --> 00:02:48.139
if you're not doing some of these
things that we discussed here,

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.790
which a trusted system should do,
the data would still be there.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.190
And if the disk gets in
the hands of somebody else,

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.060
then they will be able to sort
of gain access to the data.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.820
So if you're building a secure system,

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.960
you have to worry about this idea
of reuse of objects or resources.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.120
In particular, memory objects,
disk blocks, and how information that's

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.800
stored in them by a given process of
the system has to be wiped clean,

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.550
before those resources
are re-allocated to somebody else.
