00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.756
Once you've picked an object, you might want to drag it to a new position. Here

00:00:03.756 --> 00:00:06.944
is a demo of dragging in action. It's a bit more involved, since you also have

00:00:06.944 --> 00:00:10.380
to track and respond to mouse move and mouse self events. I'm not going to walk

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.378
through the codes since you can take a look yourself. The main question with

00:00:13.378 --> 00:00:17.025
dragging in 3D space is how to constrain the third dimension? There are usually

00:00:17.025 --> 00:00:19.860
two choices. One is to constrain the movement to be parallel to the screen

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.908
surface as seen in this demo. The other method is to limit movement of the

00:00:23.908 --> 00:00:28.258
object to be on a world plane or other geometry in the scene. For example, if

00:00:28.258 --> 00:00:31.064
you drag a handle on a face of a box to resize it, you limit interaction to be

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:35.988
along the face's normal direction. Beyond the various mouse and keyboard

00:00:35.988 --> 00:00:39.173
combinations, double-click, Shift, and Ctrl keys, there are also different

00:00:39.173 --> 00:00:42.902
forms of selection. In areas as diverse as real time strategy games, and

00:00:42.902 --> 00:00:45.586
computer-aided design programs, you can select a whole set of objects by

00:00:45.586 --> 00:00:50.365
drawing a rectangle around them on the screen. This sort of selection is done

00:00:50.365 --> 00:00:53.245
by finding which objects are fully or partially inside what is essentially a

00:00:53.245 --> 00:00:57.893
smaller frustum on the screen. Lasso selection let's you draw an arbitrary shape

00:00:57.893 --> 00:01:01.987
on the screen for choosing a set of objects. Yippee ki-yay, these aren't built

00:01:01.987 --> 00:01:05.620
into 3GS. I just wanted to point out some ways of doing selection. Keep in mind

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.682
that you don't have to make a selectable object a visible object. For example,

00:01:09.682 --> 00:01:12.412
for positioning a directional light, you might put an invisible sphere in the

00:01:12.412 --> 00:01:16.038
scene and make it selectable. Wherever the user clicks on the sphere determines

00:01:16.038 --> 00:01:20.320
a point in space, which in turn, determines the direction the light comes from.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.374
This is a far as we're going with selection and interaction. The rest of this

00:01:23.374 --> 00:01:26.110
unit will be about animation, which is a huge topic.
