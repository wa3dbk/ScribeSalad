00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.960
Now it's time for our pop quiz to make sure everyone

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.500
understands pop. For this quiz, assume that the name p refers to

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.780
a list with at least two elements. Your goal is to determine

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.890
which of the code fragments does not change the final value of

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.870
p. And so that means no matter what value p starts with,

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.710
as long as it has at least two elements after executing the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.890
code. And I'll show you the choices for the code next. The

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.720
value of the p is the same as what it started with.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.110
So here are the choices. Check the box for each

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.760
code fragment where the value of p at the end of

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.740
the code fragment is the same as the value of

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.370
p beforehand, assuming that initially p has at least two elements.
