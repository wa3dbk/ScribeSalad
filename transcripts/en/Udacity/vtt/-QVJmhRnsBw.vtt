00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.640
The main motivation of Chord is scalable location

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.850
of data in a large distributed system. So

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.310
a publisher might want to publish the location

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.510
of a particular piece of data, such as an

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.940
MP4 with a particular name, such as Annie Hall. It needs to figure out where to

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.580
publish this data in a place that the

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.170
client can find it. So that when the client

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.710
performs a look up for Annie Hall, it's directed to

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.360
the right location that is hosting the data. The key problem

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.510
that we need to solve here is look up and

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.710
you can see that the function that needs to be provided

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.940
is just a simple hash table, but the thing that

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.570
makes this problem interesting is that the hash table isn't located

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.740
in one place but that it's distributed across the network. So

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.320
what we're trying to build is what's called a distributed hash

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.150
table or a DHT. The way that we're going to

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.390
build this is using a mechanism called consistent hashing.
