00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.650
Now that we've walked through adding two fractions together, let's return to our

00:00:03.662 --> 00:00:07.250
original question. You want to frost a cake for a party. You frost a fourth of

00:00:07.262 --> 00:00:10.825
the cake in vanilla icing, and 2 5th of the cake in strawberry icing. What

00:00:10.837 --> 00:00:14.350
fraction of the cake is frosted? So, I want you to try to answer this question

00:00:14.362 --> 00:00:18.000
using what we've learned. You can use diagrams to help support your answer, or

00:00:18.012 --> 00:00:21.700
if you already know the method and understand it really well, you can just apply

00:00:21.712 --> 00:00:31.311
that. Is it 3 5th, 3 9th, 1 10th, 3 20th, or 13 20th? Make your choice.
