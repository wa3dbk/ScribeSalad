00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.920
You've just learned how to set up a two-dimensional array, and now let's say we

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.851
want to know the price of regular gasoline of the second gas station. We supply

00:00:10.851 --> 00:00:16.036
two index values; the first one is the row, the second one the column. So in

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:20.998
this case we're in row zero and in column one. Now you know how to access a

00:00:20.998 --> 00:00:25.096
particular element. You simply look up the row and the column number and plug

00:00:25.096 --> 00:00:30.450
them in here. What if you want to look at all elements? For example, to make a

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.505
print out of every price in the 2D array. Let's look at that next.
