00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
By now you may have gotten the big idea behind anti-lock braking systems.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Looking at this curve, it's obviously best to have a moderate amount of wheel slip, say, 0.2.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So the wheels must not be rolling perfectly. It's also not good if the wheels do not roll at all.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If they are locked, the wheel slip of about 0.2 would make more sense. This is the objective.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We have to have some type of technology that make sure the wheel slips stays around 0.2.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So that we apply the maximum amount of friction.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This ensures that the braking distance is as short as possible but it also ensures

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
the maximum amount of steerability.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The larger the friction is the better we can steer the car while it is braking.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You may ask yourself, okay, all of this is good and well but why don't we simply build a brake

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that applies this amount of friction and then we're done with it.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
No electronics, no sensors, no actuators whatsoever.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The problem is that this curve looks different under different circumstances.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
With a higher speed, it may look like that.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
When there's water on the road, it may look like that and so on.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So we do not know in advance which amount of friction would be best.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
What we do know that the slippage of 0.2 almost always make sense.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Put note, a wheel slip of 0.2 actually does not make sense on snow and on sand.

00:01:23.000 --> 09:59:59.000
If you're on snow and on sand, locking the wheels as quickly as possible is the best option.
