00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.870
The primary contribution of ACME is that it defines a vocabulary for

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.260
talking about architectures. Other features include an extension mechanism

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.130
enabling tool specific sub languages to be imbedded in it. For example,

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.490
a simulator might wish to deal with timing information. ACME features generics,

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.160
families and types for defining architectural styles. Further,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.150
ACME is defined in such a way that ACME descriptions can be converted into first

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.250
order logic suitable for use by automatic reasoning tools such as type checkers.
