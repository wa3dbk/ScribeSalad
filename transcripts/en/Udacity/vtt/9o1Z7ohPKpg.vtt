00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.920
OK.

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.390
Hopefully your SavedGifsViewsController
is ready to go.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.160
Now let's add the ability
to manage a collection.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.815
If we look in the Objective C project,

00:00:08.815 --> 00:00:11.354
we can see that
the SavedGifsViewsController conforms to

00:00:11.354 --> 00:00:12.858
the UICollectionViewDelegate,

00:00:12.858 --> 00:00:17.500
the CollectionViewDataSource, and
the UICollectionViewDelegateFlowLayout.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.890
So when I add all three of
those to the Swift file.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.550
Now let's take a look
at the implementation.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.780
If we scroll down to where
the datasource methods are,

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.590
we can see our familiar friends.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.580
NumberOfItemsInSection and
cellForItemAtIndexPath.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.590
Cool, no surprises there.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.720
Let's switch back to the swift project,
add our protocols and

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.030
then implement those methods.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.160
I've got a mark here for
the delegate and data source methods.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.830
And now we want to add collectionView,

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.930
numberOfItemsInSection, and
cellForItemsAtIndexPath.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.130
For numberOfItemsInSection,

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.909
we're just going to want to
return the number of saved gifts.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.130
And oops we're not really ready to
implement self into the next path yet

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.200
because we haven't made our custom cell.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.300
So let's make our custom cell.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.890
Go ahead and add the GifCell class and
have it inherit from CollectionViewCell.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.160
Open up storyboard and
find the scene called my collection.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.550
Inside the collection view,
you'll see the GifCell now go ahead and

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.930
drag an outlet from the GIF image
view into the GifCell class.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.770
And then also in the GifCell class
we're going to need a function

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.890
called configureForGif and
this is where we'll set the GIF image.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.770
And now let's switch back to
the saved GIF view controller.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.430
And of course if we want to
be able to see our GifCell,

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.890
we should give it a size.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.380
So let's go here to our mark for

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.580
the CollectionViewFlowLayout and
here we are.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.460
Here's the method for
sizeForItemAtIndexPath.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.240
So the width of our cell is going to
be approximately half the width of

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.485
the collectionView.frame.

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:02.910
But of course this method
expects us to return a size and

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.070
we're going to need a margin as well.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.460
So let's go up to
the top of our class and

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.280
create a constant to hold the margin.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.790
You'll want to make this
cell margin a CgFloat so

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.520
that it plays nicely with the CgSize and
we incorporate it into our widths.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.950
And then, of course,
we'll want to return the size,

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.560
and we should be good to go.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.010
So this ought to give us two columns
of cells in our collectionView.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.870
And let's not forget to implement
cellForItemAtIndexPath.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.024
So of course we want to dequeue a cell
we want to cast it to a GifCell.

00:02:42.024 --> 00:02:45.495
We'll grab a gif from
the savedGifs array and

00:02:45.495 --> 00:02:48.337
we'll figure the cell for that gif.

00:02:48.337 --> 00:02:49.802
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:54.116
Now sometimes when I just want to see my
cells before I have data a put in them

00:02:54.116 --> 00:02:57.470
I'll make them a weird color so
they stand out.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.460
So I just went into storyboard and
I made them this blue color.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.300
And just for testing purposes,

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.260
I'm returning 5 here in
number OfItemsInSection,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.170
and then I commented out these two
lines in cell for item index path.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.500
And then when I run the app what I see
is this so I can see my collectionView

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.340
and I can see my cells and I can tell
that their space the way I want them.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.120
I can also see that this view is
kind of blocking my collection.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.010
If you look in the Objective C project.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.470
You'll notice that this view that has
the pink squares is called the empty

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.690
view, because it's the view that's meant
to appear when the collection is empty.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.730
My collection isn't empty right now.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.850
So I'm going to go ahead and
add an outlet for

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.760
this empty view and
I'll add a line to viewWillAppear so

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.662
that when the number of savedGifs does
not equal zero the emptyView is hidden.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.030
Go ahead and add an outlet to
storyboard for the collectionView and

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.150
then while we're here and
viewWillAppear we can call reload data.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.690
And now you can move on to work
on the preview controller.
