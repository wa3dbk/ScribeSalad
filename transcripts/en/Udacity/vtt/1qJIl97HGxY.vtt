00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.980
With these two concepts, states and events in mind,

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.689
let's think a little bit about modeling of behavior. Systems that

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:12.170
respond to events are called reactive systems. If you think about it for

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.050
a minute that's much different than this other kinds of systems that you would

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.300
normally build, in which it's the system in charge of controlling the order in

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.560
which things happen. Here is the external world which supplies the stimuli that

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.050
are causing things to happen in the system, the system has to react to them.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.900
In general there are a variety of different approaches to modeling behavior.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.480
We're going to go through from the simplest, which is combinatorial systems.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.050
Through sequential systems, to the most complex and

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.820
concurrent systems. In combinatorial systems, we're just concerned with states

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.300
no events. Sequential systems have states, that is they have memory, but

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.498
they're linearly ordered one state after another. And then concurrent systems.

00:01:01.498 --> 00:01:05.820
Particularly asynchronous concurrent systems have lots of states and

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.870
lots of events and the events are happening at unpredictable moments of time.
