00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.960
Now, what if we want both
confidentiality and integrity?

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.730
How about we encrypt the message and
send all the CBC blocks, and

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.780
that's the ciphertext blocks for
protecting confidentiality.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.860
And then, we'll replicate the last
block, which is a CBC residue, and

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.000
that's for integrity.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.040
Would that work?

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.550
Obviously this approach does not work

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.250
because if we simply replicate the last
block, we are not adding anything.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.259
That is, we are not doing anything
in addition to protecting

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.640
the confidentiality.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.580
Therefore there is no way this
approach will work to provide both,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.110
confidentiality and integrity.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.170
We can instead use two different keys.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.270
One for producing CBC blocks for
confidentiality, and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.180
the other for generating the residue for

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.920
integrity, that is we encrypt
twice using two different keys.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.130
Another approach is that we first
compute a hash of the message.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.800
Appended it to the message and
then encrypt the whole entity.
