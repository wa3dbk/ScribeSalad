00:00:10.412 --> 00:00:15.725
who got greater than six hours of sleep got a temporal memory score greater than

00:00:15.737 --> 00:00:20.097
70%. So that would mean their scores are either here Or here.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.598
Which of the following conclusions is the most likely? The less sleep you have,

00:00:25.714 --> 00:00:31.341
the better your memory, the more sleep you have, the better your memory, people

relationship between sleep and memory.
