00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So the definition is a little bit complicated,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and it involves a bunch of moving parts

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
like c1s, c2s and 0s and ends in f's and g's.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's see whether the definition at least satisfies

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
some intuitive properties that we want it to.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So to the extent that we're saying that Big Theta

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
means the two functions grow roughly the same as each other,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
then it ought to be the case that

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
if some function f(n) is in Θ(g(n)),

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
it seems like it should go the other way, as well.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
If f(n) grows roughly the same as g(n),

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
then g(n) should grow roughly the same as f(n).

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Is that true? So here's some possible choices.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
No, as much as we would like this to be true,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
it just doesn't follow from the definition

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
of Big Theta that we just gave.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Yes, because Big Theta is like an equality.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
An equality is reflexive, so Big Theta ought to be reflexive.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And then another possibility is yes,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
because we can use the c1 and c2

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
from the definition of f(n) is in Θ(g(n)),

00:00:55.000 --> 09:59:59.000
use the reciprocals, and that sandwiches g(n).
