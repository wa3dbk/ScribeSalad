00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Narrator] A popular toy cipher is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
where each letter in the alphabet is mapped to some substitution letter.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This could be the same letter, could be any other letter in the alphabet,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and decryption is done by the reverse mapping.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We provided python code to make this more specific,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
what a monoalphabetic substitution cipher does.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
One way to prove that a monoalphabetic substitution cipher is imperfect

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
is to use Shannon's key space theorem, which says that

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the number of keys in a perfect cipher must exceed the number of messages or be equal to it.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Assuming a 26-letter alphabet, what length message do we need to show

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that the key space for the monoalphbetic cipher is too small to be a perfect cipher?

00:00:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
For your answer give a number, which is the minimum length message needed for this proof.
