00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.090
Ultimately, as we try to
find the maximum flow,

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.870
we're going to start with
a suboptimal flow and

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.070
then augment it with a flow we
find in the residual network.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.760
Let's see how this works.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.990
We'll start with
the flow f in a graph G.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.040
And then drawing the residual network,
we'll let f' be a flow over this graph.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.450
Of course, it obeys the residual
capacity constraint.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.360
Then we add these two flows together
using a special definition.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.170
Note only one of these two
values of f' can be positive.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.570
Now I claim without proof
that this augmented flow

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.810
is a flow in our original network G, and

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.400
that its value is just the sum of
the two values of the individual flows.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.910
This is pretty easy to verify
with the equations, but

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.390
it's not very illuminating.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.090
So we'll skip it here and
focus on the intuition instead.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.364
Is this augmented flow a flow
in the original network G?

00:00:59.364 --> 00:01:02.953
It fits within the capacity constraints
essentially by construction of

00:01:02.953 --> 00:01:05.290
the residual capacities.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.600
And it conserves flow,
because both f and f' do.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.240
So yes.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.670
And the flow out from
the source is a simple sum,

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.700
which makes it a linear function.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.430
So yes,

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.200
it makes sense that the flow of the sum
should be the sum of the flow values.
