00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.300
So having talked about the vision and the practical

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.220
implementation details of active networks, let's talk about the

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.790
pros and cons. The pro is something that we

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.340
have been stressing all along and that is the flexibility

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.140
from the point if you have an application perspective

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.710
that fact that you can ignore the physical layout

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.220
of the network and slap on your own visualization

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.210
of what you want to accomplish for your netowork flow.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.900
On top of the physical infrastructure is

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.590
the key selling point for active networks. But

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.140
this selling point comes at the cost of perhaps certain cons. What are all the

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:45.220
cons? Well, one concern could be protection threats. What I mean by that is that

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.960
eroding infrastructures carrying network flows. Not really mine

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.260
but yours and the third person and so

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
on and so forth. And just like in an

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.650
operating system when we have a process, we want to make

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.240
sure that that process is not doing anything malicious

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.370
to other processes in the same node. Same way, my

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.980
network flow should not do anything that is detrimental

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.620
to your network flow on the internet. So that's what

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.570
we mean by protection threats. So there are some

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.390
safeguards in the ANTS toolkit to address these protection threats.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.440
The first is the run time safety of ANTS

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.300
program that is running on a router node. And

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.030
the way they ensure that is by first of

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.990
all implementing ANTS itself in Java and using Java

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.030
sandboxing technique on the router node, so that anything

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.020
that a router code is doing for capsule processing

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.220
Is limited to the Java's hand box that is

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.440
executing in. And so, it cannot effect the flows

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.930
of other network flows that are flowing through

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.852
the same routing fabric. That's the first thing. The

00:01:46.852 --> 00:01:49.900
2nd protection thread is whether there could be

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.880
code spoofing that can happen. We are talking about

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.200
cold being injected into the router, and of

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.300
course there was a good reason for doing that,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.890
that I wanted a certain behavior to be

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.960
observed by the network routers, in response to packets

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.220
flowing through the network that belongs to me. But

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.140
I want to be sure that the code that is

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.490
being executed is the code that I wrote not

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.670
some malicious code that is being spoofed to that node.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.780
Well here, here the safeguard is making sure that

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.240
you have a robust, a robust fingerprint associated with the

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.590
code. And so what you do is you generate

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.710
a tight field for the capsule that is a crytographically

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.590
strong finger print of the original code. And it

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.010
always matching when you get the code from a

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.940
previous known In response to your requst, you're goint

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.210
to compute the fingerprint once more. Check it against the

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.000
fingerprint that is contained in the capsule, ensure that

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.540
there is no code spoofing happening. That's how you can

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.580
overcome this protection threat. And the third concern can

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.940
be integrity of the soft state. And what I mean

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.700
by that is, the soft store that's available

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.070
at an ordered node is limited in size, and

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.120
you don't want any particular network flow to

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.150
arbitrarily consume all of the soft state. And yet

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.340
again, there is a restricted API that is

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.180
provided in ANTS, that's the safeguard. For this protection

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.060
threat. So these protection threats are concerns. But at

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.750
least in the ANTS tool kit, they offer solutions

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.980
to ensure that these protection threats are

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.520
not show stoppers for active networks. The second

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.290
concern that one might have is Resource

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.560
Management threats. Now what I mean by that

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.520
is Because we are executing code at a router, the result of that code execution

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.740
could be that I proliferate packets in the

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.120
internet. I'll give you an example of resending

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.480
a message to my siblings I send one message,

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.800
and at some point That one message becomes n

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.950
message. So in some sense, we can start flooding

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.460
the network with capsule processing. Is that a threat?

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.850
Well it is, but internet is already susceptible to

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.570
this kind of resource management threat and yes capsule

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.330
adds to it, but it is not anything new

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.500
that it is adding in terms of resource management threat.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.550
On the other hand, we can ask the question at

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.640
each node is it going to consume more resources than

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.950
it should. And this again comes back to the safegaurd

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.980
that they have in the ANTS toolkit that the api is

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.160
a restricted api and therefore the amount of resources that

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.390
you can consume at a node It's fairly restricted, so

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.630
there is sort of a mixed answer to this resource

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.120
management concern. At a given node, the resource management concern doesn't

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.000
quite exist so long as you adhere to the restricted API of ANTS. And the second

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.520
concern that the capsules may flood the network

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.230
can happen, but it already happens, we all

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:58.640
experience spam on The internet so this is not adding any new problem but it is

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.490
perhaps exasterbating an existing problem. So having looked

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.460
at division and looking at division and the practicality

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.800
of active networks, time for a quiz.
