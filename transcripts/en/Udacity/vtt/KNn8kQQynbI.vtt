If you got 15 over 28, great job. Now, let's go ahead and do the problem. If I

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:11.701
have 3 4ths, times 5 7ths, we know when we multiply fractions that we have to

00:00:11.713 --> 00:00:17.569
multiply the numerators together. And we have to multiply the denominators

00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:23.351
together. So, 3 times 5 is 15. And, 4 times 7 is 28. Now we would need to check

00:00:23.363 --> 00:00:29.171
to see if we need to reduce the fraction, but since there's no factors in common

00:00:29.183 --> 00:00:31.338
between 15 and 28, we're done.
