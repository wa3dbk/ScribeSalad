00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.840
Our first step is to substitue this value of r into the equation. Now we need

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.701
to work toward isolating t so I'm going to divide both side of the equation by

00:00:09.701 --> 00:00:16.250
this coefficient out here, ten to the negative 12. That leaves us with 0.795

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:23.610
equals e to the negative t over 8223. Now what we need to do is get t out of

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.160
the exponent. So what do we need to do? Well, we need to take a log. Since e is

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.580
the base of our exponent here, our log should have the same base. That means we

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.970
need to take the natural log of both sides. On the left side, that's just going

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.360
to give us some number that we can calculate with a calculator. But, over here

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.880
something a little bit more interesting is happening. We have two inverse

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.627
operations that are going to cancel one another out. Leaving us with just the

00:00:50.627 --> 00:00:56.050
exponent as the entire quantity on the side. I'll leave the left side as is for

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:04.700
now. So we have natural log of .795 is equal to negative t over 8223. Now it's

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.830
easy. All we need is a little bit of multiplication. We need to multiply both

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:18.770
sides by negative 8223. So that leaves us with t equals negative 8223 times the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.100
natural log of 0.795. let's pull out our calculator to figure out what number

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.152
this is equal to. Using a calculator and rounding gives us a value of t of

00:01:29.152 --> 00:01:37.540
about 1886. So this piece of parchment from the dead sea scrolls is about 1886

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.410
years old. Now, in a real situation, estimates are a bit better than this. They

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.090
are calibrated using, for example, tree rings to determine a slightly more

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.340
accurate amount of carbon-14 in the plant material at a given time. Still, it's

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.110
pretty awesome that we can even come up with any sort of estimate.
