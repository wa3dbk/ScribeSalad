00:00:00.097 --> 00:00:02.711
So in summary and revenue model for this class,

00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:06.765
the best thing that you could do is start drawing the diagram.

00:00:06.765 --> 00:00:09.680
So what I want you to do is draw the diagram

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.781
of both your revenue streams and your pricing,

00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:14.459
and I want you to actually put numbers in.

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:17.015
So let's assume this is your company over here.

00:00:17.015 --> 00:00:22.697
What you've discovered is that there are 3 different customer segments; look at that.

00:00:22.697 --> 00:00:25.432
Tenants, property owners, and leasing companies.

00:00:25.432 --> 00:00:29.766
I want to know if this is subscription, what is the revenue stream

00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.676
that you have between each one of these customer segments,

00:00:32.676 --> 00:00:35.480
and what are the pricing tactics?

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.351
And then how do you make money and what do you provide.

00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:42.766
And out of sudden you can now see

00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:47.032
that the revenue stream and the pricing is going back and forth.

00:00:47.032 --> 00:00:51.688
I just really believe that if you could draw you have a handle on understanding it.

00:00:51.688 --> 00:00:55.182
And don't worry, on day one you start drawing and then realize

00:00:55.182 --> 00:00:57.182
I really don't understand this stuff.

00:00:57.182 --> 00:01:00.141
That's just a signal - time to get out of building again,

00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:02.237
talk to some more people and say:

00:01:02.237 --> 00:01:03.977
well, how are we gonna make money here?

00:01:03.977 --> 00:01:06.031
Cause i can't even explain it to myself.
