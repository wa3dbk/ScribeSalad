00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.505
You might have watched the intro video for this class,

00:00:02.505 --> 00:00:05.946
where I quoted the American super computer designer, Seymour Cray.

00:00:05.946 --> 00:00:10.941
"If you were plowing a field, which would you rather use? Two strong oxen or 1024 chickens?"

00:00:10.941 --> 00:00:14.215
Well, I love the chickens, and Dave loves the chickens,

00:00:14.215 --> 00:00:17.542
and I hope by the end of this class you'll love the chickens too.

00:00:17.542 --> 00:00:20.163
Now, the biggest idea in this course is parallelism.

00:00:20.163 --> 00:00:23.878
We can solve large problems by breaking them up into smaller pieces.

00:00:23.878 --> 00:00:26.994
Then we can run these smaller pieces at the same time.

00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:31.375
Parallel computing used to be a niche technology used by exotic supercomputers.

00:00:31.375 --> 00:00:33.509
Today, the world has gone parallel.

00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:36.439
Modern computing products are like the chickens.

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:40.810
They have hundreds of processors that can each run a piece of your problem in parallel.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.783
A high end GPU contains over 3,000 arithmetic units, ALUs,

00:00:45.783 --> 00:00:49.819
that can simultaneously run 3,000 arithmetic operations.

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:54.724
GPUs can have tens of thousands of parallel pieces of work all active at the same time.

00:00:54.724 --> 00:00:57.129
We call each of those pieces of work a thread,

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.270
and a modern GPU may be running up to 65,000 concurrent threads.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.566
Together, all this computing power has the potential to help you

00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:07.437
solve your problems faster than you ever could before.

00:01:07.437 --> 00:01:11.474
But harnessing all that computing power at the same time, in parallel,

00:01:11.474 --> 00:01:15.874
requires a different way of thinking than programming a single scalar processor,

00:01:15.874 --> 00:01:17.647
where you're only doing one thing at a time.

00:01:17.647 --> 00:01:20.724
In this class we'll teach you how to program the GPU,

00:01:20.724 --> 00:01:24.760
allowing you to practice what we call GPU computing or GPGPU,

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.825
standing for general purpose programmability on the graphics processing unit.

00:01:28.825 --> 00:01:33.070
More importantly, we'll teach you how to think about programming through a parallel lens.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.567
The homework assignments in this class will center around image processing applications.

00:01:37.567 --> 00:01:39.402
Frankly, they're pretty cool assignments,

00:01:39.402 --> 00:01:43.711
and with them you'll be able to do some interesting visual effects at blazing fast speeds.
