It's been cool to see how we can combine functions mathematically, but what do

00:00:03.535 --> 00:00:07.530
the results of these combinations really mean? Well, to understand the

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.658
relationship between the original functions and combined functions, I think we

00:00:10.658 --> 00:00:14.434
should make some graphs. Starting with something simple sounds like a good

00:00:14.434 --> 00:00:19.425
idea. Here I've drawn the graphs of f of x equals 2x plus 1, and g of x equals

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:25.508
3. Now, what if I wanted to add f and g together? Which of these three graphs

00:00:25.508 --> 00:00:28.819
do you think is a graph of this new function?
