00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.586
As we can see from the three points we looked at first, the x-coordinate of our

00:00:03.586 --> 00:00:09.290
point is not going to change. It's still going to just be x. The y-coordinate

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.042
however, needs to switch signs, since we have positive y here, we need negative

00:00:14.042 --> 00:00:15.709
y here.
