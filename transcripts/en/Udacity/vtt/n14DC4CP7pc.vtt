00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.440
This part of an MLM helps
with a radiologic study that

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.880
involves injecting the patient
with a contrast dye

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.690
to better see the functioning
parts of their internal organs.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.970
It deals with a lab test, the creatinine
level, which measures kidney function.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.750
This is important, because the dye in
the study is removed by the kidneys, but

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.330
it can also cause kidney damage.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.940
So it's important to know the patient's
kidney function before giving the dye.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.680
To check for that, Arden needs
to know the creatinine level.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:41.190
And to get it, this expression
must be interpreted by the EHR

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.990
in a particular hospital to fetch that
value from its proprietary database.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.680
So, even though the purpose of Arden
is to share clinical decision support,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.100
because EHRs aren't
readily interoperable,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.600
we run into roadblocks like this, and
that's led to low Arden adoptions.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.420
Healthy Decisions was a nearly two year
long standards effort sponsored by ONC,

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.860
and has now been folded into
a broader clinical quality framework.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.160
It proposed using parts
of the Arden technology

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.010
along with web services designed to make
fetching data like this much easier.
