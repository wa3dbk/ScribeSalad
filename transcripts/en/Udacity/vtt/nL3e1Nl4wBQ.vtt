00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What would you suggest for students to be studying in school

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
so that they could be prepared to contribute to this area?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I think getting a good background in basic computer science,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
including a mathematical background like discrete mathematics

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and programming and so on is important.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Also nowadays knowing systems is important because there are lots and lots of hidden

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
power of modern computer systems such as parallelism, concurrency,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
various levels of memory hierarchy, and so on,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
which is something that clearly doesn't capture very well,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
but you can get several orders of improvements in your algorithm

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
by taking advantage of this.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I highly recommend the Easley-Kleinberg book called Networks, Crowds, and Markets.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I have the book jackets here, so you can see it.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But it was published by Cambridge University Press in 2010.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
A free version of it is available on the internet, so you don't have to buy it.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Again, it's called Networks, Crowds, and Markets.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It's a great read.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
They went to great pains to have very few Greek letters,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
so they are just trying to get the concepts to you.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Also, at the end of very chapter it has like advanced materials,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
so if you want to delve more into it and they have beautiful citations

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and lots and lots of reference, but it's a great, great book.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Knowledge of algorithms is good, looking at social networks in a different way.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Not just as social network but actually starting to look at how social networks actually work.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
There are papers that come out very regularly,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and you don't need to go to like Google Scholar.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
There are different industry websites that keep track of social networks, like Mashable,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that you can actually look at, and they sometimes send out very nice analysis posts

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
on what's actually going on,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and just keeping yourself abreast of this will make it more advantageous

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
if you are interviewing, because you will be able to actually speak,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
use the right wordings and will also get you to actually appreciate

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
the math and the science behind the networks.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I see. So, spending a certain amount of time wasting time on the Internet,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
is actually a really useful thing. Not all the time, mind you.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Yeah, in this case it's good wasting. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yes. Good wasting.
