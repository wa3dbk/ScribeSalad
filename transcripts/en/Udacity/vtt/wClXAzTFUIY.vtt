00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.520
At this point, you should be familiar
with personas and wire frames.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.520
Your next task is to create at
least one persona and a user flow.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.220
You can lay out your persona
on a piece of paper like this,

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.470
split up into four quadrants.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.100
Your persona should include
the following information.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.430
A sketch of the person, or a picture of
the person, and their name, demographic

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.980
information, and any behaviors that you
think are relevant to your product.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.690
Here you should include demographic
information that leads to specific

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.690
types of behaviors.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.630
And here you should put their
pain points and their needs.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.660
Try to differentiate personas around
pain points, needs, and their behaviors.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.130
By designing your product for
their behaviors or

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.940
their different pain points and needs,
you could really target different users.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.310
And finally here is where
your product comes into play,

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.200
this is where you put all
your solutions for that user.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.700
You can create this persona using any
tool of your choice and I've included

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.855
some additional tools and examples which
are linked in the instructor notes.

00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:02.725
You can rely on user research
here to help you out.

00:01:02.725 --> 00:01:04.995
Remember the goal is to
create something quickly.

00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:07.285
You can revisit this
persona that you create and

00:01:07.285 --> 00:01:10.927
the user flow when you learn about
design sprints in lesson three.

00:01:10.927 --> 00:01:11.917
Create a persona and

00:01:11.917 --> 00:01:15.877
include a user flow that shows how
a user would complete a task, and

00:01:15.877 --> 00:01:19.717
how the user would interact in the main
navigation or flows of your product.

00:01:19.717 --> 00:01:22.957
You can see one example of this which
is linked to the instructor notes.
