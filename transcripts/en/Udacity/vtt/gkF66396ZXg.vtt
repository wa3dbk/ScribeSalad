As you know the world is filled with complex problems that we try to,

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.270
that we strive to solve. And our primary weapon for

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.470
dealing with this complexity, is abstraction. That is we hide details so

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.840
we can concentrate on the big picture. For example, when we have to

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.680
pick up supplies at the grocery store for dinner. We break the problem down into

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.710
traveling to the store, locating the items, paying for them, and

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.320
so on. It is only when we actually driving to the store that we worry about

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.340
things like what turns to take. This lesson is about managing this complexity by

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.800
carefully refining a design from an abstract version into an implementation
