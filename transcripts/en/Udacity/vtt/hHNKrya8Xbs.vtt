00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:05.029
Emotions involve four different response systems, our thought and appraisal,

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:11.046
our physiology, our expression and our subjective feelings. So let's start with

00:00:11.046 --> 00:00:15.286
thought and appraisal, this is necessary for all emotions. We have to perceive

00:00:15.286 --> 00:00:19.510
an event as somehow important in order to experience emotion, that is we have

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.918
to appraise the event as in some way harmful or beneficial to our well-being.

00:00:25.918 --> 00:00:30.208
Benefits to our well-being make us happy, and harm makes us upset, depending on

00:00:30.208 --> 00:00:35.486
what's harmful. For example, insult makes us angry, loss makes us sad, and a

00:00:35.486 --> 00:00:40.378
threat makes us afraid. But there's also the threat of losing a sexual partner,

00:00:40.378 --> 00:00:45.140
which can make us jealous. Now these are perceptions. They don't actually have

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.198
to be accurate. Misunderstandings, cause the exact same emotional reaction, as

00:00:50.198 --> 00:00:54.614
an accurate perception. So whether we're really losing our sexual partner,

00:00:54.614 --> 00:00:57.830
doesn't necessarily matter, as much as the perception, of if it's happening, or

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.490
could happen.
