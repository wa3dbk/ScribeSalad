00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.009
So the answer to this question is that both the

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:06.730
skin color and the disposition appear to be related in these

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.370
families, as opposed to height, doesn't appear to related in

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.220
our first family. Now what do we mean by this? All

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.800
I mean is that when we look at the son

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.650
here in the first example, he's much taller than the parents.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.950
Both the parents are short, so we're asking the question,

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.390
where did the trait of the son being tall come from.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.330
Not only does it not appear to come from either one

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.080
of the parents individually, but it doesn't look to be a

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.549
combination of the pair's height either. In the case of skin

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.770
color and disposition though, we see that both the daughter and the

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.410
baby share the same skin tone as the parents so it

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.230
appears as if that trait was related in this case. And

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.750
the same thing for disposition. While one parent seems to be

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.680
sad most or all of the time, the children are happy and

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.700
resemble what the other parent looks like most of the time,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.480
which is having a happy or really cheery disposition. Now it's

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.780
really important to remember as we go through this lesson and

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.550
all the lessons in this course Just because a trait appears

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.530
to be related or to be inherited in a particular ways.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.940
Looks can be deceiving sometimes. And we will talk in great

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.030
detail about what aspects of traits have a genetic component and

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.030
which of those might have an environmental component down the line.
