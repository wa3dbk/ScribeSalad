00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.340
One of the strengths of Gradle lies
in it's extensible domain model.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.400
At the heart of this model
is the concept of tasks.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.520
A task is a self-contained unit of
work that Gradle can reason about.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.880
At the core of a task is its action, for

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.730
example we might declare a task
to compile some Java sources or

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.030
to copy some files from one directory
to another, or to simply print hello.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.070
A task can perform some
action in isolation but

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.230
it can also declare
dependencies on other tasks.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.440
Gradle will ensure that all
these dependencies are run and

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.940
ensure all of their dependencies and
so on and so on.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.300
A task can also define its inputs and

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.560
its outputs, the files that
it reads from and writes to.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.980
This allows Gradle to determine if
a task needs to do its work, or

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.390
if everything is already up to date,
in which case it doesn't need to run.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.120
We'll explore all these features
later on in this lesson, but for

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.360
now let's get Gradle up and
running and execute our first task.
