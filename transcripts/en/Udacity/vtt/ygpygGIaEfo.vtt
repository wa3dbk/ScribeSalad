00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In order to use the backward Euler method to come up with an expression

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
for w at the n+1 step, we know that we're going to need an expression for w dot.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So that's the first thing we deal with. Beginning with our equation for the force of friction.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We know that the acceleration of the wheel depends on the force of friction

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
divided by the mass of the wheel.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So we plug in this expanded version of the equation for the force of friction

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
into the equation for w dot and of course the track b.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In the backward Euler method, it says that w at the n+1 step is equal to w at the n step

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
plus the step size times the change in w at the n+1 step.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Now that we have expression for w dot, we can plug into the proper location in the equation below.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
If rewritten as the wheel slip to see here and here as 1-w at the n+1 step over v,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
which of course is just an equivalent expression.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This gets rid of any explicit dependents on this.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Remember from what I said earlier that v here changes much more slowly than w.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We then specify which v we're referring to right here.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
But if you were to be more clear, this is the subn+1.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
There's a little bit of rearranging we can rewrite this equation for w n+1 as this equation right here.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The amazing slightly counter intuitive to rearrange things like this

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
since this expression looks maybe longer and more awkward than this one does.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Remember, however, that our initial request for w

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
was that it obey an equation of the form that I wrote up here.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We have a term with w subn+1 and then term with e to that value and also a constant.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
All just added together equal in 0. That's exactly what we have down here now.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
This makes our job very simple. Remember, we want to identify what c, d, f, and k are.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And now, we can just read them directly off of this equation.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
In order to implement the backward Euler method and the code now,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
all we have to do is translate the variables c, d, f, and k into code just like I've done right here.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The expression for w that the solver is going to output.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
is equivalent to the one that we just found using the backward Euler method.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It's very simple since the solver has already established for this.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
All we have to do is fill in the proper values for these variables.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
In the introduction video, I didn't talk much about what the solver is actually doing.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So now just take a second to explain that.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
It's implementing something called a Newton-Raphson method.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
This is a method used for solving implicit equations that are not linear.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So it's a perfect fit for the situation that we are faced with right now.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Let's say I have a function like this green curve right here

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
for which I want to find the x value of a certain point.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Maybe for example I'd like to find the x value of this x intercept right here.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So the thing that we actually know about this point then is the y value, which is 0.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
To use in Newton-Raphson method, I start by making a guess

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
at what the x value that appears to that y value is.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Maybe I guess the x coordinate that corresponds this blue line right here.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
What the Newton-Raphson method does is it takes the slope of the line

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
tangent to the green curve at this point.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
This may be that tangent line looks a little something like this

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and extends that line down to the y value that we're interested in.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Now, the next x value that I will guess is going to be the point of that tangent line

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
intersects the x axis in this case then I will do the same thing for this point and so on and so forth.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And eventually, my results will converge to the actual point that I'm looking for.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
This is a very effective method for solving implicit equations.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
The general equation showing the movement from one guess to the next guess is shown right here.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
We can specify this to deal with the situation we're looking at by using this equation right here.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And in fact, that's exactly what's written in the code in this expression for w_new.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Now that we understand how are solvers working, let's look at the plot we get.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
What we have here is a series of plot that all depends on time.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
First, we have position then car velocity then wheel velocity and then wheel slip.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
The difference series shown by the different colors in each plot

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
represent different values for the magnitude of the breaking acceleration.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Fusing them really close in the different parts of the top graph, you'll be able to tell

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
that 70 m/s² is the blue line; 100 m/s² is the green line;

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
130 the red line; 160 the cyan line; and 190 the magenta line.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
So we can see then how different braking accelerations affect these 4 different quantities.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Interestingly enough, it's the 130 m to second braking,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
which is one of the middle values that makes the car stopped first.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
When we slam on the brakes really hard which is shown at the magenta and cyan lines,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
the wheel stopped rotating very quickly and see the wheel velocity was 0 right away.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
However, in tandem with that, the wheel slip increases dramatically,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and the wheels are locked very early on.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
As a result, the car velocity does not actually slid down much.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Of course, as we would expect, we just don't put the brakes on very hard like with the blue one

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
then the car does go a pretty far distance, and it actually does not come to stop it all

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
in the time that we've allowed; however, this is the great example of how slamming on your brakes

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
is not the most effective braking method.

00:04:41.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Great job on this problem.
