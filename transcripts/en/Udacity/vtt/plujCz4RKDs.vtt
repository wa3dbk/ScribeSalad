Now, one thing I like to be able to do is when I get a play, I want to be able

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to actually modify the board to indicate what that play is.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I want you to write a function to do that for me.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It takes a play, but remember a play is tuple of a score, a start position indicated by i, n, j,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
a direction indicating by delta i and delta j, and the actual word, a string.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Let's make this look a little bit better by making it be a tuple.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Write the code that will modify the board and

00:00:29.000 --> 09:59:59.000
in addition to modifying it, let's also return the board
