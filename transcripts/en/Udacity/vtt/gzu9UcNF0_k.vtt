00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.969
Let's go through an example. You and your friends want to go out to eat. But

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.310
you don't want to pay a lot. There are two areas of town you're thinking about,

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.458
Gettysburg and Wilma. You look online and find the average meal prices at 18

00:00:11.458 --> 00:00:16.680
restaurants in Gettsyburg and 14 restaurants in Wilma. The link to these

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.620
average prices at all these restaurants is at the bottom. You want to know if

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.428
statistically there's a significant difference between the meal prices in each

00:00:24.428 --> 00:00:29.358
of these two areas of town. Therefore your null hypothesis is that they're not

00:00:29.358 --> 00:00:33.959
statistically different. And your alternative is that they are. This is a

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:39.450
non-directional test. To compare these two samples what do you need to know?

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.870
Should we know the population mean for food prices at all restaurants in

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.996
Gettysburg and Wilma. The average of each sample. The population standard

00:00:47.996 --> 00:00:54.215
deviations. The size of each sample. Or finally the sample standard deviations.
