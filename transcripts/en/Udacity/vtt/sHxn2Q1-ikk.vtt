00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.440
The first step is to take the log base 4 of both sides. So we have log base 4

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.055
of 4 to the x equals log base 4 of 121. Then, we just simplify over here. Using

00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:18.020
our inverse property we talked about, log base 4 of 4 to the x is just x. Since

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.974
this log undoes this exponent. That leaves us with x equals log base 4 of 121.
