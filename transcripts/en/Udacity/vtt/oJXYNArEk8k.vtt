00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.060
Well let's bring it up, let's roll one dice one time, we get a five, let's roll

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:15.633
it again, we got a three. You can keep rolling it and we see what we get, we

00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:23.576
don't want to do this 100 times, so let's just change this and select 100. Now

00:00:23.576 --> 00:00:29.915
we'll roll one dice, 100 times. So by chance, by simulation, we get a lot more

00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:35.710
6s than 5s. Let's try it again. Our distribution is looking pretty uniform.

00:00:35.711 --> 00:00:44.522
Let's try a thousand. Here it looks even more uniform, so the more you roll the

00:00:44.522 --> 00:00:49.958
die. One two three four five and six all have an equal chance of getting

00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:55.333
selected and so our distribution is uniform. In this case our sample size was

00:00:55.333 --> 00:01:00.501
one, so we don't really have sample means right now. So essentially, the

00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:06.129
standard error is just the population standard deviation divided by the square

00:01:06.129 --> 00:01:11.918
root of 1, which is just the population standard deviation. So when we're taking

00:01:11.918 --> 00:01:17.933
samples of size 1, we're just drawing members of the actual population. And so

00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:23.451
then when we graph our distribution of sample means then we're really just

00:01:23.451 --> 00:01:29.592
graphing our actual population so we'll get a distribution that's approximately

00:01:29.592 --> 00:01:35.555
equal to the distribution of the population, which is uniform since we just have

00:01:35.555 --> 00:01:37.033
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
