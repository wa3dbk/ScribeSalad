00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.140
So this is our superscalar versus VLIW quiz

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.120
solution. We have an [INAUDIBLE] superscalar with a 32

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.750
bit instruction. And we have a VLIW processor,

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.450
where it really packages up to four such instructions

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.650
into a 128 bit instruction. If we manage

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.130
to package four instructions into one of these. Then

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.200
the size is the same, four of these are equal to the size of one of these.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.540
So the program size, at best, will be the

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.092
same, 4000 bytes. However, it can happen for example that

00:00:33.092 --> 00:00:36.078
all of these instructions depend on each other. In

00:00:36.078 --> 00:00:38.706
which case we can specify only one of them in

00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:40.690
each one of these. We have to fill the

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.830
rest of the 128 bit instruction with three no ops,

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.090
simply because there are no two instructions from this

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.260
program that can actually fit in the same instruction here,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.120
because they depend on each other. And all we can put in a VLIW instruction are

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.150
operations. That are independent of each other. So, what could happen is that we

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:06.630
have a program that is really four times larger, which is 16000 bytes.
