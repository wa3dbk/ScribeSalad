00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.180
And the reason for this is because testing is inherently

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.080
incomplete. So let me re-size this a little bit, so that

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.340
I can make room for an illustration. And what I'm

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.170
going to show you here is just a reminder, that when we

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.380
test, we have a huge virtually infinite input domain, and

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.956
we have to derive from this input domain a few test

00:00:17.956 --> 00:00:21.330
cases. By picking specific inputs in the domain, and of

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.260
course, corresponding outputs. And so what happens normally is that these

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.280
test cases represent the teeny tiny fraction of

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.920
the domain, and therefore testing is always incomplete.
