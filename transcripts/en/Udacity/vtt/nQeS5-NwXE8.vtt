00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.067
The key here is that our boat is going to make a return trip. The boat's

00:00:04.067 --> 00:00:07.292
going to start and travel downstream and then turn around and come right back

00:00:07.292 --> 00:00:11.374
upstream. We know that the distance that the boat travels downstream is the

00:00:11.374 --> 00:00:15.873
same as the distance for the boat to travel back upstream. This means that

00:00:15.873 --> 00:00:22.432
these expressions are these two numbers, must be equal. So we'll know 8x-96

00:00:22.432 --> 00:00:28.110
equals 6x plus 72. This is our equation that we can use to solve.
