For grids, were primarily interested in getting robots to shoot each other in

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.644
the face. So the question we need to ask is, what sound effects do we need for

00:00:07.644 --> 00:00:13.603
our game? Do we need to play just basic sound clips? Do we need to have the

00:00:13.603 --> 00:00:17.261
ability to adjust the volume of sound effects in the game, based on the game

00:00:17.261 --> 00:00:22.520
state? Or do we really need all the abilities of Web Audio to perform audio

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.462
processing on all of our sounds. Go ahead and check which ever answers you feel

00:00:27.462 --> 00:00:28.150
apply.
