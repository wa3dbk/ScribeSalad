So when my son, Evan, was about 12, 13 months old, he said ba for water. Well,

00:00:06.696 --> 00:00:13.077
why is that? Well, he learned bottle of water and so he said ba. Now, he would

00:00:13.077 --> 00:00:17.530
even extend this to anything water. So, for instance, a lake or a pool or a

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.990
bathtub. Now my wife and I of course knew this, we had to translate though for

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.055
his babysitters or other people. Because he developed his own unique way of

00:00:26.055 --> 00:00:30.332
saying things. Which is pretty common when children are first learning

00:00:30.332 --> 00:00:35.205
language. So, in fact, perhaps you have examples of a sibling or a cousin who's

00:00:35.205 --> 00:00:40.970
at the similar age right now and says things their own way. So why don't you go

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.769
to the forum and talk about this, maybe give some examples that you know about.
