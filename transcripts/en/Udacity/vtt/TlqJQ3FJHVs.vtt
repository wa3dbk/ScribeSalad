It's also worth noting what's missing from Clark's paper.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.490
There's no discussion of security. There's no discussion of

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.650
availability. There's no discussion of mobility or support for

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.324
mobility. And there's also no mention of scaling. There

00:00:12.324 --> 00:00:13.700
are probably a lot of other things that are

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.600
missing and it's worth thinking about on your own,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.730
some of the other things that current internet applications

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.370
demand, that are not mentioned in Clark's original design paper.
