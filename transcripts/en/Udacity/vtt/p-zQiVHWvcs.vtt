00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Here's some code for finding the second largest name in that list.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It starts off opening the file that has the year of birth 1995 data in it

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and instead of having just one max value that they're keeping track of

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
we keep track of the max name and the maximum value we've seen so far

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and the second highest name and value that we've seen so far.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I initialized to zero because all of the values in this file are greater than zero,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
actually five or greater, and then, we loop through the lines in the file,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
for each line, we pull out the name, sex, and count using rsplit

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and make sure that that count is not a string anymore but an integer,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and we check to make sure the sex is female

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
because that's the way we're doing it for this question.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
If the count of this new person that we just encountered, this new name,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
is bigger than the best we've seen so far then what we're going to do

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
is take what used to be the best so far and move it to the second best.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
What used to be the best is now going to get filled in with the current individual.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
On the other hand, if the count is not bigger than the largest we've seen so far,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
but it is bigger than the second largest we've seen so far,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
then we just replace the second largest we've seen so far.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
When this loop is all completed, and we've ran through all the names,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
we just print the value and name that has the maximum

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and the value of the name has the second maximum.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We can run this, and we can see that Jessica is the highest valued name,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and Ashley is the second highest.
