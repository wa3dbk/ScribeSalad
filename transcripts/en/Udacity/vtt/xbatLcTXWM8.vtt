00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So, we have seen how to reduce an 800-line input to a single line

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and even reduce this single line even further to 8 characters

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that reproduce the bug.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This is also what the Mozilla volunteers did,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and within one night the first volunteers already had earned their t-shirts.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This is obviously simpler than 800-lines of HTML code,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but what is it that makes something simpler?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Or when do we say that something is simpler than something else?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
What is it that makes something simple?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
First, there is the burden it takes to understand something.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
In debugging, an input that takes me 10 seconds to understand

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
is simpler than an input that takes me 10 minutes.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This is why one line of HTML is better than 800 lines of HTML,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
because the one line of HTML has a far smaller burden to understand

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
why something went wrong.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Second, the less burden it takes to explain something,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
the simpler it is, or maybe the other way around.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
If something is simpler, it takes less effort or explain something.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
If I say Mozilla cannot print a select tag,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
then it is way simpler than saying Mozilla can't print this Bugzilla page

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
with the following 800 lines of code.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Plus, a short explanation also points me directly to the code in question.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
If I know Mozilla can't print a select tag,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I can go directly to the code in which Mozilla handles printing select tags.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
All of his, however, refers to humans.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It is the human burden we're talking about.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Things that are simple are easy to explain and easy to understand,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
but what is complex to one can be simple to others and vice versa.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The same thing can be explained in simple terms and also in complex terms.
