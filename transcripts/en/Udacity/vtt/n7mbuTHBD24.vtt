00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.120
As I said, L3, by proof of construction, systematically debunks all of

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.970
the myths I detailed in the previous slide. The first myth is the border

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.770
crossing myth. That is, the user space to kernel space switching. Now L

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.420
3 accomplishes this boarder crossing in

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.020
123 processor cycles. And this includes the

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.830
TLB misses that may be incurred because of

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.710
the fact that we're going from user space

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.555
to kernel space. As well as cache misses

00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:37.330
that may be incurred because we are starting

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.989
to execute some code in the micro kernel. All of that put together, L3 shows, by

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.245
proof of construction, that you can do that

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:51.210
border crossing in 123 processor cycles. And L3 goes

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.440
one step further, it actually cones through

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.415
a back of the envelope calculation, what

00:00:57.415 --> 00:00:59.965
will be the minimum cost involved in

00:00:59.965 --> 00:01:03.623
doing this border crossing? Or, in other words,

00:01:03.623 --> 00:01:08.983
how many cycles will the instructions that are needed, in order to do the border

00:01:08.983 --> 00:01:13.710
crossing, take on a particular processor architecture?

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.160
And they count the number of processor cycles,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.420
and they show that the number of processor cycles needed is about 107 and

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.860
L3 microkernel accomplishes that in 123 processor

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.915
cycles. Or, in other words, this is debunking

00:01:27.915 --> 00:01:30.315
the myth that border crossing is going to

00:01:30.315 --> 00:01:34.600
be expensive in microkernel based design. It's as

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.350
close to what it would take minimally in the processor, even if you hand code

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.950
through machine instructions, what needs to happen to go from the user space to

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.200
the kernel space? So that is proof that microkernel-based

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.660
design is not going to be incurring any more overhead for

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.400
border crossing. It turns out that CMU's Mach operating

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.380
system, on the same hardware, takes 900 cycles, as opposed to

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.020
the 123 cycles taken by L3 for border

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.020
crossing. Spin and exokernel that we have looked

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.330
at in fairly great detail, used Mach as

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.010
the basis for decrying microkernel based design, saying

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.080
that, well, border crossing in microkernel based design

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.980
is expensive because it takes this much time.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.580
But what L3 has shown is that it need not take this much time, it can

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.500
be done in much shorter amount of time. Which

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.350
is close to what the hardware can actually do.
