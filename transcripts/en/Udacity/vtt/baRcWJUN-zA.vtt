00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's illustrate how Panda's describe function works,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.060
using our Laman baseball data set. Say

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.090
that our baseball data was loaded into

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.378
a Panda's data frame called baseball, using Panda's

00:00:13.378 --> 00:00:17.510
read.csb function. Like so. If we call

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.850
baseball that describe, what do we get back?

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.580
You can see that baseball that describe returns a data frame in it of itself.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.432
For every numerical column, we see the count, mean, standard deviation, mean,

00:00:31.432 --> 00:00:36.739
25%, 50%, 75% and maximum

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.300
values. We can do some quick checking to make sure there are data generally

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.650
make sense. Here. LahmanID has actually been read in as a number, which is a bit

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.790
misleading. We won't be doing any arithmetic on

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.770
it. But we see that the minimum birth

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.300
month is one, and the maximum birth month is 12,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.330
as we would expect. We see that the minimum birth date

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.140
is one, and the maximum birth date is 31. That

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.129
makes sense. And we see that the mean birth year is

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.410
actually 1928, which to me is surprising. I'd think that

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.420
it would be a little bit later. Investigating values like this,

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.620
we can tell pretty quickly what our data looks like,

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.990
and whether there might be any significant outliers in our data.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.140
In other words, are the min or max way

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.420
larger than the values corresponding with the 25th or 75th

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.200
percentile. Although we won't discuss exploratory analysis of data

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.900
in depth, there's one thing that you might notice when

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.120
looking at a summary of your data. It may

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.740
have a bunch of missing values. This is evidenced here

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.200
by the differences in count for our various columns. Since

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.140
this is a particularly common problem. Let's discuss why values

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.940
may be missing. And different methods we can use to

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.510
mitigate the effect of those missing values on our analysis.
