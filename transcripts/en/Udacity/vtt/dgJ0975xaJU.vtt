00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.969
Show you an example of erosion, and
here we're eroding with a disk,

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.880
a circular disk,
with the origin in the middle, okay?

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.020
So this is the original image,
we saw this one before, and

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.710
if we erode with a disk of radius 5, you
can see that what's going to happen is,

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.190
first of all of these lines that
are thin, they all go away.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.430
Why do they go away?

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.640
They're thinner,
obviously than the size 5.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.890
Or actually it's radius 5.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.150
So they're thinner than size 10.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.170
Alright?
And so, none of,

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.240
there's no place you can put that
disk down and have the pixel survive.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.740
Obviously, there's one Stretch
here that's thick enough, and so

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.910
that lead survives.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.550
So I make the radius bigger,
this thing, they all go away.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.860
And if I made the radius
even bigger yet,

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.300
what happens is all these leads go away.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.230
And also you notice this square
is shrinking by that amount

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.800
because the only place.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.440
That you can fit that inside
there is at this level, and

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.950
so, it's going to pull
away from the edges.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.700
So that's erosion.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.658
Now, as you saw, dilation fills holes
and stuff, but it grows your picture.

00:01:13.658 --> 00:01:17.310
Erosion removes little things
you might not want there, but

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.060
it shrinks your picture.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.370
I don't really want to grow or
shrink my cells.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.180
I just want to disconnect them.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.890
Not my cells, the cells in the picture.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.260
So I don't really want the things
to get bigger or smaller.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.820
I just want to clean them up.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.390
Well, so that should make you think
probably I could some eroding followed

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.340
by some dilating, or
some dilating followed by some eroding.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.470
And [LAUGH] you'd be exactly right.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.360
And those two operations are referred
to as opening and closing.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.890
And, I say here the two most useful
binary morphology operations.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.900
That is just one man's opinion.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.950
My humble, well okay, my not so

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.430
humble opinion that that's
probably the most important thing.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.760
And the only reason I say it's most
important, is in many systems that I've

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.960
worked on, a, down in the, in the guts,
somewhere we're doing some opening and

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.780
closing just to clean up our
binary images a little bit.
