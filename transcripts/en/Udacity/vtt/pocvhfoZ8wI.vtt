00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And now for the answer to our quiz.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Generally, anything you can measure can also be turned into post condition,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and if at some physical condition, then it's typically very easy.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The audio level must not exceed 80 db.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
While assuming we have a way to measure the audio level, which any descent

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
audio software should have, yup--this is easy to turn into a post condition.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Turn this into a post condition and you will save millions and millions of ears from damage.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Next thing, the animated catch should walk like a real cat. Ah, real cat.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If there ever is a specification of what makes a cat a real cat,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I would be very, very delighted to see that.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I'm pretty sure cats know precisely what to do and what not to do.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
For everybody else, that remain a mystery.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Under specific atmospheric condition, the sunset simulation shall produce a green flash.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Lo and behold, that's what a PHD student at my department did.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
He was specializing in computer graphics and his PHD thesis was perfect sunset simulation,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and indeed, in reality under specific conditions,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
you can have a green flash during a sunset for just a second.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I think this has been witnessed by only a few hundred people

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and only banned on film twice so far,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and well having green or some amount of green in an image--it's actually pretty easy to check.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So I am pretty sure he also had a post condition that were done and show that he was successful,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and finally response time shall be below 10 ms.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
That's straightforward. Time is something that's easy to measure.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
This can also become a simple post condition.
