00:00:00.037 --> 00:00:01.907
Okay, final quiz.

00:00:01.907 --> 00:00:07.178
What I've got here is a list of potential reasons why the dynamic parallel version of quicksort

00:00:07.178 --> 00:00:10.116
ends up more efficient than the CPU-controlled one.

00:00:10.116 --> 00:00:14.620
We've got more efficient partitioning of the data inside the sort.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.790
We've got launching on the fly from the GPU rather than returning to the CPU to do the launch.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.527
Simpler code, because the code is a lot shorter and easier to write,

00:00:23.527 --> 00:00:26.531
and greater GPU utilization.

00:00:26.531 --> 00:00:28.867
Remember, that GPU utilization is making sure that

00:00:28.867 --> 00:00:32.803
as much of GPU is busy doing useful work at any given time.

00:00:32.803 --> 00:00:40.112
So as long as you've got enough threads going on at one time to keep the GPU busy, you have high utilization.

00:00:40.112 --> 00:00:41.842
So check all the boxes that apply.
