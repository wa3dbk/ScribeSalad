00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.304
For this last question, I want you to find the number line that represents the

00:00:04.316 --> 00:00:08.633
answer, or the answer might be all real numbers, or none of these number lines

00:00:08.645 --> 00:00:12.951
are the answer. Type the letter of the answer in the box here. For example, if

00:00:12.963 --> 00:00:16.168
you think this is the number line, you'd write d in the box.
