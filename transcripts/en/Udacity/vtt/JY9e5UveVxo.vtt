00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.920
At this point we have our classes, our attributes,

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.740
what we're missing is the operations for the class.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.340
Let me remind you that operations represent the behavior

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.370
of a class, and that they may be found by

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.310
examining interactions among entities in the description of my

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.480
system. So once more, let's bring back our description, and

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.090
let's in this case focus on this specific item.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.330
That says that the students may use the system to

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.800
add courses. So this is clearly indicating an action

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.320
that the students should be able to perform. But notice

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.100
that this doesn't mean that this is an operation that

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.370
should be provided by the student's class. It rather means

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.860
that there should be, somewhere in the system, the possibility

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.080
of performing this operation. So let's see what this means

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.920
for our example. This might mean, for example, if we

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.400
focus on the RegistrationManager, so that there should be an

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.520
operation in the RegistrationManager that allows me to add

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.300
a student to a course. And this, in turn, means

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.270
that both Course and CourseOffering should provide a way to

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.140
add a student. And therefore, I add this corresponding operation

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.790
to the RegistrationManager, to the Course, and to the CourseOffering.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.020
So after doing that we will continue and populate in

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.080
a similar way, the other classes in the system. So

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.040
let me recap. Now we saw how to identify classes.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.300
How to identify members of the classes, and

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.910
particular attributes, and operations. There is one thing that

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.060
we're missing, a very important aspect of the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.140
class diagram which is the relationships between these classes.
