00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The final strong oracle I want to talk about

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is what I'm going to call a null space transformation.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is where we take a random test case or any test case, of course,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and we make some sort of a change to it that shouldn't affect how it's treated

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
by the software under test.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And so one thing we could do just as a trivial example

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
is we could start with a simple Python function.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This is the input to the null space transformation.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So here we have foo of a and b. It returns the sum of a and b.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And one possible null space transformation on this

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
would be to add a level of parentheses or maybe several.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This is a null space transformation because we've transformed the test case,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
possibly in a non-trivial way, although here we've done something pretty trivial,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but we've transformed it in such a way that we know that the meaning of the test case

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
shouldn't have changed.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So now we can do something very much like differential testing,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
but instead of taking the same program and running it through 2 implementations of Python

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
we're going to take 2 programs which are semantically identical

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and run it through the same implementation of Python.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And if that implementation of Python treats this differently--

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that is to say, it interprets this code in such a way that it returns some different answer--

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
then we've found a bug in it.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So of course we could always do things even more elaborate.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Here we're calling some sort of an identity function on a--

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that is to say, some function that is guaranteed to return the same value of a

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that it's called with, although of course that's not going to be apparent to the interpreter--

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and then instead of adding b to a, we're going to subtract -b from a.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So another little null space transformation.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I've heard of these kind of things.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I don't have any personal experience using null space transformations to find bugs,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
but I've heard of people doing this kind of thing, and apparently it can be useful.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So what have we done here?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
What we've done is seen that in realistic situations,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
there are a lot of potential oracles available for performing random testing.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And so the conventional wisdom--at least as it's expressed in that article

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
or that chapter on random testing--that oracles are almost never available

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I think is probably not right.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It's often the case that if we think about it for a while,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
that if we're potentially willing to invest some time in creating a good oracle,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
then we can very often find something to use for random testing.
