00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.750
One of the most interest things about using real data and then trying to fit

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.320
equations to it, is that it doesn't usually fit a single function perfectly. We

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.266
can find curves that approximate it, but it's probably not going to be a

00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:17.350
completely 100 percent perfect fit. So let's see how that fit changes,

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.340
depending on which points here we decide to base our function off of. Here, for

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.540
example is the graph that we would get if we used the first two points on our

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.690
chart to create and exponential graph. So what would this graph predict the

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.860
population to be in the year 2013? Considering the scale on our graph here, it

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.940
probably seems like it's pretty tricky to predict that. But luckily, Desmos is

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.810
here to help. You'll find a link to this exact graph in the instructor comments

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.200
on this question. Click on the link and then this graph will popup. Once it

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.970
does, you can take a mouse and touch a point on the curve. From there, you can

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.000
drag it, and select what x value you want. And from there, you can see what y

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.260
value corresponds to it. Remember that this graph measures the year on the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.870
x-axis, and it shows the world population in billions of people on the y-axis.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.860
Now once you figured out what this graph says, the population will be in 2013,

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.440
can you tell me if this is an accurate prediction? Think about what the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.200
population actually became by of year 2013, and see if this is the same thing.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.199
If you want to, you can also use Google to search for world population in 2013.
