00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.930
The second option is what we call an experimental study. Hidden in this one

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.490
sentence are aspects that are universal to all experimental studies we do in

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.710
psychology. Let's start with caffeine in varying amounts. Every experiment we

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.400
do, we have to manipulate or change something or else we cannot make a causal

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.270
statement from our result. So whatever it is that we manipulate or change is

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.200
our independent variable. So in this case caffeine is our independent variable

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.610
or iv for short because we're changing the amount of caffeine each group gets.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.832
An easy way to remember this is investigator starts with an i. An independent

00:00:39.832 --> 00:00:45.470
variable also tarts with an i and it's the investigator that manipulates the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.460
independent variable. And we measure the effect of our independent variable on

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.910
the dependent variable. The dependent variable in our experiment is reaction

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.620
time because a dependent variable is what we measure. We need to measure how

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.700
the dependent variable responds or changes to the independent variable. So how

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.800
does reaction time change when we manipulate caffeine? In order to make a

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.120
causal statement, we need to make sure that the iv or the independent variable

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.810
is what causes the change in the dependent variable. So in our case, we need to

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.519
know that caffeine is what actually causes the change in reaction time.
