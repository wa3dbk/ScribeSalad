00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.770
In the debugging demo, Ki, noted that the word hello, got truncated to hell.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.235
The place where text is set is in the constructor, so something must be wrong

00:00:08.235 --> 00:00:12.810
in this constructor. Let me set a break point to check it out. I just clicked

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.700
next to the line I want to stop on. Now, if I run the syllable counter, give it

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.034
hello yellow peach and hit Enter. It pops up my debugger, and my code shows the

00:00:22.034 --> 00:00:27.030
line that the debugger is stopped on. So far, not a whole lot has happened.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.229
We've just converted S to lower case and put it in text. I want to skip these

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.732
loops and get to the juicy part and figure out what they computed. So, I'll

00:00:35.732 --> 00:00:40.357
just single step until I get to the last line. Try that out. What will the

00:00:40.357 --> 00:00:45.620
local variables, i and j be equal to if you step all the way to this last line?

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.148
You'll really need to do this in BlueJ because the Udacity IDE doesn't have a

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:54.161
debugger. So, if you run syllable counter and enter hello yellow peach and then

00:00:54.161 --> 00:01:01.234
step to the last line of the constructor, what is the value of I? How about j?
