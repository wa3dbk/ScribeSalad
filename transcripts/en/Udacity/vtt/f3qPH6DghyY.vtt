00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.080
I claimed that prove, that the composition of two polynomial reductions was

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.210
polynomial. But why was that the case? Think carefully, and

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.875
give the most appropriate bound for the running time of the reduction R.

00:00:11.875 --> 00:00:17.258
Which is the composition of m. Which runs in time p. And N,

00:00:17.258 --> 00:00:24.030
which runs in time q. You can assume that both m and n read all their input.
