00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The next question on this homework is to implement login.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let me give you a demo of what this is going to look like.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I am at this URL\login.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
After doing the register portion of this homework, the first part, this is going to be very simple.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Basically, it's a similar form to the registration except it only has a username and password.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If you type in a valid username and password and hit submit,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
it redirects you to the welcome page.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It sets the cookie, and it takes you to the welcome page.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
If you were to type in an invalid password or a username that doesn't exist,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
you get an error message that says invalid login.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Only when you type in a valid username and password do you get redirected

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
to the welcome page. Mm-kay? Cool.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This welcome page has the same cookie that I had before.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
That gets set on a successful login.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
When you have this working, submit the URL here. Good luck with this one.
