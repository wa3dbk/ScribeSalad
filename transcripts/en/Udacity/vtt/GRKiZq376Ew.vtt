00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.350
We've come up with, as solutions to the equation, log base 10 of 5x plus log

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:11.750
base 10 of x minus 1 equals 2. Are x equals 5 and x equals negative 4.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.500
Something doesn't seem quite right here, though. What do you think would happen

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.439
if we substituted in either these values of , in the spots of x in our

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.480
equation. Would both of these inputs give values of our function that are

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.920
allowed? Think carefully about the domain of the log function. So which

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.833
solutions are correct?
