Hi, I'm Chris Pryby.

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.600
I'm a course developer with Udacity and

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.240
also former Georgia Tech
graduate student.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.560
I'll be presenting this course on linear
algebra designed specifically for

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.730
students of the OMS CS program.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.610
Since linear algebra is
the backbone of many techniques and

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.720
algorithms in computer science, we
wanted to provide a resource for OMS CS

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.160
students to learn or brush up on some
of the fundamentals of this subject.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.100
But instead of giving just another set
of lectures on this topic, we wanted to

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.790
put linear algebra in the context of
how you will use it in this program.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.040
In this course,
in addition to learning some theory,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.520
you will be implementing
the algorithms we discuss yourself.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.290
By the end you will have built your own
library of linear algebra functions.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.760
The only necessary background for

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.560
this course is knowledge
of a programming language.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.130
But some familiarity with
elementary algebra and

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.310
trigonometry will be helpful as well.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.860
I'm looking forward to this course and
I hope you are too.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.980
Let's go ahead and get started.
