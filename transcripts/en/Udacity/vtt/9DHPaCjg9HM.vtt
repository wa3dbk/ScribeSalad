00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.240
In this example,

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.939
we're going to be graphing school attendance over days of the school year.

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:09.710
You can see here our data represented as dates and

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.240
attendance in a tabular form, and if we try to apply the grammar of graphic and

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.350
apply a line plot aestethic to this data, we get the green line we see here.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.850
Can you think of an advantage of using a visual representation of

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.770
data as opposed to a tabular representation of data.
