00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.990
The correct answer and again, this might be a little bit subjective,

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.500
but I think in this case it's not very subjective.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.220
Is showing tractability is actually easier than showing intractability, and the reason for that is

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:21.360
that if you want to show that a problem has a polynomial time algorithm,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.980
then all you need to do is come up with that algorithm.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.050
Now, that might be very hard, but nevertheless, once you have found a single algorithm

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.140
for a problem that has polynomial running time, then you're done.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.150
You have shown that this problem is tractable.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.810
On the other hand, if you want to show that a problem is intractable--what you have to show is

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.120
any possible algorithm, so not only the algorithms that you can come up with,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.070
not only the algorithms that somebody else can come up--any algorithm that somebody

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.040
could come up with at any point in time must still have exponential running time.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:01.020
Just stating a single algorithm or even a hundred algorithms is not enough to show intractability.

00:01:01.020 --> 99:59:59.000
For that reason, I think show intractability is in a way much easier than showing intractability.
