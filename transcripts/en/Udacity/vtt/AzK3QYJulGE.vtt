00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.080
So here's how we relate the K-step
estimators that we just

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.580
talked about with TD lambda.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.500
So the idea is this, we're actually
going to be using a weighted combination

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.780
of all of the estimators for
any one of these TD lambda algorithms.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.710
And the weights are going
to look like this,

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.600
one minus lambda for
the one step estimator.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.030
Lambda times one minus lambda for
the two step estimator.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.440
Lambda squared times one minus
lambda for the three step estimator.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.900
Lambda to the K minus one times one
minus lambda for the K step estimator

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.340
and then all the way down to
the essentially lambda the infinity, but

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.840
of course that wouldn't,
literally doesn't get any weight.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.370
&gt;&gt; Wait, what's
&gt;&gt; Except, well, let's leave it at that

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.830
for now and then we'll explain why
that's an okay thing to say in a second.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:44.580
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.510
So, so far everything you said makes
sense except you haven't told me what

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.430
you're weighting exactly.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.810
&gt;&gt; Oh, so what we're going to
do is when we move the value,

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.080
when we change the value of a state,
we're going to

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.760
change it by all
the different estimators.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.360
All the different estimators
are going to give us their own

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.450
preferences to what we should
be moving the value toward.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.750
And we're just going to
take a convex combination,

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.760
a weighted combination of all of them.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.360
Each time that we do an update for
the value of a state.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.650
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.080
&gt;&gt; Now we don't literally get to lift
all these and update based on them.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.500
But equivalently this
is what we're doing.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.280
So there's a couple things
that we should probably check.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.695
One is we should probably make sure
that these weights sum up to one.

00:01:26.695 --> 00:01:29.080
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.230
&gt;&gt; So, how do we do that?

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.700
Let's see.
&gt;&gt; You write a summation?

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.800
Good idea.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.589
So the summation is the all
the different estimators from one

00:01:38.589 --> 00:01:41.931
to infinity of the weight
applied to that estimator,

00:01:41.931 --> 00:01:45.436
which this formula works for
all different values of K.

00:01:45.436 --> 00:01:50.630
For K equals one it's lambda to the zero
which is one times one minus lambda.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.920
So we can now factor out
the one minus lambda.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.590
As long as lambda's less than one,
we can use this as a geometric series.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.220
And we get one over one minus lambda,
and that's going to cancel with this one

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.420
minus lambda and so
the weights sum up to one.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.910
If lambda equals 1 though,
what happens then?

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.060
These are all zeros and

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.790
this infinity one is one to
the infinity which is just one.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.210
So when lambda is one we put all of
our wait on this last estimator.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.140
And what happens if lambda is zero?

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.909
Sp if lambda is zero in this case,

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.514
we get a weight of one on the first
estimator and zero on all the rest,

00:02:24.514 --> 00:02:27.240
which I'll write this way,
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.860
&gt;&gt; And when lambda is one we get zero
for all these except for the last one.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.490
Which let's say at least
in the limit would be one.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.380
So this is actually as we said
this is giving us TD(0) and

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.973
this is giving us TD(1).

00:02:44.973 --> 00:02:48.320
So if we just use lambda
in place of one and zero,

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.440
which works, then we get td lambda.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.507
But the important thing is for in
between values of lambda, like a half,

00:02:55.507 --> 00:02:57.740
or .3 or something like that.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.130
We actually get weights on
all of these to some degree.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.000
And it's combining all those
different estimators together.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.290
&gt;&gt; And that seems okay.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.590
Any good characterization of
what that weight looks like.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.973
So if lambda were equal to one-half, is
that exactly halfway between TD(0) and

00:03:14.973 --> 00:03:15.630
TD(1)?

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.700
&gt;&gt; Well, when lambda's a half,
what do our weights look like?

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.335
We get a weight of a half on this one.

00:03:19.335 --> 00:03:20.340
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.255
&gt;&gt; We get a weight of a half times
a half, or a quarter, on this one.

00:03:24.255 --> 00:03:25.240
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.260
&gt;&gt; We get a weight of a half
times a half times a half, or

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.570
an eighth, on this one.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:37.530
So we get this sequence of decreasing
weight, exponentially decreasing weight.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.520
Is that halfway between
these two things?

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.380
I don't know.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.160
I suppose you could define it to be.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.540
But it is just what it is.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.860
It's a combination of a whole
bunch of estimators together.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.400
&gt;&gt; Right.
That eventually gets to zero.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.090
&gt;&gt; Sure, but again, we're combining
the outputs of all these estimators.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.000
We're using whatever update they're
suggesting and moving a little bit

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.550
in the direction of the first one and
a little less in the direction of

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.850
the second one, a little bit less in the
direction of the third one and so on.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.310
So, yeah,
in the limit we're not actually doing

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.940
the e infinity estimator at all, but
that's okay because we're doing all

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.630
these estimators that
kind of lead up to it.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.680
So I don't know, does that help
you understand TD(lambda) better?

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.010
This is the way I think about it, is
to say well, it's a little bit hard to

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.130
interpret but what we're really doing is
doing a weighted combination of a bunch

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.640
of step estimators instead of this
sort of strange, continuous parameter.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.660
&gt;&gt; Well, I guess so.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.090
I mean, when I think about it the way
you put it I guess what you're saying

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.800
is, look, you could do one step look
ahead or you can do two step look ahead.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.010
Or you can go all the way into the end
of your episode which may last forever

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.200
and you can pick any of those.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.010
Or you can say each one of those
gives me some information and

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.460
I should just figure out
some way to combine them.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.650
And I can pick various ways for
combining them and I know particularly

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.880
know how to turn the way I combine
them into simple English sentence.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.970
But I am finding ways to combine various
ones of them and I should pick some

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.700
values of lambda that seems to work for
the problem that I care about.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.720
&gt;&gt; So here we go.
&gt;&gt; All right, so

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.420
now given that we don't actually have a
crisp characterization of what something

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.680
like lambda equals one or sorry, lambda
equals a half, really gives us in words.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.880
Why do we care about these
intermediate values?

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.680
So I'm going to make a transition and

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.370
talk about next what happens
empirically when you use TD lambda.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.870
&gt;&gt; Okay.
