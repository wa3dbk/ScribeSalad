00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:01.819
Hi there.

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:04.980
Welcome to our course on
deploying a Hadoop cluster.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.300
I'm Mat Leonard,
I'll be your instructor.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.670
These days companies collect massive
amounts of data, hundreds and

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.660
thousands of terabytes.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.440
Analyzing terabytes of data on one
computer is practically impossible.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.190
One simple analysis
job could take hours.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.520
A different approach is to spread
the data over a cluster of computers and

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.680
analyze it in parallel with Hadoop and
Map Reduce.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.620
In this first lesson,
you'll deploy a simple hadoop cluster.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.020
You wouldn't actually use this cluster
in a real production setting, but

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.140
it will help you understand
the Hadoop architecture.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.670
In later lessons, you'll use automated
methods to deploy larger clusters,

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.730
like you'd use in production.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.730
To complete this course, you'll need
a basic understanding of Hadoop and

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.050
HDFS, and
be able to write MapReduce programs.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.132
If you don't know about these,

00:00:51.132 --> 00:00:54.080
take our excellent Intro to
Hadoop course, then return here.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.430
Also you'll need to use Shell
commands such as SSH and

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.490
no terminal editor such as vim or nano.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.800
You can learn about these
in our command line course.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.670
Okay, let's get started.
