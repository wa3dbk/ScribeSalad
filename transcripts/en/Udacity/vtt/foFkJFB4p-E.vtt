00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.410
One specific example for the men's side
platform is the Google Display Network.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.820
The Google Display Network GDN is
a collection of over a million websites,

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.350
apps, videos, and
blogs that show AdWords ads.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.170
Basically these million plus sites are
using Google to help them offer their

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.160
page to monetize by
providing advertisers with

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.410
online real estate to advertise on.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.190
The Google algorithm will target
the ads to the appropriate audience

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.060
by ensuring that the ads
are relevant for the page content.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.740
Will do this matching based on the
keywords you select and other factors.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.400
This will give you a much wider audience
than just being in search results.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.130
&gt;&gt; With GDN,

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.400
you have the opportunity to fine tune
where you want your ads to be seen.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.290
Beyond selecting audience
based on key words,

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.770
you can choose topics to
narrow your audience.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.150
So for Abarkment we can choose to
focus on dog related websites or

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.110
pick a specific site like
one that sells pet supplies.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.530
Or we can block our ads from certain
sites that aren't relevant to what we

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.970
do, like a site that's dedicated
to hating dogs and loving cats.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.452
We can even focus on people who
have been to our site before and

00:01:08.452 --> 00:01:10.690
re target them when
they go to other sites.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.280
This is called remarketing and

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.320
you can find out more about
that in the instructor notes.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.210
&gt;&gt; It's called a display network.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.650
Because unlike Google search,
where you can use only text ads.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.330
Here you can display all types
of formats like text, image,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.410
interactive, and video ads.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.600
To learn more about this check
out the instructor notes.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.930
&gt;&gt; So with AdWords beyond Google search,
we can target the display network.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.150
And specifically for

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.920
mobile, you can capture the mobile
Google display network.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.700
So if you have a mobile website,
you can advertise and

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.650
with mobile text ads,
or mobile image ads,

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.680
that capture users that are browsing
different sites on their mobile phone.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.450
And they may see one of your ads and
decide to click on it and

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.610
go to your mobile site.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.180
So that's our regular mobile GDN,
Google Display Network,

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.150
that's more to drive users
to your mobile site.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.130
The other opportunity you have
is to drive app installs,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.200
and we recommend setting up a campaign
where you would target apps.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.150
So your ad would actually
show in other apps.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:25.300
So when a user is, for
example, using an app of maybe

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.120
you want to specify a certain category
in which you want to target users.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.390
So for example let's say,
I like to travel a lot.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.060
As a user, I might be on a lot
of different travel apps.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.300
Hotel apps, flight apps,
whatever it may be.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.960
But it's maybe I also
have a dog at home and

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.930
I need to make sure that I have
housing for my dog while I'm gone.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.890
Well then as a dog Airbnb business

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.670
you can target users
who are in travel apps.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.460
So that would be a type of
targeting you could set up.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.840
Find users who are you know
most likely to travel.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.230
And they're already
probably using travel apps.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.270
And then I want to target my
ad to show when they're using

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.430
one of those travel apps.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.170
So you can think about what's the best
type of targeting to capture that target

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.600
audience for you.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.450
So one thing that I'm really
excited about is AdWords just

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.920
released a new type of,
a new campaign type for

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.240
display targeting specifically for
app promotion.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.270
So, it's called
the Universal App Campaign, and

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.870
it's one of the easiest
campaigns you can set up.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.079
Which is why [LAUGH] I really like it.

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:43.470
All you need to do is link your app to
the campaign and say I want to drive

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.430
users to install my app and this is
my target and cost for install price.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.910
And then you really just type
up four different lines that

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.340
could be cycled through for the ad
created and then AdWords does the rest.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.230
They create the Add formats, and

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.950
then they then add words will
determine all of the targeting.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.080
The great thing about our
universal app campaign

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.930
is that it targets all the different
platforms that Google can offer.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.340
So that would include Google search and
Google Play,

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.589
but also the Google Display Network.

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:24.160
We were talking about it with
target all categories for apps.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.490
So you can have in app ads.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.020
And then, it also targets YouTube.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.930
Now, we haven't talked
about YouTube yet, but

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.440
let's say that you have a YouTube
video promoting your business.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.740
So you can drop that video
in this campaign, and

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.970
it will also start
targeting users on YouTube.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:42.950
So the great thing is,

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.590
it covers all the different bases,
it's a really easy set up.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.960
And it just drives downloads at
your target cost per install.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.950
So, it's a campaign that is easy to
set up and it knows what you want.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.570
Ideally, it's going to deliver that
within a couple weeks of testing.
