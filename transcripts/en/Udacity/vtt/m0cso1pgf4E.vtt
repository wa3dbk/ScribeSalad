00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.094
Let's keep our same ratio and this time look at using proportion and a table.

00:00:04.192 --> 00:00:08.290
So, the number of dimes to the number of quarters is still two to three. But

00:00:08.302 --> 00:00:12.545
this time I have 10 dimes in my hand. How many quarters am I holding? We could

00:00:12.557 --> 00:00:16.700
solve this problem by extending our table. I could keep adding two dimes and

00:00:16.712 --> 00:00:21.422
three dimes in each case. So I'd have 8 dimes, 12 quarters, and 20 coins in

00:00:21.434 --> 00:00:26.225
total. And then 10 dimes, 15 quarters, and 25 in total. So if I add 10 dimes,

00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:31.185
then that means I have 15 quarters. But, maybe there was a different way to see

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:35.687
this. If I take two dimes and if I multiply it by 5, then I also have to

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.553
multiply my quarters by 5. The same is true for the number of coins. I would

00:00:40.565 --> 00:00:45.299
have 5 times 5, which is 25. Ratios often have a multiplier. We take our

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:50.337
original ratio and multiply it by a number. So to get from 2 dimes to 10 dimes,

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:55.252
we multiply by 5. So to get a 3 quarters to 15 quarters we also multiply by 5.

00:00:55.363 --> 00:01:00.413
The number of the objects continue to increase, so I can have an n multiplier,

00:01:00.425 --> 00:01:05.750
any number, and this would be 2n. 3n and 5n. These expressions represent the

00:01:05.762 --> 00:01:11.215
number of coins for our dimes, our quarters, and our total, depending on our

00:01:11.227 --> 00:01:12.040
multiplier.
