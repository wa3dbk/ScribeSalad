00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.778
Now looking at the code we just wrote, what we really want to do is change this

00:00:03.778 --> 00:00:06.970
from querying the value of KEY.W to move-up, which is the actual game

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:13.160
information we care about. In order to do that, we need to bind keys to events

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.218
in our game engine like so. In order to enable this functionality, what you're

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:22.930
going to need to do is to modify the input manager class just a tad bit. First

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.352
thing, what you'll need to do is actually add a bind function. Now the bind

00:00:26.352 --> 00:00:29.250
function will need to take the key value, and attach it to the action, via the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.591
bindings dictionary value that we placed up here. Secondly, you'll actually

00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:36.693
have to modify your onKeyDown and KeyUp events, such that the keyCode actually

00:00:36.693 --> 00:00:40.950
modifies the state in the array. Now, we've left these two functions as

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.770
exercises for you to figure out. Good luck.
