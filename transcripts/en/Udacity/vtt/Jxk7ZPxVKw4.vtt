00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.550
So now we have seen that we really want to have a better predictor, but

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.750
the question is how. We have seen that the predict,

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.940
taken predictor computes the next PC as a function of the current PC,

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.700
by just incrementing it. So question is, if all we know is the current PC,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.100
is there any better function that we can use to form a better prediction

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.600
of what's coming next? And the answer is, if all you know is the current PC,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.080
then probably you cannot make much of a better prediction. It will help us,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.690
if we knew, is the instruction a branch. But we don't know that,

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.960
we're still fetching the instruction while we are making the prediction.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.690
Is this instruction going to be taken, as a branch? Again, we have no clue about

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.860
that. What is the offset field of the instruction? If this is a branch,

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.270
this is what will be added to the PC to form the target address if it's taken.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.280
But we don't know that either because we haven't fetched the instruction. So

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.540
really, we don't know for sure anything that might be really useful in

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.490
forming the [UNKNOWN] prediction. So it seems like it's hopeless, but it's not.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.840
So what do we know if we don't know anything for certain. What we do know

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.460
is what the current PC is. But we also know something about how that branch at

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.200
this PC was behaving in the past. And we can use that because it turns out

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.500
that branches tend to behave the same way over and over again. So really that

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.400
is what we can use. We don't know for sure what this branch is going to do but

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.750
we can know what it did the few previous times when it was executed.
