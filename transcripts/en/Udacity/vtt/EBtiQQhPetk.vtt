00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.038
We saw before that this absolute value function, g of x, equals 3 times the

00:00:04.038 --> 00:00:07.998
absolute value of x minus 2, does not have an inverse when we consider the

00:00:07.998 --> 00:00:14.975
entire domain, all the real numbers. But maybe if we apply some restrictions to

00:00:14.975 --> 00:00:19.676
the domain, we can make this function have an inverse. Considering each of

00:00:19.676 --> 00:00:23.456
these choices on its own, which of them would make the function g pass the

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:27.882
horizontal line test? Please note, that if you pick more than one choice here,

00:00:27.882 --> 00:00:30.486
that doesn't mean that we have to use both of those parts of the domain at the

00:00:30.486 --> 00:00:34.659
same time. We're just looking at these one by one.
