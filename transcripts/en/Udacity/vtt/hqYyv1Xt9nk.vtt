00:00:00.113 --> 00:00:05.144
NVIDIA is not only building high end, more expensive processors,

00:00:05.144 --> 00:00:08.814
like the couplers and like the GPUs you might buy for gaming,

00:00:08.814 --> 00:00:11.818
but it also really works very hard in the mobile arena.

00:00:11.818 --> 00:00:14.952
So how is GPU computing going to influence that?

00:00:14.952 --> 00:00:17.622
Well it's not in our current shipping products

00:00:17.622 --> 00:00:21.493
but the strategy will be available in the relatively near future

00:00:21.493 --> 00:00:25.463
is to have the same GPU from the top to the bottom of the line.

00:00:25.463 --> 00:00:29.669
So eventually you will have a Kepler GPU in the Titan supercomputer

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.970
and you'll have a Kepler GPU in your cell phone,

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:40.212
and you can apply the same programming models across that line and do GPU computing

00:00:40.212 --> 00:00:42.913
in your cell phone to the extent that it makes sense to do so.

00:00:42.913 --> 00:00:47.719
So where do you see the most interesting applications going for things that you carry in your pocket?

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.057
I think that the really compelling applications for mobile devices

00:00:52.057 --> 00:00:55.394
are in computational photography and computer vision.

00:00:55.394 --> 00:00:59.163
I think that photography is at this cusp of being completely transformed

00:00:59.163 --> 00:01:03.335
from something that you do primarily with lenses and optics

00:01:03.335 --> 00:01:05.503
to something you do primarily with computing,

00:01:05.503 --> 00:01:13.578
and a GPU is just a perfectly matched tool to basically do the type of image processing

00:01:13.578 --> 00:01:14.981
and signal processing you need,

00:01:14.981 --> 00:01:18.414
basically after you've collected a bunch of photons,

00:01:18.414 --> 00:01:22.086
to process them in a way to produce really compelling images.

00:01:22.086 --> 00:01:25.223
So that sounds fairly abstract, and I think this is a fascinating field.

00:01:25.223 --> 00:01:31.563
So can you give an example of something that maybe a GPU would help you do in this computational photography realm?

00:01:31.563 --> 00:01:34.833
Little low level things or like if you want to do high dynamic range images,

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:36.801
you'll actually acquire a set of images.

00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:39.437
Then there is a bunch of problems in composing them together.

00:01:39.437 --> 00:01:43.370
The camera may have moved slightly between the images, so they have to be registered.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.453
There may be objects moving in the images,

00:01:45.453 --> 00:01:48.144
so even if you registered the images, you have to back that object motion out

00:01:48.144 --> 00:01:52.482
to get the equivalent of a still photograph that was taken at one point in time.

00:01:52.482 --> 00:01:57.255
You may have what's called a rolling shutter, where because of the way the CCDs work

00:01:57.255 --> 00:02:00.287
you expose one line of the image at a time, and so that if there's any motion,

00:02:00.287 --> 00:02:02.660
that will produce sort of a wavy action in the photo.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.294
You, again, have to remove that.

00:02:04.294 --> 00:02:08.798
Then you want to do some processing of those images to remove noise and to enhance the image.

00:02:08.798 --> 00:02:12.784
And then finally to decide both when you acquired,

00:02:12.784 --> 00:02:15.671
what exposure times you wanted to get an optimal high dynamic range image

00:02:15.671 --> 00:02:18.710
and then how to combine those images into one final image

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.282
that basically you're given a limited gamut that you'll display on your display device.

00:02:24.282 --> 00:02:27.684
Gives the human who's viewing it the appearance

00:02:27.684 --> 00:02:33.058
of actually many orders of magnitude dynamic range, from the original collected image.

00:02:33.058 --> 00:02:36.228
So bright areas of the image look bright but not that bright.

00:02:36.228 --> 00:02:40.828
Not much, though. We want you to have that much dynamic range structures display that.
