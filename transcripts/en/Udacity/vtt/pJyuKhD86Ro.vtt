A less popular,

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:05.580
less frequently used structural diagram
is the composite structure diagram.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.065
This one is used for showing
the internal structure of a class.

00:00:09.065 --> 00:00:12.070
Of particular interest to
us are its interfaces.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.900
So on the left side of
the interior class here are two

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.480
horizontal lines coming out.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.650
The top one with the circle on the edge
of it is a Provides Interface.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.780
That's saying that this class
provides some capabilities to

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.040
the rest of the world.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.230
Under it is another line coming out and
this one with a semicircle that's open.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.000
This is a Requires Interface, that is,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.320
what does this class require
from the rest of the world?

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.110
You can then imagine having a variety
of classes that plug into each other.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.200
That is, a provides from one class plugs
into a requires from another class.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.440
This is one way of putting together
the pieces of a software architecture.
