00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.140
Now recall from a previous lesson where we actually looked at

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.950
the whole concept of how we can differentiate an image in x and y, and

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.690
use that to be able to compute, for example, a derivative of an image in x,

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.560
which is basically looking at how the columns, when I parse through this,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.440
can give me highlights, or where the maximal change is, and

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.910
in this it detects, for example, the edges here in this rectangle, and

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.670
of course, I could do the same, going row-wise in this instance, and we're

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.970
going columns in this one, and we can use that now look for maximum change,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.400
this one then from black to white, and in this one, of course, white to black.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.180
This shows you very nicely where the edges, or at least with

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.570
of gradient change is that we can actually use to compute things like edges.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.630
This was also showcasing a much nicer example, of looking at how we can do with

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.340
the zebra, and here you can notice that you see, basically, information on how

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.480
the gradients that is how rapid the change is as I traverse in this direction,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.070
and, also, if I traverse in this direction, so, in the columns and

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.700
in the rows, x and y.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.180
Basic concept that we now want to build on to be able to do much more with.
