00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.727
One useful way to represent a line is using the point slope form. If we know the

00:00:04.727 --> 00:00:09.389
slope of a line, and a single point that the line goes through, we can use this

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.088
formula to express the equation of a line. Let's say you have a line that goes

00:00:14.088 --> 00:00:18.684
through the point 4, 7 with slope of negative 3. What is the equation of that

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:19.069
line?
