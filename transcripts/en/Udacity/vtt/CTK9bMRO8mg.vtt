00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.570
Like lots of Web sites, Udacity uses jQuery.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.990
But what is jQuery actually?

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.280
What's its relationship to JavaScript?

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.310
I want you to find out for yourself.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.300
Open up your browser's JavaScript console on the Udacity website.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.290
Simply type jQuery and press Enter.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.210
Remember, case matters, so the Q has to be capitalized.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.749
What shows up? Do you see a function, an object,

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:29.690
something magical, or a non-JavaScript function?
