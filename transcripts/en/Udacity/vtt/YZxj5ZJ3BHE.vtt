00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So the answer is, it really does nothing.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It'll make the computer do some work when we call sum,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but there's no good reason to ever call this procedure.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It doesn't have a return, so it doesn't produce any output,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and it doesn't actually modify the value of the first input in any way that's visible to the caller.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It does modify the value of a inside sum,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but the caller can't actually see that.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Let's see that in the Python interpreter so we make sure we understand what's going on here.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We'll define sum to take those 2 inputs and have the body that assigns to a,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
the value a + b,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and we can try printing the result of calling sum.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Let's see if it can add 1 + 1.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
When we run this, what we'll see is the result is actually None.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The reason the result is None is, while the sum procedure doesn't actually return anything,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
so there's no value here.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Python uses the special value "None" to mean there's no value.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So that's not very useful.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We could pass in bigger numbers.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Whatever we pass in, will still get the result None because sum never returns anything.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.738
To make sure it's clear what's going on here,

00:01:09.738 --> 00:01:11.646
we're going to add some print statements to sum.

00:01:11.646 --> 00:01:16.769
Printing things out is actually a perfectly good and perfectly useful way to test your code

00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:18.538
to make sure that you understand what's going on.

00:01:18.538 --> 00:01:21.000
It's always a good idea to add print statements.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Sometimes we call this debugging.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
if the code has problems, adding print statements to see more what's going on

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
is a good way to figure that out.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Here I'm going to print that I've entered sum,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and I'll print the value of a, and I'll do the same thing again.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Now when we run it, we see that we "enter sum!"

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
When we enter sum, the value of a is 2.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
That was the value passed in as the first parameter.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The value of b is 123. That was what we passed in at the second input.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
When we print out the first print, a is 2.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
We see a is 2. We do the arithmetic. That changes the value of a.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So now running the same print, it prints out the value of a as 125.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Then we return, we have the result. The result is None.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
There's no output from sum, and that's what gets printed out.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So if we add a return statement to sum, now we have the original code that we had.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I've removed the print statements.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So we don't need to see those again.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
We have this, and now we've added a return statement.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.846
Now when we run this, we do get the value 125 because the output of sum

00:02:24.846 --> 00:02:31.000
is what's returned here, which is the result of a at this point, which is 2 + 123.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.323
The other thing I want to make clear without the return is that if we passed in variables for this,

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:38.708
it still does not change their value.

00:02:38.708 --> 00:02:43.000
Let's say we had a variable--I'll even use a.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
So I'm going to use the variable a. We'll initialize it to 2.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
We'll have the variable b. We'll initialize that to 123.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
We'll call sum. We still don't have the return, so it will return no value.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.415
Let's see if the value of a has changed at the end, and it hasn't,

00:02:59.415 --> 00:03:02.354
and the reason it hasn't is what gets passed in here--

00:03:02.354 --> 00:03:04.446
even when we have a complex expression,

00:03:04.446 --> 00:03:08.277
even when we use a name, or we have some calculation that produces the value--

00:03:08.277 --> 00:03:11.800
what gets passed in is the value that that evaluates to.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.000
So the fact that it was a name doesn't matter.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
When we call sum, what's getting passed in as the value of a is the value that a refers to,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
which is the number 2.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
We don't actually modify what the variable is.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.877
That's a totally separate variable.

00:03:25.877 --> 00:03:29.000
Let me draw what that looks like to make it clear what's going on.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Here we have our code.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So that introduced a name "a,"

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and it refers to the value 2,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and it introduced a name "b," and that refers to the value 123.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Both of those are numbers.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And we have our procedure that we defined like this.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.600
It takes the 2 inputs.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.238
It changes the the value of the input named a.

00:03:50.238 --> 00:03:54.754
We're going to call sum, passing in a and b.

00:03:54.754 --> 00:03:59.000
What happens when we call sum--we have these names here.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
The names are our parameters.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
We're going to have a name inside sum that's a.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
That is going to refer to whatever value is passed in here.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
So to know what the value is, we evaluate the name a. We get the value 2.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
This a will refer to the value 2.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
b will refer to the value passed in as b.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
It's going to be the number 123.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And then when we run sum, we do the assignment.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
That's going to produce the new number adding 2 + 123.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
We get the value 125, and then we do the assignment.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
The assignment changes what a refers to.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Now instead of referring to the number 2,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.000
the a that corresponds to the parameter to the procedure sum, now refers to the number 125.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.877
Note that the original value of a, the one that we named here, still refers to 2.

00:04:51.877 --> 00:04:57.554
When we come back from the procedure, so once we get to here, we return.

00:04:57.554 --> 00:05:00.000
We're back to running the code here.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.215
All of the parameters that were visible inside the body of sum,

00:05:05.215 --> 00:05:06.692
those are no longer visible.

00:05:06.692 --> 00:05:09.000
They were there for that execution, but they're done.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
We can't use those names anymore.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.800
They were only visible during that execution of the procedure.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.800
Now at this point, a refers to the number 2, just like it did before.
