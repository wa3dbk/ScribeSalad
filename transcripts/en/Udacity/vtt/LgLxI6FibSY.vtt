00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.019
Psychologists have looked in the all different types of problem solving.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:06.900
They've learned a thing or two about what helps and what hinders us in our

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.790
ability to solve problems. Now, before we get started in problem solving, I

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.830
want you to try this. Now, imagine you're in a room, and there's two strings

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.301
hanging from the ceiling. You can reach each string individually. But, the

00:00:20.301 --> 00:00:25.816
strings are too far apart for you to reach them both at the same time. What's

00:00:25.816 --> 00:00:31.790
also in the room is a set of pliers, like these. Now, if you had to connect

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.916
these 2 strings together, how would you do it.
