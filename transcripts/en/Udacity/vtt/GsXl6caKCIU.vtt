00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.708
Athena is ready to keep pushing forward with her understanding of acoustics to

00:00:03.708 --> 00:00:08.378
help out with Concert Hall design. As before, she's still pretty concerned with

00:00:08.378 --> 00:00:12.018
how well audience members will be able to hear the music from different places

00:00:12.018 --> 00:00:17.892
in the concert hall. Now, however, she's worried about Reverberation time. This

00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:22.276
is basically how long a sound echoes for after it's been produced. Athena has

00:00:22.276 --> 00:00:26.535
figured out a simplified equation for reverberation time in the hall. The

00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:34.250
equation is, T equals 0.322 V over A. Here, T stands for Reverberation time, V

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.938
is the volume of the hall, and A is the surface area of the hall. So, to figure

00:00:39.938 --> 00:00:43.708
out the reverberation time then, Athena is going to need to find the volume and

00:00:43.708 --> 00:00:49.172
the surface area of the room. On this diagram of the hall, I've written in the

00:00:49.172 --> 00:00:53.648
dimensions of each of the sides. It's not super important right now what x

00:00:53.648 --> 00:00:58.724
stands for but just so you know, it's the depth of the stage back here. This is

00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:03.185
how long x is. Considering each of these lengths, what is the volume of our

00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:04.688
concert hall?
