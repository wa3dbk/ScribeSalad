00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.242
In the early '90s, CD-ROM's burst onto the scene starting first with computers

00:00:03.242 --> 00:00:07.440
and then actually moving to consoles. Of course, with it became larger asset

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.894
sizes as well as increased load times. See, the medium of actually getting data

00:00:11.894 --> 00:00:15.478
off of a CD-ROM was much slower than cartridge counterparts were for earlier

00:00:15.478 --> 00:00:20.194
game systems. This means for the first time in history, game developers are

00:00:20.194 --> 00:00:23.596
actually forcing users to stare at a very, very boring screen that just told

00:00:23.596 --> 00:00:28.460
them content was loading. This of course was because the assets took time to

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.832
get into memory and they weren't being streamed of disc fast enough. More

00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:35.048
importantly, game developers didn't really have the proper knowledge of how to

00:00:35.048 --> 00:00:38.842
work around this problem. Most of the architectures back then were

00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:41.866
single-threaded, which meant all the file iO was actually synchronous, or

00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:44.986
blocking, so they had to come up with very, very tricky mechanisms to load data

00:00:44.986 --> 00:00:50.556
and render that little UI. Now for grits we run into the same problem. If a

00:00:50.556 --> 00:00:53.076
user is on a very, very slow connection, it's actually going to take a lot of

00:00:53.076 --> 00:00:56.938
time to stream that data in. For our purposes we actually employ an

00:00:56.938 --> 00:01:00.953
asynchronous asset loading methodology. Which means we can actually render

00:01:00.953 --> 00:01:03.989
things to the screen, while actually pulling data in from the net. And that's

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.030
what we're going to talk about here in just a bit.
