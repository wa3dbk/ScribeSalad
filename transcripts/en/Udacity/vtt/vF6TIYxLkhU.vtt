00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.469
Here you see the composition
of these adopters.

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:07.660
As you might expect, younger providers
are more likely to adopt but

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.010
the difference isn't striking.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.950
What is striking and
has been in all prior studies,

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.730
is the difficulty smaller
practices have in adopting.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.090
Presumably due to the lack of financial
as well as technical resources,

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.290
since many of these are in rural,
poor, under served areas.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.630
ONC funded a special Regional Extension
Center Program to provide special help

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.340
to these providers.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.630
Note, as well, that practice ownership
can be a significant factor.
