00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.400
In the multithreaded DAG model,
you represent a parallel computation by

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.560
a directed acyclic graph or
a DAG, like this one.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.460
Each vertex is an operation, like a plus
or an addition or a function call or

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.740
a branch.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.030
The directed edges show you how
operations depend on one another,

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.600
where the sinks depend on the sources.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.710
So this would be a sink and
this would be a source.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.190
And this would say that c depends
on the output or result of b.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.900
Now to keep things simple, I'll always
ask you to assume that there's exactly

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.250
one starting vertex and one exit vertex.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.560
So, in this example,
here's the start and here's the exit.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.760
And of course, if you have a DAG and
there are no such vertices,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.040
the start and exit ones,
it's pretty easy to add them.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.430
Now, suppose we have a PRAM machine and

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.210
you want to use it to
run the computation.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.320
You start by trying to find any
operations that are ready to go.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.340
That is, all of their input
dependencies are satisfied.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.300
So, in this example,
take a look at the starting vertex.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.030
That one's ready to go.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.640
Since it's ready to go,
meaning it has no dependencies.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.240
We can assign it to any processor that's
free, and go ahead and start executing.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.200
So here, I've assigned starting
vertex s to processor three.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.040
And processor three will
start executing it.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.610
Now, as soon as a processor
finishes its operation,

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.050
it enables any of its
successors to begin.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.820
So, in this example,
a and b only depend on s.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.460
So as soon as s is finished,
a and b can start.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.110
So now, a and b are ready to go.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.990
So we can look for any free processors
and assign a and b to them.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.520
So, for example, it looks like processor
one and processor three are free.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.050
So let's assign a and b to them.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.980
Now, when processor one and processor
three finish their units of work,

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.135
then that will enable other successors.

00:01:51.135 --> 00:01:55.985
In this case, vertices c and d, and this
process will repeat until we finish.

00:01:57.025 --> 00:02:00.665
Now, at every step of the computation,
this problem of how to take free units

00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:04.535
of work and assign them to processors
is called a scheduling problem.

00:02:04.535 --> 00:02:07.985
Scheduling is a huge topic and
you will hear more about it soon enough.

00:02:09.435 --> 00:02:12.040
Given a DAG and a PRAM,
here's a question.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.790
How long will it take to run the DAG?

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.660
To answer this question,
you need a cost model.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.150
For now, I'm going to use a cost
model that makes three assumptions.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.170
The first assumption is that all
processors run at the same speed.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.750
The second assumption is that each
operation takes one unit of time.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.610
And the last assumption is that
these edges don't have any

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.170
cost associated with them.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.110
So let's start with
these assumptions and

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.180
let's apply them to some sample DAG's.
