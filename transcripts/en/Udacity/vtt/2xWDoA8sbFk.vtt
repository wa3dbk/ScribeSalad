00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.786
There are quite a few materials that are nearly diffuse reflectors such as rough

00:00:04.786 --> 00:00:09.191
wood, newspaper, concrete, and mouse pad. However, a considerable number of

00:00:09.191 --> 00:00:13.755
surfaces are shiny or glossy. We call these specular materials. Examples include

00:00:13.755 --> 00:00:18.263
polish metals, plastics, polish wood, glass, glazed ceramics, and enamel paint.

00:00:18.263 --> 00:00:23.015
These materials look different when you view them different angles, so we need

00:00:23.015 --> 00:00:27.754
to take into account the direction from the surface to the eye. One standard way

00:00:27.754 --> 00:00:31.780
of simulating specular materials is called the Blinn-Phong Reflection Model

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.656
named after its inventors, Jim Blinn and Bui Tuong Phong. The full model has a

00:00:35.656 --> 00:00:38.971
number of terms in it for self-shadowing and for a shininess factor called the

00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:43.760
Fresnel coefficent. But the simplest and most common form is this. Specular

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.163
equals the maximum of N dot H or 0, whichever is larger, raised to a power. N is

00:00:50.163 --> 00:00:55.275
the surface normal, same as with diffuse material. H is called the half angle

00:00:55.275 --> 00:00:59.452
vector. Say, you're given a surface, a light source direction, and a viewer

00:00:59.452 --> 00:01:04.998
direction. How would you point a mirror so that the light reflected directly

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:09.398
toward the viewer? The answer is the half angle vector, which is the vector

00:01:09.398 --> 00:01:13.920
halfway between these two directions, so that these two angles are equal. If the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.616
surface normal and the half angle are identical, then the surface is perfectly

00:01:17.616 --> 00:01:21.670
aligned to reflect light to the eye. So, N dot H would be 1, and all light is

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.080
reflective. As the normal and the half angle diversion direction, N dot H

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.274
becomes smaller. Once the angle between these vectors is 90 degrees, the

00:01:32.274 --> 00:01:37.474
contribution goes to 0. The maximum function here limits the inputs so that this

00:01:37.474 --> 00:01:41.075
value is never negative. We want to avoid it being negative because we're about

00:01:41.075 --> 00:01:45.126
to raise it to a power. The S factor here is the shininess or specular power,

00:01:45.126 --> 00:01:49.094
and has a range from 1 to infinity, though anything above 100 is not too much

00:01:49.094 --> 00:01:53.960
different. When you raise a fraction to a power, the result is smaller, and

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.098
smaller still the higher the power. For example, 0.5 squared is 0.25, cubed, is

00:02:00.098 --> 00:02:04.978
0.125, and so on. By raising this term to a higher power, the object appears

00:02:04.978 --> 00:02:09.247
shinier. We can see this in the graph of N dot H versus the specular intensity.

00:02:09.247 --> 00:02:13.408
As the cosine power rises, the slope becomes tighter and tighter and gets

00:02:13.408 --> 00:02:17.442
sharper. What the half angle represents is the distribution of microfacets on a

00:02:17.442 --> 00:02:21.836
surface. A microfacet is a way of thinking how a material reflects light. For

00:02:21.836 --> 00:02:26.230
example, a fairly smooth surface may look like this. Light coming in from one

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.038
direction will bounce off the surface mostly in the reflection direction. A

00:02:30.038 --> 00:02:34.068
rougher surface will a lower shininess has a distribution of facets more like

00:02:34.068 --> 00:02:37.974
this and the light will still go in the reflection direction, but with a much

00:02:37.974 --> 00:02:41.850
wider dispersal. At this point, it's best for you to try out the specular power

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.688
function and see how it responds. An example program that follows, you control

00:02:45.688 --> 00:02:49.760
the ambient, diffuse, and specular contributions. Try playing with the shininess

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.843
and other controls to see their effects.
