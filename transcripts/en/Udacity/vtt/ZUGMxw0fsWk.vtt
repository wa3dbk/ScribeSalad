00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.054
So let's at the solution to our mesh versus

00:00:03.054 --> 00:00:06.170
bus throughput quiz where we had four cores with a

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.546
totally random and even distribution of traffic among the cores.

00:00:10.546 --> 00:00:13.700
We are given what each core is sending, we are

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.763
getting what the bus can do and what the link in a mesh can do, and now we are

00:00:18.763 --> 00:00:21.751
asked how much faster is it on the bus versus

00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:25.886
on the mesh. Our bus cannot sustain the 40 million

00:00:25.886 --> 00:00:29.166
messages per second, that the cores are trying

00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.663
to give it. So the cores are really

00:00:31.663 --> 00:00:34.501
going to slow down to half of their speed,

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:37.769
so that the bus bandwidth demand matches what

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:43.195
it can provide. So on the bus, we get 2x the execution time that each core

00:00:43.195 --> 00:00:46.940
is capable of providing. On the mesh, we

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.750
can support 20 million messages per second per link.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.120
So now the question is, do our links get

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.390
saturated? So let's see what we get on a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.120
mesh like this in terms of traffic. Each core

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.960
is generating 10 million messages, 3.3 million are going

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.732
to each other core. So of the 10 million

00:01:06.732 --> 00:01:09.692
messages sent here, one third are going to this

00:01:09.692 --> 00:01:12.800
core, one third are going through this link, and

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.000
then one third are going here. Let's say that one

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.990
sixth go this way, one sixth go this way. So

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.610
this link will be used for one sixth of the messages

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.890
sent by this core. And this one for another one sixth.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.460
And then we add one sixth to each of these, which

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.690
brings us to one half of 10 million messages. So now

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.070
we are done with this core. What happens from this core?

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.860
Same thing. This link gets one half of the messages. One

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.304
third are going here. One sixth are going here. So this

00:01:41.304 --> 00:01:45.063
link suffers one half of this traffic again. Now

00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:48.248
this link gets one half of the traffic from

00:01:48.248 --> 00:01:51.433
this core and these two links get one sixth

00:01:51.433 --> 00:01:54.663
each. And now we're done with this core. Now what

00:01:54.663 --> 00:01:57.354
happens when this core is sending, one half of

00:01:57.354 --> 00:02:00.600
the message go this way, one half go this way.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.156
One sixth of them go through this link, and

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:06.362
one sixth go through this link, done with this core.

00:02:06.362 --> 00:02:13.320
And finally, this core sends messages, half here, half here, and then one sixtth

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.610
here and one sixth here. Now we are done with this core. So as you can see, our

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.200
links are actually evenly used. Each of them

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.840
gets two times one half plus two sixths.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.481
So we get one and one third times the traffic generated by one core. That was

00:02:31.481 --> 00:02:36.130
what the one half was off. The traffic from one core is 10 million messages a

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.947
second. So we're really getting 10 plus 3.3.

00:02:40.947 --> 00:02:45.000
So this is 13.3 million of messages per second.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.140
Which is available on, on our mesh. So

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.804
the mesh doesn't slow down the processors. So really

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:54.144
the speed up of using the mesh versus

00:02:54.144 --> 00:02:56.562
the bus is two because the bus requires the

00:02:56.562 --> 00:02:58.590
cores to slow down so that it can

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.030
support the traffic that they are generating. While the

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.690
mesh allows the cores to proceed at full speed

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.610
at 10 million max messages per second. And still

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.740
have some traffic left over. If we went to

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.364
a larger net and then four cores the bus

00:03:15.364 --> 00:03:19.054
will have to proportionately slow down while the mesh

00:03:19.054 --> 00:03:21.596
would get more links, and it will be a

00:03:21.596 --> 00:03:24.302
while until any of the mesh links become

00:03:24.302 --> 00:03:27.887
saturated. So clearly, the mesh is far superior

00:03:27.887 --> 00:03:32.570
to the bus in terms of the traffic it can support when we go to more cores.
