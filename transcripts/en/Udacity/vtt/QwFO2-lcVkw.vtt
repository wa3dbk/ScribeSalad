00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.120
So first off we want to assign the components to layers. And

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.180
it turns out that our simple rule, having events at the bottom and

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.920
percepts at the top won't quite work for the TextBrowser. Both the ViewPort and

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.920
the ScrollBar handle events and provide percepts. So they both can't be at

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.440
the bottom. And they both can't be a the top. So for the purpose of illustrating

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.830
the layered architecture, we will arbitrarily play the ViewPort on the top.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.710
Its percept is the most central one to the, to the user.
