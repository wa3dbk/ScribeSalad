00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.592
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

00:00:02.592 --> 00:00:05.497
This lesson is going to start
a whole unit on motion.

00:00:05.497 --> 00:00:08.747
Now, in the real world,
things really move, you know,

00:00:08.747 --> 00:00:12.290
wind trees blow in the wind,
boats move along the water.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.952
A baseball player swings his bat and
typically misses if he wi,

00:00:15.952 --> 00:00:17.410
if he plays for the Mets.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.470
But, you know,
things are moving all the time and

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.850
our perception system handles them.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.610
In Computer Vision, we also want to deal
with motion, but what's kind of cool is,

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.636
actually, nothing is moving.

00:00:30.636 --> 00:00:33.797
What you're seeing here is
a repeated GIF image, and I've,

00:00:33.797 --> 00:00:36.338
I've made it sort of
coarsely sampled actually,

00:00:36.338 --> 00:00:39.233
it's from some slides stolen
from some folks listed below.

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:45.680
So that you can see that it's
actually a sequence of static frames.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.830
Okay?
And, you know, of course,

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.820
the issue is that when we look
at them when they're not so

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.060
separated in time by quite so
much we see this nice motion.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.160
And what we would like is, that the same
perception of motion that we have,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.398
we'd like to be able give the machine.

00:01:01.398 --> 00:01:04.319
We'd like a machine to be able
to understand the notion of

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.000
motion, if you will.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.060
So, when we're going to
talk about motion.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.150
Here, we're going to start
talking about video.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.800
Now, really, we're just thinking
about a sequence of frames.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.580
And, in fact, a long time ago, we used
to just called them sequences because

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.760
a camera would go and then a camera
would take another picture.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.120
And then, some time later, would take
another picture, another picture.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.853
And the question was, how to use those.

00:01:24.853 --> 00:01:29.690
These days, of course, much more
ubiquitous, is a notion of video where

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.153
a sequence is captured over time,
usually, relatively quickly.

00:01:34.153 --> 00:01:39.810
So things can't change a whole lot
from one sequence sample to the next.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.710
And usually taken at regular intervals,
whether it's every 30 hertz, 60 hertz,

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.420
24 hertz, the idea is that
it's at regular intervals.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.540
Now, our image is no longer
a function of just space, x and y.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.500
But our image is a function of space x,
y, and time, t.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.280
So our signal is I of x, y, and t.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.780
But as I said before,

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.100
sometimes when we describe them as
three dimensional function like this.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.804
We tend to think of the, all three
dimensions as being the same, but

00:02:07.804 --> 00:02:08.930
they're not.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.380
Space is quite different than time, so,

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.630
if I wearing a nice checkered shirt
instead of this gorgeous green.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.620
As I moved in space, you would
see pixels changing very quickly

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.710
in terms of their
intensity of their color.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.520
But, if I were to change
the pixels that quickly in time,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.410
you would essentially see a mess,
you would see all this flickering and

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.980
things changing very rapidly.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.830
So in general, even thought we think of
these as a three dimensional function,

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.940
remember that time and space are
different in terms of their statistics
