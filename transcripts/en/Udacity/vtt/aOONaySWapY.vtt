00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.480
Hope to set up tracking and
goals with Google analytic.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.000
The first step would be to gain a code
from Google Analytic that will let it

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.970
execute on your website.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.660
The best way to do it is to go
to Google Analytic Website, and

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:23.710
click on the Admin section then you
could click here and add a new account.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.290
You could choose here between
a Website to your Mobile app.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.952
Give it a meaningful name like demo1.

00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:39.271
In my case it will be Ido's project.

00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:41.640
And let's give it a URL.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.092
And from here of course,

00:00:43.092 --> 00:00:47.230
you need to decide in which
category you are going to be.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.440
In our case it's Internet,
the Time Zone, and

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.520
some other aspects of the data
sharing that you're going to do.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.420
And by clicking getting tracking ID
you're basically accepting of course,

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.330
the terms of use of Google Analytic.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.140
And after you accept them
you'll get the tracking code.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.860
Here it is.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.770
With the right information,
how to put it on your website.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.039
Once we do this preliminary phase,
we can jump into setting up our goals.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.150
The first way to set goals is
because goals are very versatile way

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.810
to measure how well our site or
app fulfills target objectives.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.980
You can set up individual goals for

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.773
discreet actions like, how many
users reach out our thank you page?

00:01:35.773 --> 00:01:39.657
What are the top exlending pages?

00:01:39.657 --> 00:01:43.450
What are the bounce rates on each one?

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.980
Where do people interact with the site?

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.480
Let's take for example,
my own site and set up a goal.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.690
I'm clicking on the Admin to
get into the Admin tab and

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.800
then I'm clicking on Goals.
