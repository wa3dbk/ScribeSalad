00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:07.032
Now, when we have a character followed by a star or a question mark, that's the hardest part, let's save that for last.

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:12.599
Now let's consider the final case--and the final case is when we know that the pattern is not empty,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.799
and we know that we've gone through all the special characters. So the first character is not a special character,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.799
except maybe it's a dot, because we haven't dealt with dot yet.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.132
And so we want to match the first character, and then we want to match the rest of the pattern,

00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:30.299
whether that's empty or whether it's something more.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.399
So what I'm going to do is invent a new function that I call match one, and that matches a single character,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:45.299
and we want to return "true" if that single character which is the first character of the pattern matches against the text,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.666
and if we can recursively match the rest of the pattern against the rest of the text.

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:56.532
So this is saying, "We don't have a special character here, except maybe a dot,"

00:00:56.533 --> 00:01:02.599
and so we have like b followed by a, we want to match the b against the text,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.566
and then we want to match the A against something else.

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:15.500
So fill in for me here what I should be matching against to match the rest of the pattern against the rest of the text.
