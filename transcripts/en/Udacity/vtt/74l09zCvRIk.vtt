00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now to show off how insanely great memo is,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
we'll want to have before and after pictures, showing the amazing weight loss of a model

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that was fat before and was thin after applying memo.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Oh! Wait a minute. It's not weight loss. It's time loss that we're going to try to measure.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We want to show that before, we have a function f, and that's going to run very slowly,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
making us sad.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And after, we have a function memo of f, and that's going to run very quickly,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
making us happy.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Now we could do that with a timer and say it took 20 seconds to do this

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and .001 seconds after,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but instead of doing it with timing, I think it's a little bit more dramatic just to show the number

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
of function calls, and I could go into my function and modify it to count the number

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
of function calls,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but you could probably guess a better way to do that.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I'm going to define a decorator to count the calls to a function because I'm probably

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
going to want to count the calls to more than 1 function as I'm trying to improve the speed

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
of my programs.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So it's nice to have that decorator around.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So here's the decorator countcalls,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
you pass it a function, and this is the function that it returns.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It's going to be a function that just increments entry for this function in a dictionary callcounts.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Increment that by 1 and then go ahead and apply the function to the arguments

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and return that result.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We have to initialize the number of calls to each funciton to be 0,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and that's all there is to it.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So here I've defined the Fibonacci function.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Through cursive function it calls itself twice for each call, except for the base case.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I can count the calls both with and without the memoized version.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So I'm going to do before and after pictures--before and after memoizing.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So here's before.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I have the values of n and a value computed for Fibonacci number of n,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
the number of calls created by countcalls, and then I have the ratio

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
of the number of calls to the previous number.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
We see the number of calls goes up by the time we get up to n = 20.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We got 10,000 calls.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
We can scroll down, and by the time we're up to n = 30,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
we have 2.6 million calls.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And here's the after.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Now we've applied the memo decorator.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Now the number of calls is much more modest.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Now at 20, we're only at 39 calls, and at 30, we're at 59 calls rather than 2.6 million.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So that's pretty amazing weight loss to go from 2.6 million down to 59,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
just by writing 1 little decorator and applying it to the function.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Now just as an aside here, and for you math fans in the audience,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I'm back to the before part. This is without the memoization.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
This number here in this column is the ratio of the number of calls for n = 30

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
to the number of calls for n = 29.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
You can see that it's converging to this number 1.6180.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Math fans out there, I want you to tell me if you recognize that number.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Do you think it's converging to 1 + square root of 5 / 2,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
25.888 / 1600,

00:03:00.000 --> 09:59:59.000
or the square root of e?
