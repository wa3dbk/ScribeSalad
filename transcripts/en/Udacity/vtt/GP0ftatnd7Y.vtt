00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.666
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; These equations are not in slope-intercept form so it would be pretty tough

00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:07.547
to use graphing. We'd have to do a lot of rearranging and then plot points. If

00:00:07.547 --> 00:00:11.264
we were graphing, we could have also made tables, but that could take a lot of

00:00:11.264 --> 00:00:14.955
work, too. So, I'm going to take out graphing. If we want to use substitution,

00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:19.081
we need one of the equations solved for one variable. This one is almost solved

00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:23.223
for x. All I would need to do would be to subtract 3 from both sides. Then, I

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:27.428
could perform substitution. So, x could equal 2y minus 3 and now, I'd be ready

00:00:27.428 --> 00:00:31.910
to substitute this in to my first equation for x. That's a pretty great choice.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.271
If you were leaning towards elimination, you might have thought to multiply the

00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:41.099
second equation by negative 5. If we distribute the negative 5, we would get

00:00:41.099 --> 00:00:46.131
negative 15 minus 5x minus 10y. Now, we could add these equations together. I

00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:51.029
would want to switch the places of these two terms so that way I could add my x

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:55.723
terms together more easily. Now, I'm actually ready to do elimination. And I

00:00:55.723 --> 00:00:59.889
would get negative 4y minus 15 equals negative 10y plus 9. Notice I can't

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:04.515
combine these, because their not like terms. This has a y and this doesn't. This

00:01:04.515 --> 00:01:09.045
also has a y and this doesn't. This isn't so great with elimination. I'm having

00:01:09.045 --> 00:01:13.885
to do a lot of steps, and I'm having to reorder a lot of terms. So, that's why I

00:01:13.885 --> 00:01:16.730
think substitution is the best here.
