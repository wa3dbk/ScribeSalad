00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.970
Now, the first 1 is actually quite trivial; so first of all, vertex cover is a minimization problem,

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.210
so we're looking for a vertex cover that is as small as possible.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.080
Now, if the algorithm already finds one with 100 vertices,

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.790
then that means, in an optimum solution, there cannot be more than 100 vertices.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.300
Because we already know that there's a vertex cover of that size,

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.490
the optimum solution might be smaller, but it will certainly not be bigger.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.290
Now here comes the interesting part. So we just said vertex cover

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.960
is a minimization problem, which means if you have a factor-2 approximation algorithm,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.040
then the solution that we found, and we found a solution with 100 vertices,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.960
is ≤ 2 x the size of an optimum solution.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.520
Which means if you solve this equation, that the optimum

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.010
is at least as big as 100/2, or 50.

00:00:47.010 --> 99:59:59.000
So the minimum number of vertices in an optimum solution is 50.
