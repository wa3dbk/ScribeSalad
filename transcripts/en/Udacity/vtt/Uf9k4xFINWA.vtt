00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.820
Here's an example of an HL7 version two,
EDI/X12 formatted message.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.210
A lab test result as it might be
sent back to the ordering physician.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.310
The OBX line is the most interesting
part since it contains the test results.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.866
Any idea what 1554-5 is?

00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:26.774
What about 182|mg/dl?

00:00:26.774 --> 00:00:29.798
Or 70_105?

00:00:29.798 --> 00:00:33.010
Here's the same message in XML.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.240
While it's still not as obvious
as something designed just for

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.690
human reading,
it is much clearer that 1554-5 is a code

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.730
LN is the abbreviation for loin,

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.910
and 70 and 105 are the low and
high values.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.470
And, at least by inference,
182 is the result for this patient.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.760
So H must mean the result is high.
