00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.620
The lower estimate, which comes from our red graph here, is 5.1 billion people.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:13.180
And our upper estimate, which comes from this blue curve, is 36.1 billion.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.110
There's such a huge difference between these two estimates, that I think if we

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.911
think about all the different factors that affect world population, we can see

00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:25.370
why. There's so many things that influence the number of people in the world.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.040
For example, we've seen an increase in world population due to decrease in

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.220
death rates, as people live longer because of better health care. In the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.330
future, we have no idea what's going to happen. Maybe a pandemic will wipe

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.355
everyone out. Or maybe we'll have food shortages due to climate change. Or

00:00:42.355 --> 00:00:47.330
perhaps advances in science mean an abundance of food and longer average

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.468
lifetimes. Who knows? If you're interested in this, and I personally think it's

00:00:52.468 --> 00:00:56.520
a pretty fascinating topic, go to the forums and talk about this with your

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.710
fellow classmates. I think what this illustrates is that even though we can

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.709
make models, making a long term predictions, especially based on just

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:09.940
equations, can be pretty difficult. It's still, however, worth discussing.
