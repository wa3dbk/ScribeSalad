00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.610
To figure this out, let's have a look back at our picture from before.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:11.000
We said that in a set formula each clause must be satisfied and set this is kind of similar

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.650
to the requirement that each city must be visited at least once.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.330
This would suggest to add some additional vertices to the picture that represent clauses.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.340
So let's say we have one vertex here that represents clause #1

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.970
and another vertex here for clause #2 and so on.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:35.520
What we could say is that visiting this vertex here represent satisfying that clause and then of course,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.180
we need to make sure that we can only visit the city here if the corresponding variable

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.560
or if one of the corresponding variables of that clause is satisfied in the right way.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:52.110
What about a construction that looks like this--I connect the vertex that represents the clause

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.990
to this one here and I connect it to this vertex here and I connect it to this vertex here.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.160
What I would like you to think about now is the following, there are 2^n shortest paths

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.300
between A and B if we do not regard this vertex here.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.830
If we do not have clause 1 and I realize it's not the best name for that vertex but that's okay.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.290
If we have to visit this vertex here, so it's now become part of our graph.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.100
How many shortest paths from A to B do you have then that visit all vertices.

00:01:23.100 --> 99:59:59.000
Is it still 2^n, is is 2^n⁺¹, or is it 2^n⁻¹.
