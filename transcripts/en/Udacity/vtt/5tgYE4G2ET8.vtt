00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
If we sum all of those up, you get 50, so the mean is 5.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The mean is always precisely determined.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The median is a bit more difficult to compute.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If you sort the numbers, you get this sequence here.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Both the 3 and the 4 sit in the center,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
so I accept both as valid answers, either 3 or 4.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The mode in this case happens to be 9.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
But realize had there been one fewer 9,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
there would have been other candidates for the mode as well.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So, with one less 9,

00:00:33.000 --> 99:59:59.000
2, 3, and 9 would have all been valid answers for the mode.
