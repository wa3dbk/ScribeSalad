00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.419
First we're going to look at the number of steps, the step complexity.

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:04.361
And that should be the same as reduction

00:00:04.361 --> 00:00:07.452
since all are running as a whole bunch of parallel reductions.

00:00:07.452 --> 00:00:09.514
The reductions all have different sizes.

00:00:09.514 --> 00:00:13.487
So to get the overall step complexity, we need to look at the largest reduction,

00:00:13.487 --> 00:00:17.917
which is a reduction at the end here of all n elements.

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:21.006
So the number of steps to reduce n elements

00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:25.833
and thus the number of steps to perform this entire computation is O(log n).

00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:30.777
To compute the total amount of work, we notice that we're going to have n reductions to perform.

00:00:30.777 --> 00:00:33.614
The 1st reduction requires 0 additions,

00:00:33.614 --> 00:00:36.244
the 2nd reduction requires a single addition,

00:00:36.244 --> 00:00:44.230
the 3rd reduction requires 2 additions and, in general, the nth output will require n - 1 additions.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.392
And so what we're going to have to do is sum up that whole series, 0 + 1 + 2 on to n - 1.

00:00:50.392 --> 00:00:55.138
And if we do add up that series, we're going to find that the result is roughly n^2 /2 additions.

00:00:55.138 --> 00:01:00.373
So the overall amount of work is proportional to the square of the number of elements.

00:01:00.373 --> 00:01:04.432
We would say that the number of additions overall is O(n^).

00:01:04.432 --> 00:01:08.298
So while we like having a smaller number of steps than the serial version--

00:01:08.298 --> 00:01:10.409
remember that took O(n) steps--

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.625
this quadratic work complexity makes this formulation of scan ridiculously inefficient.

00:01:15.625 --> 00:01:20.835
So what we're going to do next is look at 2 other algorithms that have a more reasonable cost.
