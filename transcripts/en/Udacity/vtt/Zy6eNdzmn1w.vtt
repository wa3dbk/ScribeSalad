00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.820
What we have to do is, I needed to change make password hash

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.350
a little bit to take in a salt parameter. because we don't want to

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.670
make a new salt every time, we only want to make a new salt

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.230
when we're making a new password hash. But if we want to verify our password

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.378
hash, we want to pass in salt as a default parameter. Or, salt, or

00:00:16.378 --> 00:00:18.776
pass in salt as a parameter. So, what I do is, I pull salt

00:00:18.776 --> 00:00:22.091
out of the h by splitting on a comma and taking the the

00:00:22.091 --> 00:00:25.758
second part which is the salt and then I pass that into my function.

00:00:25.758 --> 00:00:30.090
Now, you could have also implemented this by just copying this

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.950
line into valid PW, which I guess this should have said.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.890
May need, but it's always better if you can reuse a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.940
function like this, so you don't have to you know, if

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.550
you want to change the logic here, you don't have to change

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.870
everything here. Let's go ahead and give this a run. You

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.890
can see it says true. And if we add an extra

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.880
print statement here, print h. And now we give this a run.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.570
We should see our what would store on the database. Here we go, there's a

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.440
hash, there's a salt. And we can see that it matched. And if we were

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.290
to run this again we'd see that we get a different hash and salt but

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.890
it still matches. So, pretty cool, huh?

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.630
Let's discuss one more thing about password hashing.
