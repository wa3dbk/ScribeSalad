To finish solving for x we divide both sides by 3, so x would equal 5. So we

00:00:04.384 --> 00:00:08.814
know the x coordinate is 5, but remember we still need to find y. I'm going to

00:00:08.814 --> 00:00:13.312
use this first equation to find y. I'm going to plug in or substitute the value

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:17.954
of x, which is 5 into this equation. Negative 2 times 5 is negative 10 and then

00:00:17.954 --> 00:00:22.602
I add 10 to both sides of the equation to get y equals negative 1. So this is my

00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:27.192
solution to the system. And, of course, if we want to know if we're right, we

00:00:27.192 --> 00:00:31.965
can check our solution. We'll plug in x equals 5, and y equals negative 1 into

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:36.893
both equations, and it should work. And when we check the first equation, we get

00:00:36.893 --> 00:00:41.838
negative 11 equals negative 11. And when we check the second equation, we get 26

00:00:41.838 --> 00:00:45.084
is equal to 26. So, yes, this has to be our solution.
