00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.230
Here's our third problem on solving quadratic inequalities. What do you think

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.910
would be the solution set here? Again, for this problem here, we have a union.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.186
So you should have two intervals. When you think you have the values of y, that

00:00:11.186 --> 00:00:15.550
make this inequality true, type your intervals in here. Good luck.
