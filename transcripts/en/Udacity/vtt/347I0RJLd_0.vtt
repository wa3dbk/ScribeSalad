00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.090
We have seen that we can If-Convert If-Then-Elses, A similar

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.358
technique would be very useful for a loop, but can

00:00:05.358 --> 00:00:08.257
we [UNKNOWN] If-Convert a loop? Let's go back to our

00:00:08.257 --> 00:00:11.807
loop that loads from some memory address, add something to

00:00:11.807 --> 00:00:14.718
that, Stores that back in memory, adds 4 to the

00:00:14.718 --> 00:00:18.268
pointer, to the beginning of the loop, unless the pointer

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:21.840
has reached some final value. Let's say that in this

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.236
processor, every operation takes two cycle to do. So we

00:00:25.236 --> 00:00:28.238
will have a stall cycle here, because we need

00:00:28.238 --> 00:00:31.793
to use R2 two cycles later, another stall cycle here

00:00:31.793 --> 00:00:35.111
because the add needs to operate for one more cycle

00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:38.860
before the store can see that value. There is no

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.980
stall cycle here because this add can actually proceed immediately,

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.590
it doesn't depend on the store, and then the branch

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.140
gets delayed by one more cycle because it's using the

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.478
result of the add. So we have three stall cycles

00:00:50.478 --> 00:00:53.385
here, and again this is a process where every operation just

00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:56.235
takes two cycles, we have already seen that we can schedule

00:00:56.235 --> 00:00:59.579
this loop differently. So that we load and then we do

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.134
the add I and then we do the add, this way we

00:01:02.134 --> 00:01:06.149
avoid this stall cycle here, however, after this add, the only

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:09.434
things that are left to do in this situation of the loop

00:01:09.434 --> 00:01:12.422
are the store and the branch. We can not do the

00:01:12.422 --> 00:01:15.750
branch before the store, so the store has to happen here, and

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.277
thus, we haven't eliminated this store cycle here. And

00:01:19.277 --> 00:01:22.244
then the branch can check R1 for whether it reached

00:01:22.244 --> 00:01:25.556
the final value here, because without a stall, because

00:01:25.556 --> 00:01:28.247
R1 has been manipulated here and then we had to

00:01:28.247 --> 00:01:31.352
change this store, if you remember, because the add

00:01:31.352 --> 00:01:34.362
of a constant has moved here. So that it uses

00:01:34.362 --> 00:01:37.478
a minus four offset to compensate for this, so we

00:01:37.478 --> 00:01:40.974
manage to eliminate two of these stall cycles, but one

00:01:40.974 --> 00:01:44.318
still remains, now it you look at this branch here,

00:01:44.318 --> 00:01:47.130
If conversion would allow us to kind of do the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.470
next iteration of the loop here. And then eliminate this

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.825
branch, because it would be predicated. And then we could maybe

00:01:54.825 --> 00:01:57.135
find something here, that can go over here but the

00:01:57.135 --> 00:02:00.877
problem is that. A loop is not really suitable for if-conversion,

00:02:00.877 --> 00:02:03.355
because every time we have a new iteration we would

00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:06.423
have to introduce a new predicate and then every new iteration

00:02:06.423 --> 00:02:09.963
would introduce yet another predicate, and we simply cannot deal with

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:12.677
so many predicates and so many things that get done only

00:02:12.677 --> 00:02:15.476
if the predicate is true. Pretty much if we are executing

00:02:15.476 --> 00:02:19.396
a million iteration loop sometimes and sometimes only one ite,ration Then almost

00:02:19.396 --> 00:02:22.364
a million iterations would have to be just predicated out which

00:02:22.364 --> 00:02:25.498
would be very, very slow. So we want to do something about

00:02:25.498 --> 00:02:28.144
loops that is like If conversion to allow us to kind

00:02:28.144 --> 00:02:31.798
of find things in future iterations to move here, but without really

00:02:31.798 --> 00:02:35.137
doing if conversion, So we cannot truly if convert but there is

00:02:35.137 --> 00:02:39.830
something else we can do. And that something will be called loop unrolling.
