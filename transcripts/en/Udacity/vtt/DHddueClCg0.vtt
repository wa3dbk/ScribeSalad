00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.180
Suppose you have a set of stocks that
you've determined are good investments.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.430
How much of your portfolio
should you invest in each?

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.400
There are many potential
answers to that question.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.440
In this lesson we take a look at
the approach called mean variance

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.870
optimization, or portfolio optimization.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.120
The specific question we're
looking to answer is this.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.710
Given a set of equities and

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.830
a target return, find an allocation
to each equity that minimizes risk.
