00:00:00.493 --> 00:00:04.611
The key to figuring out which pieces of information we care about is to keep in

00:00:04.623 --> 00:00:08.627
mind what we're looking for in the problem. Since we want to find out how much

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.700
one set of wiper blades costs to make, the total amount of money that Grant has

00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:16.894
spent on micro productions so far, definitely matters, as does the total number

00:00:16.906 --> 00:00:21.557
of wiper sets that, that money, $598, funded. Grant's lunch with his friends

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:25.320
does not affect the materials that he needs for a set of wipers, so I'm not

00:00:25.332 --> 00:00:29.368
going to check this one off. It doesn't actually matter for this problem. And

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.498
this last choice that we have left to consider has to do with nozzles alone, not

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.433
wipers, and as you can see from the question, wipers are what we're concerned

00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:41.177
with. We can tell already from this list, and from the fact that half of the

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:45.033
answers aren't checked off, that a lot of the times situations that pop up are

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:48.814
full of information that isn't relevant to the problem we're trying to solve.

00:00:48.905 --> 00:00:52.749
And the first step to solving problems is to make sure we identify what we need

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:56.094
to pay attention to and what we can ignore, to make our lives easier.
