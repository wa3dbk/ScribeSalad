00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:06.980
First we cube the quantity 2t. The quantity 2t cubed is 8t cubed. Now that our

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.672
fraction is simplified, we can change division to multiplication, and multiply

00:00:11.672 --> 00:00:15.728
by the reciprocal of the second fraction. We just flip this fraction over. I'm

00:00:15.728 --> 00:00:21.060
going to multiply these fractions straight across to get negative 24t to the

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.056
4th, divided by 40t to the 8th. You might have chosen to go ahead and simplify

00:00:25.056 --> 00:00:29.992
the common factors here. Which is great. We know 8 divides into 24 three times

00:00:29.992 --> 00:00:35.046
and 8 divides into 40, 5 times. When I look at my t's, I notice that I'll have

00:00:35.046 --> 00:00:39.910
four more t's in the denominator, so I'll have negative three divided by five

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.838
times t to the fourth. That's some amazing algebra if you got that one correct.
