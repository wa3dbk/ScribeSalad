00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.930
So, what does it mean to understand a problem? And I should emphasize, we're

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.142
talking about computational problems here. And what all computational problems

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:13.034
have in common is that they have inputs and they have desired outputs. So,

00:00:13.034 --> 00:00:17.824
problem is defined by the set of possible inputs. This is usually an infinite

00:00:17.824 --> 00:00:22.516
set for most interesting problems and the relationships between those inputs and

00:00:22.516 --> 00:00:27.073
the desired outputs. So, that means a solution to a problem is a procedure that

00:00:27.073 --> 00:00:31.213
can take any input in that set and produces output, a desired output that

00:00:31.213 --> 00:00:35.536
satisfies the relationship that we want. In this case, the relationship we want

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:39.544
is that the output is the number days between the birthday and the current date.

00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:43.518
So, the first step to understanding a problem is to make sure that we understand

00:00:43.518 --> 00:00:44.979
what the possible inputs are.
