Thanks Chris for that question. The answer here is 57. Let's see how we got

00:00:04.646 --> 00:00:09.218
that. So whenever I replace the variables with these variables, I have to

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.128
remember to use parentheses. So I'm going to substitute the values in. I have a

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.794
negative and then I have a cubed. I know that a equals negative 2. b is negative

00:00:18.806 --> 00:00:24.456
1. We want to raise that to the c power and c equals 5. 5ac means 5 times a,

00:00:24.582 --> 00:00:30.243
times c. So we have 5 times a, a is negative 2 and c is 5. Now we have to use

00:00:30.255 --> 00:00:36.236
the order of operations to evaluate the expression.First we want to do. Any

00:00:36.248 --> 00:00:42.403
operations that are inside parentheses, but there are none. So next I want to do

00:00:42.415 --> 00:00:48.545
my exponents or my powers. Here the negative is inside the parentheses, so it's

00:00:48.557 --> 00:00:52.176
negative 2 times negative 2 times negative 2, which gives me negative 8. When we

00:00:52.188 --> 00:00:56.665
raise negative 1 to the fifth power, 5 is an odd number, which means the

00:00:56.677 --> 00:00:59.915
answer's going to be negative. So negative 1 to the 5th power is simply negative

00:00:59.752 --> 00:01:04.364
1. Remember, when we're doing order of operations, and we're doing

00:01:04.376 --> 00:01:09.465
multiplication and division. We want to perform each operation in order from

00:01:09.477 --> 00:01:13.215
left to right. So first I have negative 1 times negative 8, gives me positive 8.

00:01:13.422 --> 00:01:16.691
I bring down the plus negative 1 and then I have negative 5 times negative 2.

00:01:17.017 --> 00:01:20.759
That gives me positive 10. Positive 10 times 5 is positive 50. Now that I've

00:01:20.771 --> 00:01:26.863
done all my multiplication and division, and I only have addition. I can do

00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:31.980
those in order from left to right. So first I do 8 plus negative 1, which is 7.

00:01:32.242 --> 00:01:36.090
And, 7 plus 50 is equal to 57.
