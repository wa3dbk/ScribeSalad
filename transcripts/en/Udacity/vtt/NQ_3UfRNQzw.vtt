00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.810
Next we will look at how the replacement
policy for the cache, which chooses,

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.820
if you remember, which block to
kick out when we need more room,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.460
interacts with the hit
time of the cache.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.300
A simple replacement policy,
such as random,

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.760
which randomly picks the block to
replace among those that are in the set,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.050
has nothing to update on a cache hit.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.200
When we have a cache hit,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.900
we don't have to do anything in
order to be later able to do random.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.870
When we have a miss, that's when
we start implementing our policy

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.350
by randomly selecting
a block to kick out.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.150
This results in faster hits, because
there is nothing we need to do for

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.270
the replacement policy when we
have a hit, and that's nice.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.960
However the random policy is not very
good for miss rate, because we often

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.630
kick out blocks that we will very soon
need to use and we don't like that.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.600
In contrast, least recently used or LRU
results in a lower miss rate, which we

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.520
like but we have to run every cache hit
update potentially a lot of counters.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.580
Even if we don't update them
we have to look at them.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.890
So there is a lot of activity on
every cache hit that results from

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.590
leaving the state that we'll late use
to select the block we will kick up and

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.270
this spends a lot of power and
also results in slower hits.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.300
To illustrate what happens on a cache
hit using LRU, let's look at a four-way

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.620
set associative cache whose counters
are currently zero, one, two, and three.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.720
If the processor accesses
this one here and has a hit.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.500
The new values of the counters are going
to be this one becomes the most

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.060
recently used And all of the other
counters get decremented.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.300
As you can see, all the counters have
changed and this happens on a cache hit.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.010
So a cache hit can result in
updating up to n counters,

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.940
where n is our associativity.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.360
Let's look at what happens when one
of the more recently used blocks

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.020
is accessed.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.660
Let's say we access not the most
recent used but the next one.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.870
In that case this becomes
the most recent used block.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.710
The counters that are larger
than this one get decremented so

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.640
this becomes two and
the smaller than this stay the same.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.840
So we get this.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.480
So only two counters have changed now.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.810
But note that even though we have
only changed two counters, we had to

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.730
actually check for each counter
whether it's lower than this or not.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.540
So even when we access the most
recently used block, and

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.470
the counters don't change at all
because this becomes three and

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.280
counters larger than it get decremented,
but

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.760
there is nothing larger and this,
lower than it stayed the same.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.260
We still, had to determine that
this is the highest counter anyway,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.440
so that we don't decrement anything or
we had to actually check for

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.580
each of these counters,
whether it's lower.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.600
So, one way or the other, even for
a hit to the most recently used blog,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.980
we have to do something and that again
slows down the hits and spends power.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.790
So what we want is a replacement policy

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.860
that retains the miss
rate very close to LRU.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.250
Meaning we want to smartly
replace the blocks so

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.140
that we can cut the block that
is unlikely to be used soon.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.900
Or the least likely to be its own, but

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.890
we want to do less activity
on cache hits to do that.
