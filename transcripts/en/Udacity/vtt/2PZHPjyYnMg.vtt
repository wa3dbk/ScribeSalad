00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let me make a final quiz in which I have a coin which probability I don't know.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
There are multiple coins. One is fair and one is loaded.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The fair coin has a probability of heads of 0.5.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The loaded coin has a probability of heads of 0.1.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to grab a random coin with 50% chance.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The fair coin will be chosen with 50% chance,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and the loaded coin will be chosen with 50% chance,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but I don't know which one it is.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I flip it and I observe heads.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
What's the probability that the coin I hold in my hand is fair?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Apply anything you've learned before--

00:00:36.000 --> 09:59:59.000
one of the rules you've learned before is exactly the right one to apply here.
