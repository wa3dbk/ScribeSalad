00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.817
Here's our numerator and here's our denominator. Fantastic algebra skills if you

00:00:04.817 --> 00:00:08.965
got these two correct. This one was really tough, so don't worry if you didn't

00:00:08.965 --> 00:00:12.712
get it right on your first try or even at all. Let's see how we can multiply by

00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:17.865
the LCD and simplify. We know we're going to multiply by the LCD divided by the

00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:23.048
LCD. When we do that, we really just distribute this to each term in our complex

00:00:23.048 --> 00:00:28.326
fraction. This gives us this expression. Now, this is pretty hideous. So let's

00:00:28.326 --> 00:00:34.034
clean it up. We know x plus 2 divided by x plus 2 equals 1. So we're left with 3

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:38.088
times x squared for our first term. This next multiplication was a little

00:00:38.088 --> 00:00:45.160
tricky. We have x squared divided by x. We can only cancel 1x from this power

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.223
and this denominator. This means we have to drop the squared power down to a 1.

00:00:50.223 --> 00:00:56.593
And we're left with 4 times 1x times x plus 2. I want to make sure I have it

00:00:56.593 --> 00:01:03.842
negative 4 times 1x. So I have negative 4x. Then I had times x plus 2 here. This

00:01:03.842 --> 00:01:08.429
denominator is a little bit more simple. These factors simplify to 1 and these

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:13.656
factors also simplify to 1. So, we're left with 2 times x squared for the first

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:18.140
term of our denominator and 1 times x plus 2 or just x plus 2 for the second

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.477
term of our denominator. I need to multiply or distribute this negative 4x to

00:01:23.477 --> 00:01:28.428
the quantity x plus 2. This gives me a new numerator. For the denominator, I

00:01:28.428 --> 00:01:33.490
don't multiply. I really add, since we have addition between these two terms.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.223
Since there aren't any like terms here, I just list out each term, 2x squared

00:01:39.223 --> 00:01:42.960
plus x plus 2. And to finish out we just simply combine the like terms in our

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.534
numerator. 3x squared minus 4x squared is negative x squared. So here's our

00:01:48.534 --> 00:01:51.043
final rational expression.
