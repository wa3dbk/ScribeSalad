00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.906
So far the process of completing this square looks pretty similar to what we did

00:00:03.906 --> 00:00:07.775
before when the leading coefficient was 1. But here's where things are going to

00:00:07.775 --> 00:00:11.675
get a little bit tricky, or at least a little bit different from what we've seen

00:00:11.675 --> 00:00:15.300
before. The next step that I'd like you to do is to factor out that leading

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.170
coefficient that we have on the right hand side. So pull out this 3 from these

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.397
two terms and then write what we need to multiply that by in this box. Think

00:00:23.397 --> 00:00:28.497
about why we want to do this based on the final form of the equation that we

00:00:28.497 --> 00:00:29.900
want to end up with.
