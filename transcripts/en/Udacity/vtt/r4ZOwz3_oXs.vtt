00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.290
This can be useful if we want to inspect

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.450
these values, or carry out further operations to help us

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.970
understand how the difference between male and female users varies

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.570
with age. For example, looking at this plot, it seems

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.730
like the gender difference is largest for our young users.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.800
It would be to put this in relative terms though.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.560
So, let's answer a different question. Let's answer the question,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.600
how many times more friends does the average female user

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.250
have than the male user? Maybe, females have twice as many

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.380
friends as male users, or maybe it's ten times as many friends
