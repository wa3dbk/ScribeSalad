00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.500
Recall our situation where we want to loop through all of

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.930
the elements in all the instances of class B.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.290
And they're pointed to by instances of class A.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.960
What this means is we have to loop through all the A's in order to get to

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.420
all of the B's and do whatever we're going to do with them.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.350
This approach if which is involves pointers in

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.280
one direction only can be cumbersome and costly.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.065
Instead, you could implement the association between classes foo and bar by

00:00:30.065 --> 00:00:36.080
intros, by introducing a new class an association class that has two attributes.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.660
One is a name of or pointer to foo instance and

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.230
the other is a pointer to the bar instance.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.730
That is, the instances are essentially a set of pairs.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.860
We have reified or made our association itself into an object.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.910
It's then an easy matter to link through all the possibilities, to loop through

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.450
all the possibilities, because they're all instances of this association class.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.010
There is a cost associated with,

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.970
with doing this, it, the cost takes the form of an extra step.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.260
If we want to go from a particular foo to a particular bar, instead of having a,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.450
a reference or a pointer directly to it, we have to go to the association

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.250
object, look up that particular instance of the foo class,

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.070
find the associated instance of the bar class and traverse in an extra step.
