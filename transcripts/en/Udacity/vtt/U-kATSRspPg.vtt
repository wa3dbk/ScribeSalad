00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.370
In fact,
no matter what the care setting,

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.590
without electronic assistance,
physicians often don't coordinate well.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.650
The Commonwealth Fund
surveys patients like Marla.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.280
In 2011 they found that,
quote, to varying degrees in

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.080
all countries chronically ill or
sicker patients encounter

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.670
failures of providers to communicate
with each other or coordinate care.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.140
Yet in each country, patients with
primary care practices that help them

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.020
navigate the care system and
provide easy access are far less

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.350
likely to encounter duplication delays
and failures to share information.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.770
Unsaid here is that almost all patients
in patient-centered practices,

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.030
shown in red here,
are using electronic records.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.200
And you can see that they have lower,
actually significantly lower,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.970
reported rates of care
coordination problems.
