00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.702
So, our answers here are 7, 7, 17, and 17. Note that, as I suggested, I simplify

00:00:04.702 --> 00:00:09.139
what was inside the absolute value as my first step. So for example, here, I

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.811
said, first off, 12 minus 5 is 7, rewrite the absolute value signs around that

00:00:13.811 --> 00:00:18.227
and the absolute value of 7 is 7. Please note that none of these answers are

00:00:18.227 --> 00:00:23.080
negative. These four numbers at least are all positive numbers. Keep that in

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.703
mind as we move forward.
