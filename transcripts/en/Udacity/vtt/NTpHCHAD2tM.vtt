00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And the answer I'm looking for, obviously, is the thing we just talked about--

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
replicate the database.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now, yes, you can get a faster machine,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but sometimes you don't have access to a faster machine,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and that's obviously not what I was asking.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Of course, you can store less data.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
That was something we used to say. I read it all the time.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This site would be a lot faster if we didn't have any users.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Or you could press the turbo button,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
which is really just a subset of get a faster machine.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I don't know if you guys remember computers with turbo buttons,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
but they were pretty cool.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
But the answer I'm looking for is replicate the database.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
If you take your database and you replicate the data

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
to a bunch of different machines, you can do more reads.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So, all right, next quiz.
