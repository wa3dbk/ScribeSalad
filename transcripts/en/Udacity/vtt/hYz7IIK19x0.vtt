00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.160
Running apps in virtual machines
means that they're essentially

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.270
sandboxed in runtime.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.890
This means that the apps cannot directly
interfere with the operating system and

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.260
other apps.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.400
Nor can they directly
access the device hardware.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.570
Each app is granted a set of
permissions at install time, and

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.470
cannot perform operations that
require permissions it does not have.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.452
More specifically, the Android platform
takes advantage of the Linux user-based

00:00:31.452 --> 00:00:36.918
protection as a means of identifying and
isolating application resources.

00:00:36.918 --> 00:00:41.065
The Android system assigns
a unique user ID, or UID,

00:00:41.065 --> 00:00:46.590
to each Android app and runs it as
that user in a separate process.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.680
The kernel enforces
security between apps and

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.910
the system at the process level
through standard Linux facilities

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.060
such as user and
group IDs that are assigned to the apps.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.290
By default,
apps cannot interact with each other and

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.930
apps have limited access
to the operating system.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.450
If app A tries to do something
malicious like reading app B's data or

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.890
downloading the form without permission,
then the operating system protects

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.970
against this, because app A does not
have the appropriate user privileges.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.280
This sandbox model is simple, but
on the other hand, it is based on

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.957
decades of Unix style user separation
of processes and file permissions.

00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:34.821
An app can announce
the permissions that it needs, and

00:01:34.821 --> 00:01:38.680
user approval is required
at install time.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.950
The permissions are typically, back up.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.530
The permissions
are typically implemented

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.225
by mapping them to Linux groups that
have the necessary read-write access to

00:01:48.225 --> 00:01:52.620
relevant system resources,
such as files and sockets.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.415
And therefore, they are ultimately
enforced by the Linux kernel.
