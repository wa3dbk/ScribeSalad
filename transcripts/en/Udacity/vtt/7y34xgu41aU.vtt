00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.203
Between group variability should be the numerator, because as it increases.

00:00:05.203 --> 00:00:09.235
This will increase the whole test statistic, and this leans more in favor of

00:00:09.235 --> 00:00:13.395
the alternative hypothesis, that at least one pair of means is significantly

00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:19.605
diffferent. Within group variability should be the denominator, because as this

00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:25.100
increases the f ratio decreases, which you can see algebraically. If the

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.850
denominator increases then the whole quotient will decrease. And this leans

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.946
more in the favor of the null hypothesis that the means are not significantly

00:00:33.946 --> 00:00:39.360
different. Just like the t statistic the numerator indicates much group means

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.000
differ. This is explained variation. Because it most likely results from

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.978
differences due to a treatment. Or just differences in the populations. With

00:00:50.978 --> 00:00:54.626
the clothing example from the beginning of the lesson, the difference in the

00:00:54.626 --> 00:00:58.160
numerator can be explained by the fact that the clothes are from different

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.562
brands. But the denominator is a measure of error. Within-group variability

00:01:04.562 --> 00:01:09.394
measures individual differences of subjects within each group. This is

00:01:09.394 --> 00:01:13.012
considered error variation because we don't know why subjects in the same group

00:01:13.012 --> 00:01:17.580
are different, whether they're people or shirts. They just are.
