00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.899
So, how did this happen? Pavlov always predicted meat powder in the dog's

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.115
mouth. The sight of Pavlov meant meat powder was coming. Pavlov wanted to test

00:00:09.115 --> 00:00:13.340
this experimentally, so what he did was he provided a neutral stimulus, a tone

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:13.795
[SOUND]

00:00:13.795 --> 00:00:18.848
, followed by meat powder, and he did this repeatedly. Tone

00:00:18.848 --> 00:00:19.317
[SOUND]

00:00:19.317 --> 00:00:25.130
, meat powder, tone sss , meat powder. Then he wanted to see whether or not the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.700
tone was able to produce salivation. Here he presents the tone alone.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.421
[SOUND]

00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:35.570
And the dog did salivate. The essence of classical conditioning is the pairing

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.622
process, where a formally neutral stimulus,

00:00:37.622 --> 00:00:38.000
[SOUND]

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.980
becomes a conditioned stimulus. Predictive ability is the key.
