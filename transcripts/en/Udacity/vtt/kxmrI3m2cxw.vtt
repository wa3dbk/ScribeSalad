00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.510
Now, let's move on, to rendering performance. Your

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.160
goal for rendering, for scrolling and animations, particularly, should

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.950
be smooth, gent free rendering. If your app,

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.210
is jumping around, as the user scrolls, or an

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.560
animation is periodically freezing, or, running at less

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.530
than a fast consistent frame rate, then your users

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.820
will be unhappy, with the experience. On desktop, we

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.040
always, tell you, the magic number is 16 milliseconds.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.620
That's a single frame, when you're running at 60 frames a second, which

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.890
is the usual frame rate of the monitor. That's not always true and actually,

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.100
it's not even that you need to consistently hit 60 frames a second. It's

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.520
far more important, to have a consistent frame rate, than a high frame rate.
