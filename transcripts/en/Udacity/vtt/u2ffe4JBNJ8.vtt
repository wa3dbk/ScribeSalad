00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.564
So now it's time to actually implement
the changes we talked about in

00:00:02.564 --> 00:00:03.730
the last video.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:04.790
To start with,

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.895
I'm going to open the create screen
in an image editing software.

00:00:07.895 --> 00:00:11.160
I'm going to use Paintbrush,
a free image editing software for

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.050
Macs, but feel free to use
whatever software you like.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.420
So for me, I will go up here,
go to open, and

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.634
browse my way to the correct screen.

00:00:22.634 --> 00:00:24.460
So now that I'm here,

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.610
what we're seeing is that we
have this event language here.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.560
And everywhere else in the class,
we use this language of task,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.310
so the first task for us will be
to change this event word to task.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.502
Now, it's fairly easy to do
that in a program like this.

00:00:41.502 --> 00:00:48.364
I am actually just going to copy this,
command c, command v and cover that up.

00:00:48.364 --> 00:00:51.180
It's not the cleanest, but it works.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.750
And with, as with all prototyping,
what works is what you should be doing.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.840
So let's move this event
word from the screen.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.400
Now, we need to add the task
word to the screen.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.056
So this won't be ideal, but

00:01:06.056 --> 00:01:10.550
it will actually convey the information
we're trying to convey.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.810
So, now that I've done that,
I can save and then I can close out.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.956
If we wanted to upload this,

00:01:16.956 --> 00:01:20.780
that my prototype was now using it,
we would press this plus button.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.200
See how it says drag and drop?

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.750
We can simply go up to create,
drag that and drop that.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.470
And because it has the same name,
we now have task over here.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.700
Any time you're uploading a screen to
your InVision prototype, which has

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.830
the exact same name as a previous
screen, it will override that screen.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.387
So, now when I go into this
screen that we've just created,

00:01:48.387 --> 00:01:50.315
then I go to the build mode, you'll

00:01:51.555 --> 00:01:56.445
see that it already has these hotspots,
and so it already knows

00:01:56.445 --> 00:02:01.105
that it's supposed to link backslash
close when I press the create button.

00:02:01.105 --> 00:02:03.145
Now let's think another thing.

00:02:03.145 --> 00:02:07.545
If we want to have these check
boxes show up somewhere and

00:02:07.545 --> 00:02:10.389
they need to be good, well,

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.710
the first place we encountered
check boxes was this calendar day.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.090
So let's open up this calendar day
in our image editing software.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.606
So as we can see, it currently has
these check boxes, which are these

00:02:24.606 --> 00:02:28.242
grey circles, and then they turn into
blue circles with checks in them.

00:02:28.242 --> 00:02:31.370
That was confusing some of our users so,
again,

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.673
we're just going to cover this up.

00:02:37.794 --> 00:02:42.630
There's no need to be fancy with it,
and then we'll replace that.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.683
So I like Paintbrush because it
comes with this nice tool for

00:02:49.683 --> 00:02:52.650
just putting out rounded boxes.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.770
So I can just make
this square check box.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.030
I'm holding the Shift key down to
make sure that it's actually square.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.100
And then I can switch over
to this copying tool again,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.030
grab that, and copy it on down.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.190
I'm going to try and line these up, but

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.960
they won't be perfect,
and that's all right.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.350
Again, you want the least time spent
on your prototype as possible.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.630
So again, we've cleaned this up, it's
much better, we have these check boxes,

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.320
let's save and upload that screen.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.000
So again, click this plus button,
and move the calendar day on over.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.560
So by doing that, we've now got
these check boxes here, and

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.130
we've now got all of the hotspots
already there, so we can click on this

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.810
and go to the week or the month,
create an event, go back to this drawer.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.600
The final thing we wanted to do
was make sure that the home screen

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.320
had these check boxes, and
we can do that in one of two ways.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.800
Either we can take our current home
screen and add the check boxes,

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.040
or we can take a look at this calendar
day, see that it has all the same

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.880
information as our current home screen,
but also as check boxes, and

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.350
say, well, maybe we don't need
actually this home screen anymore.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.570
So instead, I'm going to go through
the hotspots we already have and

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.180
change them so that rather than pointing
at home, they point at calendar day.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.860
To do that, I'm first going
to go into this view part.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.706
Then I'm going to click on build mode,
and

00:04:29.706 --> 00:04:31.307
that will bring up all the hot spots.

00:04:33.605 --> 00:04:35.019
So the way I've done this,

00:04:35.019 --> 00:04:38.820
home is the one that currently
points at the home screen.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.680
We want home to point at calendar day,
so we just change that, click save,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.060
and now if we go back to our
preview mode click on home,

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.480
it'll bring us to calendar day.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:56.160
There are two other places we'll need to
do this change, so let's move on through.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.880
The first place is in
your sign up screen.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.090
Usually when you click this create for

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.990
create an account, it will link you
to home or to your walkthrough.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.670
You can change that to
calendar day if you'd like.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.990
If you haven't pointed me in
the walkthrough, then you have to change

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:19.565
this to point to calendar day, and
again, every time it's very simple.

00:05:19.565 --> 00:05:20.425
Click on this,

00:05:20.425 --> 00:05:24.645
click on the drop down, go to
the right screen and then click save.

00:05:24.645 --> 00:05:28.025
See, here's our home, we don't actually
have to change anything from this home

00:05:28.025 --> 00:05:29.723
to root from the prototype.

00:05:29.723 --> 00:05:32.275
All we need to do is change
the things that would otherwise point

00:05:32.275 --> 00:05:33.775
to this home screen.

00:05:33.775 --> 00:05:36.700
So going through this, it looks like
there aren't any other places where we

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.130
know we need to change the hotspot.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.370
There are places where we might
have to change the hotspot.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.910
Depending on how you implemented this
new screen, this create might go to

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.750
link back, close, or it might currently
be pointing at the home screen.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.640
Similarly for this back button up here.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.640
Check those before you move on.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.730
The last one is this sign in.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.230
Very often this will be
pointing towards home, and

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.980
you'll want this to be
pointing towards calendar day.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.000
With all of that done,
we can go to our preview mode and

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.550
click around to be sure
that we've done this right.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.340
So let's try signing in, and wonderful,

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.840
now we're on this screen
with the check boxes.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.250
That's what we wanted.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:25.040
If we take a look at creating a task, we
now see that it does say, in fact, task.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.950
It's a little bit spaced weird,
but it took us five minutes to do.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.050
Wonderful, mow your test
project should have reacted to

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.070
all of the feedback we got in our first
round of user testing, which means,

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.220
of course, that it's time for
more user testing.
