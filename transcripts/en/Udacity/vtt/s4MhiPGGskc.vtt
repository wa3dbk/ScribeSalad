00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I mentioned NP hardness before.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now that we've talked about reduction, we can revisit that definition and say--

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
a problem X is NP hard if we can reduce some other NP hard problem to it,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
what that really means is we can use a solution to problem X to solve some NP hard problem,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that means that solving X has to be at least as hard as the NP hard problem

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
making it therefore NP hard.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now, there's something sort of irritatingly circular or turtles all the way downish about this.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We want to show that some problems in NP hard we got some problem,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
we have to show that we can reduce some other NP hard problem to it.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We need that problem to be NP hard. How do we show that that problem is NP hard.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Well, we can just show that there're some other NP hard problems that we could reduce to it

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and so on and so on and so on, and it doesn't really seem like we could ever get anywhere this way.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But the good news is that back in 1971, Stephen Cook gave essentially the original NP hard problem

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and that is SAT, so SAT we know is NP hard.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And the way that he showed that is really ingenious, he actually showed that if you had

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
something that could solve SAT, you could use it to simulate in polynomial time,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
essentially an NP computer--right.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
A computer that makes these non-deterministic choices, and since that's the case,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
anything that we could run on an NP computer, we can turn into a SAT problem

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and therefore, SAT is as hard as anything in NP, so that's great.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Cook got us off the ground here by giving an NP hard problem.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Now we have something else to target.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
We have some other way if we want to start that some problems are NP hard.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
We can just reduce SAT to it and then we're done, but at this point now,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
there's actually a huge number of problems that are known to be NP hard.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
If you encounter a new problem, it may already be known to be NP hard or it may very well be

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
that some know NP hard problem can be reduced to it,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
so you don't necessarily have to go all the way to SAT to do it.
