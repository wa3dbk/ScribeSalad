00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.550
Having defined the independent set and
vertex cover problems,

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.830
we will now show that vertex cover
is as hard as independent set.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.790
In general, finding a reduction
can be very difficult.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.600
Sometimes however, it can be as simple
as playing around with the definition.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.260
You will notice that in both
these examples here and

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.340
in the exercises, the set of
vertices used in the vertex cover

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.310
was the complement of the vertices
used in the independent set.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.036
Let's see if we can explain this.

00:00:27.036 --> 00:00:32.520
A set S is an independent set
if there are no edges within S.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.000
By within,
I mean that both endpoints are in S.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.110
That's equivalent to saying that
every edge is not within S,

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.855
or that every edge is incident on V- S.

00:00:44.855 --> 00:00:46.070
A-ha!

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.070
But that just says that
V- S is a vertex cover.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.340
So of course the complement
of an independent set

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.430
was always a vertex cover and
vice versa.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.640
Thus, we have the observation
that a subset of the vertices S

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.470
is an independent set if and
only if V- S is a vertex cover.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.490
As a corollary then, G will contain
an independent set of size at least K,

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.760
if and only if it has a vertex
cover of size at most V- K.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.580
The reduction then is
fantastically simple.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.720
Given a graph G and a number K,
the reduction just keeps the same graph

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.000
G and
changes K to the number of vertices- K.
