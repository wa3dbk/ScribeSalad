00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.180
Most of the times, having data
in our database is a good idea.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.812
But sometimes, we make a few bad ideas
that we may want to delete, later.

00:00:06.812 --> 00:00:10.320
Auntie Anne's Diner just realized, that
their spinach ice cream wasn't a hit,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.920
and wants to remove it from their menu.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.665
Deleting an item is a three step
process similar to updating.

00:00:15.665 --> 00:00:19.105
First, we want to execute the query
to find the spinach ice cream, and

00:00:19.105 --> 00:00:20.415
store it in a variable.

00:00:20.415 --> 00:00:22.815
Then we want to call session
delete on that item.

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:24.745
And finally, we'll commit the session.

00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:27.595
Let's go back to the Python shell,
and walk through this together.

00:00:27.595 --> 00:00:31.015
Let's assume, Auntie Anne's was the only
restaurant with spinach ice cream, and

00:00:31.015 --> 00:00:34.273
use the .dot one function,
to grab this entry in the database.

00:00:34.273 --> 00:00:35.015
To double check,

00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:38.060
I will print out the name of the
restaurant, this menu item belongs to.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.600
And see that it is indeed,
Auntie Ann's creation.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.030
We will call session.delete
to stage this item for

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.750
removal from the database, and then call
session.commit to persist this change.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.560
If we search for spinach now,
the sqlalchemy gives us, a no row was

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.980
found error, letting us know that this
data is no longer in our database.
