00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.788
Here's my solution. One thing to realize is that the angle must be set in

00:00:02.788 --> 00:00:07.176
radiance. The other is looking up how to access the target position. I added

00:00:07.176 --> 00:00:10.698
this information to the online documentation after I had problems myself. I

00:00:10.698 --> 00:00:13.840
recommend the same to you. If you find a problem in the 3JS documentation, fix

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.264
it, and submit it using GitHub. You'll help at least a hundred other people. At

00:00:18.264 --> 00:00:20.558
this point you might want to experiment with a spotlight and play with it's

00:00:20.558 --> 00:00:24.450
various parameters. Either in this program or using the 3JS editor.
