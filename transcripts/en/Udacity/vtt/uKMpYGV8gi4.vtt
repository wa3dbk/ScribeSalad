00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.820
This first situation would require a junction object.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.600
Since applicants can be interviewed by many employees, and

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.840
an employee will interview many applicants, this is

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.940
a many to many relationship. The second option would

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.480
not require a many to many relationship, because

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.310
it's a one to many relationship between the job

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.790
application and the feedback. So, no junction object is

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.030
required. This last option would require a junction object.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.250
There's going to be multiple positions on multiple

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.020
sites. And this would require a junction object.
