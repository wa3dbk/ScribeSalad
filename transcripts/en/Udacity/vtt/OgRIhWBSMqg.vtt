00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.197
So which approach will launch more threads: Thread per row, thread per element?

00:00:04.197 --> 00:00:06.275
The answer is thread per element.

00:00:06.275 --> 00:00:09.545
Thread per element will launch a thread for every X in this matrix,

00:00:09.545 --> 00:00:14.002
but thread per row, on the other hand, will only launch a thread for every row in this matrix.

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:19.255
So thread per element will certainly have at least as many, if not many more threads than thread per row.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:22.692
Which approach will require communication between threads?

00:00:22.692 --> 00:00:24.928
Well, that's also going to be thread per element.

00:00:24.928 --> 00:00:27.234
What's going to happen there is

00:00:27.234 --> 00:00:30.767
we compute a partial product for each element in a particular row

00:00:30.767 --> 00:00:35.836
and then we need to add up those partial products across those elements to create the final value.

00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:40.982
And if you remember we use the segmented scan operation to be able to do that in Unit 4.

00:00:40.982 --> 00:00:43.851
The final question, which approach will do more work per thread?

00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:46.147
Well that's going to be thread per row.

00:00:46.147 --> 00:00:49.686
This row has to do all the partial products and add them up,

00:00:49.686 --> 00:00:53.888
whereas thread per element only does 1 partial product per element

00:00:53.888 --> 00:00:59.563
and then combines the work across multiple threads to be able to get a final result.
