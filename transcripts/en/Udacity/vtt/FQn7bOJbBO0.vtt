00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.996
Here, the ranges were from negative infinity to negative 5, with the union of

00:00:03.996 --> 00:00:10.100
negative 1 to positive infinity. Great work if you found these two intervals.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.292
First, we want to find the values of p that make this equation true. We factor

00:00:14.292 --> 00:00:18.068
to find the series of p and we get p is equal to negative 5, and p is equal to

00:00:18.068 --> 00:00:23.268
negative 1. We use the values of negative 5 and negative 1 to create the three

00:00:23.268 --> 00:00:27.720
intervals on our number line. For the first interval, I'm going to test the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.188
value of negative 10. When I plug in at negative 10 for p, I'll get the

00:00:32.188 --> 00:00:37.400
statement 45 is greater than 0. I know this is true so I can include it, this

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.280
part or this interval, in my solution set. For interval II, I'll plug in the

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.422
value p equals negative 3. When we substitute this value in, we get the

00:00:46.422 --> 00:00:51.429
inequality negative 4 is greater than 0. We know this is not true, so we can

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:56.148
include this interval in our solution set. And finally, for the third interval,

00:00:56.148 --> 00:01:00.876
we'll use the value p equals zero. If p equals zero, we lose these two terms

00:01:00.876 --> 00:01:05.310
and are left with a statement 5 is greater than zero, which we know is true.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.342
We'll use parentheses at negative 5 and negative 1, since we don't have the or

00:01:09.342 --> 00:01:15.151
equal to symbol here. So any value, from negative infinity to negative 5 or any

00:01:15.151 --> 00:01:18.805
value from negative 1 to positive infinity will satisfy our original

00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:24.508
inequality. Here's our answer on a number line, and here's our answer written

00:01:24.508 --> 00:01:26.474
in interval notation.
