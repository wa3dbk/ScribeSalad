They found that students who were not asked to list their race performed well,

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.284
and as for the students who were asked to list their race they found that

00:00:07.284 --> 00:00:11.036
African American students became really anxious and performed poorly on their

00:00:11.036 --> 00:00:16.896
test. This is what we meant earlier about stereo types possibly perpetuating

00:00:16.896 --> 00:00:20.581
themselves, here we see that stereotypes can influence an individual to behave

00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:26.964
in a way that confirms the stereotype. So why is this important? Well, think of

00:00:26.964 --> 00:00:31.239
a stereotype such as girls don't do well in math or science. Or men aren't

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:35.147
emotionally aware. If you're in one of these categories, for example a girl,

00:00:35.147 --> 00:00:38.929
and you're aware of the stereotype it can actually influence your overall

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:44.030
performance. This is quite fascinating and important to be aware of because the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.254
stereotype girls are not good at math might prevent girls from going into a

00:00:47.254 --> 00:00:50.686
field that's heavy in math or even may cause individual girls to perform poorly

00:00:50.686 --> 00:00:57.280
on a math exams. Can you think of any stereotype groups that you may belong to?

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.578
And how this could possibly affect your performance on different tasks? This is

00:01:01.578 --> 00:01:04.946
a great topic for the discussion forums. However, it's a sensitive topic so

00:01:04.946 --> 00:01:08.473
please be respectful. Now, let's go to Susan who has an example for us.
