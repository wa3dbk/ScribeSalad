The neurons connecting the ear to the brain are complete at around 18 weeks

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.235
after conception. So, does this mean a fetus can hear before it's born? The

00:00:08.235 --> 00:00:12.484
answer's yes. The auditory neural connections are made by about 18 weeks. But,

00:00:12.484 --> 00:00:16.774
the fetus doesn't start responding to sound until about 26 weeks or six months

00:00:16.774 --> 00:00:21.418
after conception. Fetuses actually find their mother's voice soothing and

00:00:21.418 --> 00:00:25.924
prefer the sound of the mother's voice over other voices. One example is

00:00:25.924 --> 00:00:29.458
researchers monitored the fetus' heart rate and found that it slowed when

00:00:29.458 --> 00:00:33.106
hearing the mother's voice, which showed that the fetus was able to attend or

00:00:33.106 --> 00:00:39.290
orient to its mother's voice. And it could calm him or her. However, an

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.506
increase in heart rate would indicate fear or distress, and that doesn't happen

00:00:42.506 --> 00:00:45.370
when a fetus hears his own mother's voice.
