00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.680
Now that we have everything set up the way we need,

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:08.390
open Chrome on your development machine and go to Chrome inspect. Make

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.070
sure the site you want to debug is open on your mobile

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.320
device and then connect your laptop to your mobile device via USB.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.100
Then confirm that you want to allow USB debugging.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.090
Back in our development machine, we can see a list

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.000
of the attached devices and the Chrome tabs that are

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.320
open on the devices. You can even open other tabs.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.110
We can also focus on specific tabs, you can reload them

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.980
And you can even close a tab.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.300
The best part of course is that you can inspect the pages that

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.870
are running on your mobile device, from

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.419
your development machine let's take a look.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.860
One of my favorite new features is the new screen cast

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.060
mode. This allows you to drive the experience on your mobile device

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.450
from your development machine. You can click on links, and see

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.230
them update simultaneously on the device. As well as on your desktop.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.080
As you can see, you have all the familiar

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.820
features from the development tools available for mobile now.
