00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.620
Earlier you learned that every element on the Wikipedia web page seemed to

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.940
be a box, even the completely not-rectangular images.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.000
But wait.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.380
How can everything be a box?

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.380
I mean, there are other shapes in the world like circles, right?

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.010
Well, that is very true.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.220
On a website, something may look like a circle or

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.150
a triangle or something a little more irregular, but, in fact,

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.130
it's still just a box, it just looks like a circle.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.200
Don't believe it?

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.880
Neither did I the first time.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.140
Let's take a look at this demo site.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.590
On this site we have three very nice circles, and we've even got a triangle.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.050
I mean, these can't just be rectangles, right.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.160
Or can they?

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.540
Right clicking on the first circle and

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.820
selecting inspect element brings up Google developer tools

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.530
in the exact location where the circle is located in the structure.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.310
Wait.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.556
What?

00:01:04.556 --> 00:01:07.470
My mind was just blown.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.820
So, what exactly is going on here?

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.530
In this left panel we have the structure that we are already so

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.170
familiar with and this part seems to define our circle.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.870
If I highlight this line in Developer tools it highlights a rectangular

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.700
shape on the page but where does the visible round shape come from?

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.660
I talked a little something about style earlier.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.490
So the answer is probably in the style panel here on the right.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.950
What you see here are the styles used to display the element selected in

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.010
the left panel.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.980
The very cool thing is that you can change the style and

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.800
immediately see the result.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.240
So, for example, maybe I don't want an even number of pixels for within height.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.589
Maybe I want to change this 200 to 100.

00:01:58.589 --> 00:02:00.070
What happens?

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.690
Looks like we have more of an oval then a circle.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.820
And, maybe, I don't like the color green.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.008
But I don't know what color I want my circle to be.

00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:14.900
If I click on this little color square, it brings up a selection tool,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.860
where I can select any color in the visible spectrum.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.020
Let's go with blue.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.280
Now, go ahead, open this page.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.750
The link is provided to you in the instructor notes section.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.680
And play around with the style of the circles on your own.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.070
Particularly, take a look at what happens if you uncheck the border radius

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.230
property and if at anytime you decide that your change has got a little

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.550
too crazy and you want to go back to normal, you can just refresh the page.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.640
So, what did happen when you unchecked border radius?

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.940
Did the circle disappear?

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.820
Did the circle turn into a square?

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.820
Did the circle become smaller?

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.280
Or, did nothing happen?
