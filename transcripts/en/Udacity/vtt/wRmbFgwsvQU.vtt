In this case, it's better if researchers do not know which treatment the

00:00:04.022 --> 00:00:08.605
participants received. This is called a double blind experiment, because neither

00:00:08.617 --> 00:00:12.906
the participants nor the researchers studying them know which treatment they

00:00:12.918 --> 00:00:17.013
received. Single blind is when only the participants are unaware of their

00:00:17.025 --> 00:00:21.556
treatment condition. And the reason this experiment is double blind is because

00:00:21.568 --> 00:00:25.973
if the researcher knows which treatment each person received, that may impact

00:00:25.985 --> 00:00:30.316
their judgements on how well the active pill works versus the Placebo. It may

00:00:30.328 --> 00:00:34.522
subconsciously cause the researchers to think that the people who took the

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:38.827
active pill are sleeping better, and this might consciously or unconsciously

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:40.266
alter their measurements.
