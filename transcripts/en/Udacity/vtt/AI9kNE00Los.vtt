While the other technologies listed here are related to this ability,

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.940
and while you could argue that without the HTML source there would be no

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.170
web page to display, the best answer it the Document Object Model.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.420
The reason being that the document object model is the abstract representation

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.458
of the HTML source and allows us to programmatically interface

00:00:26.458 --> 00:00:31.740
with HTML elements, enabling the browser to create this link

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.101
between the visual display of an element and the HTML source tag.
