00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.333
We know the 7 is multiplied by 4x plus 5y, so these two are factors. The 2 is

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:11.080
separated from this multiplication by addition, so this is just a term. Within

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.247
this factor of 4x plus 5y, we have two terms, 4x and positive 5y. So, this 4x

00:00:16.247 --> 00:00:21.538
must be a term as well. And finally, we know x and y are both factors since x

00:00:21.538 --> 00:00:26.933
appears in the multiplication for 4x, and y appears in the multiplication for

00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:27.242
5y.
