00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.806
For the first interval, we would have a negative infinity to negative three. We

00:00:03.806 --> 00:00:08.501
use parentheses on each end, since we don't include these values. The

00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:12.940
right-hand side would be four comma infinity. This would be the second

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.705
interval. Be sure to include parentheses here, because we can't include these

00:00:16.705 --> 00:00:21.374
two values. Nice work if you remembered interval notation. And, just to be even

00:00:21.374 --> 00:00:24.668
more certain that we're right, we can choose any number in either of these

00:00:24.668 --> 00:00:29.716
intervals, and they should check in our inequality. So, if I chose x equals 12,

00:00:29.716 --> 00:00:34.862
I know that's between 4 and positive infinity. So I could plug in 12 for x, and

00:00:34.862 --> 00:00:39.770
then I would get the value 120. We know 120 is greater than 0, which means that

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.287
this statement is true. This quick check just reinforces that we have the

00:00:44.287 --> 00:00:48.118
correct intervals on either side. It's usually a good idea to test a couple

00:00:48.118 --> 00:00:51.777
numbers to make sure that you have the correct interval.
