00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.630
What's really cool about those examples,
is that you don't have to know much

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.620
about the problem that
you're trying to solve.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.800
All you need is data.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.740
Lot's of data.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.370
And computers.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.450
Lot's of them.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.020
And off you go.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.750
You can build a machine or
any system that often does much

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.540
better than specialized,
handcrafted approaches to the problem.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.720
So, here we are.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.440
With those tools in your back pockets,
you can now train models that can

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.850
predict from images, texts, sequences,
or any kind of data, for that matter.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.080
If you're curious, there's a ton more
to learn in the field of deep learning.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.940
Things also change every day as
new techniques get developed and

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.840
people find new ways
to use those models.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.080
Even with just what you've learned in
this class you have the tools to design

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.590
and train real models on real data,
so what are you going to try first?
