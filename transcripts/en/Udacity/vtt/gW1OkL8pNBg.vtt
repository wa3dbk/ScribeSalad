00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.049
Here's the original circle we had with a radius of 50 and its center was at the

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:12.088
origin 0,0. We want to have a new circle at center negative 10 comma 20. So we

00:00:12.088 --> 00:00:17.794
really need to move our circle 10 units left and 20 units up. This means in the

00:00:17.794 --> 00:00:23.095
equation we'll see a plus 10 next to the x. And a minus 20 next to the y. The

00:00:23.095 --> 00:00:28.200
positive 10 will shift our circle 10 units to the left, and we see that here.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:35.099
And the minus 20 will shift our circle 20 units up vertically. Notice too that

00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:38.838
the signs here are opposite. If we have a circle with a center at negative 10,

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:44.312
then in the equation we have positive 10 next to the x. And if the center is at

00:00:44.312 --> 00:00:49.271
positive 20 for the y coordinate, then we have negative 20 in the equation. If

00:00:49.271 --> 00:00:52.901
you feel like you're stuck, try creating some other circles with other numbers

00:00:52.901 --> 00:00:59.160
and see how the circles move. Are you moving up, down, left, or right?
