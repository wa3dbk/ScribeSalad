00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:05.087
So let's bring up the Z table. So here's our Z table, area under the normal

00:00:05.087 --> 00:00:10.834
curve. And we want this probability here. Well first of all, if 95% is here and

00:00:10.834 --> 00:00:18.258
the total area under the curve is 100%, then that means 2.5% is in this tail and

00:00:18.258 --> 00:00:24.587
2.5% is within this tail. So we want to find out what this Z value is when

00:00:24.587 --> 00:00:33.016
there's 2.5% less than that Z value. So let's bring up the Z table. We want this

00:00:33.016 --> 00:00:42.016
gray region to be 0.025, or 2.5%, so if we try to find 0.25, we see that it's

00:00:42.016 --> 00:00:51.832
here, at a Z value of negative 1.96. So this here is negative 1.96, and this

00:00:51.832 --> 00:01:02.262
total area up until this Z value is 95% plus 2.5% which is 97.5%. So let's look

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:10.585
for 0.975, and we see that it's here, at positive 1.96. If we found that the Z

00:01:10.585 --> 00:01:16.025
score here is negative 1.96, then since this is symmetric and mu is 0 standard

00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:21.380
deviations from itself, then we know that this would be positive 1.96, but I

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.133
just wanted to show you, using the z table, how they're symmetric.
