Let's do a quick exercise to check our

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.340
languages.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.090
We'll let sigma consist of
the symbols zero and one.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.360
And we'll let gamma consist
of the symbols a and b.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.690
For each statement, indicate whether
the given statement is true or false.
