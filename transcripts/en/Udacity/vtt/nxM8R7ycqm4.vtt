00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.640
The best option here is to use a computer based time test. Using a computer

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.860
based test, like this one, to test our reaction time is best because it gives

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.160
us an objective measure of reaction time. Now objective measures aren't biased

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.420
by the researcher like a subjective measure can be. For example, if I watch

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.700
participants then decided to rank their alertness on a scale from one to 10,

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.648
that I just arbitrarily made up. That wouldn't give us a really accurate

00:00:26.648 --> 00:00:27.484
reaction time.
