00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now speaking precisely.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
A heap isn't actually any particular data structure with some particular running time.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It's actually kind of an abstract data type. It's a data type that supports three different operations.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We have some kind of data and we can add a new number to say the set.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We can also ask, of all the numbers that are in the set what's the smallest that we've got?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And we can say, if you don't mind please remove the smallest from the structure that we have

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
doing whatever updates are necessary so that the rest of the operations can be fulfilled.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And we can implement these operations using ideas that we've already got.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So things like we can insert into a structure, we can ask what's the smallest element in the structure,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and we can remove the structure from it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Let's use this as an excuse to do a little review.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Here's two natural ways of implementing the heap operations of inserting

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and finding and removing the minimum from the structure.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We can do it with an ordered list or we can do it with an unordered list.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And there's tradeoffs to doing it this way.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.000
What I'd like you to do is, for how long does it take to do an insert into an ordered list of logn.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Is that constant time, log time, or linear time? Same thing for an unordered list.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
How long does it take to stick a new item into the list?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And finally, now that you've done that, we've inserted a bunch of elements

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
into the list and they're in there now and we want to ask the question,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
how long does it take to find and remove the minimum from an ordered list?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Is it constant, log, or linear?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Form an unordered list, to find the minimum value and remove it.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I'd like for each of these rows you should check exactly one of the boxes.
