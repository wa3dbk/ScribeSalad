00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And once again, a must be positive. If we draw the line, a is the value of y intersection, where x=0.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Remember, all linear functions are performed bx+a, so if x is equals 0,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and this term falls out, and we have y=a, so this is the value of y.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It must be positive, it's above 0 and b happens to be negative.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
For any graph that's from left to right that goes down, b is negative.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It's easily seen as x increases, as you make x larger, you make y smaller.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
That's a negative correlation as we'll call it in the future unit but the graph goes down.

00:00:35.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That's good. Now we understand a lot about this formula over here.
