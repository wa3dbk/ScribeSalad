00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.130
Now here along the bottom
a digital signal is created via

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.300
a calculation performed
on the data being sent.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.830
So it's unique to that message.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.860
It can then be used for two purposes, to
validate that the message was unaltered

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.440
in transit, and that it actually
came from the purported sender.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.380
Remember, the attachment was encrypted
using the recipient's public key.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.390
The signature is encrypted
using the sender's private key.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.240
The recipient's public key for
the message, sender's private key for

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.960
the signature.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.090
Since anyone can obtain
the sender's public key,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.460
anyone can decrypt the signature.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.060
Here's where people get confused.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.890
Keep two things in mind.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.740
The digital signature
is not the message.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.250
It is derived from the message.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.810
So once decrypted, it can be used to
assure that the message can be trusted

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.690
and that it wasn't altered in transit.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.340
The fact that it can be decrypted
using the sender's public key

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.690
ensures that it was encrypted by
the sender using their private key,

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.540
thus validating the source
of the message.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.340
Nowhere was the sender's private key or

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.500
protected health
information compromised.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.390
That's the essence of PKI for trust.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.150
Most people who aren't already familiar
with PKI find this confusing, so

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.250
here are some questions to
make sure you're clear.
