00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.573
So we're in great shape right now. We just came up with another strategy to

00:00:03.573 --> 00:00:08.728
help us solve some problems using logarithms. As you might have guessed, this

00:00:08.728 --> 00:00:13.000
is called the quotient property, and yes. If it works for natural logs, then it

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.025
also works for logs of any other base. The quotient property says that if we

00:00:18.025 --> 00:00:23.301
have log base a of A over B. Then that's equal to log base a of A minus log

00:00:23.301 --> 00:00:29.326
base a of B. And again, this works for any base a that we can plug in. So let's

00:00:29.326 --> 00:00:34.828
use the quotient property, but in reverse to find this. Log base 2 of 24 minus

00:00:34.828 --> 00:00:40.040
log base 2 of 3. First, write this as a single log expression, log base 2 of

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.709
some number. And then tell me what that's equal to, just as a number.
