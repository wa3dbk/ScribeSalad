00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.770
&gt;&gt; Tiled allows an artist to do multiple layers per map tile, meaning that we

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.475
can potentially do 10 draws per on screen tile. Sadly, our bounding view

00:00:09.475 --> 00:00:14.389
rectangle won't help us fix this in performance terms, so we have to employ a

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.802
new technique. Now, as you've played Grids, you'll notice that their environment

00:00:19.802 --> 00:00:24.722
is mostly static. Which means that we could, hypothetically, add export time

00:00:24.722 --> 00:00:29.686
from the map editor. Actually composite our entire map into a single image. At

00:00:29.686 --> 00:00:34.537
run time, this means instead of doing 200 to 2000 draw calls, we could only do

00:00:34.537 --> 00:00:38.563
one. So this is not necessarily ideal, having a single large image representing

00:00:38.563 --> 00:00:42.375
the background of our map. Because of the fact that that's actually a pretty big

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:46.061
image and it would take time to download that off the internet. Now, we can't

00:00:46.061 --> 00:00:49.836
deny the fact that this would help on the client's side for rendering. So, it'd

00:00:49.836 --> 00:00:53.553
be nice to find a way to mix both these techniques together so that we can

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:57.747
improve rendering and reduce download time. Thankfully, Canvas provides a

00:00:57.747 --> 00:01:02.169
technique called Off Screen Canvas Rendering that allows a single canvas to be

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:06.564
used an, an image element for future draws. So let's say we create an off-screen

00:01:06.564 --> 00:01:11.043
canvas. And in this canvas, we draw lots of little happy figures. Or happy

00:01:11.043 --> 00:01:15.921
trees. Later, when we'd like to actually draw this to our main canvas. We simply

00:01:15.921 --> 00:01:20.596
draw each of the elements using the draw image API. Passing into it the canvas

00:01:20.596 --> 00:01:25.051
that we composited before. So, if it took 300 draw calls to composite this

00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:29.723
canvas, when we draw to our real image, it will only actually take one for each

00:01:29.723 --> 00:01:34.086
time we render it. So, instead of doing 1200 draw calls, we only have to do 4.

00:01:34.086 --> 00:01:38.130
Which I think we can all agree is a good thing. Now, in order to support off

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.222
screen canvas, we need to keep track of a separate canvas for each tile that

00:01:42.222 --> 00:01:46.637
we're creating in our map. We've separated this functionality out into a canvas

00:01:46.637 --> 00:01:51.037
tile class. Now, the canvas tile class itself has some boundaries that we should

00:01:51.037 --> 00:01:56.129
talk. First, is its x and y value in world space? And its width and its height.

00:01:56.129 --> 00:01:59.688
Next, we actually have a handle to the canvas object itself. Or more

00:01:59.688 --> 00:02:03.675
specifically, a handle to the canvas DOM object. As well as the handle to the

00:02:03.675 --> 00:02:07.755
context for the canvas. The create element for this process should be given a

00:02:07.755 --> 00:02:11.991
width and a height. Besides setting up some initial values, the create function

00:02:11.991 --> 00:02:16.086
should actually go through and create a brand new canvas element in the DOM and

00:02:16.086 --> 00:02:20.336
set its width and height accordingly to the past in values. From there, we cache

00:02:20.336 --> 00:02:24.057
that handle, and actually grab a handle to the 2D graphics context for the

00:02:24.057 --> 00:02:25.319
canvas we just created.
