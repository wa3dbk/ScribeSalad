00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.760
Why don't we try an example using this rational zero theorem? Let's say we have

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.983
this function. f of x equals 4 x squared minus 4 x plus 1. Now, I know that,

00:00:09.983 --> 00:00:14.468
based on the rational zero theorem, any rational zero of this polynomial must

00:00:14.468 --> 00:00:20.434
be a factor of 1 divided by a factor of 4. Since 1 is the constant term in the

00:00:20.434 --> 00:00:25.998
expression, and 4 is the leading coefficient. Well, 1 has factors of just 1 and

00:00:25.998 --> 00:00:32.453
negative 1. And four has factors of 1 and 4, and also their negatives. And also

00:00:32.453 --> 00:00:36.784
2 and negative 2. Can you tell me then, what the possible ratios of factors of

00:00:36.784 --> 00:00:41.212
1, or of factors of 4 are? These are the possible rational zeros that the

00:00:41.212 --> 00:00:45.436
rational zero theorem says that this function can have. I'll give you one more

00:00:45.436 --> 00:00:49.435
hint. There are six different fractions that we should get. As always, please

00:00:49.435 --> 00:00:51.353
separate these answers by commas.
