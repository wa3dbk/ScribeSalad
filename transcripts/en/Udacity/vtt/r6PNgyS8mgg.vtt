00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.706
Now let's take a look at 802.11i.

00:00:02.706 --> 00:00:07.759
802.11i enforces access control and
the access control

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.626
protocol is based on another
standard called 802.1x.

00:00:12.626 --> 00:00:14.551
802.1x is flexible,

00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:20.460
because it is based on the Extensible
Authentication Protocol or EAP.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.180
EAP is designed as a carrier protocol
and it's purpose is the transport

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.710
the messages of the real
authentication protocols such as TLS.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:30.810
In other words,

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.710
you can implement a host of different
authentication methods on top of EAP.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.385
In other words,

00:00:36.385 --> 00:00:41.420
802.1x can accommodate a host of
different authentication methods.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.860
The more and advanced EAP methods such
as TLS provide mutual authentication.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.380
This means that it will limit
man in the middle attacks.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.728
Because it authenticate both the server
and the client to each other.

00:00:54.728 --> 00:00:59.220
Furthermore, this EAP method
results in key material,

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.070
which can be used to generate
dynamic encryption keys.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.653
That means the encryption keys
will change dynamically over time.

00:01:07.653 --> 00:01:14.050
In addition, 802.11i supports good or
strong security practices.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.120
For example, it uses different keys for
encryption versus integrity protection.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.834
And it also uses stronger
encryption methods.

00:01:21.834 --> 00:01:24.150
In particular, it uses AES.
