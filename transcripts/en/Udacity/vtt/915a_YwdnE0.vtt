In theory you could take an output image and use gamma correction on it as a

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:07.498
post process. I mentioned that there's a problem with trying to gamma correct

00:00:07.498 --> 00:00:11.476
if you have just eight bits per channel. Let's put a number on it, your job is

00:00:11.476 --> 00:00:15.173
to figure out that number. Say we walk through all possible channel levels,

00:00:15.173 --> 00:00:18.949
zero through 255 and gamma correct each value. Here's an example for an input

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.500
of one. There are few steps to convert a channel. First, if you convert to

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.380
floating point number by dividing by 255. Then use the gamma correction value

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.218
to raise it to a power. Convert back the range zero through 255, by multiply by

00:00:31.218 --> 00:00:35.022
255. Then round the fraction to get the channel number. If the input is zero

00:00:35.022 --> 00:00:39.290
this converts to zero on output. No surprises there. With one we jumped up to a

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.362
level of 21 on output. Level two jumps to 28. At these lower levels we have to

00:00:44.362 --> 00:00:47.134
boost the output considerably to get the equivalent gamma corrected value for

00:00:47.134 --> 00:00:51.905
display. Out of the first 29 output levels, zero through 28, we've used only

00:00:51.905 --> 00:00:57.346
three. Already there are 26 levels out of 255 we'll never use. On the low end,

00:00:57.346 --> 00:01:01.500
some levels are never used. On the high end, you can have the opposite. That a

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.964
number of different input levels map to a single output level. The question to

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:09.182
you is, how many unique output levels are there? I'm expecting an integer value

00:01:09.182 --> 00:01:13.256
and it's clearly less than 256. Use whatever means you like to figure out this

00:01:13.256 --> 00:01:16.810
answer, any programming language you like. This is an actual, real life

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.810
programming assignment. I personally wrote a little JavaScript program. I used

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.430
this bit of code to show me in the debug console, the answer it computed.
