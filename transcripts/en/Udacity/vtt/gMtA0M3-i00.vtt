00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.550
Now, how to do we achieve max-min fairness? One approach is

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.250
via round robin scheduling. Where, given a set of cues, the

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.020
router simply services them in order. The problem here is that

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.610
packets may have different sizes. So if the first queue had

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.219
a huge packet, and the second queue had a little packet,

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.070
and the third queue had a medium sized packet, then servicing

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.130
these queues in order obviously isn't fair. Because the first queue

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.570
would effectively get more of its fair share, because its packet

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.790
just happened to be bigger. An alternative is

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.880
to use bit by bit scheduling, where during each

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.500
time slot, each queue only has one bit serviced.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.310
This, of course, is perfectly fair, but the problem

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.290
is feasibility. How do we service one bit from

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.430
a queue? A third alternative is called Fair Queuing,

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.500
which achieves max-min fairness by servicing packets according to

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.380
the soonest finishing time. A Fair Queuing algorithm computes

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.570
the virtual finishing time of all candidate

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.240
packets, which are the packets at the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.690
head of all non-empty flow queues. Based

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.400
on these virtual finishing times, Fair Queuing

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.800
compares the finishing times of each queue

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.970
and services the queue with the minimum

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.720
finishing time. So the queue whose packet

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.690
has the minimum virtual finishing time is serviced.
