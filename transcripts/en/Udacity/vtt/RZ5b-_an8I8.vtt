00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.020
So for this quiz, I want you to think about why

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.010
we're so focused on how time scales with the size of

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.040
the input, rather than the absolute time it takes for a

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.460
particular execution to run. Check all the answers that are correct.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.980
So the first choice is, we want to predict how long

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.410
it will take for a program to execute before we actually

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.490
run the program. The second choice is, we want to know

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.690
how the time will change as computers get faster. And through

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.460
the entire history of computing it's been the case that

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.700
the computer that you can buy for the same amount

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.540
of money a year from now is faster than the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.840
computer that you can get for that price today. So

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.160
the third choice, we want to understand fundamental properties of

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.120
our algorithms, not things that are specific to a particular

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.818
input or machine. And the fourth choice is, we want

00:00:45.818 --> 00:00:47.980
abstract answers to make sure they can never be wrong.
