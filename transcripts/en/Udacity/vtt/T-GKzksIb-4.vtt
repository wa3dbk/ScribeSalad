When we compute lighting at vertices and interpolate like this, it's called

00:00:04.024 --> 00:00:09.104
Gouraud shading. Named after Henri Gouraud. Unfortunately our eyes are very good

00:00:09.104 --> 00:00:13.376
at picking out places where the rate of shading changes. Our visual system will

00:00:13.376 --> 00:00:16.978
even perceive creases. Which are called Mach bands. To avoid this problem, we'd

00:00:16.978 --> 00:00:21.096
like to compute the lighting more frequently. One way to do this is to increase

00:00:21.096 --> 00:00:23.504
the number of triangles making up the surface.
