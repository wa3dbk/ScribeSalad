00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.110
First, let's look at the simple example
of scaling an image in two dimensions,

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.830
which basically means I
have an image here, and

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.810
I want to generate another image.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.420
And in this case,
this image is twice as big.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.594
Again, we have simple set of things here
in terms of how I want to get x prime

00:00:16.594 --> 00:00:17.969
and y prime from x and y.

00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:21.495
Now let's think about what
would be in the matrix M.

00:00:21.495 --> 00:00:24.365
Basically, the way I want to do
scaling would be a simple, right?

00:00:24.365 --> 00:00:29.615
I would just multiply each component
by a fixed scaler, and uniform scaling

00:00:29.615 --> 00:00:33.785
would basically be when the same
scaler's applied to both x and y.

00:00:33.785 --> 00:00:34.668
The difference, of course,

00:00:34.668 --> 00:00:38.000
is if they're not the same,
you would get a different aspect ratio.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.300
So let's say if I multiply the, all of
the x's by 1 I would get the same width.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.560
But if I multiply all the y's by 2,
I would get a different height.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.447
So though similarly, you know, that
different aspect ratio would come in.

00:00:50.447 --> 00:00:54.089
So uniform scaling would only be when
I apply the same constant both ways.

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.571
If I apply different ones in x and
y directions,

00:00:56.571 --> 00:01:00.730
that would actually allow me to
now have different aspect ratios.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.318
So what does that mean in
terms of our matrix here?

00:01:03.318 --> 00:01:08.940
Basically, that mean is now we would
replace the M matrix by nothing else but

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.840
two scalers on the diagonal, a, which
would actually impact the scaling in

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.530
the x direction, and b, which would
impact the scaling in the y direction.
