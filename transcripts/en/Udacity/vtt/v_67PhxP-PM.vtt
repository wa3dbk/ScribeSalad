00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.530
Interestingly, we're not going to talk about a version of the prototypal pattern

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.060
that does not involve shared methods.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.750
When we were talking about decorators and when we were talking about

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.420
the functional class pattern, we examined the technique of using shared methods

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.650
or using methods that were defined in line in the body of the constructor.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.820
But the prototypal pattern really does not lend itself well

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.170
to the same examination.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.490
Why do you think that might be?

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.320
As I see it, function sharing via a prototype delegation is the very goal of

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.560
the prototypal pattern.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.080
If methods were defined inside the constructor there really wouldn't be

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.420
any reason to delegate the instances to any prototype at all.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.390
And that's it for prototypal classes.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.470
With all of this background information behind us it's going to be very easy to

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.140
understand the pseudoclassical pattern.
