00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
What you just learned is called a "P-controller" where P stands for proportional.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Here is a really trick question by which I want to test your intuition--

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
one that doesn't have a unique answer, but it has a best answer.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Suppose you do what I just said. You steer in proportion to the crosstrack error.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
That is, your steering angle is proportional by some factor of tau to the crosstrack error.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
What will happen with the car?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It never quite reaches the reference trajectory? It overshoots?

00:00:33.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Or either can happen?
