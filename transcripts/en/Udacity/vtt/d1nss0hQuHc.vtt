00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.436
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm mixing a punch mix that has 65% water with a punch mix that has 80%

00:00:04.436 --> 00:00:09.206
water. So 80% as a decimal is 0.80. I don't know how much of it I'm using, so

00:00:09.206 --> 00:00:14.138
that volume is x. Multiplying the terms together I get 0.8 times x. For this

00:00:14.138 --> 00:00:19.143
third percentage, we know that our punch mix needs to wind up being 75% water so

00:00:19.143 --> 00:00:24.010
I want to write this as a decimal. Keep in mind that we have 65% of a punch mix

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.737
that's water, and five gallons of that punch mix. When I multiply these numbers

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:32.967
together, I get gallons of water. So I have gallons of water with gallons of

00:00:32.967 --> 00:00:37.240
water should equal my total gallons of water. We'll check this in the end to

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.465
make sure it's true.
