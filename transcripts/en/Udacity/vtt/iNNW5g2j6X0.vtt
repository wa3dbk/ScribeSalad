00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.366
Volume. So, what really is volume? It's a word we hear all the time, but in math

00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:10.452
it has a special meaning. Just as we think about it in everyday life, volume is

00:00:10.452 --> 00:00:14.974
a measure of space, 3D space to be precise. So let's say I have a balloon, like

00:00:14.974 --> 00:00:19.232
this one right here. It's not inflated right now, it's pretty flat, not actually

00:00:19.232 --> 00:00:23.447
just two dimensional, but there's no air inside of it right now. To puff it up.

00:00:23.447 --> 00:00:27.888
So right now it's not really taking up very much space. However when you inflate

00:00:27.888 --> 00:00:32.484
a balloon, you increase its volume because it takes up more space. The volume of

00:00:32.484 --> 00:00:39.034
a balloon is hard to calculate mathematically. The volume of a box Is pretty

00:00:39.034 --> 00:00:43.605
easy though. Let's take this box, for instance. We can say that there are 3

00:00:43.605 --> 00:00:47.004
different lengths that we can talk about with this box. If I tilt it a little

00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:50.788
bit, you can see its height, this length right here. You can also see the width,

00:00:50.788 --> 00:00:54.948
which I'm going to call this dimension, and we can look at the length too, right

00:00:54.948 --> 00:00:58.906
here. Since this is kind of bulky to work with right now. I'm wanting to draw my

00:00:58.906 --> 00:01:03.964
own rendition on the tablet. So here is my very fancy drawing of a box. You can

00:01:03.964 --> 00:01:07.808
see I've labeled the length, the width, and the height of the box, the three

00:01:07.808 --> 00:01:12.030
different measurements that we can take of it with a ruler. Now for a box, the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.667
equation to find the volume is quite simple. The volume is just equal to the

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:20.294
length times the width times the height. In fact, I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:20.294 --> 00:01:25.384
label these sides with these abbreviations. So here we go, one side length of l,

00:01:25.384 --> 00:01:27.272
one of w, and one of h.
