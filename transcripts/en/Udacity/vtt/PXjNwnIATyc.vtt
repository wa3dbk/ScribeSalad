This brings us to the topic of creativity. We humans are naturally very

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.200
creative, and I'm not talking just about an Einstein or a Mozart. You and

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.660
I are very creative on an every day basis. You and

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.610
I constantly deal with our problems. And with dealing with our problems,

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.320
we don't just give up, we address them and most of the time fairly successfully.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.800
Now the goal of knowledge-based AI is to create AI agents that can think and

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.250
act like humans. So shouldn't we also create knowledge-based AI agents that

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.250
are creative? But in order to answer this, we have to define what is creativity.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.250
In lesson one, we saw how hard it was to define intelligence.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.370
Defining creativity is no less hard. But we will give it a try anyway.
