00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The next term I want to define is an event.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You might think of landing on the edge or landing on tails being an event.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We can define an event a bit more broadly that it's a subset of outcomes from the distribution.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So an example of an event would be landing on heads,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and landing on heads as an event is just a set of the outcome {H}.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We could define then valid for a valid coin toss,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and that's the set of outcomes {H, T}.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The probability of an event is just the sum of the probabilities of all of the outcomes

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
in that subset.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So the probabililty of an event A is the sum of all the outcomes in A

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
of the probability of that outcome.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So that should be enough to figure out, what is the probability of a valid toss?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I'll remind you that we defined the probability of heads as 0.49999,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and the probability of tails as 0.49999.

00:01:01.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So what's the probability of a valid coin toss?
