00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.150
Okay.

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.150
Let's start by looking at what
each of these platforms offer.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.480
Google Cast provides a simple
sender receiver typology

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.720
which allows developers to
create multi device experiences

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.790
integrated with their existing
apps on Android, iOS, and the web.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.650
Android TV simply takes Android and
brings it into the living room.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.990
This makes it a deal for
extending your existing Android app

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.240
to work in the living room whether or
not the user has their phone on them.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.490
You can integrate your service or
app with Google Cast, Android TV, or

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.659
even better both.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.550
Where to start and how to go further
depends on the type of service and

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.000
what platforms are already integrated.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.498
In many case you can then extend
to cover multiple platforms for

00:00:43.498 --> 00:00:44.818
the greatest impact and

00:00:44.818 --> 00:00:48.778
best user experience regardless of
what the user has driving their TV.

00:00:48.778 --> 00:00:52.810
The most common use case I hear
talked about is streaming media.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.210
Whether your app is on Android, iOS or
web your first step in building for

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.510
the living room is adding in
Google Cast functionality.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.444
Now this will ensure your users will
be able to stream on all Google Cast

00:01:04.444 --> 00:01:07.458
ready devices including chrome cast and
Android TV.

00:01:07.458 --> 00:01:11.309
Once you've finished adding Google Cast
support you can then extend your Android

00:01:11.309 --> 00:01:13.350
app using your lean back library.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.450
Allowing your users to launch and
control the app from their Android TV.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.500
Beyond this common use case,
it really depends what platform you're

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.780
already working on and therefore the
platform from which you're extending.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.670
If you've already got an Android app,

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.490
it can most easily be extended with a
lean back library to work on Android TV.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.420
In fact, many Android apps for
the phone, tablet, and

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.470
TV will all be bundled
in the same app package,

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.320
which simplifies the Google Play
experience for users.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.170
In essence, the TV is just
another form factor for your app.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.950
If you've got a web app, it can most
easily be extended to the living room by

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.150
using the Google Cast platform.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.660
The Chrome API takes care
of rendering the app and

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.700
then streaming that content
to the Cast device.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.880
If you've already got an iOS app, it can
also easily be extended to the living

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.960
room by using the Google Cast SDK for
iOS.
