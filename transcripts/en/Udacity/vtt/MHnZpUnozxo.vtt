Everything has been nice and rectangular so far. We've modified both the

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.600
polygon and texture coordinates, but in such a way that these both always

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.313
formed some rectangle. Now it's time to see what happens when this

00:00:10.313 --> 00:00:14.222
correspondence is broken. In this new demo, we can move the locations and

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:17.662
change the positions and u v's of the two upper corners. Let's start by

00:00:17.662 --> 00:00:21.446
modifying the position of the upper right corner. You can see how this distorts

00:00:21.446 --> 00:00:25.520
the texture. Now let's change the u v coordinates. This also distorts the

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.679
texture, but in an inverted way. For example, as we make v larger, the texture

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.378
distorts in a manner similar to what we saw before. An increase of v instead of

00:00:34.378 --> 00:00:38.621
a decrease in the y coordinate causes this distortion. Try the demo yourself,

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:42.392
and see what various changes do. When you're done, I'll ask you a question

00:00:42.392 --> 00:00:43.570
about what you saw.
