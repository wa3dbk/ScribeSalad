00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.000
The way we're going to deal with this is by pasting together the segments,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.240
leaving out the J position. In particular, we're going to say that in order for

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.520
the output to be a permutation of the input,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.820
in the case where, we don't have a match in the first position, okay? And

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.910
it better be the case that, the following two things are permutations of

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.240
each other. First thing in our permu, in, in our check is the tail of X.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.730
That is we're going to leave off that first element. And then,

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.900
we want to compare that permutation wise with the results of

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.010
pasting together the first segment of Y with the last segment of Y.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.360
So, we have left out the first element in X. And now,

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.280
we are going to leave out that same element in Y by pasting together the first,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.497
remember, which J minus one elements, okay? Then from J plus one to N,

00:00:51.497 --> 00:00:55.040
we're going to paste those together, leaving out the J position. And

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.020
we are going to ask the question, is the tale of X a permutation of that? Now we

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.120
know from our equality check, that in that J position, we matched the first one

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.840
of X. We've left that out. We've left out the one in the J position. And

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.260
we're now asking recursively the question about whether the remainder of

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.230
X matches is the permutation of those two segments pasted together.
