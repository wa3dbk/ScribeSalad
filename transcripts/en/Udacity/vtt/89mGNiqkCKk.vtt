00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.820
Welcome to Lesson 3. You've now learned four basic fundamental

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.420
concepts. Affordances, signifiers, conceptual models,

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.030
and system image. In this lesson, we're going to learn two more principles,

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.700
based on the gulf of execution. How do I know what I can do?

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.390
And the gulf of evaluation. How do I know what happened? This leads to

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.860
two concepts. Discoverability and feedback. Then we're going to take all

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.020
six of these concepts, and put them together. So in the

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.130
very last project of this lesson. You're going to actually build

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.620
something. Something useful. Incorporating all

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.810
that you've learned in the course.
