00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.683
Prior to the development of drugs for mental illness, people with mental

00:00:03.683 --> 00:00:09.125
disorders, as we mentioned in the last lesson, were often treated poorly. There

00:00:09.125 --> 00:00:13.078
were not effective behavioral therapies, or psychotherapy developed, to help

00:00:13.078 --> 00:00:18.184
individuals manage their symptoms. And therefore, many people resided in mental

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:22.848
institutions or state hospitals. In fact, by 1955 there were over half of a

00:00:22.848 --> 00:00:26.412
million of a people of the United States who were living in mental

00:00:26.412 --> 00:00:33.029
institutions. Then came the discovery of the phenothiazines. These were

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:36.395
initially developed as antihistamines, and they were first studied for their

00:00:36.395 --> 00:00:41.541
mildly sedating action. Chlorpromazine, that goes by the trade name Thorazine

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:46.085
was the second phenotiazine discovered and it was found produced calmness,

00:00:46.085 --> 00:00:53.532
conscious sedation, disinterest in and detachment from external stimuli. This

00:00:53.532 --> 00:00:57.501
condition was termed a Neuroleptic state and chlorpromazine was the first

00:00:57.501 --> 00:01:02.725
antipsychotic or neuroleptic drug. And these are used to manage psychosis.

00:01:02.725 --> 00:01:06.553
Neuroleptic drugs are strong tranquilizers that are perscribed for

00:01:06.553 --> 00:01:10.794
Schizophrenia. These drugs are effective for treating the symptoms of

00:01:10.794 --> 00:01:17.154
Schizophrenia because they decrease delusions and hallucinations. In fact,

00:01:17.154 --> 00:01:21.690
these were so effective, that by 1993, fewer than 220,000 people were still

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.998
residing in mental institutions. The dramatic decrease in those living in

00:01:27.998 --> 00:01:33.000
institutions was due to the development of drug therapy. These individuals were

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.150
now able to manage their symptoms and they could leave the hospital and live

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.970
with family members or in group homes.
