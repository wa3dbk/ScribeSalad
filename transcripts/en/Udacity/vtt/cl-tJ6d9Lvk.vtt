Benchmarks are very important to computer manufacturers. So usually there

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.600
are standard organizations that put together benchmarks suites for use in

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.040
comparing performance between machines. So usually there is a benchmarking

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.490
organization that takes input from manufacturers assistants, from user groups,

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.150
from experts in academia, and so on, and produces a standard benchmark suite,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.550
along with instructions on how to produce representative measurements. So

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.200
this is how we got TPC benchmarks, which are used for databases, web servers,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.850
data mining, and other transaction processing, so called EEMBC benchmarks, which

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.485
are used in embedded processing, such as cars, video players, printers, phones,

00:00:44.485 --> 00:00:49.560
etc. So if we're testing a processor for, for example, potential use in a car,

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.820
we would use the EEMBC benchmarks, not the TPC. And the SPEC benchmarks,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.130
which are typically used to evaluate engineering workstations and

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.195
also raw processors because these benchmarks, unlike the other two, are not very

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:07.630
IO-intensive. They're mostly processor oriented. So the SPEC benchmark suite

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.590
includes a number of applications, such as GCC, which represents software

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.700
development workloads like the compiler, several applications like BWAVES and

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.873
LBM that are representative fluid dynamics workloads,

00:01:22.873 --> 00:01:27.540
PERL which is representative of string processing applications, CACTUS ADM,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.700
this is a physics simulation related to relativity. This is a parser for XML.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.780
Several solvers of differential equations. BZIP, a compression application. To

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.320
game ai applications, and so on. As you can see the spec bench are really trying

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.100
to cover a variety of potential users for processors in high performance systems
