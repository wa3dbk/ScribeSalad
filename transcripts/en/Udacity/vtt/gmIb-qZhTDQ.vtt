00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.290
Time to add another type of
data structure to the mix.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.590
Before we dive into maps, I want to
introduce one new concept quickly.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.480
A set is another one of these broad,
abstract concepts.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.720
It's comparable to a list.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.360
It's also vaguely a collection of
things, but with one big difference.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.320
A list has some kind of ordering for
its elements.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.670
A set doesn't have that but instead
doesn't allow for repeated elements.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.380
You can think of a set
kind of like a bag.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.788
You can reach in and
pull something out, but

00:00:31.788 --> 00:00:35.513
you'll never know what order you're
getting the elements out in.

00:00:35.513 --> 00:00:37.821
A map is a set-based data structure,

00:00:37.822 --> 00:00:41.160
kind of like an array is
a list-based data structure.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.650
The keys in a map are a set.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.620
I know that's a lot of new terminology,
but

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.349
let's look at exactly what that means.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.530
The keys of a map, like the words
in a dictionary, need to be unique.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.620
You can have several definitions for
the same word stored in the value, but

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.730
if you had the same word in
the dictionary many times,

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.509
you would randomly pick out a definition
when you were first looking.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.700
Thus, each key only
exists once in a map.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.729
And a group of these unique keys
without any order is called a set.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.540
So what are maps useful for,
other than dictionaries?

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.600
You can use a map for
a lot of things that have unique names.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.510
For example, maybe you have a bunch
of information about Udacity courses.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.360
You could store each
course ID as a key and

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.880
use that to look up more
detailed information as values.
