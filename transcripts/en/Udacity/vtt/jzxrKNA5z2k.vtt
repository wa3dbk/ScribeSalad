00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.402
Let's start with the clearest match. The avalanche is certainly most easily

00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:06.970
done with simulation. Tracking all the small bits of snow is extremely

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.345
difficult with the other techniques. Of the remaining three, morph targets are

00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:15.386
best for making a troll frown as just two key poses would be needed. That

00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:19.336
leaves skeletal animation and motion capture. Both tasks could be done with

00:00:19.336 --> 00:00:23.058
both. However, it's a fair bit of work to get the center of gravity correct for

00:00:23.058 --> 00:00:27.810
a gymnastic flip. Motion capture would make this easy. Motion capture might be

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.380
able to capture a hand, but this can be tricky. Skeletal animation could

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.940
clearly handle this task.
