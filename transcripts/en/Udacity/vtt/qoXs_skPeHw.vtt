And the answer, of course, is Cookie. Now, of course,

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.222
generally, I've been writing with the ca uppercase C and

00:00:06.222 --> 00:00:09.340
that's how you see it around the internet. I case

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.660
actually doesn't, doesn't matter or shouldn't matter. But, I say

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.550
shouldn't because you never know where you're going to find a

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.314
web sever or, or, or browser that, that, that, that

00:00:19.314 --> 00:00:21.750
wants the headers or, or that wants the capitalization, you

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.590
know, like this, you know, capital C lowercase ookie. So

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.440
I would, I would, try again the habit of

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.460
using it that way if you can but that's that.
