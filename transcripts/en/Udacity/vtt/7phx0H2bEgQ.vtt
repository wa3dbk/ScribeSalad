00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.460
We're going to be using Google Chrome

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.160
and Google Chrome developer tools or dev tools,

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.400
throughout this course. And I recommend that you

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.980
actually use Chrome Canary. Which has all of

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.970
the latest and greatest development tools built in.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.170
And one more thing, when we capture all

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.850
of our traces. I recommend that you use

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.425
your phone, to actually capture the profiling data.

00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:29.010
&gt;&gt; Mm. Well, that makes sense. But, how do I capture this data with my phone?

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.550
&gt;&gt; Great question. For the remainder

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.020
of this lesson, you're going to get some

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.610
instructions from Peter Lovers, on how to

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.240
set up mobile debugging. And if you're already familiar, feel free to skip ahead
