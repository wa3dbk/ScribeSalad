00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.740
We assert the correctness of the
reduction with the following theorem.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.939
Consider a bipartite graph G and

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:09.780
the associated flow network F,
which we just constructed.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.328
The edges in G which have flows of
1 in a maximum flow obtained by

00:00:14.328 --> 00:00:20.280
Ford-Fulkerson on F constitute a maximum
matching in the original graph G.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.030
To prove this theorem,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.530
we start by observing that the flow
across any edge is either 0 or 1.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.630
Any augmenting path will have
a bottleneck capacity of 1.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.380
Remember all capacities are 1.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.920
So we'll always augment flows by 1.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.240
But 1 is also the maximum flow
that can go across any edge.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.840
The conservation of flow then
implies that each vertex

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.690
is in at most one edge that we return.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.900
On the left hand side, we only have
one unit of capacity going in, so

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.590
we can't have more than one
unit of capacity going out.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.510
So each vertex on the left hand side
will be included in at most one edge.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.300
And similarly, for

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.500
the right hand side, we have,
at most, one unit of flow going out.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.340
So we can have, at most, one unit of
flow going in, which implies that every

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.380
vertex on the right will be involved in,
at most, one matched edge or output.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.160
This means that the set of edges
in the original graph that have

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.120
flow 1 in the flow network
constitute a matching.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.940
Is it a maximum matching?

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.620
Well, if there were a larger matching,

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.150
it would be trivial to
construct a larger flow.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.070
Just give those edges flow 1 in here,
and connect them with out flow values

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.072
of 1 to the source, and the one on the
right with flow values of 1 to the sync.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.490
So yes, it must be a maximum matching.
