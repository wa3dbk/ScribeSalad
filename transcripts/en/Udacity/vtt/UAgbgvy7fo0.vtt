00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.210
You just made your first workflow. As you

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.380
saw, workflow actions fire depending on some kind

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.338
of event or trigger. When Barack Obama was

00:00:09.338 --> 00:00:11.735
campaigning for the President of the United States, he

00:00:11.735 --> 00:00:15.050
used salesforce. How might he had used workflow

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.200
rules in his campaign. Let's say someone signed

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.603
up to volunteer for his campaign. Maybe an

00:00:21.603 --> 00:00:24.460
e-mail would be automatically sent to the new volunteer.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.560
Or they could create a set of tasks to ramp up the new volunteer. Or possibly

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.620
they could use the volunteer's location to decide which campaign manager to

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.210
notify. Now Samantha and Andy will show you how to use approval processes, to

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.560
define a sequence of events that involves

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.090
human interaction in the decision making process.
