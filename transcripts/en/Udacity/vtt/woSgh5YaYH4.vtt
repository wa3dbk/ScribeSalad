00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.073
MainActivity is launched 
when you start the app.

00:00:03.073 --> 00:00:06.716
At the bottom of MainActivity,
we have PlaceholderFragment.

00:00:06.716 --> 00:00:10.170
PlaceholderFragment was generated
by the template we used

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.060
when creating our project.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.160
A fragment is a modular container 
within your activity.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.590
In later lessons, we'll look at how 
to use multiple fragments

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.340
in a single activity.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.830
And we'll actually explain why, 
we're using them at all.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.700
But for now, our activity contains 
just this one fragment.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.360
So here in PlaceholderFragment,
is where we reference

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.720
our UI layout resource, 
called fragment main.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.720
This XML file lives in the Resource's 
RES directory of our Project Folder.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.020
You can see other kinds of resources 
here besides layouts,

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.123
such as design assets 
or drawables, or strings.

00:00:50.123 --> 00:00:53.206
When our activity runs, 
it creates this placeholder

00:00:53.206 --> 00:00:56.420
fragment which then inflates 
the XML layout resource,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.496
converting everything in the XML file 
to a hierarchy of view objects in memory.

00:01:01.496 --> 00:01:05.402
By holding CTRL or CMD, 
depending on your operating system,

00:01:05.402 --> 00:01:08.454
and clicking on this reference 
to fragment main.

00:01:08.454 --> 00:01:12.606
Android studio will drop us 
right into the visual layout editor.

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:17.340
Once we're inside a layout XML file, 
we can switch between the design tab,

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.106
where we can drag and drop new

00:01:19.106 --> 00:01:21.672
UI elements 
and modify the layout visually.

00:01:21.672 --> 00:01:26.330
And the Text tab, where we can see 
and edit the XML that defined the layout

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.936
and UI elements.

00:01:27.936 --> 00:01:32.852
All of the views we'll talk about here 
ultimately extend the view base class.

00:01:32.852 --> 00:01:36.460
The template we used gives us 
a relative layout, with some padding

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.215
around the edges.

00:01:38.215 --> 00:01:42.000
We'll get into layout features 
like padding and margins, later.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.850
Inside our relative layout,
is a single TextView that says,

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.530
hello world.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.630
EditText, is a text entry field 
that is an editable version of text view.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.240
It has many options, such as 
whether it supports single or multi line.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.380
There are several styled versions 
of editText, in the text field section

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.956
of android studio,

00:02:01.956 --> 00:02:07.612
such as Name, E-mail, 
Phone, or Postal Address

00:02:07.612 --> 00:02:11.440
Each one sets the soft keyboard 
into an appropriate entry mode.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.580
ImageView displays the image 
defined in its source attribute.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.990
It has some really useful features,
like zooming and cropping

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.706
if the source file is too large 
or has a different aspect ratio

00:02:24.706 --> 00:02:27.092
than the image view itself.

00:02:27.092 --> 00:02:30.140
A list view is a special kind 
of view that contains one

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.490
or more view that are replicated 
to display sets of data.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.289
In this case, this single textView 
is used to display

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:40.069
the weather information replicated 
throughout the list.

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:44.429
We'll get into much more detail 
about list view later on.
