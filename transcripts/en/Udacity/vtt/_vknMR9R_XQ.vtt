00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.520
The classes, that, come with this course, such as the Picture class here, all

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.050
have an owner's manual. Here is how you can find it. Select the Tools menu,

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:17.070
Project Documentation. And a browser window will pop up. Here it is. As you can

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.470
see, we have the documentation of the Picture class. As you scroll through it,

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.140
you will find a method summary. For example, here's the grow method and you can

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.630
see it says resizes this picture both horizontally and vertically. When you

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.220
click on the link, a detailed explanation pops up. And here it explains that

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.450
you need to feed two numbers that are called dw and dh. And they're further

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.910
described down here. The first number is the amount by which to re size the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.560
width on each side. and the other the amount by which to re size the height on

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.720
each side. That's how it works for the classes that we give you. If you use a

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.880
standard library class such as the String class, you instead want to look at

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.900
the official documentation. I've made a bookmark for it and I suggest you do

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.350
the same. Here it is. On the left, you have a listing of all of the various

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.987
classes. They're many of them, most of which you never need to know. Let's find

00:01:16.987 --> 00:01:22.080
the String class. Here it is. Click on it. On the right, the documentation for

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.445
the String class is displayed and again, you can scroll through it. You will

00:01:26.445 --> 00:01:32.455
find a summary of all of the methods. There are many methods, most of which you

00:01:32.455 --> 00:01:36.970
don't need to know, and when there's one that interests you, you can click on

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.490
it and get a detailed explanation. You will have lots of practice with that

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.440
during this lesson.
