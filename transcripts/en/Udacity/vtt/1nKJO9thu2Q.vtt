00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.687
Here are all of the numbers that we selected in the last question. For each of

00:00:03.687 --> 00:00:06.652
these numbers, I would like you to check off the reason why it is not in

00:00:06.652 --> 00:00:11.978
scientific notation. Your choices are, it does not have a between 1 and 10,

00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:18.396
including 1, and not including 10, the base is not 10. And lastly, b is not an

00:00:18.396 --> 00:00:23.124
integer. Remember that general form for scientific notation, a times 10 to the

00:00:23.124 --> 00:00:24.019
b.
