And the correct answer is this guy.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and we want the value to be this variable substitution: "%(month)s".

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now we didn't talk about what variable we were going to use

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
but I figured you can guess it from our s here.
