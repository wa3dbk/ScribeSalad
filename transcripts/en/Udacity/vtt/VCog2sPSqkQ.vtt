00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Alright, how about this? We've seen just INT.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
One of our grammar rules is A goes to INT + string--

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
INT + string--and I've put the dot right here, so we've already seen an INT,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and we're expecting to see 2 more things.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This is consistent with the world that we've been presented.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We know that eventually this won't work because the full input is INT + INT,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
but we haven't seen that much yet, so we can't rule it out.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Right now we think this state is okay.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
In the future, we'll give up on it.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Similarly, one of the rules in our grammar is A goes to INT.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We've only seen an INT, so we could be in this state.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The INT is behind us. There's nothing in our future.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We're really hoping the input ends now.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The input doesn't end now.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
You and I know that there are 2 more tokens coming,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
but our parser doesn't know that yet. It's only seen 1 token.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
In the next step, the next iteration, the next recursive call,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
it will know and throw away this information.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
But for now, we're keeping it.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Alright, how about this?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
A goes to INT +--this requires us to have 2 tokens in the past,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and we've only seen 1 token of the input.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
That can't be true.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Similarly over here, there's nothing in the past, and there's 1 token to the right.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Looking at our grammar. There's really no way this could play out.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
We've seen 1 token, and this assumes we've seen 0.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Over here, similarly, INT + string--this parsing state only works if we've seen 0 tokens,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and we've already seen 1. So that doesn't match.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And in fact, similarly here, S goes to A. S goes to A is a rule in our grammar.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
That's a good sign, but this version requires us to have seen nothing,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and we've seen 1 token.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
S goes to A, and here we are.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Actually this could totally work.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
If I've only seen just INT from the input, then I could be finishing off--

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I could be accepting the string based on S goes to A and A goes to INT.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So I've already seen a full A. A goes to INT--and now I'm done with S.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Yeah! That's where I could be.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Now again, we're going to rule this out as soon as we see the next token in the input--

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that it's not the end of the string, but for now, it looks very promising.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
This is the big trick with parsing, I said earlier, we'd have to keep our fingers in many spots

00:02:08.000 --> 09:59:59.000
because until we see the whole input, we're not sure what the picture is.
