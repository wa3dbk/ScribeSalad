00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.840
Just to help us understand how we can do this kind of stuff,

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.450
I'm going to simplify this concept and

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.750
now showcase a simple way of how we can do a derivative of an image.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.410
Again, you've seen this already just a of the image itself.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.710
Now we're going to look at it with x, which basically means,

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.350
in a I'm going to look for a value, x plus 1, which basically means in this one.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.010
And x plus the next column, keep the y the same, and of course, I look for

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.750
the original column, x itself.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.810
And I just subtract that and that'll give me the difference.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.350
We have done this in the previous style sub lecture also.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.460
Let's just simplify this and look what we can actually do to

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.750
extract basically this concept of derivative as a local product.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.550
Those of you remember from previous lessons, local product, dot product, inner

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.650
product was something which was relevant in the concept of cross correlation.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.460
Here, I've just simplified this by basically multiplying the first term with 1

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.670
and the second term with minus 1 to get rid of the plus sign here.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.310
Let's rearrange this whole term.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.830
So when rearranged, now we have moved the negative term in front.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.130
And the positive term later.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.950
Of course we can rewrite this form as a dot product.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.980
Of minus and the 1 as a simple vector.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.970
And then, of course, the f x and the f x plus 1,y as the other one.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.218
So this dot product is basically now,

00:01:23.218 --> 00:01:26.990
in essence, how we could compute something like this.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.860
Now, of course, this is interesting because, in simple terms,

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.230
sometimes I could replace this dot product in case of images with

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.030
a cross correlation because in essence that's what this process would be.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.600
So this should start telling us something.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.050
This, for example, could be my kernel and this is my input.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.560
Right?

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.180
So looking at that kind of wave we can now start thinking about how we

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.430
can actually start doing similar types of processing.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.070
Now of course this is still a dot product.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.730
I'm simplifying this to kind of say this is cross correlation.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:00.710
We'll look at that in a bit.
