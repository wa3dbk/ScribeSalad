00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For this question, we have the same information that we had in the first problem.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Additionally, suppose Eve learns that Alice generated the key k

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
using a biased random number generator that outputs 0 with a 52% probability.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
What is the conditional probability now that m = 1

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
given that Eve intercepts the ciphertext 01?

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Submit your answer with four decimal places.
