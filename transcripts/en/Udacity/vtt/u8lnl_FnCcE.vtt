00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
So rather than just talk about this to death, let me use the example that we use throughout the lectures

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.450
and this is just the team that actually did this in five days not three weeks.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.120
There was a team at Columbia University called Jersey Square, and they were a rental service

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:23.140
for professional sports jerseys and in five days they did 169 interviews and had 190 people

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.100
share their website and they actually sold 2 of their products five days from a raw idea into a business.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.250
So on day one, these were their initial hypotheses coming into the class.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.030
They thought that their customer segments was going to be professional sports game attendees.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.070
Notice they were beginning with a series of hypotheses about their customer archetype.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.480
And they thought their value proposition was going to provide a cheaper way

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.880
to officially license sports jerseys to a game, eliminate the risk of owning a player

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.080
whose jersey is traded, and to provide alternatives to purchasing counterfeit jerseys.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.170
And their sales channel were going to be websites or stadium shops or ticket websites or direct mail.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.890
And how they were going to create demand was through search ads,

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.960
social media, and stadium promotions.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.170
And their revenue stream was going to be through an annual subscription model.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.160
So when they took a look at this day one canvas, the teaching team first said

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.570
"We don't even believe that there's market here. What's the total available market then?

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:29.130
Is this like a hobby or a business? And how do you know and did you do any real customer discovery?

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.480
And our skepticism really in fact infuriated these guys who they thought they were the main experts

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.440
because they were wearing a lot of jerseys.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.600
And teaching team, this is your job.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.390
You want to irritate them into action. We did this on purpose. Not by accident.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.600
We wanted these people to come back on the first day with enormous proof

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.900
that this was even worth spending their time, and they did it.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.580
They went out to Yankee Stadium in New York and found the most people in the densest area

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.290
they could who actually were potential customers and they spoke to 60-somewhat

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.120
customers just to prove to us what idiots the teaching team was by design.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.430
They didn't understand that that was part of our game.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.290
It's to get them to raise theirs.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.060
Now when they came back again, they showed us.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.500
Hey, look! There might be a real business here and it's even bigger than we thought

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.730
because it includes females and so one of the things we pointed out to them is it looked like

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.970
they had multiple customer segments.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.830
And this is just a teaching team tactic but when you have multiple customer segments

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.650
you have to have multiple value props and you probably have multiple revenue models

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.410
if not multiple other things.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.630
Just for logistics and just for you to be able to teach, we beat them up and said

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.110
you need to put these in multiple colors because it will force you to actually start thinking about

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.380
how each segment relates to each other.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.250
And so they got out of the building and again talked to different users or potential users

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.400
in different locations and now you could see they actually took our advice and segmented the canvas

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.230
into two separate colors because they thought there were two unique customer segments.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.290
And now you could see the customer segment sports jersey owners match the value prop

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.690
for sports jersey owners and match the revenue model and it's fairly easy to track their thinking.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:24.610
Now the thinking by now in this third-day duration it's a big idea for facilitators and coaches.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.220
It's no longer their opinion. They now have 100-plus customers telling them this.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.070
And life is getting kind of interesting because they now know more collectively than you do.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.260
It's actually no longer your opinion versus theirs which it was on day one.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.600
It's actually they're now bringing new data.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.630
Now it can be that they're just misinterpreting the data or they might be calling

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.310
on the wrong people in the wrong places.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.100
That's your job as the facilitator and coach.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.040
It's to say, Well, wait a minute. That's the wrong segment.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.260
Or gee, have you looked at your activities or your resources because you might have a great

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.740
theory on the right hand side but this thing won't pencil out if you just do the numbers.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.640
And so we push them a bit on day three and they actually went out

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.620
and started looking at the left hand side of the canvas because we'd beat their stuffing out of them

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.840
saying yeah, yeah, yeah this might be nice but there's no way.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.260
You know you're going to end up spending more doing this than you could bring in.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.390
And so they went out and actually talked to the left side of the canvas and they actually found out that,

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.800
oh yeah, you were right. It's not FedEx we want to use because that's too expensive.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.070
But we also found out how much we could actually charge.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.520
We had people raise their hands and say we could do that.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.940
And the other thing we push is that by the second or third day or second or third week

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.240
we want them to have launched their website or have their app up and running.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.080
And these guys did exactly that. Literally on the third day, they had a working website.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.130
And within nine hours, they had 81 visitors.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.220
Even though it was all their relatives and friends, it didn't matter.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.110
They now have traffic to a site and they actually received an order from the first customer

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.420
who wasn't even a relative, which was actually again another sign

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.020
of a teaching team standing up and cheering.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.890
So we literally all stood up and applauded and then we reminded them that the record inside of a class

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:16.050
was a purchase order for half a million dollars so they still had $499,000 to go

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.680
but it was a good start and of course it makes the other teams who were barely able to get

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.530
talking to customers understand what the scale of the game is and that you really need to be

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.180
playing this seriously here.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.610
And again, for facilitators and coaches, your goal is to keep the pressure on.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.580
You've got to keep it on. Be polite. Be respectful.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.820
But just remind them that the pressure you're putting on them is about 1/100

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.760
of what it's really going to be like in a real start up.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.110
And just understand, you're not trying to be mean.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.520
But part of your activity, if you remember, is to figure out

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.080
how these teams operate in pressure and it might just be that a good number of them

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.340
aren't suited for this stage of the company.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.900
What a cheap way to find out. This is a simulation of a startup.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:09.050
And your job is to make sure they understand that this is just a fraction of the 24/7

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.130
sleepless nights that they're going to be spending for the next couple of years.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:19.660
So you could see after five days, just five days, after talking to 160 customers

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.740
you could see how the business model evolved dramatically from something that

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.570
looked like this on day one to something that looked like this on day five.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.970
On day one, a series of untested hypothesis, a faith-based enterprise.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:40.640
On day five, the faith has turned into facts and this startup is on the road

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.440
to actually building something that customers might want.
