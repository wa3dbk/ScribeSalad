00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.750
In your book,

00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.280
you're talking about companies who
are painkillers versus vitamins.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.890
Can you talk a little
bit more about that?

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.800
&gt;&gt; Sure.
So there is kind of this religion about

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.008
vitamins versus painkillers.

00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:16.462
What we teach MBAs today, or what
entrepreneurs hear when they go out and

00:00:16.462 --> 00:00:21.436
try and raise venture capital, is that
they want to build a painkiller product.

00:00:21.436 --> 00:00:24.660
We don't want to spend our time building
vitamins, we want to build painkillers.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.240
Painkiller products are the kind
of products that customers can

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.730
tell you they need.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.340
Stop my pain.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.070
They have quantifiable markets, and
they're imminently monetizable.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.160
Vitamins, on the other hand, that's
a kind of product that people say,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.720
you know what,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.560
I don't want to back that kind of
project within an enterprise, right.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.850
Your boss or your PM will say,
no, I don't really.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.870
That's a vitamin feature,
that's not something we need to build.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.410
Let's build the painkillers.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.060
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.850
a reason that a venture capitalist will
say, we're going to pass on that idea.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.990
One of the reasons might be it just
doesn't seem like something really need.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.790
So that's the current way of thinking.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.420
I kind of challenge
that way of thinking,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.780
because if you consider some of the
products that we've been talking about

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.920
that are very habit forming, like
Facebook, and Twitter, and Instagram,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.120
and WhatsApp, these products
didn't start out as painkillers.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.500
Nobody woke up 11 years ago, in the
middle of the night, two in the morning,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.890
shouting I wish I could
update my status.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.160
That never happened
before Facebook existed.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.480
So these products that become
these painkillers over time,

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.070
they start out as vitamins.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.820
They start out as nice to haves.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.210
And they're frequently dismissed.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.070
People say, oh, it's just a little toy.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.670
It's not going to have a big impact.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.320
Well, it turns out that
by creating habits,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.020
by becoming these integral parts
of people's day to day lives.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.770
They become pain killers
as they form these habits.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.740
So today if Mark Zuckerberg said,

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.320
you know what we're going to
shut down Facebook.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.510
I've made enough money.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.850
I'm done,
people would have conniption fits right.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:47.674
They would have a big problem.

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:49.040
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; All of a sudden this product that was

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.640
a toy and was just a vitamin has all
of a sudden become a painkiller.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.690
&gt;&gt; And how do I know if my
idea is a painkiller or

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.680
a vitamin that could
become a painkiller?

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.240
&gt;&gt; Right, so it comes down to
figuring out if you have these hooks.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.160
You have very little chance
of forming a habit without

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.280
having this hook built
into your product.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.720
This four step process that takes
these pleasure-seeking behaviors and

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.480
becomes these pain killer products.
