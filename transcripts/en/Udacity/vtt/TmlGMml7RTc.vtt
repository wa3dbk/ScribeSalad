00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.540
There are particular regions of the brain that regulate hunger, and tell us

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.381
when we're hungry, or when we're full. The most important region is the

00:00:08.381 --> 00:00:12.578
hypothalamus. In particular, there is one important part. The lower middle of

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:16.976
the hypothalamus controls the sensation of feeling full. So in animal studies,

00:00:16.976 --> 00:00:21.130
when they lesion, or cut this part of the hypothalamus, the animal becomes

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.178
obese. Because the signal for being full is broken. So the lower-middle portion

00:00:27.178 --> 00:00:32.360
of the hypothalamus controls the sensation of feeling full. On the other hand,

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.180
the lateral area of the hypothalamus controls the sensation of being hungry.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.770
Again, in animal studies, lesions in this part of the hypothalamus. Leads

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.439
animals to become very, very thin, because they don't know they're hungry.
