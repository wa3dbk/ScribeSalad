00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.712
Here, x would equal positive 3. Great thinking if you found this. Now, the

00:00:05.712 --> 00:00:09.128
easiest thing to do is to think about writing this with a base of 3, and this

00:00:09.128 --> 00:00:15.859
with a base of 5. 27 is the same thing as 3 cubed. And 125 is the same as 5

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:21.710
cubed. Now that we have 3 cubed divided by 5 cubed, I can pull out a cube from

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.534
the numerator and denominator and just raise 3 5ths to the 3rd power. Remember

00:00:28.534 --> 00:00:31.820
that when you raise a fraction to an exponent, you can apply the exponent to

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.720
each part of the fraction. So this is an equivalent statement, for this. Now

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:45.040
notice, we have the same base as 3 5ths, so we set the exponents equal. x

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.043
equals 3.
