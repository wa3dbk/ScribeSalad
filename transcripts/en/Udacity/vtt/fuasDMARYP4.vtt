00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.960
As you can see the update function is pretty straight forward. Each time is

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.680
called we subtract 0.05 from the life time of this unit, and if time becomes

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.070
less than 0, we cal the kill function and then return. It's worth pointing out

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.884
once this unit has killed due to the other code we've aleready written. It is

00:00:15.884 --> 00:00:18.782
removed from my larger entity processing loops, so that update no longer be

00:00:18.782 --> 00:00:22.624
called in the future. It's also worth noting, at the end of the update

00:00:22.624 --> 00:00:26.752
function, we call this dot parent. This will allow the entities update function

00:00:26.752 --> 00:00:29.810
to be called, after we've done our local update.
