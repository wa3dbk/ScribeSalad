00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.120
Imagine a line of people all waiting to
get their hands on the best chocolate

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.310
pancakes in existence.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.410
The way this works is the person
who's been in the line the longest

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.970
gets her pancakes and gets out first.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.710
People can join on this end, but

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.420
only people on this end get
their pancakes and leave.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.520
You could perhaps call this a first in,
first out structure or a queue.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.118
A queue is kind of the opposite
of a stack in this way.

00:00:26.118 --> 00:00:30.799
In a stack the most recently added
element comes out first, but

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.590
here the oldest element comes out first.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.400
Otherwise queues are actually
pretty similar to stacks.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.780
The first element in a queue, or

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.000
the oldest element in the queue,
is called the head.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.480
The last element in the queue, or
the newest element in the queue,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.199
is called the tail.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.650
When you add an element to the tail,
the operation is called enqueue.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.769
When you remove the head element,
the operation is called dequeue.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.490
There's also an operation called peek,
where you look at the head element but

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.420
you don't actually remove it.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.180
Again, you can implement this data
structure with a linked list,

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.910
where you also save
references to the head and

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.380
tail so you can look them
both up in constant time.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.420
There are actually two special
types of queues that show up a lot.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.100
A dequeue or double-ended queue
is a queue that goes both ways.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.169
You can enqueue or
dequeue from either end.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.260
If you think about it,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.830
a deck is kind of a generalized
version of both stacks and queues.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.600
Since you could represent either of them
with it, you could treat it like a stack

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.910
and add and remove elements from
the same end, or you could treat it like

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.429
a queue and add elements on one end and
remove them from the other.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.400
Let's examine a priority queue now.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.790
In a priority queue you
assign each element

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.260
a numerical priority when you
insert it into the queue.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.450
When you dequeue, you remove
the element with the highest priority.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.500
This doesn't really follow
the rules of a normal queue,

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.850
where you remove
the oldest element first.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.640
However, if the elements
have the same priority

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.340
the oldest element is the one
that gets dequeued first.
