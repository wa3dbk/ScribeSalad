00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.495
As you might have intuited
from the exercise,

00:00:02.495 --> 00:00:05.697
some more cleverness will be needed
to make this process efficient.

00:00:05.697 --> 00:00:09.345
Even the evaluation of polynomials
at arbitrary points will

00:00:09.345 --> 00:00:11.690
take quadratic time.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.954
For each point, we need to do
a number of multiplications and

00:00:14.954 --> 00:00:18.413
additions that is proportional
to the number of coefficients.

00:00:18.413 --> 00:00:21.413
The most efficient way to do
this is via Horner's rule.

00:00:21.413 --> 00:00:24.250
You can find the link in
the instructor's notes.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.020
You can also think about filling
out the Vandermonde matrix and

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.150
then doing the matrix multiplication.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.290
Regardless, for arbitrary points, we
end up with the quadratic running time.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.340
Multiplying in the value
domain takes order (n+m) time.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.410
Since we just multiply the values for

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.550
the corresponding inputs,
xj, this part is fine.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.340
Interpolation involves solving
a system of equations with

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.920
n + m equations and n + m unknowns.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.525
By Gaussian elimination,

00:00:54.525 --> 00:00:58.091
this would take order (n + m)
cubed time in the worst case.

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:01.705
For Vandermonde matrices, however,
there's also a method called Lagrange

00:01:01.705 --> 00:01:05.740
interpolation that allows us to do
this in time that's just quadratic.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.470
Note, however,
that this still isn't good enough.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.500
In fact, we're at essentially the same
running time as we have for convolution.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.050
Is there any hope?

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.400
Well, yes there is.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.790
All of these running times pertain to
an arbitrary set of values for X here.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.560
But since we're only interested in
the coefficients of the product,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.390
polynomial C,
we get to choose all these X.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.400
And as it turns out,
this freedom is very, very powerful.
