00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Today, we'll be turning things upside down and apply what we learned so far about estimation

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and probability to solve some really basic statistical problems that occur everyday.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Today, we talk about confidence intervals and in the next class we talk about testing hypothesis.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
These are fundamental concepts that every applied statistician has to used pretty much everyday.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You'd better listen. This is my first example.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Imagine it is just about election day, and I know not all countries have election days

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
but I wish they did and I wish they were fair.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
In the United States, they have 700 million people that are eligible to vote

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
over those a section go and vote, but as a transition

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
you often wish to understand what the outcome of election day is before the actual vote happens.

00:00:48.000 --> 99:59:59.000
One thing you could is to ask every voter and then just report the results. Is this a good idea?
