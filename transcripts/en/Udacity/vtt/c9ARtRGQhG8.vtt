00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.563
Now we really found the inverse function here. But notice that it's labeled as

00:00:05.563 --> 00:00:10.350
y. And that could get confusing since I already had a y up here. Which stood

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.090
for my original function. Y was the output of this function. So in order to not

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.799
confuse these two. Let's label this f inverse of x. So instead of having y

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:30.389
equals the quantity x minus 3 divided by 2. We'll have f inverse of x equals x

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:36.502
minus 3 divided by 2. Now, notice that this is actually a line too. If we

00:00:36.502 --> 00:00:41.896
divide 2 into each term, we'll have f inverse of x equals 1 half x minus 3

00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:49.604
halves. negative 3 halves or negative 1 and a half is our y intercept. And

00:00:49.604 --> 00:00:54.426
slope hear would be positive 1 half. And I just want to caution you to be

00:00:54.426 --> 00:00:58.777
careful with this negative 1. This isn't an exponent like we normally think

00:00:58.777 --> 00:01:04.498
about it. This is just the notation for the inverse of a function. So if we

00:01:04.498 --> 00:01:11.361
take sum input x and we multiply it by 2 and add 3. To undo these operations we

00:01:11.361 --> 00:01:16.900
would have to subtract 3 first and then divide by 2. Now, that should make

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.500
sense since we're just undoing the last operation we did to x and working

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.270
backwards. So we need to undo add by 3, which is minus 3, and then we undo the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.632
multiplication of 2, which is divide by 2. Let's look closely at the graph of

00:01:32.632 --> 00:01:37.550
this function. And its inverse to see one more unique relationship. It's

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.756
actually one we've already encountered. Here on this blue graph, I've graphed a

00:01:41.756 --> 00:01:47.336
line, y equals 2 x plus 3. We have a y intercept at 3. And a slope of up two

00:01:47.336 --> 00:01:53.888
units, right one unit to get our next point of 1, 5. Now, our inverse function

00:01:53.888 --> 00:01:59.567
was 1 half x minus 3 halves. Or we could have written the equation like this. X

00:01:59.567 --> 00:02:05.575
minus 3 all divided by 2. It's the same exact line. Notice that for this line,

00:02:05.575 --> 00:02:12.325
our y-intercept is at negative 3 halves, and the slope is positive 1, right 2.

00:02:12.325 --> 00:02:18.358
Positive 1, right 2. So again, this was our original function and then this on

00:02:18.358 --> 00:02:24.446
was the inverse. Now what I want to show you is this line y equals x. Here's

00:02:24.446 --> 00:02:30.880
the black line drawn in. Notice that the function and its inverse are reflected

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.940
over the line y equals x. In other words if we fold this part over the black

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.713
line, we would get this inverse function of our graph. And if we fold this part

00:02:42.713 --> 00:02:46.867
of the original function over our black line we get this part of the inverse

00:02:46.867 --> 00:02:52.640
function. If we look more closely at a point like 0.3, which is on our original

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:00.263
function, we can find a corresponding point on the inverse function. This one's

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:07.796
3.0. Notice the x and the y coordinates have changed.They switched places. This

00:03:07.796 --> 00:03:12.834
is what's so unique about inverse functions. The x and y-coordinates always

00:03:12.834 --> 00:03:16.415
change. So if we choose another point in the graph, like negative 1.5, 0 for

00:03:16.415 --> 00:03:24.761
our function, we can find it on our inverse function. That would be 0, negative

00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:31.429
1.5. And again, the x and the y-coordinate switch places. Even for a point like

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:37.378
negative 4, comma negative 5, we can find that on our inverse. On our inverse

00:03:37.378 --> 00:03:44.250
function it will be negative 5, negative 4. That point is right here.
