Now that our code has worked, I want you

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.700
to think about the following two scenarios. What would

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.670
happen if we try to rename a file that does not exist in our folder? Or, if we

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.550
try to rename a file to a name that

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.410
already exists in our folder? You can submit your

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.620
answers on the discussion forum. After you've done that,

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.790
make sure to check this box before you continue.
