00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I get the 1.91, so if we take 26.97 ± 1.91.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We find that this claim over here is well within this confidence level.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
There is no reason to doubt that this would be a wrong claim based on the sample that we've drawn.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now again, just to pay attention here.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
In any given night there might be a reason that particularly young people come

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
or particularly old people to come--maybe on the style of music played.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Just taking a sample on one night is not fair as a statistician.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It should be really independent, so you should go and in on random nights

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and take a random person each night.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
But leaving this aside, I hope you were able to follow this.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
If you are, you're now able to test based on data hypothesis and accept or rejection.

00:00:58.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This is a very powerful technique. In the next final exercise, you get to program all this.
