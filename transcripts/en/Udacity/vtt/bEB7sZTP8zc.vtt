00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.090
So now let's look at what happens when we need to dispatch instructions. So

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:11.050
this is the situation in a cycle. Dispatch basically means to

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.940
consider latching operations results that are produced, and

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.010
also deciding which instructions are ready to execute. So in the same cycle,

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.830
usually we'll have both of them. So we will consider the situation where we

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.300
can actually, kind of at the beginning of the cycle, do this and

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.160
then towards the end of the cycle, actually choose among the instructions that

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.970
are ready to go. None of these instructions are ready to go.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.590
So if we did it the other way around in the cycle nothing would really dispatch.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.070
So now let's do it. What's going to happen is, when we broadcast the result,

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.920
we say which Reservation Station is producing the result. And what the value is.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.640
And now what happens is this. The reservation station who's result is

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.220
being broadcast know that this reservation station has already dispatched this,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.860
it was executed, it was broadcast et cetera so night comes back here.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.570
We're now going to free this reservation station base its finished its job.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.310
So the first thing we're going to do is free this reservation station.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.030
Now it's empty and is ready to receive another instruction that issues.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.720
The next thing that we're going to do is match this tag against each of the two

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.660
operands in each of the reservation stations. So what's going to happen is RS4

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.570
doesn't match, so we're not going to do anything for this. RS1 here does match,

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.260
so instead of RS1 here we are going to use a value of minus 0.29.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.620
For this instruction, it already has a value here,

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.650
so we don't have to match anything. But RS1 here does match so

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.950
we're going to take the value of 0.29. And here we have another match. Oh,

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.810
zero oh, this is minus zero, okay, minus 0.29, and this value's already here.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.320
So this completes, basically, what happens when a result is kind of being

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.470
broadcast as far as reservation stations are concerned. Now we need to consider

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.500
which reservation stations have all the operands ready to go. This one doesn't.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.940
This one does. And this one does. Because these are going to different execution

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.389
units, assuming that in each execution unit can take one operation per cycle.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.000
This instruction RS4 is going to execute in the multiplier. So

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.810
the multiplier for a while it will be busy with the, you know RS4.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.460
This is a divide. And it's going to be basically doing this over this.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.330
And then here. This one is not ready to go so the only one that

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.924
can really go here is this one so what we will be doing for awhile is RS3 minus

00:02:43.924 --> 00:02:49.590
0.29 plus 2.72. Once these are done,

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.320
they're going to broadcast their results and this cycle will repeat
