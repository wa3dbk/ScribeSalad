00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer is this would be an attacker who has limited computational power

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
but does have active capabilities.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Since they control the network, they can modify messages going through that router,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
they could replay messages, they could act as a middle attacker.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They have lots of things they can do other than just intercept

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and try to analyze intercepted messages.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
For most of what we're going to do, we're going to assume this threat model.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We're going to assume an attacker who does have limited computational power.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
That means we'll assume that encryption and hash functions

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
work the way they're supposed to.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Certainly that's not always true.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
They could have weaknesses that an attacker could exploit.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
But when we design protocols, we usually don't need to pick a particular encryption algorithm.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We're going to assume that we have one

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
that either is a symmetric or an asymmetric encryption function

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that has the properties it should have.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And we're going to assume the attacker is active--

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
that they can intercept messages, they can try to analyze what they hear,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but they can also modify messages and replay messages

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and do anything they could do to disrupt the protocol by changing things on the network.

00:01:00.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So that's the main threat model that our protocols are designed to resist.
