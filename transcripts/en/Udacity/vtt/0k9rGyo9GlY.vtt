00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
So, a couple of tips. Number 1: The Business Model Canvas

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.420
is a scorecard; it's not the class.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.050
The lectures are not the class.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.620
We're not asking you, as facilitators or mentors, to lecture in the class

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.790
but to do short summaries just to make sure everybody's up to speed

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.720
and ask probing questions to spur conversation.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.680
But the class itself is about critiques about each team's findings,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.390
from their original hypotheses to what did they actually learn.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.010
One of the things we do to make the teams feel great

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.080
is when someone actually gets physically thrown out of a customer,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.290
just remind students that some of the most aggressive teams

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.910
seem to be actually spending their time trying to get customer data

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.190
sometimes have been known to get thrown out of buildings because they've been so aggressive

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.370
or threatened with arrest because they shouldn't be where they are.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.240
We're not asking you to break any laws or do anything illegal.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.160
But you know you're pushing hard when somebody physically grabs you by the arm

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.160
and escorts you out of a place.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.000
Then you get in--then you get to show up at the class, tell us that story,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.440
and the teaching team needs to stand up and applaud that activity.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.770
That just means there was an aggressive team.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.520
And just remind them that we do not provide bail

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.160
or political asylum, depending on your country.

00:01:21.160 --> 99:59:59.000
But being passive is not the way to actually proceed with this class.
