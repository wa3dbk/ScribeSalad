00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.854
So if you remember from the original example, Pavlov was a neutral stimulus. So

00:00:05.854 --> 00:00:10.343
a neutral stimulus is a stimulus that originally produces no specific response

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:16.309
other than perhaps an orienting response, meaning the dog looked at Pavlov.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.989
Next, we see that Pavlov repeatedly paired his sight with the meat power, thus

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:26.912
the meat power was an unconditioned stimulus. Remember, an unconditioned

00:00:26.912 --> 00:00:32.616
stimulus is a stimulus that automatically causes a reflex to occur. The meat

00:00:32.616 --> 00:00:38.545
powder caused the dog to salivate. Here, the salivation is an unconditioned

00:00:38.545 --> 00:00:42.298
response. Remember, an unconditioned response is something that occurs

00:00:42.298 --> 00:00:47.286
automatically in the presence of a particular stimulus. Now remember in the

00:00:47.286 --> 00:00:51.334
beginning Pavlov was repeatedly paired with the meat powder. Then when he came

00:00:51.334 --> 00:00:55.818
by himself and did not give meat powder, so Pavlov became a conditioned

00:00:55.818 --> 00:01:01.390
stimulus. A conditioned stimulus is a previously neutral stimulus that comes to

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.636
elicit a response due to its pairing with an unconditioned stimulus. So when

00:01:06.636 --> 00:01:10.991
Pavlov approached the dog as a conditioned stimulus, It caused a conditioned

00:01:10.991 --> 00:01:15.212
response, and a conditioned response is one that occurs in the presence of a

00:01:15.212 --> 00:01:21.560
condition stimulus presented alone. So, here, the sight of Pavlov was the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.519
condition stimulus, the salivation was the conditioned response.
