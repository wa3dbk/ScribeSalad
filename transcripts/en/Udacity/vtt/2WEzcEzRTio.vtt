00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.158
So, it's pretty straight forward to think
about applying the negative sign to both

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.260
the x and the 9 when we're talking abut
subtracting expressions from one another,

00:00:08.353 --> 00:00:12.630
but what we're really doing here is using
an example of a much broader property. And

00:00:12.642 --> 00:00:16.321
that property is the Distributive
Property. So, we're distributing this

00:00:16.332 --> 00:00:20.380
negative sign to both the x and to the 9
when we say that we want to subtract them

00:00:20.392 --> 00:00:25.144
both from the 4. So, I'm going to show you
a slightly different way of looking at how

00:00:25.156 --> 00:00:29.199
to distribute that negative sign and what
distributing a negative sign really means.

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.733
First things first, we know that when we
subtract, like we're doing here, that's

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:37.666
actually the same as adding the negative
of the thing that you want to subtract.

00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:44.429
So, for example, if we have 5-3, that's
actually equal to 5 plus -3. Now, that may

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:48.579
seem like we're working backwards but hang
in there, this is going to be helpful. So,

00:00:48.591 --> 00:00:53.371
let's do the same thing here. This is
equal to 4 plus the negative of this

00:00:53.371 --> 00:00:57.570
entire quantity. However, when we're
taking the negative of something, what

00:00:57.582 --> 00:01:02.241
we're really doing is multiplying it by
-1. So, in order to get -3, we actually

00:01:02.253 --> 00:01:08.952
have to say -1 times +3. So, that means
that if we want -x+9, we actually need

00:01:08.952 --> 00:01:12.868
-1 times x+9.
You'll notice that I didn't write a

00:01:12.868 --> 00:01:16.537
multiplication sign between this
coefficient, -1, and the parentheses

00:01:16.537 --> 00:01:21.224
that's around x+9, because remember,
there's an invisible multiplication sign

00:01:21.224 --> 00:01:24.765
implied between those when there's no
space between them. So, I'll just get rid

00:01:24.777 --> 00:01:29.675
of that. So here, it's a bit easier to see
explicitly why the Distributive Property

00:01:29.687 --> 00:01:33.747
is being applied in this case. We have a
-1 that we're multiplying each term inside

00:01:33.747 --> 00:01:39.841
the parenthesis by. So, both x and -9 are
each being multiplied by -1. The

00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:43.810
Distributive Property basically says that
if you have some number or variable, let's

00:01:43.822 --> 00:01:48.112
call it a, and you want to multiply that
by some number of terms that are inside

00:01:48.124 --> 00:01:52.153
parentheses, let's just pick two to be
simple and call them b and c. And we'll

00:01:52.165 --> 00:01:55.964
just add them, although of course, c can
be negative, and you could be subtracting

00:01:55.964 --> 00:01:58.754
or b could be negative. If you want to get
rid of the parentheses, you'll end up with

00:01:58.754 --> 00:02:04.330
a being multiplied by each of these terms. So,
the a multiplies the b and that's added to

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.338
a times c as well. So, you can see why we
use the word distribute here. The

00:02:09.338 --> 00:02:15.238
multiplication of the a affects the b and
also affects the c. So, you have a times b,

00:02:15.238 --> 00:02:19.667
original operator that was between b and
c, the plus sign, a times c.

00:02:19.667 --> 00:02:25.212
So, if we use that property in this case,
we leave our 4+ and then we have -1 times x.

00:02:25.212 --> 00:02:29.871
Write the sign that's between the two
terms inside the parentheses, -1 times 9.

00:02:29.872 --> 00:02:35.942
However, we know that -1 times x is just -x and
-1 times 9 is also just -9, so we end up with

00:02:35.942 --> 00:02:42.519
4-x-9. And that is actually what's happening 
when we are quote-unquote distributing this

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.370
minus sign to both terms in here and then,
of course, we could rearrange and simplify

00:02:46.382 --> 00:02:47.226
again.
