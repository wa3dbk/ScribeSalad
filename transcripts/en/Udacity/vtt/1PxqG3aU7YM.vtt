00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.714
This ellipse would be centered at 2, negative 1. Good thinking if you found

00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:10.216
this point. This would be the basic ellipse centered at the origin. So, first

00:00:10.216 --> 00:00:16.206
we want to subtract 2 from x. And remember, subtracting 2 moves the ellipse to

00:00:16.206 --> 00:00:21.970
the right 2 units. Now, we just want to add 1 to y. And when we add 1 to y, our

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.550
ellipse really shifts down one unit. So, again, here was our original ellipse,

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.064
centered at the origin. That would be this equation. And then, we shifted it

00:00:32.064 --> 00:00:36.160
two units to the right, since we subtracted 2, and then we shifted it one unit

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.260
down, since we added 1 to y. Remember that these numbers are the opposite in

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.958
the direction. So, you might think negative 2 would shift our ellipse two units

00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:52.424
to the left. But in fact it shifts our ellipse two units to right. Likewise

00:00:52.424 --> 00:00:56.393
with y, we might think our ellipse would move up one unit, but it turns out our

00:00:56.393 --> 00:01:01.510
ellipse moves down one unit. This is the same idea that we saw for circles, and

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.220
it goes against our intuition. You want to be careful about it.
