00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.650
So, this is the state of the processor. We have some instructions fetched.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.360
This is the very first one that we will be trying to issue.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.760
This is our reservation stations, our register file with the values,

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.900
the RAT that says where the values are currently and

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.170
it's pointing to the register file for now. The ROB that is empty for now.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.840
This is a little table that we will be writing what happens in which cycle. And

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.300
then, this is kind of the legend for our reservation stations and

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.940
ROBs because we need to know, which field to put which value in. So in cycle 1,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.110
what's going to happen is, we're going to try to issue this first instruction.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.630
To do that, we need. An available reservation station and

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.510
an available ROB entry, we have both, so we are ready to go. It's a divide, and

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.870
we're going to write the divides kind of operation here. It's writing to R2,

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.950
so we're going to note that in the destination register over here.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.075
We're going to write the destination tag in the reservation station, that's

00:00:54.075 --> 00:01:00.270
going to be ROB1 now. Remember that. The value we broadcast the result with,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.430
basically the tag that everybody's trying to compare, is now going to be the ROB

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.720
entry number, not the reservation station number. That's what allows us to free

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.490
reservation stations very quickly. The R3 and R4 are going to be looked up here.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.710
We will find that it's 45 and 5, and write it here. And then,

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.940
we are going to rename R2, so that it points to ROB1 from now on. And

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.110
then because we said that we will be able dispatch in the very same cycle and

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.510
begin execution in the next cycle, we have issued this instruction Cycle 1.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.980
It's going to begin executing in Cycle 2 because both of its operands have

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.080
values ready to go. Now in Cycle 2 this instruction begins executing, so

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.490
the reservation station becomes free. Before I free the reservation station I'm

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.280
going to note that this instruction is dividing 45 and 5,

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.060
so the result that is going to eventually end up in ROB is going to be 9,

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.280
45 over 5. This instruction is not done so

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.780
technically this value lands here only when it's done but I'm going to note this

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.650
is what's going to happen because, I want to know what that value will be. And,

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.450
with that, this reservation station becomes free. So now what's going to happen,

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.370
this is a divide. It's going to take 40 cycles to do things so in cycle 42,

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:14.420
which is the 41st cycle since we began executing. We tried to write its result.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.450
That's going to be a long time in the future. Meanwhile, in Cycle 2 we're

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.785
going to try to do, the rest of the things. Can we dispatch something else,

00:02:21.785 --> 00:02:26.620
well nothing to dispatch? Can we issue something. Well the multiplication has

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.800
a reservation station and ROB entry ready to be obtained, so we can do that.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.870
It's a MUL of R1. The tag for it is now going to be ROB2. R5 and R6, are 3 and

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.000
4. So we have the values, we don't have to wait for

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.760
anything. And R1 is a result. Now we need to remember that

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.053
R1 from now on is mapped to ROB2. Basically, if anybody from now on wants to ru,

00:02:52.053 --> 00:02:57.080
use R1, it really needs to wait for the result of instruction in ROB2.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.680
So this instruction has issued in Cycle 2. It's gone up this batch,

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.150
also in Cycle 2 because it's ready to go. So in Cycle 3,

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.865
it's going to begin executing. And, with that, we have moved to cycle 3.
