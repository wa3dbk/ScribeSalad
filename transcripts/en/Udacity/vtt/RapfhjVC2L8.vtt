00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.660
Any sufficiently interesting project
is going to depend on perhaps

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.410
quite large collection of libraries.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.940
Maybe you start depending on just one or
two libraries, so

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.570
you just put their JARs in your project
directory and keep on trucking.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.400
You end up having a huge
collection of JAR archives.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.440
But then, what if a new version
of your dependency is released?

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.580
You'll have to manually download and
update the JARs and in turn

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.300
all of its dependencies and all of its
dependencies' dependencies and so on.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.470
This is clearly getting unmanageable.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.440
Another option would be to include a
list of your project's dependencies and

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.500
have anyone who wants to build your
project go and download them all.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.570
Of course, they would then have to hunt
all over the internet to find them and

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.840
they would have to check all the time to
make sure that the versions they have

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.470
Natural list of your dependencies.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.900
Brutal, right?

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.860
Of course, since this is a course about
Gradle, Gradle provides a better way.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.030
Most libraries, or more generally
artifacts, that you might want to use in

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.780
your project are present in various
repositories around the internet.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.720
Most prominent repositories are probably
made in Central and jcenter.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.900
Anyone can upload artifacts
to these repositories,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.410
as long as they include
the appropriate meta data.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.620
Every artifact in the repository
can be identified and

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.860
retrieved by a unique
set of coordinates.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.730
If an artifact has dependencies of
its own, that is also specified.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.840
The upshot is,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.390
Gradle knows how to retrieve artifacts
from all sorts of repositories and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.010
will store them in local cache to
make them available for your project.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.500
Not only that, but if you have multiple
projects using the same artifact,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.020
it will only ever be downloaded once.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.610
Gradle will also take care of retrieving
any transitive dependencies and

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.430
will even resolve conflicts when
different parts of your dependency tree

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.330
rely on different versions
of the same artifact.
