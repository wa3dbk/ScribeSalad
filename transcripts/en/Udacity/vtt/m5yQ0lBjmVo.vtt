00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.120
Here's a quick question for you.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.280
How many eigenvectors are there?

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.450
Not on the planet, in general.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.470
Okay?

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.450
Okay, well, normally for
a real symmetric, and by the way,

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.400
these things are ty, typically symmetric
because if you take a look here, right?

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.440
I've got the sum of the squares,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.170
but on the, off diagonal terms,
I've got the same, values.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.900
The sum of the cross terms, right?

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.350
So if I have a real symmetric matrix
in general if it's sized end by end,

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.410
I normally would have
N real eigenvectors.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.470
And distinct eigenvectors.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.860
There are some degeneracies if you
have identical eigenvalues and

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.370
then you have, ambiguity We're not
going to worry about that too much but

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.550
just remember that normally,

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.970
there is i say normally is later
it's going to be a little different.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.580
Normally with the N by N matrix,
im going to have N eigenvectors.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.300
So graphically,
we can look at that like this.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.840
So here i have a beautiful set of
points, aren't those delightful?

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.140
Distributed in two dimensions and

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.030
which way do you think is
the principal eigenvector?

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.590
Well, probably,
something along like that.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.610
Right, that's going to be
the axis of least inertia, right,

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.600
or of greatest variance.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.440
Get used to this idea that it's
greatest variance, and in fact,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.600
that's what this nice
little picture shows us.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.600
And this is showing us lambda 1,
meaning the first eigenvalue,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.060
large eigenvalue and
what direction is the next eigenvector?

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.922
Well as you know,
it's perpendicular to that, right?

00:01:23.922 --> 00:01:26.740
Cause eigenvectors are perpendicular
to each other, and go, and

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.650
the next one is the next most variance,
et cetera.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.850
With two dimensions, it's hard to show.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.000
There's only two here.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.350
Why am I telling you all this?
