00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.210
So this is the Mark IV Special Coffee Maker.

00:00:04.554 --> 00:00:08.400
We're going to assume that it is part of a series of coffee makers.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.771
It's the current one but it won't be long before the Mark V is coming out, so we

00:00:12.771 --> 00:00:17.144
have to be concerned with you know, the, the whole family of coffee makers and

00:00:17.144 --> 00:00:21.710
how things are going to change in the future. The Mark IV makes up to 12 cups of

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.800
coffee at a time. There's there's a filter that has to be filled with

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.490
coffee ground, and it has to be, the filter has to be slid into its receptacle.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:39.330
The user then supplies some some water in, into the water strainer and

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.440
presses the Brew button. The water is heated until it's boiling. The pressure of

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.374
the evolving system forces the water to be sprayed over the coffee grounds and

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.490
coffee drips through the filter, your standard, standard coffee maker.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.600
The pot is kept warm for extended periods by a warmer plate,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.970
which only turns on if there's coffee in the pot. You don't want that

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.890
baking in those grounds and being unable to wash them out in the future.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.010
If the pot is removed from the warmer plate while water is being sprayed over

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.040
the grounds, the flow of water is stopped, so

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.170
that brewed coffee does not spill on the warmer plate. Those are our

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.930
very high level description of what the Mark IV is supposed to be able to do.
