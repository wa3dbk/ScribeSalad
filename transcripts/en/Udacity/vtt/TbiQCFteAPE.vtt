00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.040
As we will see, one of the operating system's role is to control access of the

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.550
applications to physical hardware. So a basic understanding

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.730
of hardware components and how they interact is

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.010
essential to the course. Let's do a quick

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.660
review. What better way to start the review

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.780
than by a fun quiz. Now in this

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.450
quiz, I'm showing you the hardware continuum that exists

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:32.040
today in terms of the devices that you and I are using on an everyday basis.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.440
Smartphones all the way to the cloud and

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.650
a lot of data points inbetween. There are tablet's,

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.840
and laptops. There are desktop computers. There are

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.030
servers. And of course, the cloud computing itself that

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.840
you may have heard of, that is being

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.580
enabled by data centers. So this is a hardware

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.990
continuum that you're looking at. And the question that I'm posing to

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.255
you is, is the internal organization of computer system in this continuum,

00:01:00.255 --> 00:01:05.360
going all the way from smartphone to the cloud. Is this vastly

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.240
different? That's the question. And it's a binary answer. Yes or no.
