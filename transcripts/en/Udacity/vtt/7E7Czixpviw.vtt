&gt;&gt; How would you choose one number or at least a very small range of numbers

00:00:04.142 --> 00:00:08.961
that accurately represents the typical salary of Nursing or Geography majors?

00:00:08.961 --> 00:00:13.502
Would you choose the value at which the frequency is the highest? The value at

00:00:13.502 --> 00:00:18.121
which frequency is lowest? The value right in the middle of the distribution?

00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:23.156
The biggest value on the x-axis or the average? Choose all that you think would

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:25.883
work. There's more than one correct answer.
