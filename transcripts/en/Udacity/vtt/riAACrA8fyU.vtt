The code changes are pretty small though they took me a bit to get correct. The

00:00:03.664 --> 00:00:07.402
scale was easy enough. I modified the cylinder's x scale to be 1 quarter of what

00:00:07.402 --> 00:00:10.894
it was before. The z notation I originally applied to the cylinder, but that

00:00:10.894 --> 00:00:14.380
wasn't correct. That rotated the cylinder around its own center. This gave an

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.018
interesting result but wasn't what I was aiming for. The proper rotation was to

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:22.503
simply not rotate the petal itself as far along the z axis, rotating 70 degrees

00:00:22.503 --> 00:00:23.406
instead of 90.
