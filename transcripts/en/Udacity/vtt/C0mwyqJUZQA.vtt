00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
For the sum procedure to be useful and not do nothing,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.600
we need to change it.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.262
We need to add a return statement so we actually get an output.

00:00:07.262 --> 00:00:10.000
So add the return statement, return a,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and now we'll re-ask the same quiz.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.308
I'm going to erase the previous answer because the answer is no longer nothing.

00:00:16.308 --> 00:00:18.000
I guess I've hinted at that.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.815
You can cross this one out from your consideration,

00:00:20.815 --> 00:00:22.600
but see which of the others are correct,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.617
and I should note it's still a tricky question.

00:00:24.617 --> 00:00:27.063
More than one of these is correct.
