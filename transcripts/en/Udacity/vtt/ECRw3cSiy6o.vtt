00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.592
Let's zoom in here a little bit. We know that 95% of sample means will be within

00:00:06.592 --> 00:00:13.017
two standard deviations from the mean. Most likely, this sample mean here is one

00:00:13.017 --> 00:00:18.624
of the 95% that will fall within two standard deviations of the new sampling

00:00:18.624 --> 00:00:24.643
distribution, if everyone used the Bieber Tweeter. So, in other words we have

00:00:24.643 --> 00:00:31.271
this new predicted population mean. We'll call it mu sub BT for Bieber Tweeter.

00:00:31.272 --> 00:00:36.131
Our best guess for this is 40, but it'll be within an interval around 40, most

00:00:36.131 --> 00:00:42.531
likely. And we know that 95% of sample means, just of people who use the Beaver

00:00:42.531 --> 00:00:49.894
Tweeter, will be within this interval. Well, most likely, this is one of those

00:00:49.894 --> 00:00:55.250
95%. Let's assume that this is in that interval. If this sample mean is indeed

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.583
within this interval, then what could the population mean be? Well, if 40 is in

00:01:01.583 --> 00:01:09.464
this interval, we know 40 has to be greater than this but smaller than this. Do

00:01:09.464 --> 00:01:14.646
you remember how to solve inequalities like this? So, we're trying to solve for

00:01:14.646 --> 00:01:19.041
the population mean. So, let's subtract it from all three sides of this

00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:26.226
inequality. If we do that, then these cancel and these cancel. So, we're left

00:01:26.226 --> 00:01:32.434
with negative 2 times the standard error is less than 40 minus the population

00:01:32.434 --> 00:01:38.326
mean is less than positive 2 times the standard error. Now, I'll subtract 40

00:01:38.326 --> 00:01:43.813
from all three sides of the equation. So, here, we get negative 40. And now, the

00:01:43.813 --> 00:01:49.222
last thing we need to do is to make this positive. So, we'll multiply by

00:01:49.222 --> 00:01:54.580
negative one on all 3 sides. When we multiply or divide by a negative number,

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.842
these inequalities go the opposite way. When we multiply this by negative one,

00:02:00.842 --> 00:02:07.802
we get positive 40 plus 2 times sigma over root n is greater than positive

00:02:07.802 --> 00:02:15.418
population mean is greater than positive 40 minus 2 times the standard error.

00:02:15.418 --> 00:02:21.328
And now, we have this gorgeous interval. So, let's recap really quick. We know

00:02:21.328 --> 00:02:28.786
that 95% of sample means will fall within two standard errors of the population

00:02:28.786 --> 00:02:34.768
mean. We're guessing that the sample mean we have is one of those 95% that falls

00:02:34.768 --> 00:02:40.506
within this interval. And if that's the case, we're pretty sure that the

00:02:40.506 --> 00:02:46.458
population mean, then is between this sample mean plus or minus 2 times the

00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:47.833
standard error.
