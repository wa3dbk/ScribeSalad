Every since my first online Java program, back in 1997, I've been excited by

00:00:03.506 --> 00:00:08.087
the potential of the Internet to teach 3D graphics. Interactive 3D graphics,

00:00:08.087 --> 00:00:11.238
with speed and quality equal to that seen in AAA title games and high-end CAD

00:00:11.238 --> 00:00:15.820
packages, is now possible on the web. I'm also thrilled that we can now share

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.635
programs in a straightforward way. No installs, no compilation, and anyone can

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:24.187
look at the code being run. Udacity's motto is Learn, Think, Do. I find that

00:00:24.187 --> 00:00:28.112
perfect for interactive rendering. You don't need to buy a DNA sequencer or

00:00:28.112 --> 00:00:32.170
array of radio telescopes. You have everything you need at hand.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.398
Experimentation is easy and quick with 3js. The only danger is the risk of

00:00:36.398 --> 00:00:40.212
staying up till 4 AM saying, what if I twiddle with this parameter. I ran

00:00:40.212 --> 00:00:44.119
across a great quote from Confucius while making this course. Every truth has

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:46.918
four corners. As a teacher, I can give you one, but you must provide the other

00:00:46.918 --> 00:00:51.070
three. This suits my view of computer graphics. You can be given a firm

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.670
foundation, but you're the one who really needs to pursue knowledge and learn

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.793
by doing. Confucius probably meant something different. Don't forget you have a

00:00:57.793 --> 00:01:01.276
giant reference library at your fingertips. Much of what I found for these

00:01:01.276 --> 00:01:04.135
lessons consisted of me typing in 3JS collision detection and seeing what the

00:01:04.135 --> 00:01:08.762
search engine popped up. Developing any sort of interactive 3-D graphics

00:01:08.762 --> 00:01:11.934
program was out of reach of almost everyone 20 years ago because back then

00:01:11.934 --> 00:01:16.790
graphics accelerators cost the price of a luxury car. Now they're the price of

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.064
a large pizza. Even up until a few years ago, creating a 3-D application

00:01:20.064 --> 00:01:23.496
involved compilers and downloads and installs and once you were done, it would

00:01:23.496 --> 00:01:28.130
usually work on only one operating system. If you ran someone else's glorious

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.889
demo, you were usually less Scratching your head. How do they do it? The fact

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:35.039
is you can now make a wonderful 3D interactive that anyone with a browser can

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.139
access with just a click and can read the code that created it with just a few

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:44.418
more. How amazing is that? There's so much you can do, figure out what someone

00:01:44.418 --> 00:01:49.298
else's code does, write your own programs, write your own libraries. Even

00:01:49.298 --> 00:01:53.845
contribute to 3JS itself, and if you do, document it. Go off and do great

00:01:53.845 --> 00:01:55.950
things, and whatever you do, send me the link.
