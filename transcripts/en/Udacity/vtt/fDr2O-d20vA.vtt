00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Another graph type worth mentioning is a tree graph.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
A tree graph has two properties.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The first property is that the graph must be connected,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and the second property is that the graph doesn't have any cycles or loops.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The best way to understand what a true graph is is to see some examples.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So, let's have a quiz.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Here are 8 graphs. For each graph, I want you to check the box if it's a tree.
