00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.992
So you can see where a transpose might come up when you're doing

00:00:02.992 --> 00:00:08.259
array operations, matrix operations, image operations.

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:11.863
But the concept is generally applicable to all kinds of data structures.

00:00:11.863 --> 00:00:15.898
Let me give an example. Here's some sort of structure you might have, right?

00:00:15.898 --> 00:00:20.204
It's a perfectly reasonably structure foo. It's got a float field and an integer field.

00:00:20.204 --> 00:00:24.209
And say that you have an array of a thousand of these. Well what does that look like in memory?

00:00:24.209 --> 00:00:27.978
You're going to have the floats and the integers interspersed throughout memory.

00:00:27.978 --> 00:00:31.021
And as we will talk about later, it can be more efficient to access--

00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:33.199
if you're going to do a lot of processing on the floats,

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.703
it can be more efficient to access all of the floats contiguously.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:41.054
You're going to want some operation that let's you take your--

00:00:41.054 --> 00:00:46.720
what's called an array of structures representation, and turn it into a structure of arrays.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.777
And that operation is, again, a transpose.

00:00:50.777 --> 00:00:55.978
By the way, these two terms are so common that array of structures is often abbreviated AOS.

00:00:55.978 --> 00:00:58.908
And structure of arrays is often abbreviated SOA.

00:00:58.908 --> 00:01:02.368
You'll see these terms come up frequently in parallel computing.

00:01:02.368 --> 00:01:05.256
So, to summarize, the transpose operation is

00:01:05.256 --> 00:01:08.756
where tasks reorder data elements in memory.
