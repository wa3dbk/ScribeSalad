00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.859
Okay, now that we have seen an example of

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:06.342
instruction scheduling, let's do an instruction scheduling quiz. Let's

00:00:06.342 --> 00:00:09.422
say that this is a sequence of instructions that

00:00:09.422 --> 00:00:12.430
we have to schedule. And let's say that load

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.472
word takes two cycles, add takes one cycle and

00:00:15.472 --> 00:00:18.910
store word takes one cycle. The question for you

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.190
is how many cycles does this take to execute

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.460
as is and after instruction scheduling in the compiler this

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.885
takes how many cycles? On a processor that can do only

00:00:28.885 --> 00:00:32.380
one instruction per cycle and it has to do instructions in order.
