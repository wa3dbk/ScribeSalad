00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.021
We just said that the critical numbers of this rational inequality are 4 and 9.

00:00:05.021 --> 00:00:09.801
So these two values are going to split the number line into several parts, and

00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:14.883
those intervals, and these values are things that we can test to figure out what

00:00:14.883 --> 00:00:19.432
values of x satisfy this inequality. So I'd like you to start out by doing

00:00:19.432 --> 00:00:24.447
something very similar to what we did for quadratic inequalities. And filling in

00:00:24.447 --> 00:00:29.133
this column over here with intervals and values for x, starting the left side of

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:33.407
the number line and working right. As we did before with tables, I don't want

00:00:33.407 --> 00:00:37.593
you, in this case, to include critical points in these intervals right here. I

00:00:37.593 --> 00:00:41.862
want these to be noninclusive intervals. Oh, and one other note, I'd like you to

00:00:41.862 --> 00:00:44.682
write these intervals using inequality notation.
