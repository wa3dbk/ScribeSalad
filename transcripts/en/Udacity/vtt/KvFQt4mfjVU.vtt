00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.672
Try rationalizing this denominator, you can use the last problem as a guide,

00:00:03.672 --> 00:00:07.640
and think about what you would need to do to change this denominator so that it

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.148
doesn't contain a cube root. When you think you have the final numerator, and

00:00:12.148 --> 00:00:17.953
the final denominator, enter them here. Also, be sure to simplify if possible.
