00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.376
Two lines that are perpendicular to one another have different slopes. And not

00:00:04.388 --> 00:00:08.766
only that, but these slopes are different in a very special way. They also form

00:00:08.778 --> 00:00:12.912
a right angle with one another, as you can see that these two lines do right

00:00:12.924 --> 00:00:17.449
here. And lastly, they have opposite signs. For example, this light blue line in

00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:21.804
our graph has a negative slope. And this one has a positive slope. We'll talk

00:00:21.816 --> 00:00:26.382
more about these specific characteristics of perpendicular lines in the coming

00:00:26.394 --> 00:00:26.779
videos.
