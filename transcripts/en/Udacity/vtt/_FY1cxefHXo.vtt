00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.465
For this first term, we'll have 5 divided by 5, which equals 1, we'll have a

00:00:04.465 --> 00:00:09.254
cubed in the numerator and one b in the numerator as well. The second term would

00:00:09.254 --> 00:00:13.488
be, 8a squared b, we'll have a squared in the numerator, and one b in the

00:00:13.488 --> 00:00:18.387
numerator as well. For the third term, we'll have positive 3a, we'll have one a

00:00:18.387 --> 00:00:23.037
left in the numerator, and b squared, divided by b squared, makes 1, so just

00:00:23.037 --> 00:00:28.081
positive 3a for the third term. And finally, for the last term, we'll just have

00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:32.995
negative 12, 60 divided by 5 equals 12, and the sign is negative, so we need to

00:00:32.995 --> 00:00:37.813
make sure we include that here. Ab Squared divided by ab squared would just

00:00:37.813 --> 00:00:42.706
equal 1, that's why we're only left with negative 12. This would be our answer

00:00:42.706 --> 00:00:44.335
to our division problem.
