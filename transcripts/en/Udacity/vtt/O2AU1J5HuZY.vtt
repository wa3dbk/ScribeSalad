00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now let's look more closely on what's actually in a certificate,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and we can double click in our browser, depending on the browser.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You're either clicking on the key or clicking on the name, and we can see that

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
our certificate is telling us we're connected to google.com, and the connection is encrypted.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
When we look at more information, we can see more about the certificate,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and we can view the certificate.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Let's look at the details of the certificate, and we can see many things here.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We'll look at several of them. The first is the hierarchy.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We'll talk about that later. That's what give us confidence in the certificate.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Let's look more closely what's in the certificate,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and I've zoomed the window to make it easier to see.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The fields of the certificate are the contents, so you can see it's got a version.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It's got an issuer. Issuer indicates who issued the certificate.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
In this case, Thawte, which is now owned by VeriSign.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It's got an expiration time.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It's got the time it was valid from until the time it was valid to.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Then it has the subject, which gives us the name of the owner of the certificate,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
which is google.com, and then we can see the public key information.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It says the algorithm of the public key is,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
which is using RSA Encryption, and we talked about PKCS in unit 4

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
That's the way of padding to provide security when using RSA,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and we can see the public key.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We can see the modulus is 1024 bits.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
That's long enough to be secure with the recommended RSA key sizes today,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and then we can see the exponent, and we see that it's a small exponent.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
This is a popular exponent. Many keys use this.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And we talked about, when we look at RSA,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that it's okay that the public key has a small exponent.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
What we need is to know that the exponent for the secret key is hard to determine,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
so that must be a large number, but the public key can have a small exponent.
