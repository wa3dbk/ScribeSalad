00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.134
Say I apply a uniform scale to an object centered at the origin and then

00:00:04.134 --> 00:00:08.510
translate it. That's case A. I start again and apply the translation first to

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.484
the object then scale it. That's case B. Assuming that the scale and translation

00:00:12.484 --> 00:00:16.170
factors actually do something. I'm not scaling by one or moving zero feet or

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.634
anything like that. Mark any of the following that are always true. First,

00:00:19.634 --> 00:00:24.430
neither object's center has moved from the origin. The object is the same size

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.643
in both cases. The object's is in the same position in both cases. The object's

00:00:28.643 --> 00:00:31.533
center has moved farther in case B than in case A.
