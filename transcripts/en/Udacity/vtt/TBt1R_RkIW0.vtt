00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.380
In fact, the t-statistic I gave you is the one that we get when we do a

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.870
hypothesis test for the plane flight distance versus cost that we talked about

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.820
earlier. When we do linear regression in R, the statistical program that I've

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.700
briefly mentioned before, this is the output. Usually, you'll do software to do

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.760
any type of hypothesis test. Whether it's on a sample mean or two sample means

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.050
or the correlation coefficient or the slope, or whatever. The important thing

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.369
is that you understand the meaning of the software output. Here you see the t

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.540
value for this slope is pretty big, 5.77, the same value I gave you earlier,

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.220
and the p-value is pretty small. There are three stars by it, indicating that

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.510
the p-value is small enough to reject the null. Here are the significance

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.950
codes, which list the alpha levels. We see that three stars means we can reject

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.270
the null at the significance level of point 0.001. Since this slop is

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.990
significant, we know there's a true relationship between the distance traveled

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.160
and the cost of the ticket. Note that we can also conduct a hypothesis test on

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.220
the Y intercept, and in this case we see that's its not significant. The p

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.250
value is pretty high at 0.2 and there are no starts by it. This means that

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:25.840
we're not totally sure that the true intercept is at 161.38775. However, in

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.930
many cases, the estimate for the intercept is not of interest to researchers.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.841
One reason is that this value could have no meaning in real life. Because x

00:01:36.841 --> 00:01:43.010
equals 0 may not be realistic. For example, the price of iPods at the year zero

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.070
AD. iPods weren't even invented back then.
