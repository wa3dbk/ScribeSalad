00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.284
We would need to add 16 in order to complete the square. Remember that to

00:00:04.284 --> 00:00:09.710
complete the square, we always add the amount b divided by 2 squared. The b

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.985
value here is the coefficient in front of the x term or negative 8, so b

00:00:13.985 --> 00:00:21.284
divided by 2 would be negative 4, and when we square this result we get 16. So,

00:00:21.284 --> 00:00:24.670
we add 16 in order to complete our square.
