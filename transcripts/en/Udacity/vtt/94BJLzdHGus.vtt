00:00:00.171 --> 00:00:04.542
When you meet with your architects and you talk about, oh, let's design the next generation processor,

00:00:04.542 --> 00:00:08.880
what are really the design constraints that you think are at the top of the list?

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.528
Certainly, power's going to be number one for sure.

00:00:11.528 --> 00:00:15.438
Energy efficiency is always the number one design constraint.

00:00:15.438 --> 00:00:21.236
Very closely behind it, though, is programability and range of applications.

00:00:21.236 --> 00:00:23.928
Again, sports re-divergence is a good example of that.

00:00:23.928 --> 00:00:28.763
We want to have both a control structure and a memory system that will run diverge codes well

00:00:28.763 --> 00:00:31.064
because that'll give us a broader range of applications.

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:36.207
Then we'll look at programability, and it's not just being able to write the program and get it to function.

00:00:36.207 --> 00:00:42.120
But to get a large fraction of the absolute performance you can get out of the machines without undue effort.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.451
And a lot of this is removing performance surprises from the architecture.

00:00:46.451 --> 00:00:50.384
So that if you write the code in the very straightforward way, you'll actually get pretty good performance.

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:52.785
It won't be awful and then you'll have to sit there,

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:55.786
trying to deeply understand some obscure fact in the memory system

00:00:55.786 --> 00:00:58.327
to figure out why you've fallen off a performance cliff.

00:00:58.327 --> 00:01:01.295
And that's something that's changed really an enormous amount in the last 5 years.

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:05.449
The cliffs for GPUs have historically been steeper than for CPUs,

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.449
but they're getting much flatter as a result of the work you guys are doing.
