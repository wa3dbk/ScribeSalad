00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We can find the answer to this question right within our environment.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We first just run the initialization--that is just passing a string in here and we just run

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and nothing happens, no error message, so this is just fine.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It's actually possible to pass a string object here.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now, when we try to print it out and run this whole thing, we get an error message

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
because now what we have is that the format up here is no longer appropriate

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
for an object of type string--that is Python does not know how to format a string

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
with two digits with a leading zero.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
As you see, as soon as we are printing out the object, we get an error

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and therefore, the correct answer here is we get an error while printing.
