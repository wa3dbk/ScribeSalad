00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's say we have an array
representing the contents of a bag.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.410
In Objective-C, arrays are not typed.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.660
Instead, every item in
an array is a type ID.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.029
That means we can fill up our bag
with all different kinds of objects,

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:13.852
a bowling ball.

00:00:13.852 --> 00:00:17.641
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:18.686
A lamp.

00:00:18.686 --> 00:00:23.654
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:23.654 --> 00:00:28.414
A string and hey one more lamp.

00:00:28.414 --> 00:00:38.477
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:38.477 --> 00:00:41.950
Now, let's say we want to randomly
grab an item from our bag.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.115
We'll do that by generating
a random number first.

00:00:44.115 --> 00:00:45.630
[INAUDIBLE] Now,

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.510
at compile time, we don't know what
class our mystery item belongs to.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.690
It's marked with a type ID.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.650
At runtime,
we can get a little more information.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.610
If we throw a log statement in there,

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.410
we can see in the console that the class
of our mystery item is a lamp.
