00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.524
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Here is yet another expression, in particular, a quadratic polynomial. But

00:00:04.524 --> 00:00:08.996
this time the coefficient of the x squared term isn't just a 1. It's a 2.

00:00:08.996 --> 00:00:13.601
Because this coefficient is no longer a 1, we run the risk of having all three

00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:18.127
terms here have a common factor other than 1, a factor that we can pull out of

00:00:18.127 --> 00:00:22.505
the entire expression. I'd like you to rewrite this expression with the greatest

00:00:22.505 --> 00:00:26.345
common factor that all three terms share pulled out of the expression and the

00:00:26.345 --> 00:00:29.498
rest of the expression that it multiplies in the second box.
