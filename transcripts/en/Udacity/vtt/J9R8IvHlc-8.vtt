You'll now run 3 demo programs that show different rendering modes. In true

00:00:03.796 --> 00:00:07.754
computer science fashion, we'll call them number 0, number 1 and number 2. When

00:00:07.754 --> 00:00:11.240
you move the mouse, you'll change your view of the world. The objects themselves

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.818
don't change position. Look at each demo carefully, as you will have to answer a

00:00:14.818 --> 00:00:16.727
tricky question about the last two demos.
