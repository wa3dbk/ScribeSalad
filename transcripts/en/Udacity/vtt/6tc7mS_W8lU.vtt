00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.558
So, we said earlier that Grant spends the
same amount of money every month, which

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:09.192
means that the total amount of money that
he spent will increase incrementally as

00:00:09.204 --> 00:00:13.586
each month goes by. We know then at the
total amount of money spent can't just be

00:00:13.598 --> 00:00:17.965
equal to the money spent each month Our
answer down here has to involve time too.

00:00:18.057 --> 00:00:21.855
For example, after one year Grant will
have spent way more money than he had

00:00:21.867 --> 00:00:26.130
after just one month of being in business.
So that means that this first answer right

00:00:26.142 --> 00:00:30.215
here can't be right, because it doesn't
involve time. However since we know that

00:00:30.227 --> 00:00:34.449
the same amount of money is spent each
month, the second trace rate one here is

00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:38.755
the correct one. It says that the total
amount of money spent after a certain

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:43.458
amount of time is equal to the money spent
each month times the number of months that

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.099
have gone by. These 2 bottom answers don't
involve the amount of money that Grant is

00:00:48.111 --> 00:00:52.616
spending, so we can just eliminate them
also for good measure. Great job on this

00:00:52.628 --> 00:00:52.889
quiz.
