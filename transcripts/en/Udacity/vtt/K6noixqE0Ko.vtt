00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.733
So, we saw that we could get three solutions when we have a third power for a

00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:08.144
variable. In this case the three solutions were all different. But sometimes we

00:00:08.144 --> 00:00:12.639
can get the same solution more than once. For example, in this equation, one of

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.613
the solutions will be repeated. Do you think you can find what they are?
