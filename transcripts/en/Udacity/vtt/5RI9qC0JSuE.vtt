00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.680
Now this pseudocode that you're looking at, is very similar

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.580
to the pseudocode for verifying your credit card number. The

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.230
pseudocode for verifying your credit card starts by setting n

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.610
and sum, and it also sets a count. Then for each

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.720
digit, again starting from the right, it increments the count,

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.830
and then uses the count to determine what to do with

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.150
the digit. If the count is odd, then the digit

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.530
gets added to the sum. Otherwise, if the count is even,

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.520
then it matters how big the digit is. If the

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.400
digit is less than five, then we add two times the

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.500
digit to the sum. Otherwise, if the count is even and

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.220
the digit is five or greater, then we add two times

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.910
the digit to the sum, and subtract nine. And then,

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.410
if the last digit of the sum is zero, the card

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.860
number is valid. How would you write Java code for this?

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.600
There's a lot going on here, so first let's do one

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.910
part of it. How would you change the code for summing all of the digits, so that

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.600
it only sums every other digit, starting with the rightmost? I'd like you to

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.400
complete the sum certain digits method, which given a number like,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.809
12,345 would return 5 plus 3 plus 1. And for a number

00:01:10.809 --> 00:01:16.230
like 6,789, would return 9 plus 7. I'll give

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.330
you the code for summing all the digits to start with. And there will be

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.050
some hint links above the submit button, to

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.480
hint videos in case you'd like a boost.
