00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay, so what we're going to do intuitively is

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
we're going to add a new vertex to the graph, and then we're going to add an edge

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
from all of the current vertices in the graph to the new  vertex.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And then we're simply going to return the result

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
of graph is 4colorable of this new graph.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So we construct a new graph, which is just an empty list in this case,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and then for every node in the original graph, we add in an additional 1.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Since this is an adjacency matrix, that means that there is an additional vertex

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that every single node in this graph is connected to, like I just said.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We're going to append this new node to  each row in the adjacency matrix.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Then, we're going to append a column of 1's at the end of this graph

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
of the adjacency matrix, and this represents the vertex that is connected to

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
every other vertex, which is what we've just constructed.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And then we take this new graph, and we simply run it through graph is 4colorable.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So we've reduced the 3colorable problem to the 4colorable problem.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.500
And, by the definition of NP completeness, that means that the 4colorable problem

00:01:08.500 --> 99:59:59.000
is also NP-complete.
