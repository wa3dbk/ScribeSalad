00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.539
For this quiz, I want to see how much you already know about types. For each of

00:00:03.539 --> 00:00:08.885
the values listed here, select from the choices here what the type of that value

00:00:08.885 --> 00:00:12.270
is. Note that there are more choices than there are values, so not all of these

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.567
are used. And you can use the type operator to check your answers. But I think

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:19.749
you probably know enough to get most of these correct without using it.
