00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
With all of that in mind, let's encode our finite state machine in Python.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Here I've redrawn our finite state machine for "a+1+",

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and we said before that we were going to make the edges a mapping or a dictionary.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Well, one of our edges is at state 1 on 'a.' State 1 on input 'a' goes to state 2.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And another one is at state 2 on 'a' stays in state 2.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
That's our self-loop.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
If we were on state 2 and we see a 1, we go to state 3.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
State 3 on 1 stays the same.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Let me just highlight one of these.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This particular edge from 2 to 3 on 1 corresponds to this entry in our edges mapping.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I also need to know which states are the accepting states.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Previously, I denoted that by drawing double lines,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
but again we can't pass a picture into Python, so I'll just make a list

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
of all the things it accepts.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Then actually that's it.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You'd think we'd need a list of nodes, but you're going to see that we're actually

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
able to finesse it because all the nodes we really care about

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
already appear in this edges listing.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So here we are writing our finite state machine simulator,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and this is actually super exciting because it previews one of the concepts

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that we're going to have later in the course--interpreting another program.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It's like the junior grade version of it, even this will be a lot of fun.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So together, we're going to write a procedure called fsmsim for FSM simulation,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
finite state machine simulator.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
You pass in the input string, the start state or the current state, the edges,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and the accepting states, and it returns true if that string is accepted

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
by the finite state machine and false otherwise.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
We'll do it together.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Submit via the interpreter--I'll write the first half of this procedure with you.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So let's get started on our finite state machine simulation quiz.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Here I'm just recopying the edges definition so that we'll have a test input to work with.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
These 2--the edges and the accepting state--correspond to the regular expression

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
"a+1+", and now we're going to define our procedure, finite state machine simulator

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
given a string, the current state, the edges--these ones up here--and the accepting state.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
What do we do?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Well, one possibility is that we're already at the end of the input,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
at which point we should just check to see if our current state is an accepting state or not.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
If we're at the end of the input and we are state 3, then we return true.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Otherwise, we should be returning false.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
If the string isn't empty, then I can get the current letter as the 0th position from the string.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And now, here's your part.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
We know the current input letter we're looking at,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
the current state we're in, all of the edges are available to us--

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
you fill out the rest of this code.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Here's a hint.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Find out if there's a valid edge leaving from this state on this letter.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
If there is, you should take that edge and keep walking.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
If there is not, we fall off the end of the finite state machine and die,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
so you should return false.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And the big hint for you is recursion, which is always the hint in computer science

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
because it's the secret of all power and knowledge in the universe.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Recursion, use it.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Oh, and I can't even spell it!

00:03:00.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Alright, recursion. You should use it and spell it correctly, unlike me.
