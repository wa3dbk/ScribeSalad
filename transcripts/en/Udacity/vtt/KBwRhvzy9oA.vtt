Let's now take a quick look at BGP route selection. It is often the case that

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.060
a router on a particular autonomous system might

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.720
learn multiple routes to the same destination. In this

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.580
case, a router on autonomous system one, might

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.860
learn a route to a destination in AS4

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.730
via both AS2 and AS3. In this situation.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.010
The router in AS one must select a single

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.710
best route to the destination among the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.070
choices. The selection among multiple alternatives is known

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.160
as the BGP route selection process. Let's now take a quick look at that process.
