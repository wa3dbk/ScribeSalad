00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.030
So if this is our population. Where the y-axis is frequency. And the x-axis is

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.895
the engagement ratio. We know that if we picked every possible sample of size 20

00:00:10.895 --> 00:00:15.770
from this distribution and then we calculated the mean of each sample and then

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.621
plotted the distribution of means. It will be normal. The mean of this

00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:26.635
distribution should be the population mean, which you calculated to be 77

00:00:26.635 --> 00:00:32.164
1000ths. And the standard deviation of this distribution is the population

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:37.540
standard deviation divided by the sample size, which is 0.107 divided by the

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:44.204
square root of 20. And if we round to the nearest thousandth, we get 24 1000ths.

00:00:44.204 --> 00:00:49.237
So this is a standard error. When we found that, that the mean engagement ratio

00:00:49.237 --> 00:00:54.631
of our sample of size 20 was 0.13, we can compare it on this distribution, in

00:00:54.631 --> 00:01:01.588
terms of standard error. We want to know how many standard errors 0.13 is from

00:01:01.588 --> 00:01:02.466
the mean.
