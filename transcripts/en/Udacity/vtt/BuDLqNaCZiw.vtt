00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.140
Let me show you something cool.

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.800
In Chrome tab tools we can easily open up the source code for a website.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.675
All we need to do is open up DevTools which I will be doing by Cmd+Option+I.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.490
And then we'll go to the sources pane.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.059
Here, in sources,

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.010
we can see all of the source code that led to the website we see behind us.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.230
So Index.html should look pretty familiar and we can open up javascripts and

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.550
we can see helper.js, jquery and resumebuilder.js.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.020
Let's open up helper.js.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.840
Over here we can see it.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.610
let's give ourselves a little more room, and I'm going to scroll down.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.840
Inside helperjs, we've got all of the strings,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.840
containing the html we want to add to the page.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.680
And we can find some functions down at the bottom.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.010
This job script down here is actually creating the map that we see on the page,

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.920
but there'll be more on that in a little bit.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.640
For right now, let's pay attention to this line right here.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.460
Inside this function called locationFinder,

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.029
we see this statement that says return locations.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.830
We've seen this return keyword a few times so

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.459
far, but we haven't really delved into it's purpose yet.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.900
It's called a return statement, and

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.230
its purpose is to make the function give back a value.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.880
&gt;&gt; I think I know what you're getting at.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.660
Won't you explain it a bit more.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.640
&gt;&gt; Well, remember console.log?

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.080
It doesn't return anything, which means if we were to create a new variable,

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.540
like this.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.740
Var hello equals console dot log hello will get undefined when we try to run it.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.320
We wee that console dot log worked and

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.190
printed hello, but then we see this undefined below it.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.270
If we try to examine the variable later by just typing out hello and

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.340
pressing enter, we see undefined.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.900
That's because console dot log didn't return anything,

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.019
it didn't give anything back.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.230
However, most functions actually do return values.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.340
&gt;&gt; Like a lot of string methods?

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's look at string dot split.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.790
First we'll create a string like this one.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.660
I've created a string called myString and

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.720
set it equal to, This is my favorite string!

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.080
Then we are going to go ahead and separate the string on spaces.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.800
Meaning that we'll get each word by itself.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.290
Split works like so.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.690
It's going to act on the string here.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.204
And it's going to separate it based on the parameter here.

00:02:09.204 --> 00:02:12.009
This parameter is just a single space so

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:16.420
we should get an array of the words from myString.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.810
Let's go ahead and save it to the variable myArray and press enter.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.460
Okay, and when we try to access myArray, we see and array of strings.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.440
This, is, my, favorite, string.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.160
Each of the words from myString before.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.360
In other words,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.010
split returned an array of strings which is now equal to myArray.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.860
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see!

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.610
When we write functions that we want to turn into a value,

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.670
they must give us back a value.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.370
Looking at this function as a whole.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.580
The parameter is the input.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.770
The function does something using that parameter on the actual string and

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.340
then it gives us some sort of value.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.210
&gt;&gt; Let's think about the resumes j's on data and all the location in it.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.520
For this quiz I want you to write a function called locationizer.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.830
It's going to take in the work object.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.500
Locationizer should return an array of the locations in your work object.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.470
Remember work contains all the jobs that you've had in the past and

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.810
each one of which should have a location associated with it.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.860
We want you to return an array of those locations.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.310
You might find it's helpful to use the array.push method which

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.120
is going to add values to the end of the array.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.920
When you get to the quiz,

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.850
you'll see a sample json that your code will iterate through.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:30.350
Good luck.
