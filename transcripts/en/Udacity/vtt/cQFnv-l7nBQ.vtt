If you picked Homo Neanderthal, you're correct. Neanderthals lived from about

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:10.535
400,000 years ago and died off only about 28,000 years ago. And we have

00:00:10.535 --> 00:00:14.630
evidence now that modern humans and Neanderthals interbred for a period of

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.580
time. Therefore, Homo Neanderthals are our closest relatives.
