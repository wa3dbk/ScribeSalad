00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.420
The first principle is the Liskov Substitution Principle named after

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.880
Barbara Liskov and she proposed the principle that subclass instances should,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.670
should satisfy parent class constraints or contracts. That is,

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.880
if the client module accepts and works correctly on a parent class instance it

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.830
should also work when a child class instance is substituted.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.220
This implies that child class instances should obey parent class invariants and

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.780
method contracts including their pre and post conditions.
