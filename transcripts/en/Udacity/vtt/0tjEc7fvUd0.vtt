00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.928
This would simplify to 10 times the square root of 2, or 10 root 2. The key

00:00:04.928 --> 00:00:08.479
ideal is to remember that multiplication is between the numbers and the radical

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:13.769
sign. We can rewrite the square root 50 as the square root of 25 times 2. Then

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.480
we use our product rule to break this radical up into two separate radicals. We

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.410
know the square root of 25 is 5, so we have 2 times 5 which is 10, times the

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.628
square root of 2. We don't want to add these numbers together, since

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:32.910
multiplication was really between the radicals and the numbers to begin with.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.470
So that's why the answer wasn't 7 root 2. It might be easy to think that way.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.143
But just remember what's actually going on between the numbers.
