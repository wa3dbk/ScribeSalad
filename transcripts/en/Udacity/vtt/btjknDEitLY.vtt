00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.199
So here is the answer, I feed in all the missing

00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:05.524
values for you. And let’s try to check a few.

00:00:05.524 --> 00:00:08.482
For example, let’s take the elements related to

00:00:08.482 --> 00:00:12.011
X1. We move from X0 to X1 which added one

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:13.999
of the remainder indiscernible . We move

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:15.970
from X1 to X2, which added another one, so

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.629
we have two, but we also had one observation

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:22.793
in X1, we incremented by two because of the

00:00:22.793 --> 00:00:27.045
measurement string, 0.5. One over that is 2

00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:28.613
so when we added the measurement end up

00:00:28.613 --> 00:00:30.496
with 4. Let’s pick this off tagging element over

00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:33.283
here. This was only affected when moving from

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:36.340
X1 to X2 and it was a minus 1. This element

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.017
over here was affected when we sensed L1 from

00:00:41.017 --> 00:00:43.417
X1 and again the off tagging element is

00:00:43.417 --> 00:00:46.668
negative. So we added minus 2 over here.

00:00:46.668 --> 00:00:48.531
It’s quite involved, as you can see. Let’s

00:00:48.531 --> 00:00:50.411
take a number on the right side, the minus 2

00:00:50.411 --> 00:00:53.088
over here. This is adding up a re-contribution

00:00:53.088 --> 00:00:56.219
to X2. The first one occurred when we moved

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.151
into X2 from X1 at which point we added two

00:01:01.151 --> 00:01:04.325
. But in X2 we also measure length by L1 with

00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:07.092
a measurement value of two. We have to multiply

00:01:07.092 --> 00:01:12.726
that for a two to arrive at four and subtract it,

00:01:12.726 --> 00:01:14.257
so we have made minus four, you get

00:01:14.257 --> 00:01:16.971
the minus two. If you work out at all these

00:01:16.971 --> 00:01:21.131
examples, using the math we explained in class

00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:22.959
and working in the effective measurements get

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:26.226
a default effect of two for every value you add,

00:01:26.226 --> 00:01:28.443
you arrive at exactly this matrix over

00:01:28.443 --> 00:01:30.196
here. I hope you got a good number

00:01:30.196 --> 00:01:34.000
of numbers right that was not an easy task.
