00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Welcome to the 5th unit in our debugging course titled Reproducing Failures.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In the past units we have seen a number of techniques to systematically hand down

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
a failure cause by following back dependencies and applying the scientific method

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
to choose between various possible origins until we find the defect.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So far, however, we have assumed that the program fails in the lab

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and that somehow we would be able to actually access these earlier states

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
or at least run appropriate experiments

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
where we would be able to gather additional.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Contrast this with a program failing in the field where all we know is that the program failed

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
plus possibly a few hints from the execution,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
but all-in-all only a spottier record compared to what you get in the lab.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This is where reproduction comes into play.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You have to reproduce the failing run from the field in the lab

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
such that you can actually do the debugging. Why do you need to do that?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We need to be able to observe the run,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
because once we have reproduced a failure locally,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
we can observe and experiment at will.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
This, of course, is invaluable for isolating the defect.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Second, we need to be able to check the fix.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Only if we can reproduce a bug can we be sure that we have actually fixed it,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
namely, if the failure no longer occurs.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Reproducing a bug can be way harder than fixing the bug.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
In programmer's jargon, bug's fall into four categories.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
First, there is the Bohr bug from Bohr's model of the atom.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
This is a repeatable bug that many manifests reliably

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
under a possibly unknown but well-defined set of conditions.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Next category is a Heisenbug from Heisenburg's uncertainty principle in quantum physics.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
This is a bug that disappears or alters its behavior when one attempts to probe

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
or isolate it.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
The next one is the Mandelbug, coming from the Mandelbrot set.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
This is a bug whose underlying causes are so complex and obscure

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
as to make its behavior appear chaotic or even nondeterministic.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And last but not least there is the Schrödinbug,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
which is MIT jargon coming from Schrödinger's cat thought experiment in quantum physics.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
You know--the situation in which you have a cat in a box,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
which may be dead or which may be alive, but you don't know until you open the box.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
This is a bug in a program that doesn't manifest until someone who reads the source

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
or who uses the program in an unusual way notices that the program never should have worked,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
at which point the program promptly stops working for everybody until it is fixed.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
All these bug categories refer to various levels of difficulty as it comes to reproducing the bugs.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Here is an example of a bug that was hard to reproduce that I once encountered.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I had a C program that crashed all the time.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
In an extremely simplified version this is what it looks like.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
If I ran this program normally, it would crash.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The assertion would fail.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
If I ran it in a debugger, however, it worked just fine.
