00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:05.142
First thing we start off with is, we create a variable here called Render Engine Class

00:00:05.154 --> 00:00:10.012
and you define a variable by starting with the keyword var, and then

00:00:10.024 --> 00:00:14.789
the variable name, and then you say equals, whatever you would like it to be equal to.

00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:19.548
In this case we use an opening brace, to indicate that we'd like this to be

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.547
a javascript object. This is the object literal notation, for defining an object

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:29.436
in Javascript. From there we can declare methods and member variables of that

00:00:29.448 --> 00:00:34.151
object by specifying the name of the member, a colon and then the value that its

00:00:34.163 --> 00:00:38.693
going to take. In this case we declare the method of the name

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:42.996
drawString, we use a colon and then we say that this is going to be a function, we use the

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:47.463
keyword function to define this and then we give a list of all the parameters

00:00:47.572 --> 00:00:52.445
and then open the function with an opening brace, similarly to how you would

00:00:52.457 --> 00:00:57.543
in many other languages. Now, again, we create a variable, name it, and then assign

00:00:57.555 --> 00:01:02.058
to it, the value of gRenderEngine.context. Now this is going to take the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.056
JavaScript object, gRenderEngine and the dot notation is going to tell us that

00:01:07.068 --> 00:01:12.074
we want the context member of this object and we do something similar down here

00:01:12.086 --> 00:01:16.783
where we, grab the font member of the ctx object

00:01:16.888 --> 00:01:21.646
and assign it this value here. Now you notice that we're using addition in strings: addition is over loaded in

00:01:21.658 --> 00:01:26.620
javascript to also designate string concatenation, again

00:01:26.632 --> 00:01:31.221
similar to a lot of other languages you might have seen. Next we have an example of an if statement.

00:01:31.317 --> 00:01:35.170
If statements work essentially the same way that they would in any other language,

00:01:35.182 --> 00:01:39.237
where you have the keyword if, then in parenthesis you specify the

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:43.565
predicate that's going to return a boolean value, either true or false and then

00:01:43.577 --> 00:01:48.235
the body of the if statement that executes, if that evaluates to true. Now, note

00:01:48.247 --> 00:01:53.091
that the statement here doesn't have braces around it designating what executes

00:01:53.103 --> 00:01:57.821
if the if statement evaluates to true. This is similar to some other languages

00:01:57.833 --> 00:02:02.442
where, if there's a single line that you need to evaluate, you don't require

00:02:02.454 --> 00:02:07.435
those braces. We use this here there, just for readability purposes. So you

00:02:07.447 --> 00:02:12.305
might see this in the code. Now for larger f blocks, you can delineate them with

00:02:12.317 --> 00:02:17.200
a opening brace, and then once they are done, way down here, you close them

00:02:17.212 --> 00:02:21.698
with another brace. From there we have a number of more examples of declaring and

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.450
setting variables and then we come to a for loop. For loops are structured

00:02:26.462 --> 00:02:31.528
essentially the same way they are in C, were we have an initializer value, then

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.583
a predicate to evaluate for, when the for loop should end, and then an expression

00:02:36.595 --> 00:02:41.450
to execute at the end of each for loop. And similarly to the if blocks, the

00:02:41.462 --> 00:02:46.026
block of code that you'd like to execute each time the for loop runs, is

00:02:46.038 --> 00:02:51.178
delineated by braces. Although again, if it's a single line, you don't require

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.493
those braces to be there.

00:02:53.498 --> 00:02:58.033
Now here we see words n where n is in square braces and again, n is the

00:02:58.045 --> 00:03:02.952
variable that our for-loop is looping over. This is an example of accessing a

00:03:02.964 --> 00:03:07.875
list, where n is the n-th element in that list. Now, like most other languages,

00:03:07.983 --> 00:03:11.111
this is zero indexed as well. So keep that in mind.
