00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.620
So thanks, Lauren. You know, there a classic study in psychology that has to do

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.177
with availability heuristic. And it revolves around the question you were just

00:00:07.177 --> 00:00:13.175
asked. Which is, are we more likely to die in airplanes or automobiles? And

00:00:13.175 --> 00:00:16.100
when people are asked this, they tend to overestimate the likelihood of dying

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.233
in an airplane. And in fact, the statistics show just the opposite. We're much

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:25.190
more likely to die in an automobile. For instance, in the US about 30,000

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.786
people a year will die in automobile crashes, and only about a hundred or so

00:00:28.786 --> 00:00:34.763
will die in plane crashes. So in fact, planes are much safer than automobiles.

00:00:34.763 --> 00:00:38.667
So, even though we know these numbers, we're still more afraid of flying than

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:44.570
driving. Why is that? Well, as it turns out, there's a thing called vividness.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.495
And vividness is related to availability and accessibility. So, when we hear

00:00:49.495 --> 00:00:54.286
about a plane crash, it's horrific. A lot of people die all at once, and that

00:00:54.286 --> 00:01:00.115
makes it very vivid in our minds, very accessible, very available. So, when we

00:01:00.115 --> 00:01:04.144
think about flying versus driving, we're more likely to think of dying in a

00:01:04.144 --> 00:01:09.500
plain crash, because it's a vivid event and that's availability.
