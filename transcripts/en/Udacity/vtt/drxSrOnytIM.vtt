Our next guest is Andrew Goldberg.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
He's a principal researcher at Microsoft Research, Silicon Valley,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and his work focuses on creating algorithms for real-world problems.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
One of the interesting problems he's studied

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
is how to find the shortest path in really, really large networks in microseconds,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
so he's going to tell us a little bit about algorithms for doing that.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
[Andrew Goldberg] [Principal Researcher, Microsoft Research] Recently I've been

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
working a lot on shortest path algorithms,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
especially motivated by GPS navigation applications,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
so basically how to get from A to B.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
That's great.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
When you analyze this problem, that problem itself is fairly classically studied.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
What are the new wrinkles in it that come up, and why do they come up?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So, the new wrinkles came up when GPS navigation

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
became very, very widely used,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and also GPS maps became continent sized and detailed, digital maps.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And then you really wanted to solve the problem much faster than in linear time.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Basically when Bing Maps or Google Maps gets a request

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
it doesn't have the time to look at the whole map,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
so linear time algorithms like your classical Dijkstra's algorithm are not good enough,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and the new wrinkle was preprocessing,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
so you want to preprocess your graph to be able to answer queries

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
very, very quickly, sort of in polylogarithmic time if you want to put your theory hat on.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
During the last 15 years or so there was a lot of research

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
both at our group and also in many other places,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and there have been very nice algorithms developed

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
which 10 years ago I wouldn't have believed that it's possible,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
but basically these algorithms can answer queries in microseconds

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
on continental-sized networks.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Wow, and it doesn't pre-store all possible pair wise--

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
No, so just to give you an idea of scale

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
a continent-sized network has tens of millions of nodes,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
so 10 billion squared is too big even for today's huge disks.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Are there any relationships between the kinds of graphs that you get

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
in highways and the kinds of graphs that would come out of a social network?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
We did recent variation studies under submission now,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and we studied some of the publicly available networks,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and the sub-labeling algorithm I want to talk about next

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
has actually worked fairly well for this kind of network

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
like quarter networks and so on.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
But for example, it doesn't work so well for small world kind of networks.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Okay, interesting.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
All right, good, so if you wouldn't mind telling me a little bit about the algorithm,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I think that would be really interesting.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Let's talk about implementing just the distance oracle,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
so basically given 2 points, you want to tell the distance between those 2 points.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
The algorithm first preprocesses the graph,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and for each vertex it computes labels,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and let's say for simplicity the graph is undirected.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Then a label of a vertex is a set of vertices

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
which we call hubs and distances to the hubs from the vertex.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Each vertex has a label, and these labels must have the following property.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
If you take any 2 vertices, the set of hubs has to intersect,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and the intersection mark contains a vertex on the shortest path between them.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And why it's important is that for this vertex

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
if you sum up the distances to the 2 hubs, which you have,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
you will get the shortest path distance.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
The sum of results, so all the hubs' shortest path distance is stored?

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
No, for each vertex you have a set of hubs.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
The distance from this vertex to each hub.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
[Male] Oh, I see, and they have to share a hub.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
On the shortest path.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
That is also on the shortest path, I see.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Right, so this is a fairly strong property, so the easiest way

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
to do it is you say, okay, for each vertex

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
all other vertices are at hubs.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
[Male] Then you're guaranteed.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And then the property holds, but then your queue at a time is order of n,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and what you really want is small labels,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and it turns out that some graphs have more labels,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and the reason why this works well in road networks

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
is that we can compute labels

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
for, say, the graph of Western Europe with about 18 million vertices.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
We can compute labels of size about 70.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
70, 7-0.&amp;gt;&amp;gt;[Andrew Goldberg] Yes.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Out of how many million did you say? 16 million?

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
18.&amp;gt;&amp;gt;[Male] 18 million.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
You only need 70.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
It's very, very fast.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
If you think about that if you sort these hubs by node ID

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
we have 2 arrays, and you just need to intersect these 2 arrays of size 70,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
which you can do like a merge sort that is very good locality.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
This time becomes below a microsecond.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
It's very, very, fast.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
But this is not a very intuitive concept to me so what are the 70--

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
so we're talking about like individual intersections in Europe, right?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
This is like Piccadilly Square or something like that

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
or the northeast corner of Piccadilly Square,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and you only need to know from there

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
the distance to 70 other places in Europe.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
This is the amazing thing, and that's why people thought

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
that this wouldn't be practical because

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
if you think about it there are probably thousands,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
but the surprising thing was that you only needed a much smaller number,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
so if you think about this long range,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
it's basically intersections of major highways,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and there are not that many of those, and sort of locally

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
it's intersections of state highways and more locally

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
it's intersections of major streets.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
The bad graphs of this kind of algorithm are grids,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
but fortunately there are no big grids in the maps,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and even though there are grids like in Manhattan

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
it's only 10 avenues wide, so it's not very big,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and there is Broadway, which breaks the symmetry,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
so things are not as bad as one might think.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
That's fascinating.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Of the 70 places, I could imagine that some fraction of them are

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
for really long distance travel, like between countries,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
and some other fraction of them are for within the country

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
but far distance, and then another fraction of them

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
are for within the region of the country, and is it sort of equal buckets for each,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
or for really far distance you only need a small number, but for local you need more?

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
What's the distribution like?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
It's roughly uniform as you increase the scale exponentially.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
[Male] Wow, wow.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
That really depends on where in the country you are

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
because in that densely populated area you need more local things.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
If you are in the middle of nowhere--

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
[Male] There's only one way out.
