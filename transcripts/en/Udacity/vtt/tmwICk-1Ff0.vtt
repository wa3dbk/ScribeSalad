00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.590
For this question, what I want you to draw,

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.760
a planar graph with eight nodes. And then connect

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.020
those eight nodes with fifteen different edges. Then the

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.880
question is, how many regions does the graph have?
