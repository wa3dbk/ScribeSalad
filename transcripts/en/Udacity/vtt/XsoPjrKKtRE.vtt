&gt;&gt; Okay, very good. Here is C and I've just chosen one of the choices out

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.450
of the six choices, five here. And so we're going to try to build

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.380
a semantic network for C and five, just the way we built it for A and B. So for

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.930
C and five, I have already shown all the objects. Now, your task is to

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.340
come up with the labels with the links that are between these objects here,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.959
as well as labels for the link in the, between the object for five.
