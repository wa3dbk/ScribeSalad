00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.650
Is longitude, latitude, altitude a right or left handed coordinate system?

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.556
Consider going east to increase the longitude, and consider going north to

00:00:09.556 --> 00:00:14.436
increase the latitude. Order is also important. I list longitude first here,

00:00:14.436 --> 00:00:18.490
since we tend to think of that direction as the X direction. In reality,

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.330
locations are usually listed as latitude first, then longitude. So the question

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.884
to you is, is longitude, latitude, altitude left handed or right handed?
