00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.352
If we plot these 3 critical numbers on our number line, you can see that they

00:00:04.352 --> 00:00:08.918
split the number line into 4 intervals. One to the left of negative 10, the one

00:00:08.918 --> 00:00:13.533
in between negative 10 and negative 2, the one between negative 2 and 2, and the

00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.922
one to the right of 2. So the answer is 4.
