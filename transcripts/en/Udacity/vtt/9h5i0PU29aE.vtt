00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.370
I'll start from the last diagram.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.200
It shows the nav coming
in from the right,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.060
see how it's over here off the canvas?

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.220
And then it comes in and
covers the canvas on the right side.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.640
This one is wrong, because this
property translate negative 300 pixels,

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.780
means that the nav bar is starting 300
pixels to the left of the view port.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.370
So, this can't be right.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.940
In this example, it shows the nav
bar showing up from, well, nowhere.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.230
It's not over here.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.300
This is wrong.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.220
According to the CSS over here,
it clearly exists somewhere.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.760
In this example, the nav bar is starting
off to the left of the viewport, but

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.120
then when it comes in,
it pushes the content off the viewport.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.260
This is wrong, because the position
of the nav element is absolute.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.510
Which means that when it comes in it

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.090
will actually just cover
the existing content.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.750
All that is to say that this diagram
accurately shows the way the navbar will

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.120
show up on screen.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.910
And there you have it.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.950
This is a good way to visualize the way
your navbar is sliding in on the screen.
