00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.290
The answers are, for the first one, the dates are the same. We said that was

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.240
okay. The requirement is that the second date cannot be before the first date.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.462
It's fine if they're the same. And then the answer should be 0, there are no

00:00:10.462 --> 00:00:14.756
dates, between those two. The second one, the second input is one day after the

00:00:14.756 --> 00:00:19.130
first input, so the output should be 1. For the third one, the second date is

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.930
before the first date. The way we specify the problem. That's an invalid input.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.603
That means the output is undefined. And, our procedure could actually be

00:00:27.603 --> 00:00:31.575
correct, no matter what it does for this input. It'd be more useful if it gives

00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:35.314
a clear error message or maybe even more useful if it gives negative 1. But the

00:00:35.314 --> 00:00:38.303
way we specify the problem, we don't have to worry about what the output is

00:00:38.303 --> 00:00:42.204
there, because we're saying that these inputs are invalid. For the fourth one,

00:00:42.204 --> 00:00:47.687
the dates are a year apart, June 29 in 2013 is one year after June 29 in 2012.

00:00:47.687 --> 00:00:52.050
And so, there are 365 days in a non-leap year. And it's non-leap year because

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.490
the February that's included is the February in 2013. For the final one, we're

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:02.063
going from June 29, 2012 to June 31st, 2013. If you know your calendar well, you

00:01:02.063 --> 00:01:06.442
know there's actually no June 31st. The way we specified the problem, we said

00:01:06.442 --> 00:01:09.880
that both input dates have to be valid dates in the Gregorian calendar. That

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.662
means that the output here is undefined. We'd like to get some kind of error

00:01:13.662 --> 00:01:16.643
output, but there's no requirement for our procedure.
