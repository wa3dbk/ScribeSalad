It wasn't until the late 1980s, before the theory of multiple intelligences

00:00:04.286 --> 00:00:10.160
really took hold, after being reshaped by Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.353
He agreed with g factor theories in one important way. Intelligence consist of

00:00:14.353 --> 00:00:18.322
abilities in language, so are verbal and linguistics, or mathematical and

00:00:18.322 --> 00:00:24.300
logical abilities, and our spatial abilities. And that scores in these three

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.400
domains were highly correlated. His fundamental argument however, was that

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.479
these three domains don't adequately capture the entire scope of intelligence,

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:39.300
and argued for at least five other forms of intelligence. Musical intelligence,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.814
or bodily kinesthetic intelligence, or intrapersonal intelligence or

00:00:43.814 --> 00:00:48.968
interpersonal intelligence, inner naturalistic intelligence
