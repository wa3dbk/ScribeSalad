00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:07.430
Final, third part of this one cycle quiz, is what will this patch, if anything

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:15.700
in this cycle? So we have added boxes here for you to check, which instructions

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.070
are going to this patch in this cycle. Note that it is possible for no

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.420
instruction to dispatch. But if one does,

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.310
which one? Again, the state of the presser

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.280
here is at the beginning of the cycle. So we need to kind

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.850
of reconsider, what are all the things that have happened during this cycle.
