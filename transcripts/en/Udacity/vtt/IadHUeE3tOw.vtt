Once again, I've labeled some points on our complex plane. And I've labeled them

00:00:04.641 --> 00:00:09.026
with the letters a through h. For each of these three questions, I'd like you to

00:00:09.026 --> 00:00:13.184
fill in the letter that corresponds to the point that the question's asking

00:00:13.184 --> 00:00:17.736
about. So which point represents the number 7? Which one represents the number

00:00:17.736 --> 00:00:21.770
negative 7i? And which one represents the number negative 7 plus 7i?
