00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.610
The most dangerous and advanced APTs
are those that use a zero-day exploit or

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.950
a specially crafted malware.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.800
A zero-day exploits a previously
unknown vulnerability and

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.380
therefore there's no patch or
fix for the vulnerable system.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.970
And most likely there's no prevention or
detection signature for the attack.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.650
That is, a zero-day exploit
will succeed and go undetected.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.920
Likewise, a specially crafted malware
is usually designed to defeat

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.369
the signatures and
behavior patterns in a detection system.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.270
That is, it also has a very high
chance to succeed and go undetected.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.370
APTs are characterized by its ability to
not only evade anti-malware and network

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.400
intrusion detection systems, but also
fool even the most sophisticated users.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.110
For example,

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.725
an APT can be designed to first
compromise an internal network router or

00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:58.285
server and all it does at that point is
to learn about the valuable individuals.

00:00:58.285 --> 00:01:03.215
That is, the APT will first learn who's
e-mailing to whom, on what topic and

00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:05.890
with what kind of
attachments in the e-mail.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.590
With such knowledge, the APT can then
forge email from a person to another.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.056
And this email can appear
to be very legitimate.

00:01:13.056 --> 00:01:14.970
This is so-called,

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.730
Spear Phishing because it is
targeted to a specific individual.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.930
And if the internal network, router, or

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.860
server has been compromised, the APT
can play man-in-the-middle to make such

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.380
social engineering attacks very
successful and very convincing.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.810
For example, if the email recipient is
not certain about the email attachment,

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.630
and he sends an email to the sender and
asks hey did you send this?

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.930
The APT can pay the man in
the middle to intercept inquiry and

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.270
send answer back to the user
to say yes I sent this.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.500
APTs are also designed to plan in with
normal activities to avoid detection,

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.950
even if that means it
has to go low-and-slow.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.930
For example, if an APT is designed to
forge a document, it will not do so,

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.720
unless the user is also
authoring another document.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.440
Similarly if the APT is designed to
send our document it will not do so

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.419
unless the users also
sending our document.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:14.300
As another example if the APT is
designed to change the setting off

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.490
a controller in a nuclear plant, the APT
does not make the changes all at once.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.170
Instead, it will make incremental
small changes over time

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.850
to accomplish the eventual attack goal.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.550
For example, the famous Stuxnet
falls into this example, and

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.800
you can search and learn more about it.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.830
And because APT activities are designed
to blend in with normal activities and

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.280
go low-and-slow, it is very hard for

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.548
an anomaly detection
system to catch an APT.

00:02:42.548 --> 00:02:47.155
APTs are often designed to stay in the
compromised organization for long time.

00:02:47.155 --> 00:02:50.885
For example, always looking for
more valuable data to steal.

00:02:50.885 --> 00:02:54.915
For example, an APT can include
a number of steps, and at each step

00:02:54.915 --> 00:02:59.635
you only focus on a subset of the users,
and only part of the network.

00:02:59.635 --> 00:03:03.675
And at each step, he may actually use
a different version of the malware.

00:03:03.675 --> 00:03:06.735
And when it moves from one part
of the network to another,

00:03:06.735 --> 00:03:09.330
it may clean itself from the O port.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.350
That is, at any given it's only
present at the specific target.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.060
In other words,
it's footprint remains to be very small.
