00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.720
We start by distributing the 3. So we'll have 3 times 2 for our first term.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.782
We'll add to that three 3 root 7 for our second term. Now that we've

00:00:08.782 --> 00:00:13.609
distributed the 3, let's distribute the root 2. We'll have root 2 times 2 for

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:19.250
the third term, and root 2 times root 7 for our fourth term. Next, we multiply

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.616
3 times 2, which equals 6, these are multiplied together but we can't really

00:00:22.616 --> 00:00:27.858
change anything since this is not inside of a radical. So we just have the 3

00:00:27.858 --> 00:00:32.549
times the root of 7. Here we list the number and find the radical so we have 2

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:36.454
times root 2 and finally for this last term we have root 2 times root 7 which

00:00:36.454 --> 00:00:42.540
equals to root 14. We can't simplify any of these roots since, these numbers

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.473
don't have factors that are perfect squares. Also none of these terms are like

00:00:47.473 --> 00:00:52.972
terms. This is just the number, this is root 7, this is root 2 and this is root

00:00:52.972 --> 00:00:58.384
14. Remember the radicands and the indexes, must match in order to add radicals

00:00:58.384 --> 00:01:04.194
together. So, we just get this lengthy sum of all the terms. That's our final

00:01:04.194 --> 00:01:05.176
result.
