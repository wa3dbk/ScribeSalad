00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.872
We know that x equals 2 over 6 is a zero of this function, but we need to

00:00:03.872 --> 00:00:09.891
notice that 2 over 6 is not a fraction in simplest terms. It's a fraction that

00:00:09.891 --> 00:00:14.149
can be reduced. Both 2 and 6 have a factor of 2 in them. So this fraction is

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:19.700
actually just equal to 1 3rd. This means that 1 3rd is actually a 0 of f of x.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.421
Now that we know that x equals 1 3rd is a 0, what factor of this polynomial do

00:00:23.421 --> 00:00:27.989
we know about? Please fill in the proper integers in these boxes.
