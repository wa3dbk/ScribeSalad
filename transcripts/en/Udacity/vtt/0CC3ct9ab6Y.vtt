00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.072
Let's consider the same problem with a constant added to our dividend. The

00:00:04.072 --> 00:00:08.232
dividend is simply the thing that we're dividing into, and the divisor is the

00:00:08.232 --> 00:00:12.672
second thing that we're dividing by. How would adding this constant 4 change our

00:00:12.672 --> 00:00:16.891
answer? What new term would we need to include? Take some time to think about

00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:20.440
this, and then when you're ready, write your answer in this box.
