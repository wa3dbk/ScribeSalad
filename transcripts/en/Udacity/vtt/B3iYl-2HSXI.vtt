00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.855
Okay and finally, one last way in which we're

00:00:02.855 --> 00:00:05.760
going to look at queries involving arrays. So far we've looked

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.670
at querying array-valued fields. We've also looked at supplying

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.490
a number of values, using the" in" operator, any of

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.660
which can be found in a field, and retrieved

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.500
documents for which the value of this field matches any

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.770
of the values supplied here. We're going to look at

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.610
the inverse of" in," and that is the all operator.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.600
So if you remember, with in, the more values

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.983
we add, the larger our query target gets. Always the

00:00:31.983 --> 00:00:36.360
inverse. In this case, we're specifying an increasingly narrow target.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.820
That is to say, the model uris field, for a

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.170
document must contain all of these values, in order to

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.930
be retrieved by this query. Let's take a look at

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.810
an actual result set. Okay, and we can see that

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.010
here, all of our values are found in this document.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.880
As with this one, and this one, so on. So that's the all operator.
