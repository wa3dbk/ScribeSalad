00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Gravity exerts a certain force on that object, and this force results in forces of equal magnitude

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
perpendicular to the surface and parallel to the surface.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This happens because this angle equals 45°.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000
If the coefficient of static friction was 1.0, we would be up a threshold of motion.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The magnitude of the force that pushes the object along the surface is the same

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
as the magnitude with which the object is pushed toward the surface.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If the coefficient of static friction is 0.8, the threshold force would have a magnitude of

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
0.8 times this force, which means it's smaller than the actual force.

00:00:44.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This object is going to move. It's going to slide down.
