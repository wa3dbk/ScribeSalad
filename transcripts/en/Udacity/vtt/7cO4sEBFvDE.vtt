00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.291
In English, the word transform is a verb and means a dramatic change. Such as I

00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:09.455
saw the cube transform into a unicorn. I won't be using that form, I'll be using

00:00:09.455 --> 00:00:14.980
it as a noun, where transform is a mathematical term meaning an operation that

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.626
changes the position, orientation, or size and shape of an object. Transforms

00:00:20.626 --> 00:00:24.564
are a key part of computer graphics. In these lessons, I'll be explaining how

00:00:24.564 --> 00:00:27.906
transforms work. You probably didn't realize it, but you've already been using

00:00:27.906 --> 00:00:32.210
transforms in a few of the previous exercises. When you set the position of an

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.483
object, you were using a type of transform called a translation. We use

00:00:35.483 --> 00:00:39.753
transforms whenever we animate anything, objects, lights, or cameras. We're

00:00:39.753 --> 00:00:43.529
going to spend a fair a bit of time on transforms since they allow us to do so

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:47.694
much. The study of transforms for computer graphics is associated with the field

00:00:47.694 --> 00:00:51.270
of linear algebra. This field is concerned with vector spaces and is usually

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.500
considered a prerequisite for any computer graphics programming course. If you

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.556
know a bit about linear algebra, great. Having a deeper and wider understanding

00:00:59.556 --> 00:01:03.178
of the subject will help. However, basic computer graphics needs just a few

00:01:03.178 --> 00:01:07.205
small bits of theory to get things going. My goal in these lessons ahead is to

00:01:07.205 --> 00:01:11.365
teach you the tools you'll need to quickly and effectively be able to control

00:01:11.365 --> 00:01:12.543
your virtual world.
