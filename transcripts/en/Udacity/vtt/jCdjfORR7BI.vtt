Okay, so the answer the inline elements are a, the anchor tag, the span tag, the

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.990
image tag, the strong tag, and the line

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.820
break tag is actually considered inline. This one

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.150
is, is a little tricky, but the br tag doesn't have any with, it doesn't behave

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.670
like the other block elements do, it doesn't

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.520
make like a box on the screen. It just

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.670
creates a newline. So, anyway, hopefully you managed to

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.420
figure that one out or you learned something today.
