00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.863
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:04.863 --> 00:00:08.770
Okay. So, the DOM contains all the content of the page.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.140
The CSSOM contains all the styles of the page. So how

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.960
do we take the content and styles and turn them onto

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.150
pixels on the screen? I feel like we're missing an intermediate step.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.640
&gt;&gt; That's good intuition. Now we need to combine the

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.550
DOM and the CSSOM trees into the render tree which will

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.610
capture exactly what you described. One of the most important properties

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.840
of the render tree is that it only captures visible content.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.500
And to see this in action, let's work through the

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.260
simple example we have in front of us. At the top,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.740
we have the DOM tree and at the bottom the CSSOM

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.640
object model. To construct the render tree, we start at the

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.120
root of the DOM tree, which in this case is the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.030
paragraph node and check if there is any CSS rules. That

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.950
match it. In this case, we see that we do have

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.010
a matching rule that makes all the text render in 16

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.390
pixel font size and in bold. So we

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.990
copy the paragraph node to our render tree alongside

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.810
with its CSS properties. Okay. We're done with

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.300
the paragraph node. Let's walk down the tree. Next,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.640
we see, hello, which is just a text

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.090
node. So we copy that through our render tree.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.600
Next we arrive at the span node. We have a matching CSS rule for it. We have

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.590
a span and it is indeed a child of the paragraph node. But notice that

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.190
one of the properties in this rule is that it's marked as display none, which

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.820
tells us that the contents of this span should not be rendered. And since as

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.665
we said the render tree only captures visible

00:01:37.665 --> 00:01:40.890
content. We can skip it and its children.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.550
&gt;&gt; We skip the children, because display,none cascades down, right?

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.600
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And as a result, we can skip all

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.450
the children nodes of the span node and go to the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.710
next node, which in this case is just another text

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.300
node. And we copy that to our render tree once over.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.650
&gt;&gt; So the render tree captures both the content and the styles.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.740
&gt;&gt; Right. Now let's take a look at our Hello World page. Okay, here we

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.680
have the dom and CSS trees for our Hello World page. To build a render

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.960
tree we start at the HTML node in the

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.820
dom tree. The HTML and the head sections don't

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.860
contain any visible information. So we can just quickly

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.100
prune them out of our render tree. Next, we have

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.820
the body node. Let's copy that over. This left

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.250
part of the tree should look familiar. This is what

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.280
we just built. So let's copy that over as

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.460
well. Finally, we have the div and the image nodes.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.490
Both of these contain visible content, so we

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.810
also copy them over, and their styles, into

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.460
our render tree. With that done, compare this

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.130
render tree to what we have on the screen.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.620
&gt;&gt; Huh. Yeah. The render tree is a pretty good

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.330
representation. The unnecessary text is gone. I can see that there

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.010
should be an image on the screen and it should

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.600
be displayed on the right. So, are we all done now?

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.290
&gt;&gt; Not quite. We still have to do layout. But first a quick quiz.
