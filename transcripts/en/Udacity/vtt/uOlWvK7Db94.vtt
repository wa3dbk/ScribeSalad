00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.356
For B of 0, I just plug 0 for t into our function. Since e to the 0 is 1, you

00:00:05.356 --> 00:00:10.784
just have 1000 times 1 or a 1000. This is what we would expect, since this is a

00:00:10.784 --> 00:00:15.009
starting value of the number bacteria. And, as we just calculated, it's the

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.312
value when t equals 0. We're off to great start. Plugging in 1 for t, we end up

00:00:19.312 --> 00:00:25.671
with 1000 times e to the negative point 5. My calculator tells me 606.53, and

00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:31.106
I'll round that to 607. So after 1 hour has passed, almost 400 bacteria have

00:00:31.106 --> 00:00:37.058
died. Plugging in 2 for t gives us an exponent of negative 1. My calculator

00:00:37.058 --> 00:00:42.716
tells me that's about 367.87, rounding a bit already. Which if we round to the

00:00:42.716 --> 00:00:47.662
nearest integer gives us 368. After another hour only 220 more bacteria have

00:00:47.662 --> 00:00:51.445
died. But that makes sense when we look at the graph over here. We can tell

00:00:51.445 --> 00:00:55.894
that as we move further to the right the graph is getting less steep. So it's

00:00:55.894 --> 00:01:01.659
less steep between the values of t 1 and 2 than it is between 0 and 1.
