00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.440
How did this project go?

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.180
I mean, you did something awesome.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.826
You built an app from scratch and
it was probably frustrating.

00:00:07.826 --> 00:00:11.242
And at times you might have wanted
to quit, but you did it, and

00:00:11.242 --> 00:00:14.410
you have something awesome to show for
it.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.850
And in this lesson,

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.020
you'll become a better developer
by reflecting on what happened.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.650
And we'll pose a series of
questions that you can answer and

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.240
just see what you might have done
differently or what you did really well.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.300
Log these experiences on your blog,
if you've been keeping it.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.316
Or if you'd like to keep it more
private, we have a little text box for

00:00:33.316 --> 00:00:34.520
you to give your response.
