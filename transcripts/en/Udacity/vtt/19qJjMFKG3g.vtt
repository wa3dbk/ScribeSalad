00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.073
Once again we've got a kernel.

00:00:02.073 --> 00:00:05.317
We know it's a kernel because it's been tagged with global,

00:00:05.317 --> 00:00:08.115
so it's going to run on the GPU but can be called from the host.

00:00:08.115 --> 00:00:12.983
Once again we're going to pass in a local variable, a parameter called array.

00:00:12.983 --> 00:00:15.149
And the trick is that this parameter is a pointer,

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:19.424
and so this is actually pointing to some global memory that we've allocated elsewhere.

00:00:19.424 --> 00:00:21.325
I'll show you how to do that in a moment.

00:00:21.325 --> 00:00:25.697
Once you've got a pointer to global memory, you can manipulate the contents of that memory

00:00:25.697 --> 00:00:28.501
just as you would manipulate any other chunk of memory.

00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:31.969
In this case, I'm going to take my array,

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.140
and I'm going to set one of its elements

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.218
which happens to be equal to the index of this thread to some number

00:00:39.218 --> 00:00:42.981
which happens to be 2.0 times the index to this thread.

00:00:42.981 --> 00:00:46.004
Again not a very useful function but it illustrates what's happening.

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.875
So the point really is that since all the parameters to a function

00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:51.210
are local variables, are private to that thread,

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.251
if you want to manipulate global memory you're going to have to pass in a pointer to that memory.

00:00:55.251 --> 00:00:57.692
Of course that means you're going to have to allocate a pointer,

00:00:57.692 --> 00:00:59.093
so let's look at how that works.

00:00:59.093 --> 00:01:01.496
Here's the code to show off how we use global memory.

00:01:01.496 --> 00:01:05.305
The first thing I'm going to do is to clear some host memory.

00:01:05.305 --> 00:01:10.772
Once again I'm using a convention that's starting a variable with a prefix H_

00:01:10.772 --> 00:01:13.304
indicates that this is memory that lives on the host.

00:01:13.304 --> 00:01:15.644
Hhere's an array of 128 floats.

00:01:15.644 --> 00:01:19.149
I'm also going to declare a pointer that I'm going to use to point

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.386
to the global memory that I allocate on the device.

00:01:21.386 --> 00:01:27.458
And once again the d_ convention indicates that this variable is on the device.

00:01:27.458 --> 00:01:30.191
Now I want to allocate some global memory on the device.

00:01:30.191 --> 00:01:32.440
I'm going to use the function cudaMalloc.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.205
What's happening here is that I'm passing it a pointer to this variable which is itself a pointer. Right?

00:01:39.205 --> 00:01:44.341
And cudaMalloc is going to allocate some memory in this case room for 128 floats,

00:01:44.341 --> 00:01:49.881
and stuff a pointer to that memory into the pointer d array.

00:01:49.881 --> 00:01:53.151
If you're allocating memory you'll probably initialize to something.

00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:57.001
We use cudaMemcpy for that operation.

00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:02.026
In this case we pass in a pointer to the destination memory,

00:02:02.026 --> 00:02:05.335
which is this d array that we've allocated,

00:02:05.335 --> 00:02:09.032
and a pointer to the source memory, which is this h array variable.

00:02:09.032 --> 00:02:12.490
Then the number of bytes allocate, and then we indicate

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.621
whether we're copying from the hosted device, or vice versa.

00:02:15.621 --> 00:02:17.294
Oops, this is a bug.

00:02:17.294 --> 00:02:20.871
Now we've got a chunk of global memory, we've put something in it,

00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:23.935
and now we're ready to launch the kernel that's going to operate on that global memory.

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:25.538
So here's the kernel that we saw earlier.

00:02:25.538 --> 00:02:29.541
Again, we're going to launch a single thread block, consisting of 128 threads.

00:02:29.541 --> 00:02:34.713
I'm going to pass in this pointer where I've allocated and initialized memory.

00:02:34.713 --> 00:02:40.384
After this runs, presumably this code will do something to that memory that I pass in,

00:02:40.384 --> 00:02:43.184
and now I'll need to copy it back onto the host.

00:02:43.184 --> 00:02:49.860
If I want to use the results of this kernel back on the host, then I need to copy the memory back into host memory.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.866
Here's that operation, once again cudaMemcpy.

00:02:53.866 --> 00:02:56.569
This time the destination is h array.

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.170
The source is d array, this same number of bytes.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.241
Now we're copying from device to host.

00:03:05.241 --> 00:03:07.542
That's how you use global memory.

00:03:07.542 --> 00:03:11.724
The trick is that, since you can only pass in local variables in a kernel,

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:14.984
you have to allocate and initialize global memory outside the kernel

00:03:14.984 --> 00:03:16.360
and then pass in a pointer.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.000
Finally, let's look at how you would use shared memory.
