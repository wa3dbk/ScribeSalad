00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.360
As we said earlier,
you've probably used PKI on the web.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.540
An example is Google Mail.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.870
This also helps explain the value
of the certificate authority.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.440
We're using Mozilla Firefox here,
but you can,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.300
and should do the same with any browser.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.220
This lock icon,
adjacent to the URL of the website,

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.330
indicates that it's secure, using HTTPS.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.610
Clicking on it, as we see here,
indicates the site name www.google.com,

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.280
and that the connection is encrypted.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.460
Clicking here,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.100
brings up more information, including
the name of the certificate authority.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.610
In this case, Thawte Consulting.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.110
This would be the entity
that issued the certificate.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.870
You already know that
browser can verify that by

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.840
using the certificate
authorities public key.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.010
So browsers are normally shipped with
those keys to use for this purpose.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.620
Remember, it is a public key,
so anyone can have it.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.790
Finally, clicking here,
brings up Google's public key,

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.040
showing that it really is public.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.070
The text provides more details about
the key, and their references for

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.010
the more technically inclined students,
who want to know even more.
