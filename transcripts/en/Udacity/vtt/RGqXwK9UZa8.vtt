00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.870
So the other law that we're
going to talk about is

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.980
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or
popularly known as the DMCA.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.410
And this has to do with,
we discussed intellectual property.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.420
So content,
digital content software, and

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.940
the problem it helps
to address is piracy.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.820
Illegal copying for example or
theft of these kind of digital objects.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.160
That's what DMCA covers.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.840
So first of all,
it says that digital objects,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.230
the kind I was talking about,
actually can be copyrighted.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.400
So you have protections
that you get when you're

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.550
able to obtain a copyright on something.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.940
Well, the same thing now applies to,
that was the non-digital law,

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.000
the same thing now applies
to digital objects.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.100
Well, DMCA says it is a crime for
you to circumvent and disable

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.983
any measures that are there that have to
do with copy protection and anti-piracy.

00:01:00.983 --> 00:01:05.370
So it is built into the object,
it sort of and

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.790
undo that, and that act is
considered illegal if you do that.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.310
It also not only can't do that, it
makes it criminal for you to actually,

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.090
whatever idea that you had to produce
something based on that, manufacture it.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.910
And then sell and distribute it so
somebody else can defeat the copy

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.550
protection or the anti-piracy
measures that are in place.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.940
So essentially what we're saying is
that we need to protect those and

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.550
it's illegal to undo those
protections and sort of indulge in

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.815
commerce that allows you to
let other people do the same.
