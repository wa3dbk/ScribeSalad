00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.940
Okay, so, I just had you implement your own HTML escaping

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.040
function and then promptly showed you that you didn't actually have to

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.480
do that, because it was already built into Python. Well, the

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.520
exercise is important, because now you know what actually goes into the

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.710
escaping function that's built into Python. But you should probably use

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.400
the one that's built in, because it's been written by professionals and

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.460
seen by thousands of people and used in production, so it's probably

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.500
pretty safe. If you don't use the safe one, sometimes you can

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.770
run into trouble, like we did at Reddit once. So,

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.820
we had our own HTML escaping function, nearly identical to the

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.110
one you just wrote, except it had a few extra features

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.770
in it, because we had a few extra features in our

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.580
comment pages. Now we, at one point re-wrote this function in

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.225
C, from Python, because C is much faster and we needed

00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:48.790
that function to be particularly fast. Well, when we open-sourced Reddit,

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.330
we did a quick scan of our code for security holes,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.080
and, we weren't too concerned about this because most of Reddit

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.580
is written in Python which is a fairly secure simple language.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.040
C, that's not quite the same case. So, on the day

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.819
we open-sourced Reddit, somebody found a security hole in our HTML

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.380
escaping function that we wrote in C. It was only like

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.570
20 lines, but within there, there was a hole. And, it

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.650
was super embarrassing. We fixed it right away, but it just

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.420
goes to show, you know, unless you have a really good excuse,

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.850
you should probably just use the built-in functions. Otherwise,

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.410
you're going to end up looking like dorks, like we did.
