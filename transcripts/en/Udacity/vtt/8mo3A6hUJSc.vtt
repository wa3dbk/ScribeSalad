00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.820
So, you've chosen an app idea, you know
what features you're going to include,

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.280
and you also know which APIs and
libraries you're going to make use of.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.320
So, now it's time to
make a paper prototype.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.790
I like to do this using actual paper,
but you can also do it in Storyboard or

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.825
using Photoshop, or any number
of prototyping software suites.

00:00:18.825 --> 00:00:20.740
Link to some in
the instructor notes below.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.000
The point of this exercise is to define
how users will flow through your app.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.030
And if you're drawing them by hand,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.590
you don't need to be Michelangelo or
Davinci.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.860
Just get your ideas down on paper.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.150
Will they start with
a login in screen and

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.800
then move to a custom
set of user information?

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.310
Or perhaps they'll start
with a list of some kind and

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.770
then they can log in later to save it.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.410
Now, you want to be as
detailed as you can here.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.660
I mean,
what happens when a button is pressed?

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.520
And where are you going to
be pulling information from?

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.830
The more information that
you can include here,

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.350
in this paper prototype,
will help you down the road later.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.830
As you may have noticed, user experience
plays a huge role in this step.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.220
And if you'd like to think
a little bit more deeply about it,

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.480
Udasity has a great course
on user experience design.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.590
It's called UX Design for
Mobile Developers.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.120
Lessons one to three are what's
most relevant to us in this course.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.840
So if you'd like a link to that class is
included in the instructor notes below

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.750
if you'd like to work through
some of those exercises.
