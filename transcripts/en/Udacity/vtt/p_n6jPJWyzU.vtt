00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.160
FlexBox has been kicking around for a couple of years now,

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.380
but it's gone through some pretty major revisions during that time.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.170
It's just recently shipped in iOS 7, and it's been shipping

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.825
in Android for a little while, but you should test your

00:00:11.825 --> 00:00:15.740
FlexBox layouts thoroughly, across browsers. This may be a little too

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.000
bleeding edge for you, but, let's take a look. We're going

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.340
to walk through an interactive demo, talking you through each feature

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.840
in FlexBox, as you change the page, live, in the developer tools.
