00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.300
Let's get started with
the Udacity student data.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.300
We'll start with the data
wrangling phase.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.950
That is, acquiring and
cleaning the data and

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.590
you'll pose a question once you know
what data you have to work with.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.880
Data acquisition can happen
in a variety of ways.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.490
In this case,

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.100
you acquired the data by downloading
some files that were available.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.340
In other cases, you might need
to get the data from an API or

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.560
you might need to scrape
it from a web page.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.470
You'll also often need to combine
data from multiple different formats.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.945
Now don't worry if some of these
terms are unfamiliar to you.

00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:33.840
They'll be covered in more depth in our
data wrangling course which is linked in

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.210
the instructor notes.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.980
It's a great course if you'd like to
learn more about how to get data from

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.240
a variety of different sources.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.840
Your files are in a format called CSV
which stands for comma separated values.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.970
A CSV file is similar to
a spreadsheet with no formulas.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.330
The CSV format is also very
easy to process using code.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.280
Unlike, for example, and XLSX file,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.390
which is the format used
by Microsoft Excel.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.230
For example,

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.140
let's take a look at one of your files,
which contains student enrollments.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.140
Here's what the file looks
like in Google spreadsheets.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.580
There is a row for each time
a student enrolls and columns for

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.560
different pieces of information such as
the account key, the enrollment date,

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.180
and the cancellation date, if any.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.110
Now here is what the file looks like
if you open it in a plain text editor.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.650
A plain text editor is
a program like Notepad or

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.180
Sublime that shows exactly
what is present in the file.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.880
As you can see, the actual contents
of the file are very simple.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.790
The header row from the spreadsheet
is present as the first line

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.340
of the CSV file.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.550
The second row of the spreadsheet is
the second line of the CSV and so on.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.550
Within each row, you'll see
the first cell, followed by a comma,

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.730
followed by the second cell,
followed by a comma, and so on.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.760
This makes CSV's very easy to process in
programming languages such as Python.
