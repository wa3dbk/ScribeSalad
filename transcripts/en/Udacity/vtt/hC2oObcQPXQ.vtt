00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so let's look at this example and the different parts of it

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.830
in some detail. So what I'm showing here in green are the four different

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.080
components that were generating as a virtue of this assembly specification. And

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.210
as I mentioned a minute ago, the only one that's the, the, the variant,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.810
the one that were interested in is batch. But the other three, bFsct, mults and

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.810
iFsct are all kind of sub components that are used to, to, to create batch.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.160
You can think of a component as a little program.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.940
It's clear that batch is a little program. It's a little forecaster but each of

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.780
the other ones is a little program too. iForecast is an incremental forecaster.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.180
Mults is a set of multipliers and bFcst is a baseline forecaster.
