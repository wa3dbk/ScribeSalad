00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
All right; let's wrap this up.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Over the entire course, we've seen lexing, parsing; we just saw optimizing.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We've seen interpreting.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And just in case anything goes wrong, we know how to do debugging.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Lexing was based on regular expressions.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
They specify sets of strings, and they can be implemented under the hood

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
with finite state machines.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Parsing uses context-free grammars, which can capture behavior

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
like balanced parentheses that regular expressions can't.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And we saw how to implement those with dynamic programming,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that is, writing ourselves little memos in a chart, and parse states.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Optimizations are great; they make the programs simpler

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and conserve some important resource like time or power or heat dissipation.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
But they're only valid if they retain the meaning.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
In general, interpreting refers to walking the abstract syntax tree recursively

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and computing the final value.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
In our particular web browser, our HTML interpreter calls the JavaScript interpreter,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and our HTML interpreter calls the graphics interpreter.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And in debugging and testing we can gain confidence that our program adheres

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
to its specification by thinking very hard about which parts of the input

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
or which parts of the program might be wrong

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and carefully crafting them, paying attention to all the information we have available.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
In the homework or the class final projects, you'll finish the browser,

00:01:18.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and unit 7 will be review for the final exam.
