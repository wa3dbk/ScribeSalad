stages. A business has departments. We call

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.630
this a one to many relationship. There is

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.150
a one to many relationship between warehouses

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.170
and items, and festivals and stages. In the

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.120
Salesforce Schema Builder, we show these relationships

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.210
as lines that branch at the end, like

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.210

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.810
walk you through the incredible power of these relationships.
