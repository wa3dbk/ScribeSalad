00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880
Okay. Let's take a look at my solution. So we defined invert graph.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.330
It takes a graph and then it creates a new graph that we called an inverted graph

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.780
that we start as an empty list.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.110
Then for each element in the range of the length of the graph, we append another empty list

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.490
to the inverted graph, and we're doing this so we don't change the input graph

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.640
in case we still want to use it and since that also wasn't in the problem statement.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.750
Now, for each of those empty list since this is a square matrix,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.480
we again use the length of the input graph.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.320
Now, we check if i is not equal to j that is we're not on the diagonal of the matrix,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.510
and if so, we append 1- the current value.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.630
So basically, we flip that from 1-0, from 0-1.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.860
If we are on the diagonal, then we just put 0 there since we have already specified

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.130
that we're not allowing loops and once we get done with this, we simply return the inverted graph.
