Grant just doesn't care about how many wipers he sells though. He really cares

00:00:04.134 --> 00:00:07.916
about the money he's going to bring in, or his profit, which we came up with

00:00:07.916 --> 00:00:12.118
this equation for earlier. And I'd like you do now, is substitute in this new

00:00:12.118 --> 00:00:16.271
equation we have for n, the number of wipers that's sold, as it depends on c,

00:00:16.271 --> 00:00:20.134
the price per wiper set. Please simplify this equation as much as you can. We

00:00:20.134 --> 00:00:23.886
should come up with an equation for p, that doesn't actually mention n anywhere,

00:00:23.886 --> 00:00:25.185
or at least not explicitly.
