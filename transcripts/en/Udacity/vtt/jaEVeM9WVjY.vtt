00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.969
Let's see what the Vandermonde
matrix looks like at

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:04.768
the complex roots of unity.

00:00:04.768 --> 00:00:09.810
Each row corresponds to
the powers of one of the roots.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.980
So for 1, the powers are all 1.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.210
The powers of Omega are 1, then Omega,

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.940
then Omega square,
all the way up to Omega to the N- 1.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.300
The next value is Omega to the second,
so we go

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.180
omega squared to the 0th power is 1, to
the first power, what that ends up being

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.215
is omega squared, and then we have omega
to the 4th, omega to the 6th, etc.

00:00:35.215 --> 00:00:44.560
In general, the kj-th element is
omega with the k -1 x j- 1 power.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.760
This matrix has some
very special properties.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.470
For our purposes,

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.640
however, the key one can be
summarized with the following claim.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.310
We'll let omega be a primitive
Nth root of unity.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.540
This means that all of its powers,
0 through N-1 are unique.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.530
Well, then, the Vandermonde matrix,
parameterized by omega as defined here,

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.930
times the one parameterized by omega
inverse is = N x the identity matrix.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.290
For the proof, consider the kj-th
element of the product.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.620
For this we're multiplying
the K throw of M of N of omega

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.560
with the J column of M or
N of omega inverse.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.460
So we're taking corresponding
powers of omega to the K- 1,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.500
and omega to the -J- 1.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.352
Multiplying those together, and
then adding all of those up.

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:46.064
Gathering terms from the exponent,

00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:52.890
this becomes the sum over L,
of omega to the K- J, x L power.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.370
Now if K is equal to J,
then every turn here is 1.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.610
And overall sum is N.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.740
Otherwise, we recognize this
as a geometric series, and

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.780
rewrite it as this ratio here.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.850
Note however, that omega,
to the J- Kth power is a root of unity.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.864
And then raising that to the Nth power,
must necessarily be 1.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.930
So, this numerator expression is 0.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.800
The whole thing is 0.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.240
And that then proves our claim.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.430
This is terribly important.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.670
Recall that evaluating a polynomial
at the roots of unity, correspond to

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.360
multiplying the coefficients by
this matrix here, and of omega.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.170
And we use the fast foria
transform to do that.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.920
Now we see that we can
multiply these values

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.590
by essentially the inverse
of this matrix.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.010
Also using the fast forier transform and

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.200
this will allow us to recover
the coefficient's given values.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.060
This is why it was so

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.780
key that the fas foria transform
work with any route of unity.
