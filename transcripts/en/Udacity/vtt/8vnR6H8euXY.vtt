00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Male] For the last question in Homework 1,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
you're going to solve the problem of how to round numbers,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and this is going to require using a new Python function we haven't

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
introduced yet in lecture, but you'll be able to figure it out

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
as part of this homework problem.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
But it's a pretty tough question, so that's why it has 2 gold stars.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The new function that you'll use is the str function.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The str function takes as input any number,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and it turns that number into a string, so the output of str

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
applied to a number is a string that represents the number that was passed in,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
so if we evaluated str on the number 89,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
what that evaluates to is the string containing the characters 8 and 9.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So it's a string that looks like the number that was passed in,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but instead of being a number, now it's a string.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If you understand str, you'll be able to solve this question.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Your goal for this question is given a variable x,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
so at the beginning of your code, x has been initialized to store the value

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
of any decimal number.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
What your code should do is print out the nearest whole number to x.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So here's a few examples.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
If the value of x is 3.14159,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
what your code should print out is 3.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
If the value of x is 27.63,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
your code should print out 28.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And to keep this a little simpler, you can assume that the value of x

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
is not negative.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
This is going to require you to combine several things

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
that you've seen in Unit 1.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The only new thing that you need to solve this is the str function

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
that we've just explained.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Everything else that you need to solve this is something that you already know

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
from Unit 1.
