00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.010
The slopes we end up with are 10 for brand 1, 8 for brand 2, and 10, again, for

00:00:06.022 --> 00:00:12.309
brand 3. This is really interesting. For both brand 1 and brand 3, when we move

00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:18.285
over 10 in the x-direction, we have to move up 100 in the y-direction. And, of

00:00:18.297 --> 00:00:22.749
course, 100 divided by 10 is just 10. I drew this right triangle on the gray

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:27.409
line, which corresponds to brand 1, but this same exact triangle can be drawn

00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:32.363
for the line for brand 3. This has exactly the same proportions. It doesn't

00:00:32.375 --> 00:00:37.540
however work for brand 2. What's even more interesting, however, is how this

00:00:37.552 --> 00:00:42.235
ties in with our equations. We said before that brand 1 and brand 3 seem the

00:00:42.247 --> 00:00:47.045
most similar because they both had coefficients of 10 in their x terms. 10 is

00:00:47.057 --> 00:00:51.835
what we found for the slope of each of them as well. So, seems like this number,

00:00:51.942 --> 00:00:57.376
the coefficient of the x term in our equation corresponds to the slope of the

00:00:57.388 --> 00:01:03.857
line. This is also true for brand number 2, we see a coefficient of 8 in the

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:06.059
term 8x, and a slope of 8.
