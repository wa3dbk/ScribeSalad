00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.890
So Paul, why is persistence important
and how many prototypes can you

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.730
expect to make if you're actually
building out an app from scratch?

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:08.630
&gt;&gt; A lot.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.050
Way more than you think you should or
than you think is at all reasonable.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.030
Your trash can should be full by
the end of the week, every single week.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.200
I'm not talking about full blown
interactive JavaScript prototypes.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.630
That's going to take a lot longer.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.770
I'm talking about sketch prototypes.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.610
When you start,

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.440
you want to focus on iterating quickly
in the cheapest possible medium.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.760
And often that can be crayons, right?

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.689
You go out to a, actually, every time
I go out to a restaurant, I ask for

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.040
a kids menu and crayons, if I see them.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.770
So that if I have an idea or
I want to jot something down or

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.864
whatever I have pen and
paper there and I can sketch it out.

00:00:40.864 --> 00:00:42.795
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; There are a couple different iPhone

00:00:42.795 --> 00:00:46.158
apps if you're doing mobile development
that let's you turn sketches very

00:00:46.158 --> 00:00:48.328
quickly into kind of
mock interact prototypes.

00:00:48.328 --> 00:00:48.946
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; But

00:00:48.946 --> 00:00:51.343
it works perfectly
fine just to sit there,

00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:56.210
and actually move the paper around to
create the impression of interactivity.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.030
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; And

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.320
interactive prototypes are great
because you can make them super, super,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.030
super fast and
you can make them super quickly.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.739
Sketching out ten prototypes,

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.800
ten full flows throuo your app should
take you no more than an hour or two.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.353
And then you take those prototypes
around to five different people in your

00:01:12.353 --> 00:01:14.257
office and walk them through each one.

00:01:14.257 --> 00:01:17.620
And now you have an amazing amount
of user testing data that's going to

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.865
be invaluable as you start to move
into interactive prototypes or

00:01:20.865 --> 00:01:24.830
like click-through prototypes or
full JavaScript interactive prototypes.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.060
&gt;&gt; And as time goes on you'll get
faster at building these prototypes and

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.320
at finding users to test with.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.090
&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.930
As you go on, one, you'll get better
at knowing which interactions or

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.330
how to represent interactions in paper.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.160
You'll get better with your tools,
your interactive click-through tools.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.930
You'll get, if you start coding,
better at JavaScript,

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.130
or better at talking to
the developers who are actually

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.135
building the prototype about which
things matter, to speed that up.

00:01:52.135 --> 00:01:53.380
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.680
&gt;&gt; And as you get better at that,
of course, you get faster.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.130
And so you can really tear
through prototypes and

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.810
just throw them out at the end.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.840
So one thing that's really important to
remember about these paper prototypes

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.930
and interact prototypes is that
the first times that you make them,

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.400
you're going to look at them and
you're going to say,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.480
this sucks, this is terrible.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.040
This is not at the right solution,
and that's fine.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.920
That's absolutely perfect.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.870
Your goal is not to find
the right solution the first time,

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.450
your goal is to iterate lots and lots
and lots and lots and lots and lots and

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.640
lots and lots and lots and lots of times
and eventually find the best solution.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.500
Separate from that, as a designer, as
a prototyper yourself, you're going to

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.595
look at this and say, this is not
the best thing that I could've made.

00:02:37.595 --> 00:02:40.320
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; Your craft will not be very good.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.850
That's fine.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.560
You're going to suck at this for
a long time, before you're good at it.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.080
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; That's part of doing this.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.510
And because you're doing so
many of these,

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.550
you're going to get better really fast.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.330
And so the best thing that you
can do is just keep going.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.800
Just keep making prototypes,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.385
keep sketching,
keep making interactive prototypes.

00:02:58.385 --> 00:02:59.410
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; You will get faster,

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.150
you will get better, it will get easier.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.720
Just keep going.
