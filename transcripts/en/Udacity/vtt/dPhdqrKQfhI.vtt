00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.140
I'd like to introduce some terminologies that we can talk more easily about the

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.364
different quantities we're dealing with. We'll call the amount of money that

00:00:09.364 --> 00:00:14.380
Grant initially invested in the account, the principal, which in Grant's case

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.831
is $10,000. We also already mentioned the interest rate before. And in Grant's

00:00:20.831 --> 00:00:26.215
case, this is 3%. Now, let's think back to the math that we were doing. In the

00:00:26.215 --> 00:00:35.000
expression, 10,000 times 1 plus 0.03. Where do the numbers 10,000 and 0.03 come

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.156
from? For each one, please pick one of these choices. The number of years the

00:00:41.156 --> 00:00:46.007
money is invested, the number of times interest is compounded per year, the

00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:50.704
interest rate as a percentage per year, the interest rate as a decimal per

00:00:50.704 --> 00:00:57.493
year, the principal or the number of months in a year.
