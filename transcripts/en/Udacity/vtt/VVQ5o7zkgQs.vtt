00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.210
So you have the DOM tree and

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.020
we know the browser transforms
this into the accessibility tree.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.070
It can do this because much of
the DOM has implicit semantic meaning.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.210
That is the DOM is using standard native
HTML elements that are automatically

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.400
recognized by browsers and were
predictably on a variety of platforms.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.750
Accessibility for native HTML
elements such as the standard link or

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.950
button, is handled
automatically as well.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.230
We can take advantage of that
built in accessibility by writing

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.910
HTML which expresses the semantics
of our page directly.
