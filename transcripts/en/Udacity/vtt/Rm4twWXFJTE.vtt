00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's try to do this in a general way now. Right. So we call this procedure down heapify.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Let's talk about how we actually will go with this.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I've made a couple of helpful routines to help with the heap.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
given a position i in the heap, left (i) returns the position of the left child.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Right (i )returns the position of the right child. Parent (i) returns the position of the parent.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Root (i) answers whether or not the node that we're talking about is a root.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
There's no root. Leaf (L, i) returns whether or not we're looking at a leaf (i).

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
In other words, it has no children.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It has no children if what where the right child would be is off the end of the list

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and where the left child would be is off the end of the list.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Then there's one other special kind of node and there can be at most

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
one of these in the whole tree and that's a one_child node.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
That happens if a node has a left child, which is the very last element in the array.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The right child doesn't exist.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
That's just what I said that the right child is at the very end of the list

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
or off the end of the list then that's a one_child node.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Down heapify is this notion that we've got.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We apply this in the notion where we've got a heap rooted at node i that satisfies

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
the heap property except perhaps i to its children, to its immediate children.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We can apply this if the heap property is satisfied.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Everywhere except maybe between the root and its kids,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
so the root in particular the node i and its kids.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Let's just say that. If i is actually a leaf, then we're done. Right.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
We're satisfied everywhere except for between i and its children,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and i doesn't have any children.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So, good. That's great. Heap property is restored.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
If i has only one child, then we need to think a little harder.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
In the case where i has one child, we check the heap property

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000
between i and its one child on the left and if i is bigger than its child that's bad.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
That means the heap property isn't satisfied but all we have to do to fix it is

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
we just swap the value in the left child and i.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
That's what we did and then now we know that that last node

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
is the very last node in the tree and that node we just swapped into

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
is the very last node in the tree so it must be that things are happy everywhere.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
What if i has two children? So this is some internal node in the tree now.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Or possibly a root of a large tree. So now we check the heap property.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I'm going to do this this way. I'm going to ask look at the left and the right children,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and look at the minimum value of those two.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
If the minimum value is bigger than or equal to L[i] that means L[i]

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
the value at node i is smaller than both the kids so we're good.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The heap property is satisfied everywhere and we can just return.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000
On the other hand, sadly if that doesn't hold, then we need to see which child is the smallest

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
or the smaller of the two and swap i's value into that child.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
That's just what we're doing in the example by hand.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Let's check it. If the left child is smaller than the right child,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
that means that the left child is the smallest one.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.000
We swap i and the left child's value and then we need to down heapify on the left child.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.000
We've basically fixed things everywhere except for possibly the tree rooted at left (i).

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
It could actually not satisfy the heap property but that's okay.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
We can fix that by bubbling down the tree with down heapify once again.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
It's just what we did when we're doing it by hand and then we can return.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Finally, we reached this point, if the heap property is violated and the right child of i

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
is between i and the right child of i so we can just swap i and the right child of i

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
possibly causing the tree rooted at the right child of i to be violated.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
We just run down heapify starting from there. When that's done, we can return.

00:04:09.000 --> 09:59:59.000
And we've established the heap property throughout the tree.
