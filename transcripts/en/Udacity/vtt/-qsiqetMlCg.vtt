00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.469
Here we're going to talk
about constructionism.

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:04.700
Constructionism is a learning theory and

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.730
probably the most influential
learning theory of the past century.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:08.990
If you've taken a psychology class,

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.050
you're probably familiar with
constructivism, the brain child of

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.700
Jean Piaget, that describes how people
learn about the world around them.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.580
Constructionism is a learning theory
from Seymour Papert, that takes those

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.110
ideas of constructivism and
applies them to how we should actually

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.690
develop curricula or develop activities
to best facilitate student learning.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.590
Constructionism is really about putting
the learner in the center of learning

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.890
activity, and having them actually
construct an understanding

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.710
of whatever concept we're
trying to teach them.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.550
It suggests that we can't just pour our
knowledge into a learner's head, but

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.190
really they have to build their
understanding of whatever we're

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.690
communicating to them.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.790
Now constructionism is kind of
the umbrella over a lot of different

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.110
pedagogics that we'll
talk about in this class.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.190
It's the umbrella over project based
learning, problem based learning,

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.040
learning by design,
learning by example, learning by doing.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.440
All of these things put the student in
the center of the learning process and

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.060
have them construct their understanding
of a concept through some

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.500
authentic experience.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.280
So constructionism is really
about facilitating that active

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.040
learning process, putting the learner in
the center and having them experience

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.290
the concept in an authentic way and
construct their understanding of it.
