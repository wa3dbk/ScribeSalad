00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.304
For g of x equals the absolute value of x minus 3. We can write this in

00:00:05.304 --> 00:00:10.245
piecewise form as g of x equals negative x minus 3, for x is less than 0, this

00:00:10.245 --> 00:00:15.105
branch over here and g of x equals x minus 3 for x is greater than or equal to

00:00:15.105 --> 00:00:23.643
0. You can write f of x equals the absolute value of x minus 3. As f of x

00:00:23.643 --> 00:00:28.009
equals negative x plus 3 for X is less than 3, and x minus 3 for x is greater

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.203
than or equal to 3.
