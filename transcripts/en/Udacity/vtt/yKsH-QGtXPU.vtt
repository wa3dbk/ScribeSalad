00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.510
We will discuss two different variants of the

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.390
queueing lock the first one we'll talk about is

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.490
the array-based queueing lock, and this is due

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.080
to Anderson. And I'll refer to it as Anderson's

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:19.950
lock later on as well. Associated with each lock L is an array of flags. And

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.380
the size of this array is equal to the number of processes in the SMP. So if you

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.490
have a an N-way multiprocessor, then you have N elements in the circular

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.978
flags array. And this flags array serves as a circular queue. For N-queuing the

00:00:38.978 --> 00:00:42.960
requesters that are requesting this particular

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.480
lock L. So every lock has associated

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.810
with it, this flags array and it's really intuitive that since we have utmost

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.528
we have N processors in this multiprocessor. We can have utmost

00:00:56.528 --> 00:01:00.690
N requests simultaneously waiting for this particular lock so the size of the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.650
data structure, the flags data structure is equal to N where nN is the number of

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.590
processors in the multiprocessor. Now each element in this flags

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.760
array can be one of two states. One state is the has-locks state.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.980
And the other state is a must-wait state. Has-lock

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.820
says that whoever is waiting on a particular slot

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.290
has the lock. So this particular entity let's say,

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.610
is hl. And that means that whichever processor happens

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.610
to be waiting on this particular slot is a

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.330
current winner of the lock and is using the

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.490
lock. On the other hand, must-wait is indicating that

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.860
if a processor has must-wait as the. Entry in this

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.070
particular element of the array, and is waiting on

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.770
this particular slot, that means that the processor has to

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.710
wait. You guessed it. There can be exactly one

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.020
processor that can be in the hl happy state because

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.847
it's a mutually exclusive lock. And therefore. Utmost one

00:01:58.847 --> 00:02:01.475
processor can have a lock at a time, and all

00:02:01.475 --> 00:02:05.140
the others should be waiting. And, so what we

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.250
do is, in order to, when we get this lock.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.449
To initialize the lock, what we do is

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.230
we initialize the lock data structure, this array

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.400
data structure. The flags of array data structure

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.650
which represents a circular queue by marking one slot

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.840
as hl. And all the others as must-wait. An important point I want you all to

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.060
notice, is that the slots are not statically

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.655
associated with any particular processor. As requesters come in,

00:02:32.655 --> 00:02:37.360
they're going to line up in this flags array at the spot that they get

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.600
in the next available slot. The key point is that there is the unique

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.230
spot that is available for every waiting

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.970
processor. But it is not statically assigned

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.210
and we'll see. How requests get formed using this circular queue in a minute.
