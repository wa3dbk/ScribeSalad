00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.848
So welcome to 7637 Knowledge Based AI. At the beginning of each lesson,

00:00:04.848 --> 00:00:08.646
we'll briefly introduce a topic as shown in the graphics to the right.

00:00:08.646 --> 00:00:12.445
We'll also talk about how the topic fits into the overall curriculum for

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:15.684
the course. Today, we'll be discussing AI in general,

00:00:15.684 --> 00:00:19.921
including some of the fundamental conundrums and characteristics of AI.

00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:23.641
We will describe four schools of AI, and discuss how knowledge based AI

00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:27.732
fits into the rest of AI. Next, we'll visit the subtitle of the course,

00:00:27.732 --> 00:00:30.600
Cognitive Systems, and define an architecture for them.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.970
Finally, we'll look at the topics that we'll cover in this course in detail.
