Once the Detail Activity is launched, 
it shows Hello World.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.507
Instead, we want 
to read the forecast data

00:00:06.507 --> 00:00:10.704
from the Intent, and display it.
Make the appropriate changes

00:00:10.704 --> 00:00:14.591
in the app, so it matches the mocks.
Then verify the behavior

00:00:14.591 --> 00:00:16.700
by compiling and running the app.
