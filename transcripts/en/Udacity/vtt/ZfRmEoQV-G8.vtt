00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.780
It is a day as ordinary as the next. Jenny wakes up and decides

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.990
to go for a hike. On this day, however, she goes down a

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:17.520
path she wouldn't normally take. Before long, an unsettling feeling of being

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.850
lost sets in and she comes to a fork in the road. Which way to go?

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.710
Only her trusted diary can answer this question. She opens it and there lies the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:40.150
answer, a message. It says take the road less travelled. Now it's

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.430
up to you to help Jennie get home. All you have to do

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.980
is read this piece of code, which guides the next step she will take.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.610
Now tell me, which path will you send Jennie down.
