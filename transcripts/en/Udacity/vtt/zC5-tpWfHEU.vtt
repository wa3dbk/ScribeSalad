If you think this wouldn't happen these days or you wouldn't fall prey to what

00:00:03.474 --> 00:00:06.738
happened in Milgram's experiment you would be interested to know that Jerry

00:00:06.738 --> 00:00:10.053
Berger from Santa Clara University recently redid this experiment and found

00:00:10.053 --> 00:00:15.538
almost the same results. This would be a great time to go to the forum and

00:00:15.538 --> 00:00:17.916
discuss whether or not you think this research study should have been

00:00:17.916 --> 00:00:22.170
conducted. Now, Berger did get approval from the HSIRB, Human Committee

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.198
Research Board and they did change informed consent a little bit. But head to

00:00:27.198 --> 00:00:30.142
the forum and discuss this. It should be pretty interesting. Now let's go to

00:00:30.142 --> 00:00:33.920
Lauren and start the second part of this lesson on social perception.
