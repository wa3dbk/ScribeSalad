00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.075
This parabola will open down and it has a vertex at negative 1,3. Excellent

00:00:06.075 --> 00:00:11.622
work if you got this vertex correct. In order to find this vertex, we need to

00:00:11.622 --> 00:00:16.526
complete the square for these x terms. This x squared term has a coefficient of

00:00:16.526 --> 00:00:19.750
negative 2, so I'm going to factor that out from these two terms first in order

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.490
to complete the square. So we'll have 2 two, times x squared, plus 2x, plus

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.401
some unknown number. Now, this number is the number we'll use to complete the

00:00:30.401 --> 00:00:35.826
square. And the positive 1 will just stay outside on the end. The b value is

00:00:35.826 --> 00:00:42.278
positive 2. So, we know b divided 2 equals 1. And b divided by 2 squared equals

00:00:42.278 --> 00:00:46.490
1 as well. This means that we'll need to add one in order to complete the

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:52.090
square for these terms. But we really didn't just add one here, we really added

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.960
1 times negative 2, or a total of negative 2. Let's think about this in iterms

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.191
of distribution. We have negative 2x squared, we have negative 4x and we have

00:01:04.191 --> 00:01:10.604
negative 2. Because we subtracted two from this equation, we really need to add

00:01:10.604 --> 00:01:16.960
2 to make sure that it's balanced. We really add 0. This is why we have to put

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.859
a positive 2 on the end of our equation here. Now, we're ready to rewrite this

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:27.842
as a perfect square. That perfect square is x plus 1. We'll still have negative

00:01:27.842 --> 00:01:32.986
2 out in front, and we'll have positive 1 and positive 2 added on the end. This

00:01:32.986 --> 00:01:38.076
gives us our equation in vertex form, so we can easily identify the vertex. We

00:01:38.076 --> 00:01:43.589
set the binomial equal to 0, to get an x value of negative 1. And the k, or the

00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:48.735
y coordinate of the vertex, is just 3. This is how we get the vertex of

00:01:48.735 --> 00:01:53.727
negative 1,3. It's right here. Now, to get the other points, let's use this a

00:01:53.727 --> 00:01:59.726
value of negative 2. I can zoom in one my vertex, and then we can see we move

00:01:59.726 --> 00:02:03.570
one to the left and one to the right, and two units down to get these other two

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.592
points on our parabola. Since this parabola is y equals, we know we need to

00:02:09.592 --> 00:02:16.072
move negative 2 down from the vertex once we move 1 left and one right. This

00:02:16.072 --> 00:02:21.706
gives us our points of negative 2, 1 and 0,1. Notice how the y coordinate here

00:02:21.706 --> 00:02:28.152
and here are two less than the y coordinate of the vertex here. This is why the

00:02:28.152 --> 00:02:31.263
a value is so important when it comes to graphing parabolas, and makes our

00:02:31.263 --> 00:02:33.610
graphing much more simple.
