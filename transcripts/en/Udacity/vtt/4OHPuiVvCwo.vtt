00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So the task now is to actually implement Heun's method,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
we have provided for you Euler's methods.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You can copy these lines and turn them into Heun's method in the end.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Again, the error is determined so that we can see by how much

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Heun's method is better than Euler's method.
