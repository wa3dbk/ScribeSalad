00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.540
Before we go and optimize it's important
to understand that these optimizations

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.620
are only meant for production.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.580
Sure you could execute them all
the time, but it would dramatically slow

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.530
down your iterative build time, and thus
make live editing a lot less powerful.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.010
Instead I recommend to split your
tasks into development and production.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.880
Development tasks contain things
you really need no matter what.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.390
Sass processing, for example, and tasks
that only make sense through encoding,

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.480
for instance, live editing.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.310
However, keep in mind
that while developing,

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.790
this means you'll be using a different
version of your app than your users.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.310
It's going to look and feel mostly the
same, but sometimes performance issues

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.660
or bugs only manifest with
a specific optimization technique.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.301
So make sure to always test the
production version from time to time.

00:00:43.301 --> 00:00:48.030
In our next couple of instructions,
we'll be creating more generated assets.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.860
Previously, the only generated files
we were producing were the CSS files.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.360
But now we need to create
a structure to hold production and

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.760
development files separately.
