We just saw that in order for a function to undergo a reflection in the y-axis,

00:00:04.312 --> 00:00:10.389
we need to replace x in the original function with negative x. So going back to

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.232
our equation, y equals the root of x, if we want to reflect the graph of this

00:00:14.232 --> 00:00:20.420
function in the y-axis, what do we need to replace with what in the equation?

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.649
And what final equation will that give us?
