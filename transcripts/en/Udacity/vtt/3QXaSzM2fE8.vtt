00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.840
Now let's go back to
the topic of raid 4 writes.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.689
Let's say we have raid
4 with five disks here.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:12.600
And let's look at just one set
of stripes with their parity.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.860
And now let's say we want
to write new content to D0.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.910
So of course here,
we will have changed the data.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.080
And the remaining data disks don't
have any changes to their data.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.790
But the question is how do
we compute a new parity?

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.855
One way of doing that would be to read
the data from the other three disks and

00:00:32.855 --> 00:00:36.570
XOR that with the new
content in the fourth disk.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.150
But that would result in three reads and
a write.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.650
If N is even larger that will
increase the number of reads we need

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.230
to do the write.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.670
So instead, we are going to figure
out how to update this parity.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.660
What we need to know is
what was the old data and

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.800
the new data with we XOR these we get
which bits of the data have changed.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.170
If we know the old parity,
and this XOR change and

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.910
we XOR the two together, we get to flip

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.780
all the bits of the old parity that
would change as a result of the bits.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.530
So basically a flip in the data

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.890
here would result in
a flip in the parity here.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.630
We can compute it, what to flip,
XORing with the old parity flips it and

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.760
that's what you write to the new parity.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.960
So that's why we have a read and
a write of the old parity.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.260
In addition we have a read of the old
data if we don't already know it.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.320
And we know the new data.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.850
So basically we have
a read from the data disk.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.900
A read from the parity disk.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.170
A write to the data disk and
a write to the parity disk.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.080
And the parity disk will be a bottleneck
because the four disks here

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.660
are accessed by writes in a way
that reads and writes one disk.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.880
Another write would maybe read and write
this disk but all of these read and

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.400
write the parity disk, so
it becomes a bottleneck.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.090
Because the parity disk is
a bottleneck for writes,

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.550
we have RAID 5 which has exactly the
same reliability property as RAID 4 and

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.130
very similar read performance, but
it fixes the write performance.
