00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.950
One of the best parts of being a
developer advocate is the opportunity to

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.350
talk to developers and designers around
the world in building amazing things.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.320
And we talk about their existing
integrations, ways to make them more

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.080
performant, how to take advantage
of new services and increasingly,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.620
how to extend them to new form
factors and more parts of users lives.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.760
And in these conversations,
I hear a lot of great ideas.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.320
Some of these ideas can be
characterized like this.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.790
Incredibly cool [LAUGH] while
also not useful at all.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.950
And herein lies a central issue
with building for new form factors.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.400
Often our imaginations run so
far to the science fiction of our art,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.060
that we forget to make sure we're
solving actual user problems and

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.330
then test to make sure our
solution is a good one.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.030
That's why we're going to
take a few moments right now

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.320
to discuss the big picture of design for
new form factors as a baseline for

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.340
our more detailed design
discussions later in the course.
