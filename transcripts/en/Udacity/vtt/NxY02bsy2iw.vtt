00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Norvig] This homework assignment has to do with games that have more than 5 cards.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So in games like 7-Card Stud or Texas Hold 'em, players have more than 5 cards.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Sometimes some of those cards are in common--

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that is, all players share some of the cards. But that doesn't matter.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
What you're asked to write in this program is this function best_hand,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
which takes a hand with 7 cards in it and returns the best 5 card hand.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So in other words, each player out of their 7 cards has to come up with

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
the best hand that they can make according to the hand_rank.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
What I want you to do is write your code for the function best_hand

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
to return a 5 card hand that's the highest ranked.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And here are some tests.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I'll give you a hint, which is a lot of the functionality can be found

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
in the preexisting Python modules.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
One thing that's interesting to look at is the itertools module.
