00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.860
Let's bring the z table back again. So now our z score is 2.26. So here's 2.2,

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:15.832
and here is where it intersects 0.06. So the probability of getting a mean less

00:00:15.832 --> 00:00:23.415
than 40 is 0.9881. The probability of getting at least 40 is 1 minus 0.9881,

00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:29.984
which is a far lower probability. So we have this really skinny sampling

00:00:29.984 --> 00:00:36.410
distribution and the probability of getting greater than 40 is very small,

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.192
0.0119. So getting a sample of size 250 with a mean of 40, is pretty unlikely to

00:00:43.192 --> 00:00:49.604
occur by chance. In this case, this shows some kind of relationship, probably,

00:00:49.604 --> 00:00:53.262
between the Bieber Tweeter, and Klout score.
