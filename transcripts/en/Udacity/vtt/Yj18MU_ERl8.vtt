00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.290
Dan mentioned the idea of using
widgets to bring our Sunshine data

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.100
directly to the user's home screen.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.670
What exactly is a widget?

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.940
So far, we've only focused on
activities, full screen experiences, and

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.610
fragments, which are reusable
portions of those activities.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.500
Widgets differ in that area
provides just the view.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.230
That view is then passed
to the home screen app,

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.440
the launcher to display alongside other
widgets and other app launcher icons.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.115
App widgets had a humble beginning.

00:00:28.115 --> 00:00:32.280
Fixed-size widgets that could
respond to one action, tapping.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.840
It was great for control widgets or

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.460
widgets with just a single piece
of information to display.

00:00:37.498 --> 00:00:41.500
In Android 3, widgets got support for
collections of data and

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.910
vertical swiping.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.380
Now, you can display a stack, list,
or grid of data right in your widget,

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.335
making it easy to jump into exactly
the piece of information you need.

00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:55.425
Android 3.1 opened up the possibility
of resizing your widget either

00:00:55.425 --> 00:00:57.985
horizontally, vertically, or both.

00:00:57.985 --> 00:01:01.285
This gave users the ability to customize
exactly how much space they want

00:01:01.285 --> 00:01:04.675
to give to your widget, and
gave developers the tools needed to

00:01:04.675 --> 00:01:09.175
customize how they display their data
depending on the size of the widget.

00:01:09.175 --> 00:01:12.425
So, can we use these capabilities for
Sunshine?

00:01:12.425 --> 00:01:14.800
Let's focus on two common cases.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.380
Today's weather, where we'll build
a horizontally resizable widget,

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.170
showing information just about today.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.030
And the weather forecast,
where we'll build a detail widget,

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.390
which will display the same data we
see in the main screen of Sunshine,

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.300
to give users quick access to their
forecast, right from the home screen.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.170
So let's get started.
