00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.971
Here are the four answers. Great work if you've had at least two of those. For

00:00:03.971 --> 00:00:07.619
the second one you might have written it as negative root 6 or negative 1 times

00:00:07.619 --> 00:00:12.768
root 6. Both are correct. For this third one we can't add the radicals together

00:00:12.768 --> 00:00:16.832
since the radicants are different. We do have the same index since we have a

00:00:16.832 --> 00:00:21.940
square root. But this radicand is a 2 and this one's a 3. So we leave this as

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.980
is. Here's a little bit more work to make it more clear. We have 4 root 3 minus

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.508
2 root 3. So if I have four of these root 3s and I subtract 2 of these root 3s,

00:00:31.508 --> 00:00:36.578
I'm left with two of the root 3s. We see that if we factor out a root 3 from

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:41.436
the first term and the second term. This would live us with the quantity 4

00:00:41.436 --> 00:00:46.326
minus 2 time root 3. We simplify the number in front of our radical sign to get

00:00:46.326 --> 00:00:49.522
2. Now you don't need to show this step in your problem solving but if it

00:00:49.522 --> 00:00:53.858
helps, you can definitely do it. Whenever I add and subtract radicals I just

00:00:53.858 --> 00:00:57.840
look at the numbers in front and then look at what I need to do with them.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.372
Should I add or subtract these? In this case I subtract, so I just have 4 minus

00:01:02.372 --> 00:01:06.832
2, which is 2 of 3. This last problem was just like one we've seen before. We

00:01:06.832 --> 00:01:11.266
want to make sure that we have a 1 in front of this, a cube root of 3. So we're

00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:15.540
really subtracting 9 minus 1, which equals 8. We want to make sure that we keep

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.518
our root on the end so we have 8 times the cubed root of 3. I hope your getting

00:01:20.518 --> 00:01:21.853
the hang of this.
