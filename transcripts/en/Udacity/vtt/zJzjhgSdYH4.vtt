00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.700
So Charles and Michael just gave
you some of the general theory and

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.950
inspiration behind machine learning.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.450
They also covered the three types of
machine learning that will make up a lot

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.270
of your work in this Nanodegree
program supervised, unsupervised, and

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.030
reinforcement learning.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.770
Now let's cover some of the examples
of the applications of machine learning

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.320
a little bit more detail.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.050
Like Sebastian self driving car or
health care or trading.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.500
We've taken a few videos from some
other courses we've produced so

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.420
you can get an idea for
what machine learning can do.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.010
Notice, especially how in every
case we can describe the problem

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.370
as learning concepts from raw data.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.890
Learning concepts and building models
is the core of machine learning.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.450
And every problem you tackle can
be described in these terms.
