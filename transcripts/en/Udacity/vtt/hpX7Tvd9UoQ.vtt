00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.200
A quick note before we get started.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.620
This video was recorded April 6th, 2015.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.140
Now my suggestion to you is that you
don't follow along with the video.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.169
Instead go ahead and
watch the video through once.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.410
After you're done with that,

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.830
we've provided some text instructions
in the instructor notes.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.479
From time to time Android Studio is
updated, which means that menus or

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.300
screens can look a little bit different.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.620
And while the video
might be out of date,

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.180
the text instructions will be
updated a lot more regularly.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.590
Okay, so if you've closed
Android Studio, go ahead and

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.860
reopen Android Studio.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.952
You should be staring at the screen.

00:00:32.952 --> 00:00:34.940
I'm going to go ahead and

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.660
click on this app we named start
a new Android Studio project button.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.739
All right that should take you to
the screen where we have a couple of

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.700
different options.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.430
The first one is the application name.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.480
This is the name that you'll see in
the app bar at the top of the app

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.230
as well as the all app
screen of the device.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.349
Okay, right below this we
have company domain and

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.140
if this looks similar to your
web address, you're right.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.280
Normally, if you own the web
address you type it in here.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.100
That one point in my life
I owned LylaFujiwara.com.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.900
So if I was making an app for
myself instead of a demo app for

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.950
all of you I would go ahead and
change this to lylafujiwara.com.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.930
Now you might be wondering why.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.970
Well, if I was planning to
distribute my app at Google Play.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.670
This package name down here is something
that I need to uniquely identify my app.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.810
Meaning that across all of the people
in the world who are making apps

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.820
this needs to be completely unique.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.809
Now if we look a little bit
more of the structure of this

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.800
the package name is actually
the company domain reversed.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.408
So instead of lylafujiwara.com we have

00:01:41.408 --> 00:01:46.000
com.lylafujiwara followed by
the application name with no spaces.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.330
So while there might be a couple of
different app developers that make

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.420
a happy birthday app, you're not
going to have a bunch of app developers

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.670
that all own lylafujiwara.com and
are making a birthday card app.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.820
And then the way that the Internet
is set up if I buy lylafujiwara.com

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.929
that means I should have complete
control over what is shown there and

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.990
nobody else can buy that domain name.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.835
And if I own it and it's specific to me
then that helps ensure that this package

00:02:09.835 --> 00:02:11.264
name is completely unique.

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:16.172
Okay but you're not me and you don't
own this domain and since we're all

00:02:16.172 --> 00:02:20.840
practicing together and I want us all
to have sort of the same set up for

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.132
this app, I'm going to change
this to android.example.com.

00:02:25.132 --> 00:02:28.617
And you should go ahead and use the same
company domain because I know that some

00:02:28.617 --> 00:02:31.259
of you won't actually own
website domains yourself.

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:33.617
Also it will help you batch our code and

00:02:33.617 --> 00:02:37.897
if you look below you should see
com example Android happy birthday.

00:02:37.897 --> 00:02:41.852
And if you look below you should see
that it says com.example.android and

00:02:41.853 --> 00:02:44.616
again that's the reverse
of Android example com and

00:02:44.616 --> 00:02:47.451
that is It's says happy birthday after.

00:02:47.451 --> 00:02:50.771
Okay so the next thing that you can
change is the project location.

00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:53.460
This is where all the files
that have to deal with your app

00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:55.371
will be saved on your computer.

00:02:55.371 --> 00:02:59.720
Now usually Android Studio will create a
folder for your Android Studio projects

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.540
and the default is to just put
your app inside this folder.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.429
And you can see that the name actually

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.980
matches the name of
the folder that it'll be in.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.320
This is a pretty good default location,
so unless you have any strong reason to

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.900
change it, I'd go ahead and
just click next.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.869
Okay, now this is a fun screen.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.380
It let's us pick what phones and

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.100
devices that we're going to
actually make our application for.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.600
Now you're making an app for a phone and
a tablet and you're not trying to make

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.330
an app for TV ware or glass, so we're
going to leave these all unchecked.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.370
The drop down right here shows us the
version of the Android operating system

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.770
that our application will support.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.400
We're going to go ahead and scroll up.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.740
You can see that the first public and

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.470
widely used release of
Android was called cupcake.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.500
With this release Google started
a convention where they would

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.770
continue to go alphabetically but

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.620
they've each operating system off
of desserts or sugary treats.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.530
Cupcake was followed by Donut and
Eclair.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.700
And this is why you'll see words like
Ice Cream Sandwich, Honeycomb and

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.290
KitKat in the dropdown menu.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.700
Now below this dropdown you'll see
this handy Help Me Choose link.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.270
This graph shows some helpful
percentages of how many people who have

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.000
Android phones use the different
operating system versions.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.940
Looking at it we can see that most users
at least at the time of this recording

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.840
are using the deliciously named KitKat.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.500
The percentages, so

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.130
the percentage of people in the world
using Google Play who will be able to

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.140
use our app if we pick one of these
as our minimum supported version.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.479
So if you pick the newest
version of the operating system,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.420
which is lollipop,
at least at the time of this recording

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.850
only users with new phones would
be able to download your app.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.390
And that would be due to only have
about 0.1% of all the phone users

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.800
actually able to download your app.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.620
So you might be asking why not
make it after all phones by

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.230
picking the oldest version
of the operating system.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.220
Here's a picture of the first
commercially available Android phone

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.860
the T-Mobile G1 which is also known
outside the United States as HTC Dream.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.969
It was released in 2008 and
ran Android 1.0.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.600
Obviously a lot has changed since then.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.150
For example, Absolute Google Wallet
which let you pay for groceries or

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.200
the wave of your smartphone require
a near field communication.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.190
A near field communication or NFC Was
actually a type of hardware that didn't

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.940
make it into Android phones until 2010.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.500
So if you're making
an app that requires NFC

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.740
there's no reason to even try
supporting older phones like this,

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.940
that are running older versions
of the Android operating system.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.140
Anyway, for the purposes of your app,
I want you to use API 15,

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.830
which is Ice Cream Sandwich.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.700
This should work for
about 90% of the phone users out there.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.980
All right go ahead and click Next.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.160
On this screen you're given a bunch of
starting tablet's you can choose from

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.130
depending on what you're trying to make.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.454
You going to go ahead choose blank
activity which is already selected

00:05:43.454 --> 00:05:46.550
because it's the sub-list one and
I'm going to click Next.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.256
Finally, this screen gives you
the opportunities to name a couple of

00:05:49.256 --> 00:05:51.821
different files that are going to
be automatically generated for

00:05:51.822 --> 00:05:53.430
your application.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.250
As you'll soon see the application is
composed of all the picture files,

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:03.200
sound files, XML files, java file and
more that are required to make the app.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.849
Basically there are a lot of files that
work together to make your application.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.260
Will talk about this all soon.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.200
For now take a look at the layout name.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.800
You've been working on
XML layout files so

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.630
this is the name of the file we'll
be editing in just a little bit.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.210
I'm actually not going to
change any of these defaults.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.440
So you can go ahead and click Finish.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.240
Now depending on your computer
speed it might take a moment to set

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.550
everything up.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.900
If you look down here you'll
actually see a little loading circle

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:31.100
as well as a loading bar.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.940
And we can see a loading
circle down here as well

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.710
meaning that it's continuing
to think about things.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.159
So take a break, go ahead, stretch and
get some tea or I mean, coffee.
