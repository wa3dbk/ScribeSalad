00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.770
The radio is powered by electricity from a wall socket at not a battery.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.390
It can be controlled by two manual knobs. One for volume on the top right and

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.920
one for tuning on the right side. The chosen frequency is displayed on

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.750
the right side of the front panel with a small vertical white bar.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.490
The display features a twelve hour clock on the left front and

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.940
two small lights. The light in the upper left hand corner of

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.960
the display labeled AM indicates whether the displayed time is in the morning,

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.780
when the light is off or in the afternoon or evening when the light is on.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.050
The light in the lower right hand corner of the display is labeled wake.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.990
If it is lit indicates you have armed the alarm. In addition to the above,

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.540
the radio has two switches and five buttons. One of the switches on the top edge

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.110
of the back determines whether the frequency band is set to AM or FM.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.790
The second switch found in the center front of the top has four positions.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.340
The switch slides horizontally from left to right. In order,

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.420
the positions indicate whether the radio is on, off, armed for wake by radio or

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.200
armed for wake via a beeping sound. Four buttons are found on the left side of

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.500
the top of the radio. They can be used to set various timers in the clock.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.760
They are labeled hour, min, wake, and sleep. By pressing the wake button,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.180
you can set the time you wish the alarm to go off. By pressing the sleep button,

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.390
you can set how long you would like the radio to play before automatically

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.770
shutting off. Using this feature allows you to fall asleep with the radio

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.890
playing. If neither button is pressed you can set the current time of day.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.600
You've actually set these three timers using the other two button on the front

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.220
left of the top of the radio, they are labeled hour and min. By pressing hour

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.680
you increment the hour of, of the respective timer, the wake, sleep or time of

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.770
day timer. Similarly for min, if you wish to be awakened 15 minutes later

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.440
tomorrow morning than you were this morning you would hold down the wake button

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.960
while pressing the min button 15 times. The final button is the snooze button.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.540
It is the large button found in the center front of the top of the radio.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.780
The snooze button is useful when the alarm is trying to wake you up.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.520
Each time you hit the snooze button the alarm shuts off for

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.470
10 minutes. The final feature to note about the radio is that the alarm will

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.640
automatically turn itself off after one hour, to prevent the situation where you

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.070
forgot to turn it off and it was audible all day long.
