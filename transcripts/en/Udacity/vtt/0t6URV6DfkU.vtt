00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.021
So in CUDA a stream is a sequence of operations that will execute in order on the GPU.

00:00:06.021 --> 00:00:10.253
And the particular operations we care about are memory transfers and kernel launches.

00:00:10.253 --> 00:00:14.362
If I perform a cudaMemcpyAsync, launch kernel A,

00:00:14.362 --> 00:00:18.429
then perform a second cudaMemcpyAsync and then launch kernel B,

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:21.628
then each operation completes before the next starts.

00:00:21.628 --> 00:00:26.040
So the first Memcpy happens, then kernel A runs to completion.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.406
Then the second Memcpy happens and then the second kernel runs.

00:00:30.406 --> 00:00:35.479
But if I do those same operations and this time I put them each in a different stream

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:38.313
by adding a parameter which is the stream,

00:00:38.313 --> 00:00:44.098
then now these operations can potentially run concurrently, therefore completing in much less time.

00:00:44.098 --> 00:00:48.459
So this operation is in stream 1, this operation is in stream 2,

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:52.867
this operation is in stream 3, this operation is in stream 4.

00:00:52.867 --> 00:00:55.467
Since we didn't specify a stream for any of these,

00:00:55.467 --> 00:01:00.541
we would say that they are in the default stream, which happens to be stream 0.

00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:06.740
A couple of notes. A CUDA stream object is of type cudaStream_t.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.584
For example, here we declare a stream called s1.

00:01:10.584 --> 00:01:14.092
You create streams using the cudaStreamCreate call,

00:01:14.092 --> 00:01:19.396
passing in a pointer to the stream you want to create, and you destroy them by calling cudaStreamDestroy.

00:01:19.396 --> 00:01:21.964
And remember, to get asynchronous memory transfers

00:01:21.964 --> 00:01:27.865
you need to be using cudaMemcopyAsync, which in turn must be called on pinned host memory.
