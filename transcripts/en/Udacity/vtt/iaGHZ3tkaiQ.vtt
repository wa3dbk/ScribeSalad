00:00:00.073 --> 00:00:02.269
So before we get started with the entire

00:00:02.269 --> 00:00:05.673
course, let’s take a look at what a team

00:00:05.673 --> 00:00:08.518
actually could accomplish at the end of this process.

00:00:08.518 --> 00:00:11.387
Now imagine you had 10 weeks or months

00:00:11.387 --> 00:00:14.186
or a year to go do this. You’d actually be

00:00:14.186 --> 00:00:17.820
able to do a lot. But what if we gave you five days?

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.246
Let me give you an example of a team from

00:00:20.246 --> 00:00:22.595
one of our classes that decided they were

00:00:22.595 --> 00:00:24.881
going to provide a rental service for

00:00:24.881 --> 00:00:29.062
professional sports jerseys. And in five days

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:31.096
– five days they personally got out of the

00:00:31.096 --> 00:00:34.010
building and spoke to 169 customers and

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.376
had 190 people come to their website. And

00:00:36.376 --> 00:00:38.256
as we saw two things, they were in the

00:00:38.256 --> 00:00:40.933
class. Let’s take a look at what their

00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:45.209
business model canvas started with and evolved to.

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:47.319
So on day one, these were their initial

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:50.315
hypothesis coming into the class. They

00:00:50.315 --> 00:00:53.251
thought their customer segments was going

00:00:53.251 --> 00:00:56.332
to be professional sports game attendees,

00:00:56.332 --> 00:00:58.900
who were going to be male, adult, less than

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.183
a $100,000 income, and attend 10 games

00:01:01.183 --> 00:01:04.250
per year. That is they were beginning with a

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.884
series of hypothesis about their customer

00:01:06.884 --> 00:01:09.602
archetype. And they thought their value

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:12.701
proposition was going to provide a cheaper

00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:15.284
way to officially license sports jerseys to a

00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:18.366
game, eliminate the risk of owning a player

00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:20.534
whose jersey is traded and to provided

00:01:20.534 --> 00:01:23.683
alternatives to purchasing counterfeit jerseys.

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:25.054
And their sales channel was going to be

00:01:25.054 --> 00:01:27.111
websites or stadium shops or ticket

00:01:27.111 --> 00:01:29.229
websites or direct mail. And how they were

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.421
going to create demand was through

00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:32.306
search ads, social media, stadium

00:01:32.306 --> 00:01:34.322
promotions. And their revenue stream was

00:01:34.322 --> 00:01:36.837
going to be through a annual subscription model.

00:01:36.837 --> 00:01:38.326
And on the left hand side, kind of the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.161
backstage of the business model canvas,

00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:42.380
their activities we’re going to be rental

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.432
tracking, shipping, dry cleaning, marketing

00:01:44.432 --> 00:01:45.867
and customer service. And they were going

00:01:45.867 --> 00:01:47.951
to have to have those resources, inventory

00:01:47.951 --> 00:01:50.985
of jerseys, warehouses, logistic systems.

00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:52.767
And their key partners might be the

00:01:52.767 --> 00:01:54.518
professional sports league, and the

00:01:54.518 --> 00:01:56.135
suppliers, and the dry cleaners, and the

00:01:56.135 --> 00:01:59.285
shop vendors, and envelope suppliers, and

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:02.600
UPS, and FedEx, and Postal Service. And

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.788
their cost structure was going to be for

00:02:03.788 --> 00:02:05.309
warehousing, shipping, cleaning, logistics

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:07.550
tracking, website development and

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.300
maintenance. And this sounds particularly

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.326
reasonable. You would look at this and go,

00:02:11.326 --> 00:02:15.341
absolutely, why do I even need to begin this class.

00:02:15.341 --> 00:02:18.080
But they got out of the building and spoke

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.314
to 60 people – 60 people by going to

00:02:21.314 --> 00:02:23.965
Yankee Stadium and actually meeting a

00:02:23.965 --> 00:02:26.734
bunch of customers on the first day. And

00:02:26.734 --> 00:02:29.832
look happened. They realized that actually

00:02:29.832 --> 00:02:32.282
women wore sports jerseys as well and

00:02:32.282 --> 00:02:33.285
there was no way you could have

00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:35.317
convinced them with that until they stood in

00:02:35.317 --> 00:02:37.587
front of the customers at Yankee Stadium

00:02:37.587 --> 00:02:40.634
and said, hey, it’s a 50-50 split. And then it

00:02:40.634 --> 00:02:43.570
was actually young adults, 18 to 30, and

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.550
they actually were casual sports fans. And

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.001
now they started to get a better

00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:50.503
understanding of what customer

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:52.782
relationships were, about getting

00:02:52.782 --> 00:02:54.807
customers, keeping them and growing

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:57.233
them. And they realized that people would

00:02:57.233 --> 00:03:00.601
maybe, also be interested in a pay-per-

00:03:00.601 --> 00:03:02.451
rental model as well as an annual

00:03:02.451 --> 00:03:05.376
subscription. Next, they got out of the

00:03:05.376 --> 00:03:08.111
building again. And now they started

00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:10.228
expanding who their customer segment

00:03:10.228 --> 00:03:12.559
was and they actually split the segment into

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:14.576
two. They realized there were different

00:03:14.576 --> 00:03:18.075
archetypes; sports jersey owners, who were

00:03:18.075 --> 00:03:21.376
male, 13 to 35 but there was also another

00:03:21.376 --> 00:03:23.910
archetype which were people who attended

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.250
a single game. And they were male and

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.234
female 18-30 and they were casual fans.

00:03:30.234 --> 00:03:32.254
And so now they actually were able to take

00:03:32.254 --> 00:03:35.200
their revenue stream and match it to their

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.017
archetype. So for sports jersey owners, an

00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:40.033
annual subscription made sense, but for

00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:42.593
single game attendees, pay-per-rental

00:03:42.593 --> 00:03:45.520
made sense. And their value prop differed

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.247
for again those two different archetypes. As

00:03:48.247 --> 00:03:50.634
you will see later, what we need is every

00:03:50.634 --> 00:03:52.962
time we have a unique archetype, we need

00:03:52.962 --> 00:03:55.130
to have minimum a matching value

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.498
proposition and matching revenue model

00:03:57.498 --> 00:03:59.430
for each archetype.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.033
On the fourth day, they’ve learned some

00:04:01.033 --> 00:04:03.383
more things. Most importantly they learned

00:04:03.383 --> 00:04:05.034
how much would some of those sports

00:04:05.034 --> 00:04:07.981
jersey owners actually pay in an annual

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:11.331
subscription. They actually started asking,

00:04:11.331 --> 00:04:13.531
some serious solid numbers. And the

00:04:13.531 --> 00:04:16.605
answer they got back was $200. And they

00:04:16.605 --> 00:04:18.708
also understood that social media would be

00:04:18.708 --> 00:04:21.825
big component in customer acquisition.

00:04:21.825 --> 00:04:24.069
The next day, they learned some more.

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:26.097
They actually learned another alternative

00:04:26.097 --> 00:04:28.311
for sports jersey owners would be a

00:04:28.311 --> 00:04:30.444
monthly subscription and also a one time

00:04:30.444 --> 00:04:32.927
rental. And they started thinking about how

00:04:32.927 --> 00:04:35.529
would you keep those customers, that is,

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:37.195
how would you eliminate churn and

00:04:37.195 --> 00:04:38.929
increase royalty. And they started to think

00:04:38.929 --> 00:04:41.378
about seniority royalty programs and how

00:04:41.378 --> 00:04:43.328
they would grow those customers by cross

00:04:43.328 --> 00:04:45.750
selling and up selling them with premium

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.238
subscriptions and family plans.

00:04:48.238 --> 00:04:51.414
So you could see after five days, just five

00:04:51.414 --> 00:04:55.003
days after talking to 160 customers you

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:57.807
could see how the business model evolved

00:04:57.807 --> 00:05:00.149
dramatically from something that looked like

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:02.483
this on day 1 to something that looked like

00:05:02.483 --> 00:05:07.049
this on day 5. Day 1, a series of untested

00:05:07.049 --> 00:05:10.017
hypothesis, a faith based enterprise. On

00:05:10.017 --> 00:05:13.515
day 5 the faith has turned into facts. And

00:05:13.515 --> 00:05:16.181
this start up is on the road to actually

00:05:16.181 --> 00:05:18.818
building something that customers might want.

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:20.948
So in the rest of these lectures, we’re going

00:05:20.948 --> 00:05:23.382
to take you through each one of the business

00:05:23.382 --> 00:05:25.833
model components and hoping you will get

00:05:25.833 --> 00:05:28.848
out of the building just like this team to test

00:05:28.848 --> 00:05:32.000
each one of your hypothesis
