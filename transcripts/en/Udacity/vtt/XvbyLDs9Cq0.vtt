00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.836
The fully factored form of this rational function is T equals 1.932 x squared

00:00:05.836 --> 00:00:11.265
times x plus 10 for the numerator and in the denominator, 2 x times 11 x plus

00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:18.254
50. From the denominator, we can see that the values of x where the function

00:00:18.254 --> 00:00:24.056
will be undefined are x equals 0, and x equals negative 50 over 11. So x is not

00:00:24.056 --> 00:00:26.370
allowed to equal either of these values.
