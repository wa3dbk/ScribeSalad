Alright, so let's take a look at another piece of code: now this is another bit

of the game we'll be building, but there are a few errors here, that we've added in.

00:00:09.555 --> 00:00:14.189
Your job is to go through this code, find the errors that were introduced,

00:00:14.216 --> 00:00:19.030
and then fix them based on the syntax you learned previously. Good luck.
