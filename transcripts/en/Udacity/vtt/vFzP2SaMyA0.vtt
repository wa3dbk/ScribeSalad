00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.220
Game engines are not really libraries.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.500
They're more properly
classified as frameworks.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.930
And frameworks have this important
concept of inversion of control.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.680
When you're using libraries,

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.230
you've got your code that
is doing most of the work.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.790
However, you have a couple of places
where you're going to need some help.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.440
So you plug in a couple different
libraries, your code's running along.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.280
You call into one of the libraries for
help with something specific,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.510
like drawing or playing a sound.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.080
And then your code resumes control and
keeps doing what it's doing.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.890
On the other hand,

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.590
when you're using a framework,
the framework is doing most of the work.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.550
And then has one particular place
where you insert your code.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.470
So, the framework is going along,
allocating resources,

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.060
determining when things get called.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.580
And then, eventually, when it's time for
your application-specific logic,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.980
the framework calls into your
code to do something and then,

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.670
your code returns control
back to the framework.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.440
This is called inversion of control.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.220
Or, more colloquially,
The Hollywood Principle.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.410
&gt;&gt; Fantastic audition, kid.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.230
You're a real talent,

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.650
you're going to be a star, so
I'll call you when we gotta roll.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.510
No, no, you don't call us, we call you.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.980
&gt;&gt; For instance, the game engine
handles stuff like starting up the app,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.520
setting up a place to draw,
allocating various resources.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.120
And then only when it's finally time to
draw a frame of the game, then it calls

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.560
your code to provide the game specific
logic needed to draw that frame.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.060
When you're done drawing, you return
control back to the framework.
