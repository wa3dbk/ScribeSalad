00:00:00.598 --> 00:00:05.436
Android TV gives you the tools to easily
extend your existing app or game, or

00:00:05.436 --> 00:00:08.016
create new ones just for the big screen.

00:00:08.016 --> 00:00:11.368
The most important thing to
remember here is that it's android.

00:00:11.368 --> 00:00:14.509
It's the same platform you already
used to build your phone apps.

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.352
In fact, most of that code can
be used for the TV app as well.

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:20.873
It can even be in the same APK.

00:00:20.873 --> 00:00:22.665
Here are the differences.

00:00:22.665 --> 00:00:25.233
First, you've got to
declare the activity that's

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:26.522
intended to run on the TV.

00:00:26.522 --> 00:00:28.355
This is done on the manifest.

00:00:28.355 --> 00:00:32.598
Second, you want to update your UI
to use the Leanback Support Library.

00:00:32.598 --> 00:00:36.352
It is not strictly required, and if you
like making things hard on yourself,

00:00:36.352 --> 00:00:37.345
then don't use it.

00:00:37.345 --> 00:00:41.679
For the rest of us, interface
widgets such as BrowseFragment,

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:47.235
DetailsFragment, and SearchFragment make
building a great TV UI fast and easy.

00:00:47.235 --> 00:00:52.181
The third and final step is to make your
app and content available to the user.

00:00:52.181 --> 00:00:55.209
In the first step, you will have
declared the Leanback launcher

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:58.759
intent-filter so that your app shows
up in the apps row on the home screen.

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:01.392
To have it show up in
the games row instead,

00:01:01.392 --> 00:01:04.549
you just need to set is game
to true in the manifest.

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.400
There's also the opportunity for

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.177
your content to appear in the
recommendations row or through search.

00:01:10.177 --> 00:01:13.646
The recommendations row is an essential
feature of the home screen.

00:01:13.646 --> 00:01:17.568
It gives users quick access to
dynamic and relevant content.

00:01:17.568 --> 00:01:21.832
It's essentially a bunch of cards that
represent a system or App Action,

00:01:21.832 --> 00:01:24.599
notification, activity,
or piece of media.

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:28.267
We'll show you a little later how
to get your content shown here.

00:01:28.267 --> 00:01:32.809
Search is important too, because users
often have specific content in mind and

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:37.308
browsing for that content is usually not
the fastest or easiest way to find it.

00:01:37.308 --> 00:01:42.186
However, you can add a search action
in your app, which you should do, but

00:01:42.186 --> 00:01:43.277
why stop there?

00:01:43.277 --> 00:01:47.842
We'll also show you how to get your
content in Android TV's global search

00:01:47.842 --> 00:01:48.439
as well.

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:52.339
That's it, three major steps to
getting the great experience for

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:54.019
your content on Android TV.

00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:58.621
Declare your activity, use the Leanback
library to make everything look and

00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:02.938
feel as it should on the TV, and
then integrate with recommendations and

00:02:02.938 --> 00:02:03.530
search.
