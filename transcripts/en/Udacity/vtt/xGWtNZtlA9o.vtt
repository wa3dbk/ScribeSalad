00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.319
Since you want to divide this entire side by 4, but we know that 12 is going to

00:00:04.331 --> 00:00:08.674
multiply each of the terms inside the parentheses, you can conveniently just

00:00:08.686 --> 00:00:12.844
divide 12 by 4, which is something really nice. That just gives us 3 as our

00:00:12.856 --> 00:00:17.138
coefficient instead of 12. Over here, the 4 is canceled out and we just have 2x

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.498
plus 7.
