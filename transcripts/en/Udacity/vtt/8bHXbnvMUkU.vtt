00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Use list comprehensions to identify all the TAs

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
who are teaching a 300-level course.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So that's any course beginning with the number 3,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
which in this case will be Gundega and Job.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You may want to use the string.find method to help you out here.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Your variable, ta_300, should look exactly like this.
