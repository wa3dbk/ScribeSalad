Now that we have all of our canvas tiles filled in. Our drawing code actually

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:07.296
manages to be much simple. All we have to do is walk through our canvas tile

00:00:07.296 --> 00:00:11.133
rate, and check if the given canvas tile is visible. If so, draw it to a primary

00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:14.993
canvas. So let's go ahead and fill in that code. Now, before you do that. Don't

00:00:14.993 --> 00:00:18.707
forget that you still have to offset your canvas tile by the viewRect. So take

00:00:18.707 --> 00:00:19.641
that into account.
