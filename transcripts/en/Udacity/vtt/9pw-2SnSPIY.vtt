00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.960
So that concludes this lesson.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.540
It concludes the lesson on tracking.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.410
It concludes what seems like months
of recording about tracking.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.490
Somehow this ended up being a lot but

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.610
its really a cool part
of computer vision.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.450
You have probabilistic state.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.230
You have the notion of measurements and

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.930
the idea of combining those to come
up with what's really going on

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.970
in the world, which at its heart is
what computer vision is all about.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.560
Also for many of you,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.060
even if you don't end up doing computer
vision this idea of maintaining

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.810
a consistent interpretation over time
as something changes becomes important

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.190
whether you're tracking the state of
traffic flow over a bridge, something,

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.040
whatever it is this idea of maintaining
Interesting interpretation over time.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.820
So some of the principles we
learned here from computer vision,

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.150
can be applied to those
more generic situations.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.840
Anyway, that's it for tracking.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.790
Onward and upward.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.870
Pretty soon we'll start
talking about recognition, and

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.470
lots of other cool stuff.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.970
See you later.
