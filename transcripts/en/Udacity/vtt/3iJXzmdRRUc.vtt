00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.316
Now that their sound manager is initialized. The next thing we need to take

00:00:03.316 --> 00:00:06.980
care of is actually loading our sound effects so that they're ready to play.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.134
Now the Web Audio API is similar to the image loading process that we use for

00:00:11.134 --> 00:00:16.024
Canvas. We only load images asynchronously. Now for essentially the same

00:00:16.024 --> 00:00:19.608
reasons. So what we're going to do is check if the sound has already been

00:00:19.608 --> 00:00:24.496
loaded. And if it is, we call our call back function. If its not we kick off a

00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:28.030
load in the form of an XML a to the p request, and then assign a callback

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:34.273
function for once the load has completed. Finally we're going to return to

00:00:34.273 --> 00:00:38.010
actual clip data either way. Now here's some skeleton code to get you up and

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.209
running. What we'd like you to do is to fill in the code So let them performs

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:46.081
the Asynchronous loading that I just desribed
