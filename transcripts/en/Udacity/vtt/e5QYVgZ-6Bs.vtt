00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.079
The answer is red.

00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:04.364
In addition to the two parameters being passed between parentheses,

00:00:04.364 --> 00:00:07.870
which of course get bound to the input parameters, one and two.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.900
I'm now passing a third parameter by calling that function on the right side of

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.280
a dot access for property look up.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.270
The value that appears on the left of that dot will automatically be

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.190
given the name, this, inside of that function invocation.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.320
This behavior is useful if we plan on doing much object oriented programming,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.430
since there will usually be a relevant focal object for any given method call.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.570
And that object generally appears to the left of

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.870
the dot when the method gets called.
