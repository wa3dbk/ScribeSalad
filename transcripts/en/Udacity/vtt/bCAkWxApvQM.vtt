00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.810
Inconsistency occurs when two different entries contradict one

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.590
another. So for example, if a customer is

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.480
recorded in two different current addresses, we've got

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.060
a consistency problem. Fixing consistency problems really boils down

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.570
to the problem of who do I trust

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.880
the most, or more specifically, which data source do

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.910
I trust the most? So with our address

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.030
example, we might ask ourselves which entry was collected

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.860
most recently. or if our problem is one that's

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.250
a little more general say just location information. Another type

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.600
of question we can ask is which collection method

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.500
is likely to be most reliable? Because one data source

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.920
might be populated based on GPS while another is

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.450
based on user enter data. We might actually have a

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.710
third that's using IP based location detection and all

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.410
three of these are contributing location information to our system.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.110
So again, addressing consistency problems is about determining which

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.950
of our data sources is most likely to be correct.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.460
And possibly introducing agreement among our inconsistent records by

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.120
copying the data from the record we trust the most.
