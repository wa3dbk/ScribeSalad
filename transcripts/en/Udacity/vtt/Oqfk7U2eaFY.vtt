We have seen that the processor can improve performance a lot, barely ordering

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.070
instructions. But things are not that rosy in the instruction reorder land.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.602
In real programs we can have exceptions. Such as divide by 0, that can be messed

00:00:14.602 --> 00:00:19.870
up if we don't execute instructions exactly in program order. This lesson

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:25.020
explains how to clean up the reordering mess when exceptions do happen
