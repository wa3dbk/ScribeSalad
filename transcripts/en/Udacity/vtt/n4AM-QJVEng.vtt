00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.000
We have our dispatch quiz. Let's look at the solution.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.750
If this instruction was indeed issued in the previous cycle,

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.964
meaning it came into the reservation station. Then, depending on,

00:00:08.964 --> 00:00:12.580
when do we select [INAUDIBLE] instructions for execution. Let's say we do it,

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.620
kind of, you know, towards the end of the cycle. There might not be enough time.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.100
Simply, this reservation station, when we're considering,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.200
what can be dispatch for execution. This one simply wasn't there yet, basically.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.610
In the same cycle where we select something, this got inserted here and it

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.880
wasn't inserted early enough in the cycle, so this is possibly correct. It can

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.840
happen that's, that's basically you cannot do both of the things consecutively

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.810
in the same cycle. Another instruction was dispatched to the add unit. This is

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.770
entirely possible if, for example, RS1 will sent. In the previous cycle to,

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.300
to the execution unit, then this instruction couldn't have because then it can,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.980
can't take only one instruction. So this is also possibly correct.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.240
RS2 is older than RS3, so RS3 cannot dispatch until RS2 does.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.350
This cannot be correct. Because, in out of order execution in [UNKNOWN]

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.490
algorithm is one of the out of order algorithms, we will dispatch an instruction

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.960
as soon as its operands are ready. If we were concerned about this,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.780
when the operands are ready, we still don't dispatch the instruction, then we

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.690
will have an in-ordered processor, which we don't want. Actually, the reason why

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.940
this is an out-of-order processor is because, is that instructions like this can

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.790
execute even if they are not the oldest instruction in the reservation stations.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.090
So this is definitely not true. So the correct answers are only one and two.
