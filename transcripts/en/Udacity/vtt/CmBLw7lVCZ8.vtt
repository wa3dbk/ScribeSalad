00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.164
So for this quiz I want to see if you understand the difference between static

00:00:03.164 --> 00:00:07.039
and dynamic typing. For each property listing below you should select which type

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:11.110
of language whether it's statically type language or a dynamically type language

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.998
is typically more likely to have that property. Here are the properties it

00:00:14.998 --> 00:00:19.820
requires less code for the same amount of computation. Check whether you think

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.541
it's more likely for a statically type language to require less code, or a

00:00:23.541 --> 00:00:27.696
dynamically type language. It's less likely for programs to crash when they are

00:00:27.696 --> 00:00:31.082
running. It's more fun to program in. This is certainly a little subjective.

00:00:31.082 --> 00:00:36.180
Programs should execute faster, and it would be a better choice for programming

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.300
avionics flight control software for a new fighter jet. This is a bit

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.692
subjective, and might require a little bit of speculation on your part, but I

00:00:43.692 --> 00:00:47.137
think if you think carefully about the difference between static and dynamic

00:00:47.137 --> 00:00:50.423
type checking, you'll be able to answer correctly, or at least get the same

00:00:50.423 --> 00:00:51.453
answer that I will.
