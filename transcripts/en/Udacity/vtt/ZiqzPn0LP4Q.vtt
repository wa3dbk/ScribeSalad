00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is the second one.  R4 is receiving this.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So it'd better be something encrypted with a key that R4 can decrypt.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
R4 should not be able to decrypt something encrypted with the public key of Alice.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
R4 could decrypt these two because R4 could know the public key of Bob,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but then anyone could also decrypt these two.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So we want it encrypted in a way that only R4 can open.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
That's like the envelope with a seal that only a particular person should be able to open.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The content needs to be visible to R4 where to send the message next,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
which is what the To Alice part does, but invisible to R4 what the actual content is.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Alice looks different from the other routers the way I'm writing in here.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
For this to be secure, there shouldn't be any real distinction between R4 and Alice.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
That's hard to get in a network like this.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So it probably is the case that R4 actually learns that Alice is the endpoint,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but because the message was received from the previous one in this chain

00:00:52.000 --> 99:59:59.000
doesn't learn that it was Bob talking with Alice.
