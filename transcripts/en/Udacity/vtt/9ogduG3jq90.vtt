Let me ask a different quiz--suppose you run linear regression, and you found that b=4 and a=-3.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
To remind you, this describes the following linear relationship between x and y.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
My question is about the correlation coefficient r.

00:00:15.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Will r be positive, negative, zero, or can't we tell as in can't tell?Check exactly one box.
