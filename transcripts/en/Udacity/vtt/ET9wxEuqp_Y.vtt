00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:02.676
Let's turn to the technology side a little bit.

00:00:02.676 --> 00:00:06.222
Ten years ago if I wanted a faster computer,

00:00:06.222 --> 00:00:10.304
then what I would do is wait 6 months and then the clock speed of the CPUs I could buy

00:00:10.304 --> 00:00:12.579
would be 30% higher than it was,

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:16.282
and I'd go down to the local store and buy a new faster processor.

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:22.763
And that was largely determined by just a faster clock that I'd go from 1 to 2 to 3 GHz.

00:00:22.763 --> 00:00:24.289
That's not happening anymore.

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:25.223
How come?

00:00:25.223 --> 00:00:25.923
Yeah, so it's interesting.

00:00:25.923 --> 00:00:29.859
A lot of people refer to that scaling in CPU performance as Moore's Law,

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:31.501
which is a little bit of a misnomer.

00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:36.314
Moore's Law really predicts a growth rate in the number of devices you can fabricate on a chip.

00:00:36.314 --> 00:00:37.647
And Moore's Law is actually alive and well.

00:00:37.647 --> 00:00:41.230
We can still, every generation of technology, fabricate more devices

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.750
and assuming extra chip, that's still growing exponentially.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.552
What stopped around 2005 was what's called the Nard scaling,

00:00:49.552 --> 00:00:54.156
which was scaling the voltages that we operate our chips at as we scaled the dimensions

00:00:54.156 --> 00:00:56.758
that we make the transistors at.

00:00:56.758 --> 00:01:00.062
And this stopped because of weakened current in the devices.

00:01:00.062 --> 00:01:05.666
And without going too technically into it, what that meant is that now when we get a new generation of chip,

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:12.521
let's say we produced a line width by from say unit to 0.7 of whatever that unit was.

00:01:12.521 --> 00:01:18.593
A recent jump is from 28 nanometers to 20 nanometers.

00:01:18.593 --> 00:01:22.731
When we do that, we now get twice as many devices in the same amount of area.

00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:26.570
In the old days we would scale the voltage by 0.7

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:33.898
and since the power goes as CV squared, C would go at 0.7 the voltage will go by 0.7 squared.

00:01:33.898 --> 00:01:37.334
We'd wind up with the, I should say energy goes to CV squared.

00:01:37.334 --> 00:01:43.873
We would wind up with energy of switching the device being about a third of what it was before √8,

00:01:43.873 --> 00:01:51.677
so we'd get this 3x improvement in performace per watt of a basic unit,

00:01:51.677 --> 00:01:53.512
and then you can take that and use it in various ways.

00:01:53.512 --> 00:01:55.815
One of the ways we used it was to crank clock rate up.

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:57.851
Now that's not happening anymore.

00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:05.395
Now that we're holding voltage constant, we're getting a little bit of energy gain from the 0.7 in capacity.

00:02:05.395 --> 00:02:09.062
But even that, we're not really getting the whole 0.7, we're getting maybe half of that.

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:18.316
We get perhaps in a generation of technology a 15% improvement in the basic underlying technology.

00:02:18.316 --> 00:02:21.411
So that's why you can't take the same old serial processor

00:02:21.411 --> 00:02:23.013
and just have it go faster anymore.

00:02:23.013 --> 00:02:25.251
You're not going to get any of the frequency improvement.

00:02:25.251 --> 00:02:27.184
Frequencies are largely flattened out.

00:02:27.184 --> 00:02:34.233
You get more parallelism but it's no longer that factor of 3 each generation that you used to get.

00:02:34.233 --> 00:02:42.267
It's now you know perhaps 15% or so before you start applying architecture and circuit innovation.

00:02:42.267 --> 00:02:45.231
If you just relied on process, that's all you would get.

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:50.206
Even though each one of those transistors is a little smaller and sucks up a little less power,

00:02:50.206 --> 00:02:53.308
that's not nearly enough to change the fact that you're making these bigger

00:02:53.308 --> 00:02:54.687
and more parallel every generation.

00:02:54.687 --> 00:03:01.964
That's right. The better way to think about it is suppose you got the whole 0.7 on capacitance in that scaling.

00:03:01.964 --> 00:03:05.887
That means you now sort of are 30% less energy.

00:03:05.887 --> 00:03:09.592
So you can now put 30% more units on.

00:03:09.592 --> 00:03:15.330
You would only grow 30% more parallelism in a power constrained environment on that same dime.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.702
You could take that 30% either in clock rate or in more units.

00:03:19.702 --> 00:03:24.007
Although it's harder to take in clock rate because that scaling is less linear.

00:03:24.007 --> 00:03:27.577
Now, you don't get the whole 30%. You may get half of that for various reasons.

00:03:27.577 --> 00:03:32.515
But that's what you're getting to play with each generation until you start innovating.

00:03:32.515 --> 00:03:34.956
That's why it's actually kind of fun to be a computer architect these days,

00:03:34.956 --> 00:03:36.820
because that's where the value is.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.867
It used be largely in process, and so companies that had a proprietary process kind of an advantage ,

00:03:42.867 --> 00:03:44.356
and they still have a little bit of an advantage

00:03:44.356 --> 00:03:47.960
but that advantage has really shrunk since process matters less these days.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.355
And what you do with the process, the architecture and circuits

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:52.699
and programming system matters a lot more.
