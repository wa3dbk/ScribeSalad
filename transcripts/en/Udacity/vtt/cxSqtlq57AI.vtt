00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.887
We begin by finding the real roots or the real zeros, and sketching the graph

00:00:03.887 --> 00:00:09.850
of polynomial functions. So let's start by looking at this first function.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.968
Please take some time to find the roots of the function g of x equals the

00:00:13.968 --> 00:00:20.395
quantity x plus 2 times the quantity x Squared plus 1. Remember that the word

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:25.120
root and the word zero mean the same thing, values of x that make the function

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.416
0. Please separate your answers by commas.
