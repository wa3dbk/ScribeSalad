00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.630
So what do you do to
improve your metric?

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.230
&gt;&gt; Iterate, right?

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.720
Talk to your users and change.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.070
If something's not working,
there's a reason it's not working.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.380
I think the worst thing that happens
when metrics aren't going well.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.780
The two worst things I would say that
people do when their metrics aren't

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.340
moving in the right direction.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.480
They stick their heads in the sand and
say,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.340
no, I understand better
than anyone else.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.090
So I'm just keep down the same path.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.910
Which typically doesn't work
because you're getting signals and

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.540
the other worst thing that people
do is people switch metrics.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.110
People say, oh well I know we were
suppose to focus on revenue but

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.080
it's not growing so
we're going to to focus on users.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.370
Because they focus on, or press or
money raised or something.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.760
Because that's something they can
point to as a sign of success,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.130
because honestly, it's really,
really hard to admit that you're not

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.150
doing something right and that you're
failing, especially as an entrepreneur.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.960
Because your ego is actually
pretty important, again,

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.830
to push you through those walls.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.180
But you can't let it get
in the way of change.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.510
You have to understand what
you're getting wrong and fix it.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.210
&gt;&gt; And when you iterate you do A/B
testing or any other type of testing?

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.748
&gt;&gt; It depends.

00:01:07.748 --> 00:01:11.550
I mean A/B testing is
specifically really about

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.660
changing something on your website.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.660
Doing two different versions to
see what happens to click rates,

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.140
if you have a different picture,
or something like that.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.250
So that can be useful, but typically
you need to go deeper than that, right?

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.390
You have to tinker with
the guts of what you're doing.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.060
If you're losing customers,

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.210
because your server load times are too
slow A/B testing won't help you there.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.420
You actually have to
re-engineer what you've built.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.690
If you have the completely
wrong features, A/B testing.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.650
You know, you could do
the thing that we used to do,

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.410
which was put the dead link and
see if people click on it.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.750
That's a form of A/B testing.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.470
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; But then you have

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.190
to build a whole new thing.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.100
And, I think about A/B testing
as incredibly powerful,

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.190
but very much about incrementalism.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.470
A lot of the the time when it comes
to iterating your product you have to

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.490
take leaps.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.200
So this is actually, I think,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.370
something I didn't say before, which
is listen to your customers feedback.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.720
We don't build exactly what they say.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.740
You have to make the intuitive leap from
the feedback you get to what they're

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.315
going to need in the future and what
they're going to want in the future.

00:02:12.315 --> 00:02:14.110
A/B testing won't get you there.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.030
Strong product vision will.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.350
&gt;&gt; So
when do you know that you can launch?

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.070
&gt;&gt; There's no way to know.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.930
I think precisely, I think the main
thing is just launch already, right.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.620
If you've built that thing,

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.660
that is useful, even in the smallest
way to your users, put it out there.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.850
Because if you wait for

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.360
some sort of monolithic launch,
you're going to be too late.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.430
I think this is one of the key
differences between how start-ups launch

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.060
and how software is made today
versus ten or 15 years ago.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.720
There's a great book about Intuit.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.850
I'm totally blanking on
the name of the book,

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.430
but it's sort of the story of Intuit and
how they beat Microsoft Money.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.710
Because they did, which was crazy.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.770
That the small startup beat Microsoft.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.080
And I remember very distinctly you know
they had to launch a useful product, and

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.731
it's tough because it was you know
accounting software and tax software.

00:03:05.731 --> 00:03:08.510
Oh I think it wasn't tax
software at that point,

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.450
it was Personal Money Management
software.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.160
And it needed a lot, and
they did this Herculean effort.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.410
To get the whole thing done and
the CTO worked for

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.960
a week without sleep kind of thing.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.400
And the reason they had to do that
is because they actually had to

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.360
press floppy disks, right.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.070
You had to get the software
onto a floppy disk and

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.380
making the whole company came
in to press floppy disks.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.900
And one of the times they did this there
was a bug they realized afterwards.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.310
They all came back the next weekend,
repressed them, sent them out.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.820
And so that was this idea that you
had to be ready to launch kind and

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.310
like really ready with everything done.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.230
And what that lead to was a hell
of a lot of up front investment

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.650
with no idea whether or
not the product would work.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.530
Now, because of the internet,

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.040
you can basically deploy something
smaller and then add to it over time.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.570
And so, we tell startups again and
again and again, just launch something.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:59.690
Because, a lot of the time,

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.760
the thing that you think will be the
next step in your company's life isn't,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.840
and you won't know it unless you're
interacting with customers, so.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.300
&gt;&gt; So, a lot of entrepreneurs want
to wait until they're feature ready.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.270
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Until the last mile feature is done?

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.540
&gt;&gt; That they have the right
number of pixel padding.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.240
We're talking crazy things.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.120
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Where people are delaying a launch

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.630
because they want a very specific
graphic they hired someone to do.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.820
Nobody cares if you have that graphic,
right.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.980
They care whether or not the product
works and does something for us.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.390
&gt;&gt; Right, and what are, for example,

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:40.410
the bad things that you forget to do
in launch, or should wait to launch.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.880
&gt;&gt; Well it has to work.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.680
Sometimes people will focus too
much say on visual design and

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.330
the thing won't work.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.810
It just won't load,
you hit a button and nothing happens.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.330
That's the worst thing that you
can possibly do because you get

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.310
one chance to make a first impression
on someone and it better be good.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.010
On the other hand, you can launch
as many times as you want.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.190
Right?
No one will remember you

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.580
launched if they never saw it.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.270
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So it's okay

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.990
just to put it out there.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.720
It doesn't have to be
a big splashy thing,

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.250
just put it out there, see what happens
and keep launching until people notice.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.480
&gt;&gt; And start to learn.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.150
&gt;&gt; And start to learn about you, right?

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.490
So every time you got a new feature,
you launched, right,

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.530
you're launching fresh until you hit
that point where people know about you.
