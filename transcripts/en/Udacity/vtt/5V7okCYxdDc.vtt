00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.820
So here is a representation of the restaurant script. Here is the name of

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.750
the script, restaurant, and the six elements that we talked about earlier.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.430
Track, props, roles, entry, result and scenes. So

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.180
this particular track refers to formal dining. Here are the props, tables, menu,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.590
check, money, food and place. And for food and place we can use symbols. These

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.640
symbols can be used as variables. So where I may different kinds of foods and

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.370
different kinds of places in a restaurant. Here are the rules, so

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.710
S is a customer, W is a waiter, C is a cook, M is a cashier, O is an owner and

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.350
so on. The entry conditions are S is hungry, S as the member is a customer,

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.640
S has money and those conditions are that S has less money. S is not hungry.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.530
S is pleased. But O has more money. And scenes, well,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.520
let's discuss them in the next slide. Here is a representation of scene one.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.640
We'll call it the entering scene. This particular scene consists of

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.640
several events. So in the first frame, the customer S, S stands for

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.800
the customer. Moves himself or herself. So S is moving himself or

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.970
herself to some restaurant, some place P. And the second frame,

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.814
the agent S, the customer Sees some table. So this frame,

00:01:12.814 --> 00:01:17.840
the customer S decides to, take an action. The particular action is, where this

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.320
agent S this customer S moves. Customer S himself or herself to the table.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.210
So this is a walking action going on. Let us continue another set just a little

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.169
bit longer. So now S is moving his own body into a sitting position. Here,

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:34.996
the waiter sees the customer, and now the waiter moves himself to the customer.

00:01:34.996 --> 00:01:41.490
And now the waiter moves the menu, to the customer. And

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.760
this completes a representation of the first scene of entering in a restaurant.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.280
One can imagine many more scenes. The next scene might be a way to customer

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.100
orders food. The third thing might be the way the waiter brings food, and so

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.520
on and so forth. And then the last thing is the customer pays the bill and

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.840
then walks out. This is a stereotypical notion of a script.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.950
Your notion of a script, might be slightly different depending on what kinds of

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.780
restaurants that you go to. In different cultures, the script for

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.889
going to a restaurant might be quite different. The point here is that

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:14.440
the script is capturing in a knowledge representation, what is known about

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.620
the stereotypical situation of going to a restaurant of a particular kind.
