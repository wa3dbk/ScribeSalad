00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.590
The Angular framework is very
relaxed in how you can use it.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.390
If you just want to use
some of its features and

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.360
not the whole framework,
then you totally can.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.530
But to stay organized and

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.780
consistent with our apps, we'll use a
project scaffolding tool called Yeoman.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.490
Before we do that let's see how
easy it is to add Angular to

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.880
an existing project.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.175
Here's a simple app that lists
some information about a brick.

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:23.398
I want to give customers the ability
to enter a number of bricks and

00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:25.320
calculate how much it'll cost.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.790
This is a simple request and can easily
be done with Vanilla JavaScript.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.290
But let's see how easy it is to
do with Angular from scratch.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.890
First we need to link to
Angular in the project.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.750
Then to bootstrap Angular,
we need to include an Angular specific

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.280
attribute called ng-app
on the body element.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.633
Now Angular will run.

00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:47.000
Awesome, except we're not
really seeing anything.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.460
Angular is actually working.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.570
We just haven't told it to do anything.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.300
To actually see something, we need to
add some special code that Angular will

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.470
use to display the information.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.200
In the index file is an input field for

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.270
the user to select how many
bricks they want to purchase.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.150
And here's a section for
the cart that will show the total price.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.820
But how do we get these two
sections linked together?

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.800
We'll look at this in more detail when
we get to the section on directives.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.580
But I'll add this Angular
attribute to the input field.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.330
Then I'll use this same value
down here in the calculation.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.970
Looking at the browser,
we now have an interactive app.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.890
Granted, this is a very simple app,
but isn't it incredible what

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.900
we've accomplished without even
opening a single JavaScript file?

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.890
So I just added the code directly
to the existing index file.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.420
That's fine for small projects,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.790
but if you're app grows or if multiple
developers are working on an app,

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.480
you'll probably want some
organization and consistency.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.550
Let's look at Yeoman to see one way
professional Angular projects are built.
