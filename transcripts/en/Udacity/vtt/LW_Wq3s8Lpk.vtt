00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.734
All right.

00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:01.730
Welcome everybody.

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.090
Hope you're having a great day.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.550
Back to computer vision and
were continuing with our work and

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:07.280
particle filters.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.410
Last time we introduced
particle filtering and

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.360
we talked about the algorithm
that actually implemented it.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.030
So were using a set of
particles representing density.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.210
And we went through the base loop of
essentially propagating the belief

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.160
forward through about the deterministic
and non-deterministic part.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.390
Then we get a measurement
which gives us a likelihood.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.590
We multiply the,
the prediction by that likelihood and

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.800
that gives us something in Bay's rule
that we can normalize to have a new

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.540
belief, a new posterior
estimate of the state.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.870
So, in this lesson, we're going to look
at some, robot vision examples that,

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.600
sort of illustrate nicely, sort of,
the simplicity of using this method.
