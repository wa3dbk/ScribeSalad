00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.764
Our last step is to simplify common factors that appear in the numerator and the

00:00:04.764 --> 00:00:09.563
denominator. I can divide each of these numbers by 1 and 2 10ths, and I'll have

00:00:09.563 --> 00:00:14.303
3 over 1. Next, I can divide 3 into 3 and 6. I rewrite my expression and then I

00:00:14.303 --> 00:00:19.043
divide 1 and 8 10ths and I get 9 10ths. Our number isn't quite yet in scientific

00:00:19.043 --> 00:00:23.666
notation, we'll need to move this decimal one place to right. So what should

00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:27.887
this last exponent be? Take some time to think about, and think about writing

00:00:27.887 --> 00:00:29.406
this number out if it helps you.
