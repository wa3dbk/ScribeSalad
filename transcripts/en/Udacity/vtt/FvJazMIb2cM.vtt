00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now, comes the answer--option D would mean that we have a huge amount of immigration

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
of recovered persons--no.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Option B would mean that the number of susceptible persons is reduced

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
by 100 persons per day that looks like immigration but not like vaccination.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
With option A, we would be changing this coefficient.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If you remember where this coefficient came from, it had to do with the probability of being infected,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
mainly more precised with the probability that a susceptible person is infected

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
by an infectious person and it had to do with the number of contacts.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It doesn't have to do with vaccination.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It's option C, we move 5 million persons from the susceptible compartment

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
to the recovered compartment.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Of course, we're cheating a little there. These 5 million persons have not recovered from the illness.

00:00:48.000 --> 99:59:59.000
They are immune as are all other recovered persons.
