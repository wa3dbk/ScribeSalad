00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's my read all function--this is the code I just took a few minutes to write,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and what you can see is that I've included a couple of assertions.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The first thing that I've asserted that the file descriptor passed 10 is greater than or equal to 0.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
These file descriptors are integers usually small ones and they have to be non-negative.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The second thing we're going to assert is that buf that is to say pointing to the block of memory

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
into which we're going to read data can't be the null pointer and just asserting buf like this

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
is implicitly a test that the pointers not null in C.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And the third thing we're going to assert is that the number of bytes to read is also non-negative.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So, given that setup and we're just going little sanity checking here, we can get to the main logic.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So the first thing we're going to do is initialize a left variable which is going to be the number of bytes

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
left to read to initially be the total number of bytes to read.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Now we're going to enter our while loop--the while loop is going to operate until either

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
the read system call returns something less than 1 that is to say it returns 0

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
indicating an end of file condition or -1 indicating an error.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And if either of those things happens, we're just going to return that value to our caller.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
If read work that is to say it read some positive number of bytes, we're going to increment

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
the buffer pointer by that number of bytes, reduce the amount of bytes left by that number of bytes,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
assert the number of bytes left hasn't gone negative due to some sort of a logic error,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and now finally if there are no bytes left, we're going to return the number of bytes read

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
which has to be just the original number of bytes but these asked to read.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So this is pretty simple code and I would expect or at least I would hope to be able to get it right

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
but I know from vast prior experience that I never get this stuffed right the first time,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
so what I want to do is be able to test it.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So what I've done is written a little test runners, and so what the test runners does is opens a program

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and so here we're just using a splay tree from Python that happens to be in this directory

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and allocating a buffer and we don't need to worry about the details here

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and then what we're going to do is 100 different times we're going to issue the read all command

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
to read the contents of the file into the buffer and then we're going to assert that

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
read all--always read the full number of bytes we're trying to read and then

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
we're also going to assert using a memory comparison function that

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
the contents of that file are the contents that we expected.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Its definitive variables initializes some code I didn't really talked about

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
to contain the data from the file.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And so what you're going to say if we do this 100 times, then our new read all call passes.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And so let's look at what happens.
