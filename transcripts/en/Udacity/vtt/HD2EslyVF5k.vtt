00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay, now for a quick quiz.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We have this definition of decorator, and we've seen how that works.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Here's an alternative that was proposed by Darius Bacon,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
which is this1 line--return the function that updates wrapper for the decorator

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
applied to the function from the original function,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and then 1 more line, which says, decorator = decorator of decorator.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Can you get any more recursive than that?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The question is, does this work?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I want you to give me the best answer.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The possible answers are yes, it does; no, it's an error; no, it correctly updates decorator

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
such as n_ary, but not the decorated function such as (seq);

00:00:36.000 --> 09:59:59.000
or no, my brain hurts.
