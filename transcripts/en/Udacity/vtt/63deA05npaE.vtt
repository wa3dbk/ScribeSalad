00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.920
I start with a model, that I think it's
good to figure out your persistence,

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.840
figure out the objects that will be
in the model, write it and test it.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.001
Once your model is in place, it's tested
enough that you're confident in it,

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:18.455
it's just much easier
to proceed from there.

00:00:18.455 --> 00:00:23.185
&gt;&gt; So, once I have everything all
ready to build a new project,

00:00:23.185 --> 00:00:26.975
my first step in Xcode is
&gt;&gt; File new project.

00:00:26.975 --> 00:00:30.070
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So the way I started out,

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.080
when I have an idea, is I want to sort
of validate the core proposition and

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.360
just verify that I can
actually build it.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.220
So I just dig in as fast as I can,
I don't worry a lot about code quality.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.000
I don't worry a lot about what
the final app is going to look like.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.340
I just want to validate that
usually its inspiration and

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.220
that's what keeps me coming
back to finish the app.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.749
&gt;&gt; So, when I'm starting to build the
app I think the most important thing is

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:00.100
to get from a to b as quick as you can.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.890
&gt;&gt; I've done a lot of
different projects and

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.810
where I usually get stuck or
stalled is when I try to optimize for

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.870
every little corner case that might
happen, so taking what your idea is and

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.390
trying to figure out how to get to stage
one, version one of the app, just have

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.630
something that you can use and that's
usually what I try to build first.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.740
&gt;&gt; I take a lot of time to read
the documentation and to make sure

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.850
the tools that I'm going to be using to
make the project are the right tools.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.880
Sometimes you find that the tools
are no longer supported and

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.170
you have to pivot and
find something new.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.620
Sometimes you find

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.770
something that just came out that's
better and easier to implement.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.290
Sometimes you find the documentation
is really hard to read, and

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.200
you have to take more time
to just decipher what it is.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.485
When I'm starting a new project
from scratch, I think of,

00:01:57.485 --> 00:02:00.150
at first I try and
make a minimum viable product.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.780
I think of the simplest version of
the app that I can possibly think of,

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.380
and then I build that.
