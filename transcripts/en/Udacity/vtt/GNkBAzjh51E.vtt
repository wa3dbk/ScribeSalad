00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.050
Incremental concept learning
is intimately connected with

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.560
human cognition.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.710
We can adopt two views of learning.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.150
In one view of learning,

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.470
the intelligent agent is given
with a large number of examples.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.570
The agent's task, then, is to detect
patterns of regularity in those examples

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.050
and learn those patterns of regularity.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.540
In the alternative view, the agent
is given one example at a time.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.800
And the agent has to gradually,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.820
incrementally learn concepts
out of those examples.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.729
Now you and I as agents,
as cognitive agents in our daily lives,

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:34.800
deal with one example at a time.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.790
Rarely is it that we
encounter millions or

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.610
hundreds of thousands of
examples given at once.

00:00:42.462 --> 00:00:45.950
Incremental concept learning is
a lot closer than kind of learning

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.490
that you and I as cognitive agents do.
