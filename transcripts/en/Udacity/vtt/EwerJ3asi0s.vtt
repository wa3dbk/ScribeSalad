00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And this is the one thing that's really important--variance is a quadratic expression.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
A final multiplier of the outcome goes out quadratically, and we talked about this,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
you might have forgotten it--it's not important.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I think now that you see it again, you might hopefully remember it.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.000
That means if you multiply 1/N inside the variance, the 1/N² outside,

00:00:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
N²=4 in this case, 0.5/4 is 0.125
