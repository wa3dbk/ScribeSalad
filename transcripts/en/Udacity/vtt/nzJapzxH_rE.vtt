00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Welcome to the first unit of CS258--How to Make Software Fail.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now, making software fail is something that I feel very strongly about, but in the big picture,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
it's not necessarily failures that we're interested but rather the fact that if we can find failures

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
in software and if we can fix these failures, then eventually we're going to run out of bugs

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and we'll have a software that actually works reliably.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now if you look at testing software as a whole--as a large problem--it's really kind of daunting,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
because we can look at Microsoft's products and we can see that Microsoft didn't manage

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to eliminate all the bugs in their products, and we can look at Google's services and we

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
can see that Google didn't manage to eliminate all the bugs in their services and so we might

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
want to say to ourselves--how can we possibly get rid of all the bugs in our own software.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Well, what turns out to be the case is the testing problem is not really this large monolithic problem,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
but rather can be broken down into a lot of smaller sub-problems, and by looking at those

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
sub-problems, we can apply known techniques and things that people have done before,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and we could sort of pattern match on these problems, and once we've become good

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
at these smaller problems, then we can become much better testers as a whole.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.907
And this is what Unit 1 is about.
