00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Just to illustrate this example, imagine we'd start up with some graph H. It's a little bit of a mess.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
There's a lot of edges in here but we're going to do is convert this to a new graph G,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
which is the complement of H, and so every place in H where there is an edge we leave the edge out,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and every place where there is not an edge, we add an edge.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
For example, this node is not connected to this one or this one.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So in the complement graph, we connect it that one and that one.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This node is connected to three on the top, one on the bottom.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So we connect it to this one on the top and these two on the bottom.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This one on the top and these two in bottom.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So we carefully constructed this complement graph G and the thing that you need to realize now is that

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
G, this new graph, which is the complement of H has an S-clique

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
if and only if H has an S independent set.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
In fact, it's the same set of nodes. So here's our four clique for example.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
This is similar to the graph that we looked at before.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This is our four clique in G and if we look that corresponds exactly to a four independent set in H

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
because it has all the pairwise edges in G and then it has to fail to have all those pairwise edges in H.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So that's how can use the solution into the clique problem to solve the independent set problem.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Now in this particular example, well it illustrates a general idea

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
which is we take instances of one problem and we transform them into instance of another.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
In this case the transformation is really very straightforward.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Maybe it wasn't obvious to you at first. Now that I putted that, it's probably pretty straightforward.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Some of these reduction actually can be much more involved.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
This one actually is also really easily reversed.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So if we have an algorithm for independent set.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
We can use that to solve the clique problem the same way.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Invert the graph where I complement the graph, look for the independent set and that tells us

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
what the clique is in the original graph,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
but sometimes again the connection is not always so straightforward.
