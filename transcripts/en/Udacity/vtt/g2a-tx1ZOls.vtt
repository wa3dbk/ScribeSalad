Now because this is an intro course, we can't go into depth into operant

00:00:03.687 --> 00:00:06.808
conditioning, but I do want you to know that it's used across a variety of

00:00:06.808 --> 00:00:11.985
disciplines and subfields. For example, we did see Dr. Zelig use operant

00:00:11.985 --> 00:00:16.340
conditioning in her animal training and behavioral modification. We also know

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.784
that operant conditioning is used in treating drug dependence. People in

00:00:20.784 --> 00:00:24.547
industrial organizational psychology use the principals of operant conditioning

00:00:24.547 --> 00:00:29.390
to increase worker productivity as well as decrease accidents on the job site.
