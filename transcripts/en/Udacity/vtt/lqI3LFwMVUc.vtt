00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:01.900
Thanks Ryan.

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:06.810
For exploratory analysis like these plots, we can clearly see patterns or

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.062
deviations in the data that we might miss from a table or summary statistics.

00:00:12.062 --> 00:00:14.290
But there's still an even more important reason for

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.880
creating graphics like these in the first place.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.166
The key lies in the immense power of our visual processing system.

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:24.680
Danish physicist Tor Norretrander converted the bandwidth of

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.230
our senses to computer terms to help us understand this power.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.510
In this visualization,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.940
I can see that sight takes up the majority of the frame here.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.590
In fact, it's been said that sight can process information up to the speed of

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.710
computer networks, or an Ethernet cable.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.930
Sense of taste has the bandwidth of a calculator.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.900
And the small white box at the corner of this frame is only 0.7% of the area,

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.600
and it's what we are aware of when all this processing is happening.
