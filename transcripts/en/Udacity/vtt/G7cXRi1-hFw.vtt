00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.200
How would you use planning to develop an agent that can

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.630
answer Raven's progressive matrices? So, the first question you want to ask here

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.570
is what are our states? What's our initial state? And what's our final state?

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.120
Given that, what are the operators that allow the transition between them.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.070
How would we select those operators?

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.710
We are talking about partial ordering planning in this lesson,

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.920
what conflicts are possible when we are trying to solve Raven's problems?

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.440
How would we detect those conflicts beforehand and avoid them? Note that again

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.020
we can consider this at two different levels. First, we can think of the agent

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.640
as having a plan for how to address any new problem that comes in. Or second, we

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.640
can consider the agent as discerning the underlying plan behind a new problem.
