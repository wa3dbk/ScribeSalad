00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.330
&gt;From the mocks, we can see when a list item is clicked we should

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.720
perform an action to open up the details page for the forecast. How do

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.870
we implement the click listener behavior? Take

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.740
a look at the ListView documentation. What

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.250
method is used to wire up behavior on a list item when it is clicked?
