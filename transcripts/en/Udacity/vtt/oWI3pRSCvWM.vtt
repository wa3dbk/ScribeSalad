00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.802
For this first question we separate the hexadecimal digits like this, 0 5 is

00:00:04.802 --> 00:00:11.372
easy, that's 5 in integer. 24 is 2 times 16, which is 32 plus 4, which is then

00:00:11.372 --> 00:00:19.408
36 total. The hexadecimal number D zero is 208 as D is decimal 13 and 13 times

00:00:19.408 --> 00:00:25.614
16 is 208. To convert to floating point, we divide by 255. Not much divides

00:00:25.614 --> 00:00:32.503
evenly by this value, so we round off. 127 converts to 0.49803 etc, which we

00:00:32.503 --> 00:00:41.530
round off to 0.498. 200 divided by 255 is 0.784. 255 divided by 255 is easy.

00:00:41.531 --> 00:00:48.766
That's 1.0 exactly. For this last problem we start with 0x which shows a

00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:55.890
hexadecimal number 0.4 times 255 is 102. In hex this is 6 times 16 plus 6. So

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:03.530
66. 0.0 times 255 is 0. So in hex this is just two more zeroes. 0.11 times 255

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.640
is 28.05, which we round to 28, which is 1C in hexadecimal.
