Welcome.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.300
So far whenever we think about photography, we think about a process where it

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.030
takes a camera like this, and captures a image that can be done, used as

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.900
a photograph, could be printed, or you could do different types of things with.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.580
For computational photography,

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.630
we need to actually add a level where we can take this image and create

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.690
a digital representation of this image that would make this a computable entity.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.260
So in this series of lectures, what we're going to do is take a digital image,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.620
and start looking at what we can do with an image and

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.420
different types of processing approaches on it.
