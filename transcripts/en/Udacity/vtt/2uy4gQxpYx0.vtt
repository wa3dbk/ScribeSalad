00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.150
Remember these four functions that we played with at the very beginning of our

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.007
discussion of Rational functions. Well, we're going to play with them a little

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:11.001
bit more right now, except I'd like to make one change to each of them. I want

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:14.932
to add in some absolute value signs. Take a second right now to predict how the

00:00:14.932 --> 00:00:18.004
addition of these absolute value signs to each of these functions is going to

00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:22.690
change the way that their graphs look. Now that you've had a chance to make

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.091
your prediction, here are the graphs of our functions. You however, need to

00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:30.680
tell me which graph goes with each function. Pick some points to test out and

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.859
then put the letter of the graph next to the function it belongs with.
