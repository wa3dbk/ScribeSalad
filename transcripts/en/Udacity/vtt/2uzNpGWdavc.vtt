00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.200
If you are not familiar with object-oriented programming or its counterpart,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.490
the functional programming paradigm, this may seem weird to you.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.700
We called a few methods on an object.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.350
The methods returned some values, but now, when we wanted to actually draw our

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.730
chart, we call the draw method on our original myChart variable.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.460
What's happening behind the scenes, the, the dimple library actually implements

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.420
an object-oriented interface for its objects, in which the method calls on

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.030
the myChart object and you take the internal state of the object.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.550
What does this mean?

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.050
Well, when you call the series and addAxis functions, they

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.660
actually add the axis and series objects into the chart that they're called on.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.040
So now, when we call draw on myChart, myChart's been mutated by

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.390
the addSeries addAxis calls, such that they have all the data and

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.950
specification they need for the draw function to operate.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.520
The fun thing about working in the debugger with Chrome is that as soon as we

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.750
call the draw function, the chart will immediately be drawn into the Web page.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.730
Keep an eye on the Web page in the background here.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.310
And even though we're pausing the debugger,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.320
all the code we execute here has access to the Web page itself.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.960
Calling the draw method,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.330
we can see that a bar chart spontaneously appeared in our Web page window.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.489
One last thing to note before we move on to better and

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:36.824
different charts, that the returned object from the draw function is

00:01:36.824 --> 00:01:39.186
the chart object that we called it on.

00:01:39.186 --> 00:01:45.506
If we inspect draw_chart, which we stored the return value of myChart.draw into,

00:01:45.506 --> 00:01:48.753
we can see here that it's dimple.chart and

00:01:48.753 --> 00:01:53.350
has all the same properties as our original chart.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.400
And again, we can actually check whether it is equivalent to our initial chart

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.070
by using the triple equals operator in JavaScript and comparing it to myChart.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.230
And we can see here that it is indeed the original chart.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.080
This style of returning the object that you would call the method on is

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.790
exactly how D3 works and allows you to chain methods without having to go

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.490
through an intermediate representation or variable.
