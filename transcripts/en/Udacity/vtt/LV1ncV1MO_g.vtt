00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.160
The problem with things right now, is that if one

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.110
of our nodes fails, we're left with missing data for the

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.450
file. If the node goes away for example, we've got

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.170
a 64 megabyte hole in the middle of my data.txt, and

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.610
of course similar problems with any other files that happen

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.370
to be stored on that node. To solve this problem, Hadoop

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.180
replicates each block three times, as it's stored in HDFS.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.200
So block one doesn't just live here, it may also be

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.410
here and here. Block two is here, here and here,

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.930
and block three is here, here, and here. Hadoop just

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.600
picks three nodes at random and puts one copy of

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.390
the block on each of the three. Well actually, it's not

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.400
totally random, but that's close enough for us right now.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.260
So now if a single node fails, it's not a problem

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.200
because we have two other copies of the block on

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.390
other nodes. And the NameNode is smart enough to see that

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.180
these blocks are now under-replicated and it will arrange

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.350
to have those block re-replicated on the cluster. So we're

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.980
back to having three copies of them. So we've taken

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.210
care of the problem, if one of our data node

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.129
fails. But there's another obvious single point of failure here.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.340
What happens if the NameNode has a hardware problem? Might

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.407
the data be inaccessible? Or is the data in HDFS

00:01:12.407 --> 00:01:15.840
lost forever? Or is everything fine and there's no problem?
