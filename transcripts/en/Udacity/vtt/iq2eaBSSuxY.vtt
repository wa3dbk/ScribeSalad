00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.402
F plus g of x equals x squared plus 3x plus 1. Great thinking if you found this

00:00:06.402 --> 00:00:10.110
function. To find this function, we simply want to add the two functions

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.376
together. So, we'll have 3x plus 2 for f of x. And we'll have x squared minus 1

00:00:17.376 --> 00:00:22.878
for g of x. So notice, here's f of x and here's g of x, we're just adding the

00:00:22.878 --> 00:00:29.968
two functions together. Write in the highest power first, of x squared plus 3 x

00:00:29.968 --> 00:00:35.931
plus 1. This is the result of adding these two functions together, f plus g of

00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:41.945
x. And let's see this on a graph as well. We have f of x, which is our straight

00:00:41.945 --> 00:00:48.180
line. We have g of x, which is our parabola. And then we have f of x plus g of

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:55.469
x. It turns out that this is also a parabola. And remember before that we took

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.770
f of 2, which that y value was 8, and we added it to g of 2, and that y value

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:09.585
was 3. When we add the y values together here the value of 3 and here the value

00:01:09.585 --> 00:01:17.086
of 8, we get a new value of 11. Notice that the x coordinate for each of these

00:01:17.086 --> 00:01:21.478
points are all the same, they're all 2, but the y value for this point comes

00:01:21.478 --> 00:01:29.501
from adding these two y values together. So, this point came from adding f plus

00:01:29.501 --> 00:01:35.932
g of 2, but remember we also found another point, f plus g of 0. We found f

00:01:35.932 --> 00:01:41.620
plus g of 0 by adding the y coordinates for here together. We had 0, 2 on our

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:50.448
orange graph, our f of x, And we had 0,-1 on our blue graph g(x). So, on our

00:01:50.448 --> 00:01:58.270
new graph f plus g of x, we have the value 0,1. Notice that the x coordinates

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.010
are all the same and we get this y coordinate from adding these two y

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:09.600
coordinates together. This is f of 0 and this is g of 0. Remember that if x

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.242
equals 0, then the output for this function would just be 2. Since 3 times 0

00:02:15.242 --> 00:02:21.062
equals 0, and we'll do that with positive 2. So we know this point is on the

00:02:21.062 --> 00:02:27.027
graph of f. Also, we know this point would be on the graph of g. When x equals

00:02:27.027 --> 00:02:32.842
0, the output here is negative 1. So, if we want to find f plus g of 0, we

00:02:32.842 --> 00:02:36.786
simply add these two outputs together, and output of 2 and an output of

00:02:36.786 --> 00:02:44.370
negative 1, to get an output of positive 1. That's were we get this point from.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.704
And notice that this is actually represented for all values of x. Any input

00:02:49.704 --> 00:02:54.225
that we plug in here and here, we have their sum. This is another way we can

00:02:54.225 --> 00:02:56.410
think of their function using their graph.
