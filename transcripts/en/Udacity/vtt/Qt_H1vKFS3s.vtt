00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.700
And the answer is, it'll be Black Discerning Mortimer. So, there's a lot of

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.315
interesting and somewhat surprising stuff going on here. So, I hope when you

00:00:07.315 --> 00:00:10.914
solve this, if you did it by an experiment, you tried to find a general rule

00:00:10.914 --> 00:00:14.630
instead of just seeing what the result was. If you didn't do that yet, try it

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.050
now, see if you can figure out a general rule for why we end up with this

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.837
result. Then, come back for the explanation, which will follow. So, here's

00:00:20.837 --> 00:00:23.978
what's going on here. So, we have this class hierarchy. And when we have

00:00:23.978 --> 00:00:27.829
multiple base classes the order in which they're listed matters. So, we listed

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.902
Discerning Bear first. That means, the Discerning Black Bear will inherit the

00:00:31.902 --> 00:00:36.512
init method from Discerning Bear. What happens in the init method of Discerning

00:00:36.512 --> 00:00:40.810
Bear is we call super, passing in Discerning Bear. That means, ignoring

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.700
definition of super bear and calling init. Looking just at this part, you would

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.848
think, well, that means we're going to call the Bear init method. And that's

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:51.178
what would normally happen, if we just started with a Discerning Bear. That's

00:00:51.178 --> 00:00:54.874
not what happens, though. What we get when we have super (DiscerningBear, self),

00:00:54.874 --> 00:00:59.326
well, remember the first class we passed in her means ignore that class. But the

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:03.500
next class in the hierarchy, if we look at this, is actually what we got here.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.543
The super, here, we'll call the init method for the BlackBear. Now the super of

00:01:07.543 --> 00:01:11.511
the self object for the BlackBear, now is going to be Bear, and we'll get to the

00:01:11.511 --> 00:01:14.886
Bear init. So, this is kind of surprising. This is one of the dangers of using

00:01:14.886 --> 00:01:18.762
multiple inheritence that it becomes pretty tricky to understand what some code

00:01:18.762 --> 00:01:19.113
means.
