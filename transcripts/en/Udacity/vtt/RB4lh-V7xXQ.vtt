00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.630
Now let's discuss boot sector
virus in more details.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.310
First let's look at
how boot sector works.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.370
A boot sector is a special sector
on the hard drive of a system.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.865
When a system is booted the code in
a boot sector will always run first.

00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:17.565
In a code, it's called bootstrap loader.

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:20.355
The bootstrap loader is
typically responsible for

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:22.175
loading the operating system.

00:00:22.175 --> 00:00:22.865
For example,

00:00:22.865 --> 00:00:27.885
it may ask a user to choose a list
of operating systems to boot from.

00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:32.615
For example, the bootstrap loader
typically may ask a user to choose

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:36.490
an operating system from a list and
then loads that operating system.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.820
And this is how system
boots from a hard drive.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.530
Again, it starts with
code in the boot sector.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.768
And then when a bootstrap loader runs,
it loads the operating system.

00:00:45.768 --> 00:00:49.120
When a boot-strapper
virus infects the system,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.380
the virus code is inserted
in the boot sector.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.920
And the reason is, boot sector again,
is a special place in the hard drive and

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.890
the code there will always be
executed first when the system boots.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.440
So, by putting virus code there,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.790
whenever system boots the boot
sector virus will run.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.520
Then, of course, the boot sector virus
can perform a number of malicious

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.200
functions such as infecting
other programs on the system,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.740
spreading to other systems and stealing
useful documents from the system.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.010
After the virus code runs, the boot
sector virus should transfer the control

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.740
to the original bootstrap loader so
that the system can boot normally,

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.930
at least appear to the user
that the system boots normally.
