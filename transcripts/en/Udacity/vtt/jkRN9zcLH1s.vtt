00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.820
Before talking about conditional weight variables, I want to make a

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.820
distinction between mutual exclusion and

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.070
synchronization. Mutual exclusion, as we

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.540
have seen, is about preventing two threads from accessing a

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.460
resource, often a piece of memory, at the same time

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.660
regardless of exactly where they are in their execution. For

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.860
example, if Thread 1 is accessing this memory, then the

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.580
lock should block Thread 2 from accessing it or vice

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.850
versa. If Thread 2 is accessing the piece of memory then

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.310
the lock should block Thread 1 from accessing it. Synchronization,

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.259
by contrast, is about controlling where the threads are in

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.716
the flow of their executions. For instance, it might be

00:00:35.716 --> 00:00:39.055
important that Thread 1 completes some task A before Thread 2

00:00:39.055 --> 00:00:42.200
can start task B. In effect, we want the message

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.010
that A happened to get sent to thread B. Mutual exclusion

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.620
and synchronization are related. But it is important as a

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.140
program to know which of these goals you are after so

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.650
that you can use the right constructs.
