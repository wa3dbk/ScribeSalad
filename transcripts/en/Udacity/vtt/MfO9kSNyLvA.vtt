00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.180
As we have mentioned earlier, configuration is a kind of design,

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:09.450
a kind of routine design. And one material configuration is bound refinement.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.600
In configuration, all the components of the design are already known, but

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.150
we are to find some arrangement with the components, and

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.350
we assign values to some of the variables of those components,

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.580
to arrive at the arrangement. Here is a design specification working it's way.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.160
Here might be a plan for designing a chair as a whole. And

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.990
once we assign values to some of the variables at the level of the chair,

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.460
then we can refine the plan for the chair into a plan for the chair legs,

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.180
the chair seat, and so on. All of this might be subject to some constraints.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.110
There are in fact a number of AI systems, that do configuration design.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.270
Many of them are being used in industry. Some of these AI systems use,

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.410
matters like brand refinement the way we are showing it here.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.320
Others use case based reasoning. And various systems use a variety of methods,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.180
for doing configuration design, including model based reasoning and rule based

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.080
reasoning. What about more creative kinds of design? Design in which not all

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.820
the parts are known in advance. Since we just discussed the flashlight example,

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.480
in the context of systems thinking, let us revisit that example in the context

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.640
of creative design. So this is a schematic of the flashlight circuit.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.360
Here is the switch, the battery, the bulb, as earlier. On the systems thinking,

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.140
we discussed how structured behavior function models capture the knowledge that

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.690
when the switch is closed, electricity flows from the battery to the bulb, and

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.870
the bulb converts the electrical energy into light energy. Let us suppose that

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.150
this particular electrical circuit use a 1.5 volt battery and

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.130
created 10 lumens of light. Tomorrow someone comes to you and

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.990
says, I want 20 lumens of light. Design a flashlight electrical circuit for me.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.660
How will you do that? You might go to the structure, behavior function model for

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.040
this particular circuit and do some thinking. You may recognize, the amount of

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.330
light created in the bulb is directly proportional to the voltage of

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.550
the battery. Instead of creating 10 lumens of light you need 20 lumens of light,

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.130
you might say, I'm going to use a 3 volt battery. So far, so good. You've done

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.560
system thinking in the context of design thinking. But now let us add a wrinkle.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.234
Suppose that a 3.0 volt battery is not available. At this point,

00:02:20.234 --> 00:02:23.825
a teacher tells you it's okay if a 3.0 volt battery is not available.

00:02:23.825 --> 00:02:28.450
You can connect two 1.5 volt batteries in series. Two 1.5

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.630
volt batteries connected in series will give you the voltage of three volts.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.350
Accepting the teacher's advice, you can now create an electrical circuit

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.500
that will use two 1.5 volt batteries in series and create light of 20 lumens.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.010
But you're not just creating this particular design, you also learned something

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.120
from it. Every design, every experience is an opportunity for learning.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.750
In the 1990s, Sam [UNKNOWN] here at Georgia Tech created a program called IDOL,

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.410
IDOL did creative design. In particular, IDOL would learn about design patterns.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.850
&gt;From simple design cases, the kind we just talked about.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.610
I'm sure most of you are familiar with the notion of design pattern,

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.350
design patterns are a major construction software engineering. But design

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.210
patterns are not just in software engineering but in all kinds of design, for

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.680
example architecture and engineering and so on. There is some way of capturing

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.130
the design pattern that can be learned from the previous case. A field of design

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.310
of a device that changes the valuable variable from one value to another value.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.140
And you want another design that changes the value the same variable to some

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.340
other value not the same as the previous design. One way you in which you can

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.680
create the new design is. By replicating the behavior of the previous design.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.620
So not just having behavior be one for the first design, but

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.350
having this behavior be one as many times as needed. Let us connect this to

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.610
the example we just saw. If you have a design of an electrical circuit that can

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.020
create 10 lumens of light, and you know how to do it through some behavior B1.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.640
I need to design an electrical circuit that can create 20 lumens of light, but

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.680
you don't know the behavior of B2. Then this behavior B2

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.680
is a replication of behavior B1 by connecting components and series.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.769
Once Sam's program IDOL had learned about this design pattern of cascading,

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.980
of replication, then, when it was given the problem of

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.060
designing a water pump of higher capacity than the one available.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.790
It could create a new water pump by connecting several water pumps in series.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.760
Thus, ideal, created new designs in one domain, the domain of water pump,

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.880
through analogical transfer of design patterns learned under the domain,

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.990
the domain of electrical circuits. You would form the perspective of the new

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.160
domain of water pumps initially did not know about all the components about all

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.180
the water pumps that will be needed. With Sam's program, IDOL is creative enough

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.390
to know that the pattern of problems here in the water pump is exactly the same

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.759
pattern that was also occurring in the domain of electrical circuits.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.730
Sam's theory provides a computational account of not only how design patterns

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.120
can be used, but also about how these design patterns can be learned and

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.910
transferred to new domains. There is of course a lot more to design.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.650
We said earlier that design thinking engages problem solution,

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.690
core evolution. It's not just that a solution evolves but

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.130
the problem remains fixed. But the problem evolves even as the solution evolves.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.190
It's not quite clear how humans do this kind of creative design,

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.750
with this problem solution co evolution. There is certainly a few AI

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.820
systems capable of problem solution coevolution at present
