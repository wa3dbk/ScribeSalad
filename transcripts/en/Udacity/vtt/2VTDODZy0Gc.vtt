00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.480
There are some deep implications that may not be readily obvious. Core

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.240
services are trusted services, since they provide access to

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.400
hardware mechanisms. Why? The services may need to step

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.360
outside the language-enforced protection model to control the hardware

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.440
resources. In other words, the applications that run on top

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.550
of an extension have to trust the extension. Extensions

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.080
to core services affect only the applications that use that extension.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.520
That is, it is not catastrophic and does not affect

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.030
other applications that do not rely on this particular extension.
