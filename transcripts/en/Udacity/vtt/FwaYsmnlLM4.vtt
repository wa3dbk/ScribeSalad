00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.360
So let's now define the confusion matrix.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.750
I added a few data points on the right side here.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.510
Now I want you to count the number of points that fall into each of

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.220
the four quadrants of the confusion matrix.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.390
So count on the right and put the numbers on the left
