00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.870
Now it's time to
download the sample code

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.680
we'll use in the rest of this lesson.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.350
Download controllersample.zip

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.600
by following the link in
the instructor notes.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.540
Next, unzip it and
import it into Android Studio.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.530
And finally, run it on an emulator.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:13.410
Once the game is running,

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.510
you can steer the ship using
the arrow keys on your keyboard.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.080
And you can fire the lasers
with the space bar.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.200
The first time you press one of
these keys, your ship will appear.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.270
If you need more details
on any of these steps,

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.420
