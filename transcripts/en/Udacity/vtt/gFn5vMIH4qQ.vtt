Okay, so here we are on our browser. I'm going to

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.060
open up those developer tools again, which in Chrome that's just

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.680
an, an option. And I think Firefox has fairly similar options.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.740
I don't know about Internet Explorer. When I get this little

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.500
JavaScript console, and we don't have to know JavaScript but I

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.344
am going to show you one thing we can do. I say

00:00:15.344 --> 00:00:19.070
document.cookies, cookie. I can actually get a list of all the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.930
cookies in JavaScript. And then I can actually say document.cookie equals,

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.820
visits equals one. There are ten thousand and one. Okay, now I've

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.920
just set that cookie. Trust me. And when I reload this page.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.650
Thank you web server. You are the best ever. Pretty

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.660
neat huh? We just cheated. So, let's say we actually want to

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.029
implement this feature, and we didn't want people to cheat.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.370
Let's talk about how we might prevent people from doing that.
