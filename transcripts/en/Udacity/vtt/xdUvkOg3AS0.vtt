When we sleep, our body works to restore itself after a long day of neural

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.820
activity. In fact, the brain can use up to 80% of its energy to sustain

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.174
synaptic activity. The brain needs a way to conserve energy after a long day of

00:00:14.174 --> 00:00:18.844
wakefulness in physical an mental activity. Sleep also helps us in memory

00:00:18.844 --> 00:00:23.058
consolidation, and learning. And finally, sleep is really important for neural

00:00:23.058 --> 00:00:25.390
growth, as we've discussed before.
