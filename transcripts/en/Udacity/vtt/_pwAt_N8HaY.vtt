00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.640
So, the process that now we want to
leverage is called Tone Mapping.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.250
Tone mapping is an attempt to be able to
take an image, and high radiance image,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.720
like the one we talked
about the radiance map, and

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.400
converting it to a space where we
can now actually visualize it.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.200
So what basic thing we need to do is we
want to map one set of colors to another

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.580
in a reduced space.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.210
And we want to basically account for

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.260
being able to display it on a medium
that has a limited dynamic range.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.350
So again even displays actually
are built the same way as sensors.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.500
They could, they should actually
be able to go from 0 to 55.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.830
We don't want to be able to dynamically,
and get the colors

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.810
in the space that a display can show it,
and again as a set-up printer.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.400
And a variety of things exist
on this kind of technology.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.650
And of course, we want to be able to
display these things on printers,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.300
monitors, and projectors.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.380
This is primarily to address the fact
that printers and most of the displays

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.460
right now are inadequate,
in terms of how they can represent it.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.750
And of course, these days with 4k
displays and all that kind of stuff.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.570
We can actually really display a lot
of high dynamic range information.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.010
But, of course the content for
those types of displays is hard.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.550
So Tone Mapping addresses the problem
of being able to get this contrast

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.020
reduction from the scene radiance image,

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.680
which is captured in the radiance
map to a displayable range.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.240
It preserves the image details and color
appearance, because remember, what we

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.880
did with the HDR process was really
capture the radiance map from a scene.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.150
But we can't display it, so what we
want to do is basically convert it

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.730
into a form and
that's what tone mapping does.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.710
Many, many well known algorithms are
existing for this kind of an approach.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.490
We'll be discussing some of them
in detail in this class also, and

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.540
I just list a few of them.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.260
I encourage you to look at them.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.350
Now before we go on,
there's one thing that I wanted to add.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.720
If you look at this image,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.330
I actually get bothered by both
Tone Mapping and HDR on the web a lot.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.000
Sometimes, and
this is one of the perhaps most overused

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.280
imaging technology out there
on the internet these days and

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.140
people are actually generating images,
that to me look ghostly.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.620
So this image of course,
is capturing all of the detail.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.335
But with the clouds and
all of that kind of na,

00:02:07.335 --> 00:02:10.000
natural lighting it
actually feels unnatural.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.170
In fact this scene would have never
been naturally done like this.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.600
So that is one of my problems with doing
over you know, use it of things like HDR

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.590
as we are actually generating a lot of
images that don't look natural anymore.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.320
So my recommendation, use it carefully.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.230
Hopefully, you like
the example I showed you.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.980
Here is another example of
a similar type of an image.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.650
I mean yes, it's a dark image.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.590
It's a nice image.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.510
It looks artistic, but even in the most
natural situations you would not have

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.560
seen lighting like this in a square,
a popular square, where ever you are.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.740
So what we're really doing with tone
mapping for high dynamic range images is

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.140
taking again this whole dynamic range,
which is shown here in the real world,

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.880
and what we want to do is squish
the whole range into a 0 to 255,

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.930
and in essence,
that's what tone mapping does.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.790
It takes the whole range and, based
on the display characteristics, and

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.320
perhaps, a few things
that I want to emphasize,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.490
it compacts it out into this range.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.670
So yes, you do lose information,
but if you save the radiance map,

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.460
you already have that information
that you can use later.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.130
Things that does, it basically takes
the limited contrast information and

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.650
maps it to the medium, display medium
that you're using and preserves details.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.510
Again, we'll be covering
a little bit more of tone mapping

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.760
online in the class.
