The next piece is who are your key partners and suppliers.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Partnerships are kind of interesting is we need to ask ourselves before what's the deal

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
is what exactly are we acquiring from partners, and also

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
what activities are they going to perform and when.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And this is where a start up sometimes make a mistake of thinking while large companies

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
do partnerships, I guess I need those two on day 1.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Change all the types of partnerships you need in year 1 are certainly not the ones

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
you're going to need in year 3 or 5 or 10, and the types of partnerships could be strategic alliances,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
joint ventures, just regular suppliers and buyers, and you need to be thinking through

00:00:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
who they are and after your getting out of the building and tested them.
