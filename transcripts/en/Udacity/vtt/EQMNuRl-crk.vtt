So, although we often think of deception as bad. And in many cases it is. But

00:00:04.132 --> 00:00:07.696
even by today's standards, what Milgrim did, in his research, was actually not

00:00:07.696 --> 00:00:13.615
unethical in terms of the deception. Because he did two things. He debriefed

00:00:13.615 --> 00:00:19.215
his participants. And it was a necessary part of the design. In fact if you

00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:22.845
think about it, research often needs to use some degree of deception because if

00:00:22.845 --> 00:00:26.035
we told participants in advance what the study was about, and what our

00:00:26.035 --> 00:00:31.080
hypotheses were, it would completely invalidate the results.
