00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.430
So how would you apply a problem reduction to Raven's Progressive Matrices?

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.360
Before we actually talk about how our agents would do it,

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.430
we can think about how we would do it. When we are solving a matrix, where do

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.940
the smaller or easier problems that we are actually breaking it down into?

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.880
How are we solving those smaller problems, and how are we then combining them

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.480
into an answer to the problem as a whole? Once we know how we're doing it,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.070
how will your agent actually be able to do the same kind of reasoning process?

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.180
How will it recognize when to split a problem in to smaller problems?

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.520
How will it solve the smaller problems? And how will it then combine those in

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.350
to an answer to the problem as whole? During this process think about,

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.170
what exactly is it that makes these smaller problems easier for

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.870
your agent to answer than just answering the problem as a whole?

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.150
And how does that actually help you solve these problems better?
