00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.719
Up to this point you've learned a lot about the basics of data visualization.

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:08.910
You learn what constitutes good data visualization from and you learned what

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.630
types of visual and coding choices you can make to represent your data.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.239
&gt;&gt; You've seen where data visualization fits into the larger process of

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:17.220
data science.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.960
And you have also been introduced to some of the technologies that

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.990
data scientists and data artists choose when they're creating graphics and

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.770
visualizations of their own.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.410
We've had a chance to play with D3 in the browser and

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.300
work with some code so hopefully I have what your appetite for

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.600
the types of visualizations we'll be creating in this course.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.930
&gt;&gt; Next we're going to be going over some more design centric elements of

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.590
data visualization and also how to choose the right type of visualization for

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.770
your data type.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.530
We'll also arm you with a few tools to think critically about the data

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.290
visualizations that you create and

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.360
also analyze data visualizations that you see in the wild
