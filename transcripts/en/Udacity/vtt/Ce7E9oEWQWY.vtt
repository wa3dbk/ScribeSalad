00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.370
Okay, so now you have a list of friends.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.842
But not the ability to share
lists with those friends.

00:00:04.842 --> 00:00:08.430
I'm going to split up the actual
sharing code into two parts.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.220
The first thing we'll do is to simply
keep track of who is shared on

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.340
what list.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.550
The second part, is making sure
that when a user is shared,

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.330
they get a copy of the list
in their own user lists.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.720
And then on top of that,
whenever a list anywhere is updated,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.900
that all of the copies of that
list are simultaneously updated.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.680
Let's start by focusing
on this first part.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.890
Okay, so
here we are back at the sharing flow.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.270
And we're going to focus on the share
list activity specifically,

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.950
because we already dealt
with how to add friends.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.180
When I press the great plus button here,
there needs to be a change in both

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.590
the UI of the share list activity and
the data in the database.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.230
So let's talk about what
the change will look like.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.960
Well for
the UI that change is pretty easy.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.570
I'll see green check next to
the name of the person that I just

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.740
shared the list with.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.840
In the database,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.960
you're going to be changing around
what is in the shared with a list.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.210
We can see the change here.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.410
Since I added Lyla,

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.220
in shared with under the same push
ID as the list I'm interested in.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.880
So right here.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.660
We have the user data for
the user that I just shared with.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.910
So basically, when you press this plus
button, it should add that user's

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.410
user data to the Shared With list for
the shopping list that you're sharing.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.230
And again, that shopping list is
specified by the push ID here.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.300
And when you press the button again, it
should remove that user from the shared

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.690
list, and
put the UI back to the gray plus button.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.330
Alright, hopefully that's enough for
you to get started.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.460
I'll send over the spec right away.
