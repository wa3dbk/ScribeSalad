Let's say we don't know how the song might impact engagement. It could make

00:00:03.556 --> 00:00:08.512
students less engaged, or make them more engaged. Therefor, we're going to put

00:00:08.512 --> 00:00:14.100
here, muse sub song. because the song is the intervention. We're going to try

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.160
to test if this parameter will be significantly different from what you've

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.795
already found. Our next step is to set a criteria for making a decision. Where

00:00:22.795 --> 00:00:26.956
our decision will be to either reject or fail to reject the noll. We have to

00:00:26.956 --> 00:00:33.358
choose our alpha level, the alpha level we'll generally use is .05, which means

00:00:33.358 --> 00:00:39.178
that for a two tailed test, we have 2.5% or .025 and a porportion of .025 on

00:00:39.178 --> 00:00:47.527
the left tail. Then we'll find the z-critical values. And finally, we'll find

00:00:47.527 --> 00:00:51.640
the z-score of the sample mean, and see if it falls in the critical region.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.534
Based on that, we'll decide whether to reject or fail to reject the null

00:00:55.534 --> 00:00:59.360
hypothesis. That's an overview of everything you were going to do in this

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.573
lesson. Before we get cracking, let's make sure you understand what it means to

00:01:03.573 --> 00:01:08.470
reject the null. Select the appropriate word in each sentence, so that they all

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.842
describe what it means to reject the null. One point of clarification, when

00:01:12.842 --> 00:01:17.470
figuring out this second one, just ignore negatives. Let's say the z-critical

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.130
value is positive, then how big should be the z-score of the sample mean to

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.279
reject the null?
