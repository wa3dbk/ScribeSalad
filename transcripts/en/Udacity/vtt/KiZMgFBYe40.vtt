00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Just to shake things up, let's get started on the right.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Here our start symbol is S and it goes to PQR and there actually aren't that many choices.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If we think about it, there are two strings in this grammar--PQR and PQ nothing.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So this doesn't look like a good bet because it doesn't produce PQQ, or P, or PR.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This is not a match. All right. What do we have over here?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Well, every string is going to have to start with lowercase p and then Q,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
looks like I can have 0 or more Qs and then eventually we end with an R.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This looks pretty good because it matches the first string

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and the string down here, but it doesn't get PQQ so I don't like this one.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
How about this grammar in the middle that uses ABC instead of Senatus Populus Que Romany

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
in the name of the senate and the people of Rome--A, B and C?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Well, we have two choices for our start symbol that definitely complicates things,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but both of them start with a P--well that's convenient

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
since all five of our strings starts with a P.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Let's just go through the strings one at a time. Can I get P alone?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Yes. A goes to PB. B goes to nothing--so I can get that one. How about PQQ?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000
A goes to PB. B goes to Q and then Q again and then nothing. Yeah, I can get that one.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
How about PR? A goes to PBC. B goes to nothing. C goes to R.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
This is looking super promising. PQR--we use the first rule-PBC.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
We'll gather up one Q and then we'll have an R. Great! PQQR. We use the first rule--PBC.

00:01:35.000 --> 09:59:59.000
We'll go around this loop twice to get two Qs and then end with an R.
