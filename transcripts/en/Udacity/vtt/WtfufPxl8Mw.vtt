00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.660
So the answer is actually zero seconds that this will

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.710
take very little time. It won't be exactly no time

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.080
but very close to zero seconds. And the very reason

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.460
for this is because of both the way make_big_index works.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.680
Which creates an index where the words start with four

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.060
A's, and we keep increasing the letters as we go.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.940
So that means the index created by make_big_index passing in

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.680
any number. The first entry in that index will always

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.490
be aaaaaaaa, and so when we do the lookup, the way

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.060
lookup works, it goes through the entries in order, and it's

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.680
going to find the first entry right away. So the point

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.590
I want to make with this quiz is that the execution time

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.680
depends on both the size of the input, and sometimes it

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.970
depends on the actual input. So here the size of the

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.700
index is very big, because we looked up a word that's

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.370
at the very beginning of the index, the lookup is very fast.
