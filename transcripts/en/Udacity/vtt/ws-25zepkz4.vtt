00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.522
And the answer is no. We actually don't need to do any calculations or no major

00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:08.977
calculations, at least, to find the last zero. It's simply the complex

00:00:08.977 --> 00:00:13.676
conjugate of this one non-real zero we already have, i. The complex conjugate

00:00:13.676 --> 00:00:17.336
of i is negative i. So that is our missing zero. Awesome.
