00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.410
If you're a bit quiz savvy, probably this one was very easy to get,

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.540
but I'll explain the answer to you of course as well.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.660
So, at least one variable must be flipped and the chances of flipping the right variable

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.559
are at least one-third and I''ll explain it to you.

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.040
Now, let's say we have one clause and that clause has 3 variables and it's not satisfied.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.770
So, if the overall Boolean formula has a satisfying assignment

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.830
this means that in the satisfying assignment either this variable here, this one here, or this one here

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.590
must evaluate to true and currently, they all evaluate to false.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.760
So, at least one of those variables must be flipped in order to satisfy the clause.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.590
What are the chances that we're flipping the correct variable?

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.439
Meaning that we indeed choose the variable to flip

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:47.760
that would also have a different value in the satisfying assignment.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.880
Well, since we select one out of three variables those chances are at least one-third.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.080
So, they are exactly one-third.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.170
If in a satisfying assignment, you have exactly one variable that evaluates to true

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.660
or a variable set to false with a knot and the chances are even better

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.180
if in the satisfying assignment you would have two of three variables

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.760
that would need to evaluate to true, but there are always at least one-third.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.650
We initially can expect to get about half of the variables right

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.090
and a random change will be successful or a random change and clause that is not satisfied

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.490
will be successful with the probability of at least one-third

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.480
and that of course also means that the probability of making a mistake

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.590
meaning that we flip a variable that we should actually not have flipped

00:01:30.590 --> 99:59:59.000
is at most two-thirds.
