00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.531
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; For this problem, we start with our slope formula. And, we already know the

00:00:04.531 --> 00:00:09.025
slope, it's 1 4th. We also want to fix one of these points to be x and y, and

00:00:09.025 --> 00:00:13.480
then this other point will be x 1 y 1. So I have the slope is 1 4th, I fix the

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.246
point x,y, and then this last point is 6 negative 1. So 6 for the x, negative 1

00:00:18.246 --> 00:00:23.252
for the y. After substituting the values, here's the equation I get. You can

00:00:23.252 --> 00:00:28.116
think about cross multiplying here, or just multiplying by the least common

00:00:28.116 --> 00:00:33.010
denominator, which would be 4 times x minus 6. The 4 is reduced to 1, and the x

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.913
minus 6, and the x minus 6 also reduced to 1. 1 times x minus 6, is well, just x

00:00:37.913 --> 00:00:43.037
minus 6. And then, I have 4 times the quantity y plus 1. So I need to distribute

00:00:43.037 --> 00:00:47.564
this four to both terms. So 4 y plus 4. I want to write this equation in

00:00:47.564 --> 00:00:53.031
standard form, like this. So I need to move this constant to the right and the 4

00:00:53.031 --> 00:00:57.951
y to the left. I'm going to add 6 to both sides to get a constant on the right

00:00:57.951 --> 00:01:02.675
so I get x equals 4 y plus 10. And now I subtract 4 y from each side. So I get x

00:01:02.675 --> 00:01:07.848
minus 4 y equals 10. I just list these terms here because they are not like. If

00:01:07.848 --> 00:01:12.206
you got x minus 4 y equals 10, amazing work. I know this isn't the easiest

00:01:12.206 --> 00:01:17.351
problem and we haven't even covered how to do this part here. So, if you got it,

00:01:17.351 --> 00:01:18.425
excellent work.
