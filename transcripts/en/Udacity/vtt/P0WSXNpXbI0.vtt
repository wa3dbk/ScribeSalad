00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's start with an exercise.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Suppose we are in an election, and there are two parties--party A and party B.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And suppose it's a toss up, so both parties are getting the same number of votes--or 50%.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Here are three pie charts.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Will any of those reflect the outcome of the election?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Perhaps the first, the second, or the third, or none of the above.

00:00:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Please check exactly one box.
