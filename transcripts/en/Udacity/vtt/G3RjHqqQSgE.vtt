00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.760
Okay, let's take a look at an example of applying this procedure

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.070
we've just talked about. Now in this case, what I want to

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.190
do is work with the open street map data for the city

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.950
of Chicago, Illinois in the United States, I chose this because Chicago is

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.950
my hometown. Now looked at an example from this data set in

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.330
a previous lesson when we were talking about extracting data from XML.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.290
Now, in this example, we're going to take a look at a

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.280
small part of the cleaning that we would need to do for this

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.060
data set. This is all human-entered data. Or, for the

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.390
most part, human-entered data. So, it is especially dirty. What I'd

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.000
like to look at here is auditing street types. So,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.190
for example, avenue. One thing we might be interested in doing

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.210
with a data set like this is harmonizing all of

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.740
the data, so that we have just one way of writing

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.530
something that's an avenue. Alternatively, what we might actually be interested

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.960
in doing is encoding the fact that this is an avenue

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.130
somewhere in the tag set for this particular address. Or, encoding

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.290
it in some other way. Okay? So, the type of data

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.930
that we're going to be getting in to our auditing routine

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.239
is an entire street name. And what we're going to be

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.920
extracting is just the street type. And, then, taking a look

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.450
at all of the different street types that are mentioned in

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.120
the data set that we have. Now the data set that

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.020
we're going to work with here Is actually only a fraction of

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.778
the complete Chicago Open street map data set. In this case,

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:21.022
we're going to be working with about 20% of the total data

00:01:21.022 --> 00:01:24.480
set. The entire data set is almost 2 gigabytes. So for text,

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.330
that's a pretty large data set. Okay, back to the code. So,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.600
as I mentioned, we're going to be getting street names, and

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.250
what we want to do is recognize types from street names. Now,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.250
I'm going to use Python's regular expression module in order to parse out

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.090
the street types. So, let's take a look at the regular expression

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.770
that's here. Okay. We're going to match a sequence

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.740
of non-white space characters optionally followed by a period.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.650
This is to catch abbreviations like ave or st

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.400
as an abbreviation for street, and this match must occur

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.450
at the end of the string. And we're going

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.661
to use this regular expression right here. And each time

00:02:01.661 --> 00:02:03.979
this function audit street type is going to be

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.460
parse the street name. We're going to do a match

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.350
against that string looking for something like ave or avenue

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.890
or street. Okay. Let's take out more holistic look at this

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.120
particular piece of code. Now, again, this is just a

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.500
small portion of the type of auditing that we would want to

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.200
do, so the way I've set this up is the

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.360
main routine here is called audit, and what audit is doing

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.280
is it's looping through this XML file using the Sax

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.060
parser that's part of the element tree module. From Python. Let's

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.980
just take a look there. See? And in this case I'm

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.120
actually using the C implementation of this particular module. So I'd

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.610
encourage you again to go take a look at the documentation

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.540
for XML etree, in particular the element tree module. Okay, now

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.080
what we're going to be doing here is looping through that

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.240
file. We're going to get one tag at a time here.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.800
And, what I'm doing each time is asking the question, is

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.080
this a street name? Now, if we were doing a full

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.250
auditing parse, we might actually have multiple things that

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.770
we're checking here and be generating multiple types of

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.150
audit data. In our case, what we're going to

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.530
be doing is essentially creating a record of all

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.500
street types that we find in this data set.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.000
So, let's go ahead and run this. Okay, and

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.970
here's out output. Now, what I did here, was

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.100
essentially keep a record of the number of times I

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.380
saw all the different street types. And my parser recognizes the

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.120
street type from the street name. We can see that we've

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.360
got four different forms. Of avenue, the most common one being

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.840
the full word avenue and then ave as an abbreviation without a

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.130
period, although there were several that had a period. And again

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.400
remember this is only 20% of the data type. Okay, the other

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.950
thing that's nice about auditing the data this way is I

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.180
would have forgotten about street types like court. For example, and I've

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.630
actually got three different types of court represented here, and

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.990
probably also boulevard. And we can see that that also

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.840
is represented. So what we've done here is essentially audit

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.535
all of the street types as entered by the human editors

00:03:59.535 --> 00:04:01.690
over the open street map data. Now what we would

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.400
do with this particular type of data Is then decide,

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.470
okay, what type of cleaning is necessary? Do we want

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.530
to convert all forms of avenue into the full word avenue.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.950
And, do something similar with all of the other street

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.940
types. What type of capitalization do we want? Do we want

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.760
something that looks like this? Or, do we want just the

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.600
first letter capitalized? And then finally, we can see that there

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.990
are lots of things that actually matched our parser, which

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.050
are not in-fact, street types. So, we need to be careful

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.640
about that, as we're actually doing the cleaning. So that we

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.690
don't In fact, introduce further errors into the process. Okay? So,

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.160
I'd encourage you to take a look at this

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.980
code which is shared with you and make sure you

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.760
understand how it works. The next step then, would

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.580
be to actually use the audit data. That we have

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.950
here, in order to figure out some cleaning tasks,

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.360
for street types. And again, as I mentioned, this is

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.080
just a small portion of the type of cleaning that

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.270
we would have to do for this particular data set.
