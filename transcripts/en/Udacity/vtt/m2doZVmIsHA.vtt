00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.890
The answer here, although it might be a little bit subjective,

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.780
but I think it's rather objective actually is that

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.860
in terms of  difficulty, it's much easier to just gather evidence

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.380
than accomplish a mathematical proof in my opinion.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.870
The reason for that is that in a mathematical proof you cannot only say

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.570
well these 10 people or these 20 people haven't found a good algorithm for my problem,

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.290
but you would really have to show that any algorithm that anybody could ever come up with

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:34.090
would still require exponential time which does not allow you to give any examples

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.930
or just state the number of algorithms, but you have to go about it in another way

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.910
that is much more complicated as you'll also see in this unit.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.280
In terms of convincing this of course, the mathematical proof is more convincing

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.050
than just gathering evidence because here we know that no matter what happens

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.770
the problem is intractable whereas here we could just have another smart person coming in

00:00:58.770 --> 99:59:59.000
who finds a polynomial time algorithm and then it suddenly turns out that the problem is tractable.
