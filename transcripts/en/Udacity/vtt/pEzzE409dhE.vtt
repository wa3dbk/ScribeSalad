00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.643
Well, to get this x squared, we multiplied x times x. And, to get this 9x

00:00:04.643 --> 00:00:09.454
squared, we multiplied 3x times 3x. So, we just squared the first term. If I

00:00:09.454 --> 00:00:14.504
squared the first term here I would get A squared. This middle term is a little

00:00:14.504 --> 00:00:19.497
bit trickier. If I do 4 times x I have 4x. But I don't need one of them, I need

00:00:19.497 --> 00:00:24.216
two. So I'm going to have 2 times my first term and my second term. The same is

00:00:24.216 --> 00:00:29.213
true down here. I don't just have one 3x, I have two. So I'm going to have the

00:00:29.213 --> 00:00:34.129
first term times the second term, times 2. So here's the first term, a, times

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.771
the second term, b, times 2. I listed the 2 first, since we usually put

00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:44.450
coefficients in front of variables. Now we need to think about the last term,

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.523
the 16 and the 1. Well I know 4 squared is 16, and 1 squared is 1. So to get the

00:00:49.523 --> 00:00:54.459
last term, all I need to do is square the second term. So we square the b, we

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:59.648
add b squared. Here's a general pattern we could always use if we ever have to

00:00:59.648 --> 00:01:04.494
square a binomial. Now, you don't have to memorize this, but this is helpful in

00:01:04.494 --> 00:01:08.556
these particular cases. If you do commit this to memory, or continue to

00:01:08.556 --> 00:01:12.129
recognize the pattern, it will help you out in later lessons.
