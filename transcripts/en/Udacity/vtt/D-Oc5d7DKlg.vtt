And the answer is clearly no.

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.060
Obviously, there are many missing requirements here.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.910
For example, requirements about registration for the

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.560
customers, requirements about fitness program creation, membership

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.481
types, and so on. Plus, we are also missing all of the nonfunctional

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:19.270
requirements, which we haven't seen yet, but that we will discuss in a bit.
