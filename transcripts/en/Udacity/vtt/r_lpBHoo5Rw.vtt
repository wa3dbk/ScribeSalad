00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.580
If you're a member, we talked about
resource qualifiers in lesson one.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.840
The idea's that you can vary
things like drawables, strings,

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.000
even layouts based on qualifiers like
language and device orientation.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.780
There are a number of resource
qualifiers you can use to start changing

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.430
your UI based on screen size.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.660
The primary ones you should use are
width, height, landscape orientation.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.860
And portrait orientation.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.580
Width and height simply mean
the device's current width or height.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.085
Which of course changes when you rotate
the device to portrait or landscape.

00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:38.130
There's is also the smallest
width qualifier.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.410
Which is the smaller of
the screen's width or height.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.340
It's the same in either portrait or
landscape, so

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.830
it's a useful qualifier for
controlling attributes that you

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.070
don't want to vary when you rotate
the device, such as font sizes.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.050
There's also small, normal, large,
and extra large size buckets.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.880
These are less useful and because
they don't give you as much control.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.100
They're considered deprecated.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.970
So going back to break points, say we
chose a break point point of 600 dps.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.460
Once the screen is wider than 600 dps,
we want to tweak our UI.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.561
For this,

00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:21.660
we add the w600dp directory qualifier to
hold whatever new resources we create.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.710
Another good resource to use
is the design metrics tool

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.870
on the Google design website.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.920
It lists the screen dimensions and
densities for

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.670
many popular devices in Android,
iOS, ChromeOS and

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.780
Android Wear, along with a UI
designer in Android Studio.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.570
It's a good way to visualize how
your design might need to change to

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.660
fill up space on, say,
a Nexus 9 in landscape mode.
