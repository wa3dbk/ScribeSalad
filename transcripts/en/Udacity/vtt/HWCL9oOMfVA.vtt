00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.600
That's right. Maps isn't visible 
or running any services,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.295
so it's the most likely to be killed.

00:00:05.295 --> 00:00:07.810
Gmail is running a service, 
but it's not interacting

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.310
directly with the user.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.850
While Google Music 
and the camera app are.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.720
Of those two, the Music app
must have been in the foreground

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.290
for longer than the camera.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.820
So it's got a slightly lower priority,

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.310
though neither are in 
any danger of being killed.
