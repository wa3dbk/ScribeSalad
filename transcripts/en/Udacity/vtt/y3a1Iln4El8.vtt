Now, again, there is a way we can do this without a calculator. We can just

00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:10.478
divide 1.5 by 3 and then multiply that by 10 to the 11th over 10 to the 8th. If

00:00:10.478 --> 00:00:14.376
you do that, what numbers do you end up with? Think about how you divide these

00:00:14.376 --> 00:00:17.009
terms when the base is the same.
