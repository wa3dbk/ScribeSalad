00:00:00.276 --> 00:00:02.288
For the homework, you were asked to calculate the

00:00:02.288 --> 00:00:05.611
signature of a message M3. The first thing to know is

00:00:05.611 --> 00:00:11.457
that M3 equals M1 times M2. Substituting M from

00:00:11.457 --> 00:00:13.341
here, we can apply the exponent to each determine

00:00:13.341 --> 00:00:15.724
the product and we can extend this out applying the

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:18.094
modulus to each product. And M1 to the D power

00:00:18.094 --> 00:00:22.527
mod n is signature 1 and M2 to the power of D mod

00:00:22.527 --> 00:00:26.060
n is signature 2 and since in our first line, the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.259
signature was taken mod n, you take this mod n and

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.000
this is our answer.
