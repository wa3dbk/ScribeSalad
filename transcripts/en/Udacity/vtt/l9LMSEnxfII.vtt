00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.590
Let's now do another quiz on MSI.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.950

private caches, MSI coherence,

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.560
Block X initially in memory.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:16.140
But now, C1 is reading, and
then C2 is writing, and then C1 writes.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:22.450
So what is the state of C1's and C2's
cache after each of these things occurs?
