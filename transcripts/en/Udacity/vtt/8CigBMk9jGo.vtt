00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.292
Alright, so let's take a look at this monster of a function. Once again we

00:00:04.292 --> 00:00:07.464
start by defining whether or not this is a static or dynamic object, and of

00:00:07.464 --> 00:00:12.710
course setting the proper flag to the body definition type. So the first thing

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.516
we do is we actually start off by defining whether or not this is a static or

00:00:15.516 --> 00:00:18.322
dynamic body and assign a particular flag to the type property of the body

00:00:18.322 --> 00:00:23.185
definition. Next, since the calling function probably has information about

00:00:23.185 --> 00:00:26.161
where they want this object to be spawned, we go ahead and set the position x

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:29.281
and position y value so that the physics object can actually exist in the world

00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:34.234
in correct place. From there we call registry body function which will of

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:37.114
course invoke box 2D to create a physics object and return to us a handler

00:00:37.114 --> 00:00:42.360
representation of it and then we go through with creating a fixture definition.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.241
Now, the defaults for a fixture definition object are generally pretty good and

00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:49.028
that's what we use for most objects and grids. However, for the bouncy fixture

00:00:49.028 --> 00:00:51.800
we actually changed the density, friction and restitution, so that when an

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.242
object hits a wall, it'll contain a lot of its velocity moving away. This means

00:00:56.242 --> 00:00:59.410
that bouncy bullets maintain a high velocity and ability to kill other players

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.878
since they don't lose any energy in impacts with walls. Finally, what we'll do

00:01:03.878 --> 00:01:07.050
is actually create a shape object with a new polygon shape as standard API

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.378
calling defines, and then we'll call SetAsBox passing in half width and half

00:01:10.378 --> 00:01:15.690
height. From there we call the CreateFixture objects which attaches this

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.745
definition to the body object and return it out to the calling class. And if

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:21.640
you got all that, then you deserve a cookie.
