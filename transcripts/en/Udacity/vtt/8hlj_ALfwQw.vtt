00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.330
When I'm hiring a junior iOS developer,
or just about any junior developer,

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.930
there are basically two
things that I'm looking for.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.020
I'm looking for
a solid foundation and also passion.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.760
With a solid foundation I
mean that I'm not looking for

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.430
quantity of knowledge, but quality.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.180
I will never ask questions about a very
specific detail on some framework.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.970
That doesn't give me the information
that I'm looking for.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.150
I want to make sure that any code that
he brings to our existing code base

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.600
will work, will be reusable by
the team and won't break anything.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.490
So I will try to center on questions

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.780
that show if he has a solid foundation
on the basics of iOS development.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.670
For example I will always
ask the candidate if she

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.070
understands the model,
view, and controller.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.980
How they relate to each other and

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.900
what are the main responsibilities
of each of these teams.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.840
A common mistake that many
beginners make is not using

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.250
the right method to send information
from one object to the other.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.247
I'm talking about things
like the delegate,

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:24.560
notifications, and
target action for example.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.763
So that's something that I always
ask if he has an understanding of

00:01:28.763 --> 00:01:32.290
notifications, when you
should use notifications and

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.840
when you should use delegate instead.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.640
That's a common mistake.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.690
So this is the sort of quality of
knowledge that I'm looking for.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.860
Another question that
I will try to ask is

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.480
try to find out if he's
passionate about what he's doing.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.500
It's vital that this is not just a job.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.110
It must be your hobby, too.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.860
So a few years ago,
there was an accident in New York where

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:10.150
the pilot of the plane managed to do an
unpowered landing on the Hudson river.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.100
And a few days later,
his resume became public and

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.330
it was very obvious why this pilot
was a great hire for US Airways.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.490
His job was piloting an airbus and

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.680
his hobby was piloting a Cessna, so
he was a total nerd about flying.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.580
This is the kind of
people you need to find.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.830
If the candidate shows that her hobby
is also programming, that's a hire.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.990
So I'll try to find that by
asking if she has any GitHub

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.160
profile that's a must,
any side projects that he or

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.050
she is working on by himself and

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.270
contributions to open source
software that sort of thing.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.340
That shows that he's really
really passionate about coding.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.240
So that's what I'm really looking for
in a junior IOS developer or

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.530
just about any junior developer.
