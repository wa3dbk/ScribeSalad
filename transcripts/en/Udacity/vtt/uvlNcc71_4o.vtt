00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.496
We know for a standard form the slope is negative A over B, so our slope is

00:00:04.496 --> 00:00:09.233
negative 3 halves. If we want a line that's parallel to this line, well, our

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:14.020
slopes have to be the same, so this also has to be negative 3 halves. Way to go

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.488
if you got those right.
