Hey everybody,
welcome back to this lesson on style.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.118
Before we start,
I want to introduce you to James Parks,

00:00:06.118 --> 00:00:08.025
another course developer
here at Udacity.

00:00:08.025 --> 00:00:09.560
&gt;&gt; Hi there.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.096
&gt;&gt; By now you've learned how to
develop your first website with HTML.

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:15.932
Now James is here to help you
take things a little further and

00:00:15.932 --> 00:00:17.790
add some style to your sites.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.510
&gt;&gt; Right, in this lesson, you'll be
writing CSS to improve the look of your

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.880
sites, and along the way you'll
try out browser developer tools.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.740
Dev tools are incredibly
useful amongst other things

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.020
you'll find that you can test styles
really, really quickly using them.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.280
&gt;&gt; That's awesome, I love DEV tools.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.090
All right, that's it for me now i'm
going to leave you to it james.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.350
&gt;&gt; All right, let's get started.
