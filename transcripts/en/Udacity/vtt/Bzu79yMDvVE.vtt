00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.594
If you chose y equals 45, excellent work. You have 45 hours to spend on the car

00:00:04.594 --> 00:00:09.361
rental, which means this amount can't change. On the graph, this means that the

00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:13.975
y value should be constant, it should always remain the same. If the y value is

00:00:13.975 --> 00:00:18.359
always 45 then that must mean I have a horizontal line. That would be this

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.924
choice. The first choice would mean that I only have $5 to spend, which we know

00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:28.976
isn't true. The last choice would mean that, I drove the car for 45 hours, x is

00:00:28.976 --> 00:00:33.642
in hours, so x is 45. We know this isn't right. We know this equation isn't

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:38.516
true. The amount of money we have doesn't depend on the number of hours, x. So

00:00:38.516 --> 00:00:39.815
this equation's out.
