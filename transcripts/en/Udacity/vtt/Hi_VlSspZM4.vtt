00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.040
So, I've got some good news and
I've got some bad news.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:04.920
What do you want to hear first?

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.800
Stark as always.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.700
All right, well,
I'll tell you the good news first.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.240
So, the beta testers love the ability
to share with their friends.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.780
You can see that here
Paulter's rating about it.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.840
Well, as much as Paulter raves.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.660
Bad news is that we've
got a couple of one and

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.510
two star reviews complaining that
they're having trouble finding

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.860
their friends in
the massive user accounts.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.980
Katie here says that she
loves the sharing feature.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.610
But with over 400 users, she can't
find any of her actual friends.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.820
I'm thinking maybe the thing to work on
next to deal with some of these issues

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.890
is some sort of auto complete
searching functionality.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.570
And, I'm guessing we could use
of Firebase's query features

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.652
to implement this functionality.

00:00:43.652 --> 00:00:46.970
I'm going to think about how you
might implement it a little bit more.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.940
But, while you're waiting,
why don't you jump on a call with JP

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.400
to learn a little bit more about
range queries in Firebase.
