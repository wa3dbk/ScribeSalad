00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.450
Now that the move function is available on every single car and

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.939
has been rewritten to use the keyword this.

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:07.939
It's somewhat hard to imagine a use for

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.450
storing it in the global variable, like move.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.260
Let's take the code for that method out of this area in the global scope and

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.710
move it right into the decorator function.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.360
Take a moment to refactor this library function.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.230
So that the move method's code exists within the carlike decorator.
