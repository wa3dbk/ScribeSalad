Alright. In this project, we're actually going to

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.590
build something. So here's what we're going to do.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.150
We're going to take a box, any box. And do anything you want to it. So

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.820
that the box, if you put in on a table and anyone passed by. They would be

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.160
invited, without any instructions. To rub it and turn it. And grab it.
