00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.370
So far in this course, we've discussed how to

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.380
acquire, munge, and analyze data. These are all really important

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.520
skill sets for a data scientist to have. However,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.920
an equally important skill is the ability to communicate your

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.820
findings. Sure, this can be done through a presentation

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.350
or through a blog post. But, one of the most

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.860
effective ways to communicate your findings is through a data

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.870
visualization. During this lesson we'll be focusing on the basics

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.620
of data visualization. We'll talk about how to use

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.049
a variety of visual cues to encode information and also

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.990
how to make concise and effective visualizations that really

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.850
communicate what you're trying to say. We'll also go over

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.690
how to make some of these different types of

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.660
visualizations in Python. Once you have these skills, you'll be

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.370
able to take the findings that we've accumulated about the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.880
New York City subway system. And really make effective visualizations

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.570
that communicate these findings either to your friends, or your

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.710
family. Or, anyone else. All right, why don't we begin?
