00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's go through the answers.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
a) can't be right. b) could be right.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's perfectly acceptable to return i for a question about the square root of -1,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
assuming that we're working in a domain of complex numbers.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
c) is probably an acceptable result as well.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Not a number is often returned for numerical queries in the floating-point domain

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that have no good actual answer.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
d) is also most likely a good answer, throwing an exception.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
e) is not a good answer. -1 can never be the square root of -1.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And crashing the machine is probably never a good response.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So the answer is some combination of b, c, and d.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And so again here, what's happening is just running a simple test case

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
is forcing us to think about the specification for the software under test.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And in fact, this is really, really common that as soon as we start testing a piece of software,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
we start to really have to think about what the software is actually supposed to be doing.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And this is a good thing.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Often when we're testing software, we're not so much just looking for bugs in the software,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
but we're helping to refine the specification for the software under test.
