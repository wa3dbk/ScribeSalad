00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.570
Let's look at some examples of UIs for
tablet's that are less than optimal and

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.110
see where they break down.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.380
We'll use the factors we discussed
as a rubric for grading each UI.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.845
This first example shows
a list of messages or updates,

00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:16.075
perhaps it's some kind of social app.

00:00:16.075 --> 00:00:20.545
It's essentially a list with
full width text and images.

00:00:21.665 --> 00:00:25.955
Let's see how it does against our
rubric for what we're optimizing for.

00:00:25.955 --> 00:00:30.370
Now firstly, I don't think this design
offers a balanced use of space.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.890
The left alignment can leave lots of
empty space and it feels a bit lopsided.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.300
Secondly, any time you have full width
text, this isn't optimizing for reading

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.800
comfort as you're likely to exceed the
45 to 75 character line lengths we want.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.430
Lastly, I'd say that this design risks
blowing images up to fill this width,

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.320
sacrificing quality.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.760
This next example is something
like a detail screen,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.310
with a full width image with
an awkward aspect ratio.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.790
Looks like it might have a fixed height,
but a fill width off the screen.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.690
Then it has some text
content top left aligned.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.435
Looking at our optimization goals,

00:01:07.435 --> 00:01:11.340
odds say that this design
isn't very balanced.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.810
All of the content is concentrated
here on the top left.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.970
This design also doesn't seem
to respect image quality.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.620
Displaying a small sliver like
this is likely to only convey

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.740
a portion of the whole image.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.340
Lastly, I'd say that there might be a
missed opportunity to maintain context.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.530
This looks like a sparse detail screen.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.380
It might have made more sense to show
this info in a larger context, say,

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.500
in its own panel or dialogue.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.770
Our last example tablet screen
shows some kind of image feed.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.730
Here the images flow
horizontally from left to right.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.740
Again, looking at our rubric,

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.240
I'd say that this design doesn't
make balanced use of space.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.300
We have dense content here on the left
and sparse areas here on the right.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.430
This design also doesn't optimize for
image quality.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.550
It's not that the layout is likely to
blow up images, it's more of a missed

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.560
opportunity to display them
more richly or interestingly.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.669
This design appears to use a fixed
size for each image, which is a shame.

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.950
Why not make better use
of the space available?

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.230
Lastly, I've marked it down for
overall aesthetic.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.300
I'd say that this kind of jagged look,
like this, is somewhat awkward.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.500
While these examples might seem
contrived, they're representative

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.160
of how many apps out there today
aren't thinking adaptively.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.300
With some simple tweaks,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.150
you can vastly improve how your app
might appear on larger devices.
