00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.600
For our final unit, we're going to start by exploring Inverse Functions.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.542
Inverse functions are a way that we can undo what we do to an input. For

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:14.240
example, if we doubled a number the inverse of that would be dividing it by 2.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.010
Before we get into the fancy notation, let's just look at a mapping between two

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:25.136
sets. Here are three ordered pairs. The first set is a, b and c. And the second

00:00:25.136 --> 00:00:32.713
set is 2, 3, and 1. A maps to 2, b maps to 3, and c maps to 1. We could also

00:00:32.713 --> 00:00:37.590
show this using a mapping diagram. Here's the first set, containing a, b and c.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.461
And here's the second set, containing the numbers 1, 2 and 3. We said a maps to

00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:50.545
2, b maps to 3, and c maps to 1. Now, this would be considered a function,

00:00:50.545 --> 00:00:56.678
since every input has 1 distinct and unique output. In other words, every

00:00:56.678 --> 00:01:02.442
single output has one unique input that creates it. Now, let's consider a

00:01:02.442 --> 00:01:08.788
different function. This time this function will have the ordered pairs 2a, 3b

00:01:08.788 --> 00:01:15.495
and 1c. This function is the inverse function of this one. And we could express

00:01:15.495 --> 00:01:21.294
it with this mapping. Notice that here we had the inputs of 1, 2 and 3 here,

00:01:21.294 --> 00:01:28.425
here and here. Now these input correspond to different outputs. 1 corresponds

00:01:28.425 --> 00:01:36.264
to c, 2 corresponds to a, and 3 corresponds to b. Look carefully at these two

00:01:36.264 --> 00:01:42.454
functions and their mappings to figure out their relationship. What do you

00:01:42.454 --> 00:01:47.950
think is the relationship between a function and its inverse? Once you've taken

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.580
some time to think about this, I want you to try and answer this next question.
