00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.122
So we have 2 approaches here--thread per row and thread per element. Which is better?

00:00:05.122 --> 00:00:11.129
So we might have different performance on matrices that have a similar number of elements per row,

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.921
and we might have differing performance if we have a varying

00:00:14.921 --> 00:00:17.795
or even a wildly varying number of elements per row.

00:00:17.795 --> 00:00:23.066
So which of these is comparatively better on each of these kinds of matrices?

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.238
So I'd like you to put a couple checkboxes in.
