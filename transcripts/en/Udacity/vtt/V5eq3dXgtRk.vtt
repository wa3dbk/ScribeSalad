00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.990
So what actually goes into
getting images from the Internet

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.980
onto the screen in your app?

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.480
Well, there's a networking part
to actually download the images,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.130
can't do that on the main thread so
we'll have to use a background thread.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.990
You probably want to cache
the images locally to prevent

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.769
unnecessary repeated downloading.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.520
Oh, and down sampling and decoding.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.360
It doesn't make sense to load giant
images, just to display tiny icons.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.474
Well and we have icons on our list, so
probably want some behavior to ensure

00:00:30.474 --> 00:00:33.291
that we can still scroll
our list nice and smoothly.

00:00:33.291 --> 00:00:37.322
A whole bunch of images are loaded or
cancel requests for images that are no

00:00:37.322 --> 00:00:42.180
longer visible due to life cycle changes
such as our activity being paused.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.740
Then it add the image to the screen
at least we have image view there.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.275
Oh, and
we have our notification as well.

00:00:49.275 --> 00:00:52.915
There we probably do need to get the
whole image as we build the notification

00:00:52.915 --> 00:00:56.085
so maybe a synchronous API for
this case.

00:00:56.085 --> 00:00:59.056
Anyone else thinking this
is a bit complicated?

00:00:59.056 --> 00:01:03.065
You can't just cut out any of these
steps if we want to go to experience.

00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:07.330
But none of the logic here is
unique to sunshine, right?

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.245
Plenty of other ops have gone
through the same flow and

00:01:10.245 --> 00:01:12.220
tackle these same steps.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.540
When you see these types of
reusable pieces of code it's

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.080
a great time to consider
using a library.
