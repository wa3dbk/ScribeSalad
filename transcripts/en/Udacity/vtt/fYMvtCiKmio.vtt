00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.080
I've recorded three different traces of the same page. The

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.250
only difference is how I've included the JavaScript. In one

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.100
of these traces, I've used the blocking script tag. In

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.270
another, I've inlined the script, and in the last one, I've

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.700
used the script tag with the async attribute. Take a

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.500
look at the sequence of the events here and try to

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.020
figure out which is which. Once you know the answer,

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.960
just write down blocking, inline, or async in the boxes below.
