00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.889
To illustrate some of the key challenges
in computing with Turing machines and

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:08.141
how to overcome them,
we'll examine this task here,

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.548
where we're given an input string, and

00:00:10.548 --> 00:00:14.531
we want to tell if it is of the form
w#w, where w is a binary string.

00:00:14.531 --> 00:00:15.930
Otherwise, we reject it.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.700
I'll illustrate the basic
idea on this example.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.160
First, we x out the first
symbol on the tape.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.240
And then we're going to go look to
see if the first element past the #

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.640
is the same symbol.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.080
So the fact that I read a 0 here,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.790
somehow has to encoded
in the machine's state.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.480
So we'll go along to the first symbol
after the # and indeed it is a 0.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.850
If it wasn't,
then we can reject the input right away.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.090
Those two strings on either
side of the # are not equal.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.700
We x out that 0, so
that we know not to check it again.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.160
And we move left, past the #,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.591
over to the first x after
that that we encounter.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.920
And now we're ready to
repeat that process.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.900
We x out the 1 this time.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.830
Remembering the fact that it
was a 1 in the machine state.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.269
We can forget that the previous
symbol was a 0 by now.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.040
And then we move right, past the #,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.240
past all the x's,
to the next non-x symbol that we see.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.060
This is a 1,
which matches what we x'd out before.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.180
That's great.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.780
We x it out and then we rewind past
the #, to the first x that we encounter.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.011
At this point, the next symbol is a #,
so we know that the string to

00:01:27.011 --> 00:01:31.263
the left of the # matches the first
part of the string to the right.

00:01:31.263 --> 00:01:34.211
But, there might might
be more to the right, so

00:01:34.211 --> 00:01:38.900
we check that we crossed off all of
the 0's and 1's to the right of the #.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.840
If we didn't, then we reject
because there wasn't a match.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.770
The string on the right was too long.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.980
As Turing machines go,
this is a pretty simple program, but

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.860
as you can see here,
the state diagram gets a little messy.

00:01:50.888 --> 00:01:54.480
Like the Sipsor text book, I have used
a little shorthand here in the diagram.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.920
When two symbols appear to
the left of the arrow, I mean,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.670
to match either one those.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.400
It's easier than writing
out a whole other edge.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.900
Also, sometimes I will only
give a direction on the right,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.789
interpret that to mean that
the tape should be left alone.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.830
Here is our initial state, q0.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.767
&gt;From here,
we usually read either a 0 or 1, and

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:18.550
proceed down one of these
two parallel paths.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.400
We need parallel paths here, because we
have to remember whether it was a 0 or

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.680
a 1 that we read initially.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.990
We move past the rest of
the first string to the # and

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.243
then past any x'd out symbols
to the next either 0 or a 1.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.430
Actually, if we encounter a blank,

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.380
that means that the second string was
too short and we can reject immediately.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.570
Or if we encounter a 1
when we're looking for

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.370
a 0, that also means that we reject.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.620
If we encounter a 0 in this side,
however,

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.170
that means that we found a match and
we can begin the rewind process.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.990
And this path is exactly an alogus.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.750
When we do find the match, we x it out,
and then begin the rewind process.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.625
Rewinding past all the xs.

00:03:02.625 --> 00:03:07.560
Then we encounter a #, and
then we rewind past all the 0s,

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.839
and 1s until we encounter the first x.

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:13.719
And then we move
the symbol to the right so

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:18.826
that we're reading the next symbol
in the first string that was input.

00:03:18.826 --> 00:03:21.730
And then we're ready to
begin this process again.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.918
When in this phase, we encounter the #.

00:03:23.918 --> 00:03:28.150
That means that we've matched
all of this first string, here.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.890
And so we just need to check that
this string here isn't any longer.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.463
So we moved past all the xs and if we
encounter a blank next, that's great,

00:03:36.463 --> 00:03:37.980
we accept.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.530
If we encounter something else,
then we need to reject.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.670
Take a minute to look this
all over carefully and

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.830
convince yourself that it's right.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.830
It helps to trace through an example.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.360
We'll do this for the input 01#01.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.796
Of course we start in the initial
state q0, and we read a 0,

00:03:57.796 --> 00:04:02.501
so we transition to the state q1,
xing out that 0.

00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:04.310
So this becomes our new configuration.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.710
Next, we read a 1 so
we stay in this state and

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.600
just move the head to the right.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.400
Next we encounter the #, so we move to
state q3 and move the head to the right.
