00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.140
Let us consider the processing as a second example comes along.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.200
And the red outline for this example means it is a negative example. So

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.720
now the agent will try to find a way of specializing the most general model and

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.670
generalizing the most specialized model, in order to account for

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.960
this negative example. So given this negative example, you want to

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.500
specialize the most general model so that this negative example is excluded and

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.310
yet each of the specializations is a generalization of this most specific model

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.160
because this was coming from a positive example. We do want to include this.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.370
Let's first specialize in a way so that each specialization is a generalization

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.150
of this model. There are 4 ways of doing it because there are 4 slots here.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.610
The first slot here deals with the name of the restaurant like Sam's or Kim's.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.700
One specialization of this most journal concept is to put the name of an actual

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.330
restaurant there. This is generalization of this concept because this was

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.840
deferring to one specific need at Sam's, this is referring to any need at Sam's.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.180
In a similar way I can specialize the filler of the second slot.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.680
In short of having any meal, I can make it a breakfast meal.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.870
This is a specialization of this most general concept that is

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.120
a generalization of this concept because this refers to breakfast at any place,

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.770
this refers to breakfast at Sam's on Friday and so on. Similarly for

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.590
the third slot and the fourth slot in this most general concept.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.030
Now I must look at these specializations of the most general concept and

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.890
ask which one of them should I prune so as to exclude the negative example.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.100
I notice that Sam's doesn't match Kim's, so this is already excluded in so

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.360
far as this concept is concerned. Breakfast doesn't match lunch, so

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.450
this example is already excluded as far as this concept is concerned. How about

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.830
with this concept of characterization and mix this negative example, therefore I

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.080
must floor it. So we pull away that particular concept characterization and

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.120
we are left with three specializations of the most general model.
