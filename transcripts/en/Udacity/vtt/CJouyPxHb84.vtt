00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.230
In the previous example, we saw how we could make visualizations more clear

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.420
by removing extraneous elements.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.240
We can conceptualize this relationship using something called the data

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.520
to ink ratio.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.650
The data to ink ratio was defined in 1983 by Edward Tufte,

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.240
and describes the ratio of ink used to describe the data to the ink used to

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.080
describe everything else.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.100
So what is a good data to ink ratio?

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.540
Typically, we think of high data to ink ratios as being very good.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.080
It means that a large portion of the ink used in a visualization is used to

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.800
describe the data points themselves.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.240
A low data to ink ratio is usually very bad.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.140
And describes a visualization in which the majority of the ink is not used to

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.050
describe the data, but is actually describing something else.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.120
In general, we want to have the highest data to ink ratio as possible.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.930
If we have a low data to ink ratio,

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.700
we have extraneous elements in our visualization that should be removed.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.230
Let's look at an example.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.720
In this example we look at two

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.210
graphs that are representing the same information.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.800
On the left hand side, we have a visualization that has a low data to ink ratio.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.070
Notice, the extra elements in the visualization that can be removed,

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.220
such as the blue background, the horizontal and

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.460
vertical grid lines, and the outer black border.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.070
What this shows is that a large amount of the ink used in

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.060
this visualization does not directly describe the data at hand.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.270
On the right hand side,

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.260
we see a visualization with the same data with a high data to ink ratio.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.520
The only ink used is ink that is actually describing the data directly.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.760
Comparing both visualizations side by side, the one on the right is

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.610
not only more pleasing to the eye but it is also much easier to understand.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.860
When we're building data visualizations, we always want to strive for

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.620
as high of a data to ink ratio as possible.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.790
Let's go through a few more examples of how we can take a visualization with

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.710
a low data to ink ratio or extraneous elements, and

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.330
reduce it down to something that is simpler and much easier to understand.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.640
In this example, we're going to take a visualization and

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.900
try to improve it's data to ink ratio.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.970
Here, we have a bar chart showing the number of calories for

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.320
various types of foods.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.880
At first glance, we can see examples of bad visualization techniques that

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.340
we've discussed previously.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.268
Such as this busy background, poor color choices, and

00:02:07.268 --> 00:02:09.750
the use of 3D shadow and gradients.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.460
Let's walk through step by step how we can simplify this visualization and

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.420
increase it's data to ink ratio.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.090
First, let's remove the wood background from the outside and

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.470
the gray background from the inside, increasing contrast and legibility.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.520
We can also remove redundant labels, such as the legend and

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.010
some of the titles as this information is encoded elsewhere.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.640
Now that we have removed the background,

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.400
the heavy borders separating the various elements are no longer necessary.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.330
So let's take those out too.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.160
Remembering our color theory, we shouldn't use more than one or

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.310
two colors in the visualization unless it is encoding some value in the data.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.410
The color of these bars don't reflect any differences between the foods.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.380
So let's remove all of the colors except for the food of interest.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.490
In this case, bacon.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.100
Great.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.740
We've already improved the data to ink ratio quite a bit, but

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.250
there's more that we can do.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.470
Recall that 3D graphs, including gradients and shadowing, can be misleading.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.120
So let's flatten out those bars and

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.850
remove the drop shadows to make it more clear.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.550
We can also make the data stand out by reducing the boldness of the labels and

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.120
the gridlines.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.330
If we want to go even further we can remove the lines entirely, and

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.400
encode the values directly into the bars themselves, like this.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.490
Comparing the two visualizations side by side,

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.900
you can easily the effect of improving the data to ink ratio.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.800
The visualization with the high data-to-ink ratio is far more clear, more

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.390
interpretable, and that's all the elements you need for a great visualization.
