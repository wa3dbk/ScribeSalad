00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, let's go write out the answer together in the interpreter.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm going to start by defining my function small_words,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and it takes a list of words as input.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I definitely want to iterate over each one.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The problem definition said that we want those involving at most 3 letters,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
so those are the small words that we yield.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now I'm going to add some debugging to see if I've gotten the right answer.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm going to use one of these list comprehensions because I love them so much.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm going to print out each word that's in small_words

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
applied to "The quick brown fox."

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I'm just sort of eyeballing it.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
"The" and "fox" are at most 3 letters, so I hope to see these 2 in the answer,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
but "quick" and "brown" are too big to make the final cut,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and that's exactly what we got out.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Recall that our goal was to enumerate all the strings in a grammar.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
That was our super slow approach to check and see

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
if HTML or JavaScript was valid.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Well, unsurprisingly, these generators

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
are the trick we're going to use to enumerate a lot of strings

00:00:55.000 --> 09:59:59.000
in a concise manner.
