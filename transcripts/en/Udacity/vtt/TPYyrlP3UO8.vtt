It is also important to look at how the component frameworks differ in as far as

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.390
their support for variability is concerned.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.460
Recall that one of the key advantages of components and their late

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.390
finding is the fact that there's some flexibility provided to their customer.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.080
As far as Java and

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.970
CLI are concerned, they use a single virtual machine for all platforms.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.570
Many languages can generate byte codes that target those particular platforms.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.390
COM also supports many languages, but on Microsoft platforms only.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.600
CORBA supports, supports multiple languages, but each of the,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.200
each of the languages must its own IDL binding.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.610
Each platform must also have an object request broker

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.190
running on that particular platform.
