00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
It's important to analyze the running time of this algorithm

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
so we have some idea of how efficient it is.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And again, that's going to involve counting up the number of primitive steps,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
primitive statements, time that the algorithm takes when solving a problem.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We'll assume, as before, that n represents the number of nodes in the graph

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and m represents the number of edges.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And it turns out that the basic strategy that we use for this algorithm

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
is a kind of graph search.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
There's 2 principal flavors of graft search, depth first search and breadth first search.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This one that we've been talking about is a form of depth first search.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Later we're going to see a version of breadth first search

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
when we start looking at shortest paths.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
But this particular algorithm is not concerned about the length of the paths,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
it's just trying to figure out which nodes can be reached by any kind of path.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So taking a look at this algorithm here,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
one of the things that we can note right off the bat

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
is statements like this one, marked(node) = True,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
can only be executed once for each node in the graph.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So even though it's a little bit hard to tell exactly when this is going to execute,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
we know at the end of the day every node is going to get marked

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and no node is going to get marked twice.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So that means once for each node in the graph we're going to execute this statement

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and this statement and this loop.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And what does this loop do?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It goes through and basically visits all the edges that come out of this particular node (node).

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And for each of those edges, well, it does some work.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It checks whether or not it's marked, which we're going to assume is a unit time operation,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
some kind of nice hash table and it behaves nicely,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and a recursive call, and we're going to somehow have to account for

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
all the stuff that happens in this recursive call, but let's not worry about that for the moment.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
It's going to do this one main computation, this adding whatever value it gets back

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
to this quantity here, then it returns.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So these statements here are going to get executed once per node.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
This statement is going to get executed once per node.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
This statement is going to get executed once per edge in the graph

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
because for each node it's going to visit all the edges emanating from that node.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So even though it's very difficult to keep track of what's going to be executed when,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
we know that the total running time here is going to be big theta

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
of the number of nodes plus the total number of edges in the graph.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So that's what's happening in this marked component.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And then what's happening outside here, this marked gets executed once at all,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
then for every node in the graph it may or may not execute this statement,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
which does the call to mark component.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So we're going to iterate over all the nodes,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and again, we're going to do some work but not more than constant work per node.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And if we look at our running time here, adding another n in here doesn't change the big theta.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Again, even though it's very complex to figure out which statements are executing when,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
the actual running time is big theta of n + m.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
It's worth pointing out that this is linear in the size of the graph.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
The graph consists of some number of nodes and some number of edges,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and that's the whole story.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So this is actually linear in the size of the graph.
