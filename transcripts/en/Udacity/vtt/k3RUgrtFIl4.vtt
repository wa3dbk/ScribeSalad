00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.146
So where does 40 fall on this distribution? Looks like it's above the mean, and

00:00:07.146 --> 00:00:15.454
the mean is 37.72, so we're finding how many standard deviations 40 is from

00:00:15.454 --> 00:00:28.919
37.72. So 40 minus the mean of the sampling distribution, divided by 2.71, which

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:34.706
is about 0.84. Good job. You just calculated the z-score for this particular

00:00:34.706 --> 00:00:39.405
sample, using the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution. And

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:44.233
remember that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution is called the

00:00:44.233 --> 00:00:45.227
standard error.
