00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.500
Trust among HISPs is another challenge.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.900
Earlier we said that the HISP
established trust by

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.530
verifying that Doctors Johnson and
Jones are who they say they are and

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.980
that they are licensed physicians
in their practice state.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.830
That's fairly easy to
do on a local basis.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.780
Suppose, however,
that physicians in two states, or

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.870
even two regions of the country,
want to use direct.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.330
They will almost certainly be
connected to different HISPs,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.009
each of which established its own
policies for establishing trust.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.330
Nationwide there could
be hundreds of HISPs.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.870
Is each of them going to
have to investigate and

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.100
contract with all the others to make
sure they can trust each other?

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.040
That gets unwieldy fast, as shown here.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.230
Direct Trust was established
to provide a solution

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.110
by establishing a trust community.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.390
As the number of HISPs increases,
the number of trust

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.020
relationships needed doubles
as ten more HISPs are added?

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.000
Triples as 30 more HISPs are added?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.400
Grows exponentially?

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.200
Depends on where the HISPs are located?
