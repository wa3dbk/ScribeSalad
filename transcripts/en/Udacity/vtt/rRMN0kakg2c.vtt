00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.085
The code for this course lives in a Git
repository, hosted on GitHub.com.

00:00:05.135 --> 00:00:08.730
While you don't really need to know
anything about Git or GitHub for

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.870
this course.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.250
I wanted to explain a bit, so that Git
doesn't seem like some scary black box.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.270
A Git Repository, or repo, is just
a folder full of stuff, usually code.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.120
As well as a history of
snapshots of that code.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.720
These snapshots are knows as commits.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.380
If this repository is sitting
on a server somewhere,

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.350
it become super easy for a bunch of
people to all talk to the repository.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.550
Potentially, all making
changes at the same time

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.030
in such a way that no ones steps on
each others toes with their changes.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.953
The very, very short version,
is that you clone a repository.

00:00:41.953 --> 00:00:44.541
You make some changes
to your local files.

00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:47.200
You commit those files to
your local repository.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.730
Merge in any changes that anyone
else has made in the meantime.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.190
And then push your version back
up to the main repository.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.330
Git is what's called a version control
system, and it makes creating software

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.677
projects, like the code for
this course, super, super easy.

00:01:00.677 --> 00:01:04.141
If you're interested in learning more,
Udacity actually has a whole

00:01:04.141 --> 00:01:07.429
course on Git, which you can
find at udacity.com/ud775, or

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:10.440
by following the link down
in the instructor notes.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.330
Bookmark it and check it out later.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.920
Git is a crazy useful tool.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.070
Anyway, at Udacity,

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.620
we use a service called GitHub
to host our Git repositories.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.840
The code we're going to share with you
has actually been on GitHub the entire

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.610
time we've been working on this course.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.240
It's just that we flipped a switch
to make the repository public

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.900
when the course went live.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.940
That also means that all the messy
history from when this course was in

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.080
development is still in there.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.650
Feel free to poke around and find all
the embarrassing commit messages.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.375
Also, to you GitHub masters out there,
if you find errors in the course code,

00:01:41.375 --> 00:01:43.760
pull requests are gratefully accepted.
