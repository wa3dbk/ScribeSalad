00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The task now is to study what happens to energy with the forward Euler's method.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The method is provided and your task is to fill a ray called energy, that's also provided,

00:00:11.000 --> 09:59:59.000
with the correct values and eventually the results are plotted to see what happens to energy.
