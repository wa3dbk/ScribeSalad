00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.360
For this quiz, I want you to figure out which components are required for

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.510
AJAX requests.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.870
But to answer this question, I want you to do some research on your own.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.750
When it comes to learning a new language or

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.280
a new library, the documentation is really your best friend.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.580
So for this exercise, I want you to take a look at the documentation linked in

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.550
the instructor notes, and then check off the minimum amount of

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.360
information that's required to make an AJAX request.
