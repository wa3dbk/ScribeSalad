00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.687
We'll set up our long division problem like this. We write the thing that we

00:00:03.687 --> 00:00:07.660
want to divide, underneath here, and the thing want to divide it by out here.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.960
Now, let's start by thinking how many times x minus 2 can go into the first

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.416
term over here, the one with the highest degree. So, how many times can x minus

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:20.574
2 go into x cubed? To make things a little bit easier, let's only consider the

00:00:20.574 --> 00:00:24.870
x here, since the degree of x is higher than the degree of 2. So what do we

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.259
need to multiple x by to get x cubed? Please put the answer right here.
