00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.210
The next thing I want us to find, is the horizontal asymptote of this function.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.939
Remember that the way we found this before, was we divided the numerator by the

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:13.513
denominator. So, why don't we take a step back and just do that first? So let's

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:17.616
start by just doing that division. What is 8 x squared minus 1 divided by 4 x

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:19.600
squared minus 9?
