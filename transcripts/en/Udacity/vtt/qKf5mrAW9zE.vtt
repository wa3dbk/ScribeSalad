00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.583
So remember that in the last quiz you
simplified y to the fourth x squared y to

00:00:04.595 --> 00:00:09.141
the negative two to equal x squared y
squared. But in doing these we actually

00:00:09.153 --> 00:00:13.863
dealt with something we haven't talked
about explicitly before. This negative

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:18.305
exponent right here. My question for you
now is basically what do negative

00:00:18.317 --> 00:00:23.053
exponents mean? So which of these five
answers down here. Is an equivalent

00:00:23.065 --> 00:00:28.327
expression to what we started out, with y
to the fourth x squared y to the negative

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:33.745
two? Remember whatever you pick down here,
also needs to give us the final answer of

00:00:33.757 --> 00:00:38.753
x squared y squared in the end. So think
about what intermediate step you need

00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:42.644
between here and here. And which one of
these answer choices fits that? This is

00:00:42.656 --> 00:00:43.913
definitely a little bit tricky.
