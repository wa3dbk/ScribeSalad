00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.812
First, we want to add 4 to both sides to get this polynomial by itself. Now,

00:00:04.812 --> 00:00:09.044
we're in a position to complete the square. We know our b is positive 4. So, b

00:00:09.044 --> 00:00:13.795
divided by 2 equals 2. And b over 2 squared is equal to 4. This is the amount

00:00:13.795 --> 00:00:17.910
we need to add to both sides of our equation in order to complete the square.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.273
So, we'll have positive 8 on the right and then we'll have x plus 2 for our

00:00:21.273 --> 00:00:26.244
perfect square on the left. Keep in mind, this positive 2, comes from our b

00:00:26.244 --> 00:00:31.566
over 2 term. This is positive 2, so this is positive 2. Another way to find

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:34.728
this number, is the take the square root of this term and use the sign for the

00:00:34.728 --> 00:00:39.224
b term. The square root of 4 is 2 and we use the positive sign, since this sign

00:00:39.224 --> 00:00:44.557
is also positive. Next, we take the square root of both sides of our equation,

00:00:44.557 --> 00:00:49.716
to get x plus 2 equals positive or negative, 2 root 2. Finally we subtract 2

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:52.350
from both sides, to get our two answers for x.
