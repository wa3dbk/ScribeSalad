00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So, here you are, you are sitting in front of your interactive debugger,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
stepping for the program, you're looking at the variables, stepping, and stepping, and stepping.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Setting up breakpoints trying to figure out what's going on and no time asked.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:31.000
You sit in front of your screen. You dig through the code step by step by step by step.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And you watch individual variables appear and disappear. Time passes.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It's late, so you order a pizza. Maybe a cup of coffee.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
You keep on watching the screen and some more coffee

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and just keep on stepping and stepping to your program as time goes by.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It's pretty late already and you keep on concentrating, stepping, stepping, stepping.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:22.000
You are so close now. That's when the phone ring. Ring. Ring. Ring.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Who's on the phone? Who's on the phone?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It's a significant other asking you, "When on earth are you planning to come home?"

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
You are in a lose-lose situation.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
You either lose your concentration or you lose your significant other.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You have 30 seconds left until you lose all the concentration you have so carefully build up.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
You have 30 seconds to decide what to do.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I know a fair amount of programmers who when faced

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.815
with such a problem have taken the only right decision.

00:02:00.845 --> 00:02:06.798
And I think that debugging is the number one divorce ground for programmers.
