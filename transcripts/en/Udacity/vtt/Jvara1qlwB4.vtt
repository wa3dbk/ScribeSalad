00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.390
So, what happens to the neurotransmitters once they're released from the

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:09.008
synaptic vesicles? A variety of things can happen. One, those neurotransmitters

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:15.182
can be taken back up by that neuron. This process is called reuptake. However,

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:20.094
there are some groups that prevent reuptake. For example, maybe you have heard

00:00:20.094 --> 00:00:25.216
of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors. If someone were to take an SSRI, it

00:00:25.216 --> 00:00:31.360
means that once those neurotransmitters are released Into the synaptic cleft.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.447
The drug prevents those neurotransmitters from being taken back up by that same

00:00:35.447 --> 00:00:40.247
neuron. That allows for more serotonin in the synaptic cleft and eventually

00:00:40.247 --> 00:00:45.498
those serotonin neurotransmitters can attach to the receptor sites. Another

00:00:45.498 --> 00:00:50.546
mechanism is enzymes will actually break down those neurotransmitters. In doing

00:00:50.546 --> 00:00:53.876
so, they will not be able to attach to receptor sites. Once the

00:00:53.876 --> 00:01:00.269
neurotransmitter attaches to the receptor, it can have 1 or 2 effects.

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:07.220
Neurotransmitters can have an inhibitory effect or, an excitatory effect.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.185
Inhibitory effect is going to decrease the likelihood of the next neuron

00:01:11.185 --> 00:01:16.378
firing. Whereas an excitatory effect is going to increase the likelihood of the

00:01:16.378 --> 00:01:18.460
next neuron firing.
