00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.220
The [INAUDIBLE] algorithm has
the so-called five style structure.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.786
That is, encryption and
decryption differ only in key schedule.

00:00:08.786 --> 00:00:14.030
That is in decryption,
we apply the same operations

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.040
as in encryption, but
only with the key sequence in reverse.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.140
That is, round one of decryption uses
the key of the last round of encryption.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.100
And so on and so forth.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.940
We can take a closer look to verify
that decryption really works by applying

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.840
the same operations as an encryption,
and only the key sequence in reverse.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.800
In particular,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.230
we only need to look at the decryption
operations in the last round.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.260
The input to each round, for
example, the input to the first

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.350
round of decryption is actually R and
N in reverse order,

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.510
meaning the right half is on the left,
and the left half is on the right.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.010
This is due to the swap operation at
the end of the encryption process.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.630
For example, the input to the first
round of decryption would be R16 and

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.190
L16, because encryption has 16 rounds.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.060
And here, because we are using the key
sequence in reverse in decryption,

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.100
then the key using the first
round of decryption

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.380
is the key using the 16th
round of encryption.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.960
Record that we can use algebra to
represent the desk operations.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.820
If you use those algebra expressions,
you will be able to verify that given

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.220
this input in the decryption process you
should be able to produce this output.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.840
I'll leave these as a exercise for
you to do at home.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.030
Therefore, after 16 rounds
of decryption process,

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.210
the output would be R and
L in plaintext.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.770
In the final swap operation
at the end of the process

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.730
would produce the correct plain text
result L and R in the correct order.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.330
And this is how
decryption in this works.
