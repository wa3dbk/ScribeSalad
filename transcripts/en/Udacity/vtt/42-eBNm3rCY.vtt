00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So now we have equations that govern the

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
rates of change of the position and the velocity.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The rate of change of the position is the velocity,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and the rate of change of the velocity is the acceleration,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
which is by Newton's law, force divided by mass,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and in a typical setting, we also know the position

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
at time 0 and the velocity at time 0.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now we are going to use the computer to learn

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
what these equations are leading to, and the easiest

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
way for doing so is called the Forward Euler Method.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The most complex thing about that method may be

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
the name of Euler.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Euler was born in Basel, Switzerland, that is.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Most people these days use the German pronunciation

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
of his name -- Euler -- even though the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Swiss pronunciation may be different from that,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and in the U.S., you may also hear the pronunciation Euler.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I try to stick to the pronunciation Euler,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but forgive me if I, from time to time, fall back into saying Euler

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Euler's idea was to solve these equations

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
by walking in small time steps.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
If we start at the initial position--

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
x(0) and the initial velocity -- v(0),

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
what would happen after a short timespan we call h?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The position would approximately increase by h times the velocity.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
If the velocity is 2 meters per second,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and we wait for 3 seconds,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
we will be changing the position by 6 meters, for instance.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But, of course, we're using a much smaller time step.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Similarly for the velocity, after some small time h,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
the velocity will be its original value plus

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
the time step times the acceleration, which is F/m.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So these equations will take us from

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
time 0 to time h approximately.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I'm cheating a little when I write equal signs here.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
In the same fashion, we can get from time h to

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
time 2h doing another step.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
This is what this second step looks like.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We know the position that we have reached at the end of the first step,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and we continue with the new velocity,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and that results in the new position --

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
similarly for the velocity.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
You iterate this process over and over again

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and find estimates for positions and velocities as you go.
