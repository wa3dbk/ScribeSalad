00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.150
So we have seen that our predict not taken predictor, that is very simple to

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.300
implement, is pretty accurate. For about 88% of all instructions it

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.180
predicts correctly. So why do we even need any better predictors?

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.630
Because anything better than this will require some investment of hardware to do

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.310
the prediction better. We will answer this question in two ways. First, we will

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.710
compare the CPI with the not taken predictor, that is, let's say 88% accurate.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.710
And with a better predictor that let's say 99% accurate. And we will do this for

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.660
a five stage pipe line that results branches in the thirrd stage, so

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.620
it has a two cycle penalty when ever there is a misprediction. So

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.010
it has a two cycle penalty when there is a misprediction. We will also do it for

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.250
a 14 stage pipeline that results branches in the eleventh stage, so

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.460
it has a 10 cycle penalty for a misprediction, and for

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.510
another pipeline that has 14 stages results branches in eleventh. Stage but

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.780
this one executes 4 instructions per cycle, so this is very close to

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.760
what modern processors look like. So for a not taken predictor and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.890
a 5 stage pipe, the CPA we get is 1 plus how often we mispredict,

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.370
which is 12% of all instructions, times the penalty of a misprediction,

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.079
which is 2 cycles, which gives us a total CPI of 1.24.

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:37.540
What happens when we have a better predictor? Well,

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.270
we now get 1 plus 0.01 only 1% of the time we mispredict and

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.880
we get a 2 cycle penalty then. So the CPI now is 1.02.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.420
And now let's look also at the speed up that we get from a better predictor.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.430
If the frequency of the processor stays the same and it executes the same number

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.900
of instructions, then the speedup is simply the improvement in the CPI.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.060
So the speedup would be the CPI of the not taken predictor but

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.460
divided by the CPI of the better predictor. And

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:21.060
we get a speed up of 1.22. This is actually a noticeable speed up.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.200
But things get more interesting when we have a deeper pipeline.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.630
In that case, we have a 1 plus still 12% I couldn't see for not taken.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.740
But this time the penalty because where is all the branches in the eleventh

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.760
stage will be 10, and we get an overall CPI of 2.2. This

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:46.170
is much worse than the 1 that we will be getting with no mispredictions.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:53.293
With a better predictor we get 1 plus 1% misprediction rate times 10 for

00:02:53.293 --> 00:02:57.810
a total CPI of 1.1. And that gives us a speed up of 2.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.980
So as we can see now, the better predictor is giving us twice the performance of

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.190
the not taken predictor. And we have seen this already,

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.350
that the deeper the pipeline, the more benefit we get from a better predictor.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.580
But what happens when we also do multiple instructions per cycle? So

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.050
this processor can do four instructions in a cycle. So

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:26.560
the ideal cycles per instruction is one-quarter of a cycle. We add to that

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.870
how often we have missed predictions times how many cycles do we waste for

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.150
a missed prediction? We still detect missed predictions in the eleventh stage.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.210
So everything done in the ten cycles after the branch was fetched, is wasted.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:49.080
So, we still have a ten cycle penalty here. And we get an overall CPI of 1.45.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.840
That's actually less than one instruction per cycle.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.460
It's better than a single instruction per cycle processor, but

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.560
not that much better for something that should be four times as capable. Now,

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.385
let's look at the better predictor, which should give us the ideal CPI plus

00:04:09.385 --> 00:04:15.420
1% of the time ten cycle penalty and that results in CPI

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:21.940
of 0.35, or about three instructions per cycle even with the branches.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.640
If we compute the speed-up it's 4.14. So as you can see, if we

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.550
have a deeper pipeline or if we are able to execute more instructions per cycle,

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.900
then the better predictor is more important than in simpler processors.
