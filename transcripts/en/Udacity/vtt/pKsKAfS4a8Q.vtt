00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.575
So Athena's been building a lot of models in her architecture class so that she

00:00:03.575 --> 00:00:07.620
can depict buildings. And she figured out one really easy way to build a

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.180
rectangular building. All you do is you take a rectangular sheet of paper, and

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.905
you just cut a square out of each corner. So you cut a square out of all four

00:00:16.905 --> 00:00:20.765
corners, and make each square the same size. So let's try it out and see what

00:00:20.765 --> 00:00:21.364
happens.

00:00:21.364 --> 00:00:23.170
[SOUND]

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:39.682
Voila, four squares drawn Okay, great, so now we have a rectangle without any

00:00:39.682 --> 00:00:56.716
corners. Now all I have to do is fold up the different flaps. And look, we have

00:00:56.716 --> 00:01:03.242
a box. If you want to make it a permenent box, we can always tape each corner

00:01:03.242 --> 00:01:13.450
together. And look at that, we have a building. Now, this may look pretty

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.693
simple right now, but If you think about it, we've only dealt with area in this

00:01:16.693 --> 00:01:19.942
class so far, and that's really all that Athena's talked about in her

00:01:19.942 --> 00:01:25.328
architecture classes so far too. But being able to make a box or a building, or

00:01:25.328 --> 00:01:29.414
whatever you want to call this, is really powerful. This is a three dimensional

00:01:29.414 --> 00:01:34.180
object. Means it has space that it occupies, and I can do stuff with it

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.829
like[NOISE] Fill it with M&amp;amp;Ms.

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:38.333
[SOUND]

00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:43.314
So this could be a model building or it can hold stuff. It can hold M&amp;amp;Ms, it

00:01:43.314 --> 00:01:46.972
can hold my tape,[SOUND] I can do whatever I want with it because this shape

00:01:46.972 --> 00:01:52.325
takes up volume. It doesn't just have area, it has a volume. So this is a

00:01:52.325 --> 00:01:56.454
totally new concept for art class and also a new concept for Athena. It's

00:01:56.454 --> 00:01:59.183
going to be super important as she continues to study architecture.
