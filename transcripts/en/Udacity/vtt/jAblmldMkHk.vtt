Writing your own software or using somebody else's software

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is one thing--what about getting it right?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Generally, one distinguishes between three different aspects of that.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
First is verification, checking whether your code really implements your model.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Second, calibration. Ensuring the parameters of your model so as to reproduce given observations.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And the third one is validation. Check whether the real word reflects the predictions of your model.

00:00:28.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Of course, within a certain application domain and to a certain accuracy.
