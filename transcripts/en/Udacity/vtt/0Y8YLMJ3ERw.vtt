00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.482
As we discussed before software development efforts normally result

00:00:03.482 --> 00:00:06.127
in the delivery of a software product that satisfies

00:00:06.127 --> 00:00:09.879
the user requirements. So normally our software development organization

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:13.127
will release this application to its final users, however, once

00:00:13.127 --> 00:00:16.090
the software is in operation many things can happen.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.950
So, for example, the environment might change. There might be

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.940
new libraries. There might be new systems in which

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.070
our software has to operate. Or they may be future

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.950
requests, so the users may find out that, guess what,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.370
they want to do something different with the problem that

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.835
we gave them. Or, again, and this is one of

00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:35.970
the most common occurrences, users might find problems with the

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.307
software and may file bug reports and send the bug

00:00:38.307 --> 00:00:42.090
reports back to the software developer. These are the reasons

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.420
why software maintenance is a necessary phase in software development.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.190
Software maintenance is the activity that sustains the software product

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.780
as it evolves throughout its life cycle, specifically

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.350
in response to bug reports, feature requests and

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.890
environment changes. Development organisations perform three kinds of

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.450
maintenance activities: corrective maintenance to eliminate problems with the

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.740
code, perfective maintenance to accommodate feature request, and

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.730
in some cases just to improve the software, for

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.230
example, to make it more efficient, and finally,

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.650
adaptive maintenance, to take care of the environment changes.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.470
And after this activities have been performed, the software developer

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.540
will produce a new version of the application, will release it

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.150
and the cycle will continue through out the lifetime of

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.440
the software. That's why maintenance is a fundamental activity and a

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.420
very expensive one. And one of the reasons why maintenance

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.080
is expensive, that I want to mention now, is regression testing.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.180
During maintenance every time you modify your application you have

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.120
to regression test the application, where regression testing is the activity

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.010
of retesting software after it has been modified to make sure

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.320
that the changes you perform to the software work as expected,

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.540
and that your changes did not introduce any unforseen effect. I'm

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.630
pretty sure that you're familiar with the case of a new

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.000
version of the software being released and just a couple of

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.260
days later another version being released to fix some problems that

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.000
occor with the new version. These problems is what we call

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.640
regression errors and they're what regression

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.560
testing targets and tries to eliminate

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.240
before the new version of the software is released into the world.
