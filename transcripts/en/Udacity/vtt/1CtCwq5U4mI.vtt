00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.688
All right, let's start off with media only screen in max-width 500.

00:00:04.688 --> 00:00:09.480
In my main.css file I've added media only screen and max-width 500.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.900
Okay, I've refreshed the page and let's make it smaller.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.630
Oh, there we go.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.260
As soon as we got below 500 pixels it disappeared.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.840
So that one looks like it's working.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.620
Next up we've got media only screen with max-width 500 and

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.710
this orientation landscape.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.544
Now orientation here is referring to phone orientations,

00:00:26.544 --> 00:00:29.610
whether it's turned in landscape mode or portrait mode.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.530
We'll save main.css.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.740
We'll refresh Chrome.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.970
And let's see.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:34.570
Aha!

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.490
And that one's also working.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.440
Now we've got media only screen, and min-width 500.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.610
Okay, let's see.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.620
Oh, and as soon as I refresh the page, it disappeared.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.600
That's because this screen is bigger than 500 pixels,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.090
which means that that media query got hit and paragraphs are being hidden.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.110
Last but not least, we have media only print and with a max-width of 500.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.240
Now print here means that these styles are only going to be

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.329
used if it's being printed.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.240
So we'll save the page.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.680
We'll refresh.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.510
And here it is.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.750
Let's make the screen smaller to see if it disappears.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.460
And it does not.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.340
We're not printing so

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.540
this paragraph's going to stay even if the screen is smaller than 500 pixels.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.660
So looking at the question.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.120
The first one made paragraphs disappear for screens smaller than 500 pixels.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.800
As do the second, but the third and fourth didn't.
