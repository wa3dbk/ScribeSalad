00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.376
The lobotomy has a tragic and torrid history, in that, in nearly four decades

00:00:04.376 --> 00:00:09.318
approximately 40,000 lobotomies were performed. If you're interested in the

00:00:09.318 --> 00:00:13.280
history of the lobotomy there's a lot of information available on the web. In

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.240
addition, you may be interested in a book about Walter Freeman. Who's

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.794
considered one of the most scored physicians because he performed approximately

00:00:21.794 --> 00:00:26.385
3,500 of those 40,000 lobotomies. The name of the book is entitled "My

00:00:26.385 --> 00:00:30.641
Lobotomy" by Howard Dully. In that book, Mr Dully explains his experience of

00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:35.812
getting a prefrontal lobotomy from Walter Freeman. Now, we're going to post a

00:00:35.812 --> 00:00:40.600
link from a PBS special in the instructor's note box. I want to warn you that

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.320
this video is extremely graphic because it shows actual lobotomies being

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.000
performed. Therefore, I want to warn you that it can be very upsetting,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.598
disturbing, or disconcerting to watch. So please think carefully before you do

00:00:53.598 --> 00:00:54.060
so.
