00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.970
We can understand the importance
of authentication by going back

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.950
to the discussion we had about what
a trusted computing base does.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.580
So we have resources that need
to be protected and we can do

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.510
that by having a trusted computing
base that is a reference monitor.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.900
Every request that comes for
a resource has to be monitored.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.270
And when you monitor the request,
the question you have is,

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.760
should this request be able
to access the resource for

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.490
which that is the target
of this request?

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.620
To answer that question we
really have to establish

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.510
who is the request coming from.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.360
The source of the request is,
we're going to be able to identify that

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.890
because we have
authentication in the system.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.660
So let's look a little bit more closely
at what authentication really is.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.960
Authentication, we said we have to
establish the source of the request.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.890
So we have to ask the question, who
are you, if you happen to be the source?

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.424
And of course,
you can't just claim to be anybody.

00:01:02.424 --> 00:01:07.650
When you're going to claim that
you are Alice, you have to provide

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.050
some evidence to us that is going to
convince us that you really are Alice.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.870
So authentication is knowing the
identity of the source and establishing

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.670
that it indeed is that person who is
making that claim about the identity.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.530
So once we establish the source of
a request, convince ourselves that

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.040
the user is who he or she claims to be,
the next part is authorization.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.380
So in authorization we're
really establishing

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.140
whether the source of the request does
have the permissions necessary for

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.090
the resource that they want to access.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.650
So this permission check is
the authorization process and

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.910
once authentication and
authorization is done,

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.070
of course then we allow access to
the resource when permitted and

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.450
the source of the request is able
to make use of the resources.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.350
So let's dig a little bit deeper
into this question about what is

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.431
authentication?

00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:11.440
We just discussed that
the operating system or

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.260
the trusted computing base,
OS is that plus more perhaps.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.920
So the OS of the trusted
computing base needs to know

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.720
who is making a request for
the resource that is protected.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.440
So access to that resource
has to be secured.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.940
So we know that in a computer system
a request actually comes from a process.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.710
This process may be running one of your
services, your browser, a mail client,

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.180
whatever it is.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.630
So processes making the request, but

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.700
we know that processes
are run on behalf of users.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.235
So a given process that is
making a request must be running

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:51.220
on behalf on a certain user.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.570
We call the user also a subject or
a principal.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.680
These are the active entities
that actually initiate request or

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.810
cause actions.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.460
So these terms are used interchangeably,
but we'll stick with user.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.810
So process runs on behalf of a user.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.350
Authentication, which is our topic,
essentially is going to help us

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.710
answer this question that we have,
is that if a process is making a request

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.670
to know who's making the request,
what user is making the request,

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.530
we must answer the question on whose
behalf is the process running?

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.160
So the requesting process makes
the request by making a system call.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.330
It comes through the operating system,
but

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.510
on whose behalf is it making that call?

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.140
To establish the user on whose
behalf the process is running,

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.680
of course we have to start
with authentication.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.410
In the beginning,
when a user comes to the system,

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.102
the user is going to
authenticate himself or herself.

00:03:55.102 --> 00:03:59.500
So that's how we, for example,
start a login session.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.140
You login to the system, or start the
session that's going to launch one or

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.600
more processes that you need to run, and

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.810
then in the end the session
is going to be over.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.860
So when you start the login session,

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.190
prior to launching the process
that is making the request,

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.589
of course you're going to make
a claim about your identity.

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:24.270
You're going to tell the system, I am
Alice, and then the system is going to

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.967
ask you, well give me some evidence so
I can believe that you really are Alice.

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:32.390
And when that evidence is
provided we need to verify it.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:37.290
The verification actually tells us that
the user is actually who he or she

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:43.220
claims to be, and then that user launch
an application or start a process.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.780
And that process is then going to have,
sometimes we say credentials of this

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.020
user, because this
user was authenticated.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.800
In other words, those processes
are going to run on behalf

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.380
of that user that just authenticated,
and

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.410
whatever resources this user is
able access, those processes

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.240
will be able to successfully
gain access to those resources.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.790
So really, requests when we talk about,
do come from processes, but

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.480
processes run on behalf of users.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.770
And the system knows what user
a process is running on behalf of

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.075
because of authentication,

00:05:18.075 --> 00:05:22.770
because that comes before the process
gets launched and makes the request.
