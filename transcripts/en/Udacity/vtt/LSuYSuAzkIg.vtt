So whenever we see absolute value bars, we want to think distance. Let's see if

00:00:04.467 --> 00:00:08.786
we can use that knowledge to answer this question. So what do you think? What

00:00:08.798 --> 00:00:13.155
could the values of K be? 0? Negative 3 and 3? Any real number? Or no solution?

00:00:13.254 --> 00:00:17.573
Take some time to think about it and draw some diagrams. Maybe try and place K

00:00:17.585 --> 00:00:19.670
at different parts of the number line.
