00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.650
Today, we're going to be talking about distribution channels.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.180
How does your product get from your company to your customer?

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.220
You're all familiar with the business model canvas.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.810
We've already talked about value propositions and we've talked about customer segments

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.520
in the last two lectures, but today we're going to talk about channels.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.900
So let's take a look at our business model canvas.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.990
Channels is just one of the nine boxes in the canvas and it's a series of hypothesis

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.110
of how does our product get from our company to our customer.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.990
Now, when companies first started, there were essentially manufacturing concerns

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:43.920
and they hired agents, outsiders to be their sales channel, and the first types of companies we had

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.790
made physical products and therefore, had physical channels--salespeople, stores, etc.,

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.550
but with the emergence of the web, we now have web and mobile channels.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.630
And so a choice for us is picking the right distribution channel.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.180
We're going to talk about physical versus web mobile channels.
