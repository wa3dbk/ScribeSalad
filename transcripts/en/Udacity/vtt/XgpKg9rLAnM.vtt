Back in the world of glasses wipers, Grant just found out that the situation

00:00:04.293 --> 00:00:08.736
with manufacturing cost is not quite as simple as he thought. He not only has to

00:00:08.748 --> 00:00:12.955
pay for materials to build his wipers, which remember, we figured out that one

00:00:12.967 --> 00:00:17.249
wiper set cost $6.50 to buy. He not only has to pay for materials to build his

00:00:17.261 --> 00:00:21.381
wipers, which you'll recall, we figured out that materials for one wiper set

00:00:21.393 --> 00:00:25.848
costs $6.50, he also has to pay for the factory space that he's using. This is

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.910
just a fixed amount, per month, of $1200. Taking this information into account,

00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:34.171
which one of these expressions do you think should replace the question mark to

00:00:34.183 --> 00:00:37.404
create an equation for the money that Grant spends each month?
