00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.240
As you can imagine, since data science is being deployed

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.090
in such a wide range of fields, data scientists use

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.710
many different tools, depending on the task at hand. One

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.630
of the most versatile and ubiquitous is a Python package called

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.780
Pandas, which we'll use in order to handle and manipulate

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.210
data during this course. You might wonder why we'll be using

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.860
Pandas, as opposed to another tool. Pandas allows us to

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.790
structure and manipulate our data in ways that are particularly well-suited

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.400
for data analysis. If you happen to be familiar with the scripting language, R,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.020
Pandas takes a lot of the best elements from R and implements them in Python.
