00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:09.449
If we first take 8 times 8 we get 64, and if we
calculate 12 times 12 we get 144. If we then add

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:17.800
these together, we get 64+144 are 208,
great. We will make sure that we give you

00:00:17.816 --> 00:00:21.419
plenty of opportunities throughout the
course to practice doing calculations like

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:24.509
this just in case you found this tricky.
