When performing the order of operations, we want to make sure we do

00:00:04.062 --> 00:00:08.992
multiplication first. So, I noticed that I have multiplication here and here. 2

00:00:09.086 --> 00:00:13.532
times 20 is 40, and 4 times 3 is 12. Now, we can keep working, I'm going to do

00:00:13.544 --> 00:00:18.423
my addition first, and then my subtraction. 1 plus 40 plus 5 makes 46, and then

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:21.953
I subtract 12, 46 minus 12 is 34. If you put 34, nice work.
