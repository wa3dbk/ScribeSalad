00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So we're going to go back to the live web app we were working in before.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is the main file we were using.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm not going to ask you to follow along with me anymore

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
because I'm going to be writing more code,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and it'll be tedious for you to try and keep up.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I'll try to type slowly, and we'll quiz as I go.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So the first thing we're going to do is adjust this file to work better for our needs.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So remember, we we're submitting to a different URL before.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We were submitting to /testform.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
That's when we were learning about multiple handlers.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We're going to get rid of that.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We're going to get rid of that action parameter,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and we're going to get rid of that whole handler.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We're not going to be using that anymore.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And we're also going to get rid of the URL reference to that handler.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We don't need that anymore.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So now I've simplified this file quite a bit.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We have our simple form that we were using before,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and we have our main handler that's mapped to by /.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
/ maps the MainPage. Here's MainPage with a get function.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And this get function just prints our form.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
This is a very simple example we started with from the very beginning.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Let's make sure this still works.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Here we are in our browser.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We've got our basic form. Everything is as we expected it.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Okay, let's go back to the Editor.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So instead of having this basic form of just a text field,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
we're going to make a form to ask somebody for their birthday.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So we can validate their inputs.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So let's get rid of this input.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and we're going to ask the user, what is your birthday?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We'll have a blank line.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Then we'll have 3 inputs--1 for the month, 1 for the day, and 1 for the year.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So I'll go ahead and add those.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So I've updated our form a little bit.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
It has a string, what is your birthday?, a blank line, 3 inputs, all of type text

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and they're named month, day, and year, 2 more blank lines,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and then our submit button.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Let's check how that looks in our browser.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Here we are in our browser.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
We've got our text, what is your birthday?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We've got our 3 inputs for month, day, and year, and our submit button.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I made the font a little bigger in the browser, so we could read it better.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Now this is not very clear what we're asking for.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Remember we have a solution for that though.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Let's add some labels so we can see month, day, and year next to our text inputs.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So here we are in our Editor again.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I'm going to add a few labels.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Okay, so all I did is, I added label elements like we did in the previous examples.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Here's an opening label, our old month input,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
some month text to appear next to our text input, and then the closing label.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I did that for each of these inputs--month, day, and year.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Let's see how that looks in our browser.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Okay, here we are in our browser.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I've reloaded it, and things are looking nice.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Now we can see that we're asking for the month, the day, and the year.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Now I'm going to type in some data here,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and I'd like you to tell me what you think is going to happen when I click submit.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So when I hit submit on that form, what do you think is going to happen?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Will the form clear?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Will we get an Error 405 because we never added a post() handler to /?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
We'll see the form values in the URL?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Or will the app count down to my birthday?
