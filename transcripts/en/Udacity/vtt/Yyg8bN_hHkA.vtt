00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.230
The Android 5.0 introduced
a new tool bar widget.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.050
This generalization of the action bar
pattern, gives you much more control and

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.520
flexibility.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.010
Tool bars of view and your hierarchy
just like any other, making it easier to

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.850
interweave with the rest of your hues,
animate and react to scroll events.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.070
Many Androids apps now have two or
more tool bars.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.810
As in this example.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.950
Toolbars are made particularly
important, because of the design rule

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.080
that we aren't supposed to split a
toolbar with another piece of material.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.360
This means we often
need multiple toolbars.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.090
Fortunately, we have a fully
functional version that has been

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.150
built as part of the Android
support library.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.710
In order to make use of toolbar, we need
to first change our application to use

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.980
a theme that doesn't add
an action bar on our behalf.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.810
I'm going to create a base toolbar
style, that gives it a background color.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.750
Toolbars have transparent
backgrounds by default.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.170
We'll also make sure that we're
using the light pop up theme.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.060
This will be important when
you set the toolbars to

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.120
the dark theme in our layouts.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.760
That we can have a little more light
colored text that will pop against our

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.330
dark background.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.250
I can make all of my
toolbars get this new style,

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.970
by placing a toolbar
style in the app theme.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.930
Then you just add
the toolbar into our layout.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.080
Note that I'm setting the size to
be the standard action bar size

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.900
from the current theme,
using the ?attr notation.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.640
And I'm setting the theme to
be the overlay theme for dark.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.650
This will nicely style
us with light text.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.100
Finally, I can make the toolbar
behave like an action bar.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.280
By setting into the activity
using setSupportActionBar.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.090
Once it's there, I can apply action bar
styling to it using getSupportActionBar.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.060
I could use these functions
to get the icon back, but

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.310
I want to demonstrate one other
cool thing about toolbar.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.600
It contains a view group
that you can customize.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.470
This view group is like an even
more simple frame layout.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.310
So we could add our logo back
to the toolbar this way.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.570
This level of control,

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.410
becomes useful as we continue
to work towards our new design.
