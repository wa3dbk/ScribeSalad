00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.850
So to do that, we have to think about

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.510
pictures as of not just a collection
of pixels, but actually as a graph.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.390
And what I mean by
a graph is shown here.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:16.450
So, in the graph we have a,
a node for every pixel, okay?

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.530
And between every pair of
pixels is a link, okay?

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.320
Just as in any other graph,
those are the edges of our graph, right?

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.890
And on each edge, there's what's
referred to as an affinity weight, or

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.930
just a weight, and
here that's written as wpq, all right?

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.827
And the idea is that I'm
going to need an edge for

00:00:38.827 --> 00:00:41.125
any weight that is nonzero, okay?

00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:47.042
And the weight is going to measure
the similarity between two pixels.

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:50.908
And the two, and the similarity will be
essentially inversely proportional to

00:00:50.908 --> 00:00:52.110
the difference.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.140
So that just means that the,
the more different they are,

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.520
the less similar they are.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.650
And another way of saying it is
if the difference is too big,

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.280
I'm going to say the similarity is zero.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.120
So those edges go away.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.590
So I'm going to build a,
a weight matrix, using this affinity.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.510
So I, a standard affinity, for

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.750
example, might be that I'm just
going to use a Gaussian, right?

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.440
Where I say the,
the affinity between two pixels, i and

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.970
j, is just this exponentiation,
as a function,

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.870
just as exponentiation as
a function of the distance.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.120
So of course, there is a parameter here.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.029
And here, you can see the change in
affinity depending upon what that

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:30.500
parameter is you get
these different curves.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.740
And essentially if you use a very small
sigma this thing goes, grows quickly.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.410
So in which case, only nearby pixels
get any reasonable affinity at all.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.630
Whereas if you have a large sigma,
you can connect,

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.690
you can have strong infinities in
between points that are somewhat far

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.480
away, far away in your distance space.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.030
So if your distance includes just color,
then it would be that.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.020
But typically, our distance is also
going to include actual distance.
