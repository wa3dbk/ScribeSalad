00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.404
Let's imagine that these spectrums of
questions really do line up with not

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:08.285
just easy and hardness, but
actually line up with understanding.

00:00:08.285 --> 00:00:10.585
Which is sort of the assumption
that we made, right?

00:00:10.585 --> 00:00:13.445
That anyone can answer the easy
questions, but as you know more,

00:00:13.445 --> 00:00:15.240
you can answer the hard questions.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.930
That means the chance of
you being able to sort of,

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.470
these questions are aligned, not just in
terms of easy and hard, they're actually

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.650
aligned with some underlying
notion of what you actually know.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.994
That your knowledge is, which I'm
just writing as understanding here.

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:28.573
&gt;&gt; Okay
&gt;&gt; Okay,

00:00:28.573 --> 00:00:32.444
now furthermore let's imagine you're
understanding were here, okay?

00:00:32.444 --> 00:00:35.600
This is really where you are on
this understanding scale.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.370
&gt;&gt; Where Curly is.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.413
&gt;&gt; That's where Curly is.

00:00:37.413 --> 00:00:40.070
&gt;&gt; Okay,
in this linear scale of knowledge

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah so this linear scale of

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.380
knowledge about dinosaurs that
apparently requires some background in

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.730
calculus, you're basically
here on this linear scale.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.450
Well what would that mean for
you to be right here.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.440
Well it probably means that for
questions way over here,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.910
those really are easy for you and
you'll always get them right.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.430
And for questions way out here,
they're too hard for you and

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.519
you're probably going to get them,
almost certainly get them wrong.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.730
But one of the interesting things about
being right at some particular level of

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.620
understanding is that
you will occasionally

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.110
get some of these things just on this
side of your understanding right.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.930
And you will occasionally get
things just on this side of

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.580
your understanding wrong.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.170
Really kind of understanding is
like a probability function.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.228
And I'm going to pretend it's Gaussian,

00:01:23.228 --> 00:01:25.590
because that's what we
do in machine learning.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.230
And just kind of say the probability

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.080
of you getting a question right depends
upon where your understanding is.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.145
And as you move far in one direction
you will always, always get them right.

00:01:36.145 --> 00:01:38.918
Far in another direction you will
always, always get them wrong, but

00:01:38.918 --> 00:01:41.704
right around your level of
understanding there's some noise there.

00:01:41.704 --> 00:01:44.539
And you'll sometimes get the ones that
are just beyond your understanding

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:47.800
right, and sometimes get the things that
are just below your understanding wrong.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.090
We actually talked about this in
the machine learning class you might

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.840
remember when we talked about self
play and learning how to play games.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.110
Do you remember this?

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.870
&gt;&gt; Was it a racquetball example?

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.400
&gt;&gt; Right we used
a Racquetball example and

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.610
we talked about how if you play someone
who is much much better than you

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.490
are then basically you never learn
anything because you always lose.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.770
&gt;&gt; That's like the hard questions.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.195
&gt;&gt; Those are like the hard questions.

00:02:08.195 --> 00:02:11.235
And if you play someone
you're much much better then

00:02:11.235 --> 00:02:13.035
you also never learn anything
because you always win.

00:02:13.035 --> 00:02:14.255
&gt;&gt; That's like the easy questions.

00:02:14.255 --> 00:02:17.285
&gt;&gt; Right, and in fact the right thing
to do is to play someone who's just

00:02:17.285 --> 00:02:18.143
a little bit better or

00:02:18.143 --> 00:02:21.320
just a little bit worse than you
that is right around where you are.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.290
And then you'll actually learn something
because the exploration makes sense.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.530
And sometimes you get positive feedback,
sometimes you get negative feedback, and

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.990
you learn how to modify your actions and
to learn.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.100
&gt;&gt; Okay, that makes sense to me.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.130
&gt;&gt; Right, and so
by analogy that's what's happening here.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.080
If I can give you questions right around
where your level of understanding is,

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.730
then you might learn something.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.880
&gt;&gt; Good.
&gt;&gt; So given that highfalutin boughten

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.850
taking it all the way
back to racquetball.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.800
What do you think a good
set of incentives might be?

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.610
&gt;&gt; I don't know I mean it's like,
what I wanted to say was,

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.150
well you want to be getting
like half of them right.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.230
And so we could pay off the teacher.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.900
Well we I guess we pay the learner off
for getting things right because that's

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.990
really what the learner
should be striving for.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.025
But we can pay off the teacher for
keeping things around a half.

00:03:02.025 --> 00:03:04.791
But that doesn't really make sense
because then the teacher could do like

00:03:04.791 --> 00:03:07.154
I'm just going to randomly choose
from a really easy problem or

00:03:07.154 --> 00:03:09.410
a really hard problem, and
on average that will be a half.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.680
So it'll really not be asking any
questions that are in that happy zone.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.360
&gt;&gt; That's good so actually what
you just said is pretty important.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.060
&gt;&gt; And it seems like a really bad idea.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.180
&gt;&gt; No,
no it's actually really important.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.440
You said something really important.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.750
Let me point what you said.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.200
You said that if I tried to pick
a half or any distribution really.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.832
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:25.832 --> 00:03:29.060
&gt;&gt; Then he teacher can
always just choose questions

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.840
to kind of get that distribution.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.750
And sometimes they'll be incentivized
to, I'll just pick easy ones or

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.580
hard ones where I know I'm going to
get the distribution that I want.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.030
And that sort of misses the point.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.880
But what if I don't allow you to
pick the question what if instead

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.650
I require you to tell
me where this line is?
