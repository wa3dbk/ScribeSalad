00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.500
So how do we identify who
the owner in the group are?

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.230
If we look back at our
directory listing,

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.480
we'll see two columns,
here in the middle.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.680
Most of the entries read
student student, but

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.160
there's one here that reads root root,
and I'll come back to that one.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.110
These two columns identify the owner and
the group for each entry in this list.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.520
Now it's important to remember, although
each of these has the same word,

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.100
student, listed in the two columns,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.070
they're in two entirely
different things.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.880
The system has a username student,
which is the owner of the file.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.260
And a group name student,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.728
which was automatically created
when we made this user.

00:00:35.728 --> 00:00:39.330
This is pre-common practice
on a Linux system,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.910
to have a group name
the same as the user.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.090
Just remember that they are two
entirely different things.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.980
So, what's up with this entry
here that has root root?

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.800
We can see that the entry's name is ..,
and that's just a shortcut for

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.390
the parent directory.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.385
And we know we're in our
student's home directory.

00:00:56.385 --> 00:01:00.730
So this entry here,
is the equivalent of /home.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.010
That directory is owned by the root
user, and has a group of root.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.350
And if we look at the permissions,

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.080
we see that only the root user
can write to that directory.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.260
let's test this out for ourselves.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.272
I'll move into the directory using cd..

00:01:16.272 --> 00:01:17.590
And then I'll try to write a file.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.240
You'll get a permission denied error,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.150
just as this permission
system told us we would.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.340
Only root is allowed to
write in this directory.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.110
And our current user's
definitely not root.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.040
We can still list the files in this
directory, because we have read access,

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.400
and we even entered the directory
because we have execute.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.903
We just can't write.
