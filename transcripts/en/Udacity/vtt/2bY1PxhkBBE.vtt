00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.810
So we write the program as a truly parallel program, or in other words,

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.920
the application programmer is going to think

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.440
about his application and write the program as

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.290
an explicitly parallel program. And there are

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.920
two styles of writing explicitly parallel programs. And

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.330
correspondingly, system support for those two tiles

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.580
of explicitly pavalled programs. One is called message

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.690
passing style of explicitly pavalled program. The

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.430
run time system is going to provide a message

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.430
passing laterally which has primitives for. An

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.130
application thread to do sends and receives to

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.660
its peers that are executing on other

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.380
nodes of the cluster. So this message passing

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.830
style of explicitly parallel program is true to

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.650
the physical nature of the cluster. The physical

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.400
nature of the cluster is the fact that

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.320
every processor has its private memory. And this memory

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.330
is not shared across all the processors. So

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.440
the only way a processor can communicate with, another

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.840
processor is by sending a message through the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.650
network that this processor can receive. This processor cannot

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.400
directly reach into the memory of this processor. Because

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.680
that is not the way a cluster is architected.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.050
So, the messaging passing library is true

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.860
to the physical nature of the cluster. That

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.070
there is no physically shared memory. And

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.790
lots of examples of message passing libraries that

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.980
have been written to support explicit parallel

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.950
programming. In a cluster they include MPI, message

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.510
passing interface, MPI for short, PVM, CLF

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.990
from digital equipment corporations. So these are all

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.320
examples of message passing libraries that have been built with the intent of

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.430
allowing application programmer to write explicitly parallel

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.400
programs using this message passing style. And

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.350
to this day, many scientific applications

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.300
running on large scale clusters in national

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.400
labs like Lawrence Livermore, and Argonne National

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.110
Labs and so on, use this style

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.669
of programming using MPI as the message

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.895
passing fabric. Now, the only downside to the

00:02:11.895 --> 00:02:15.350
message-passing style of programming is that it is

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.190
difficult to program using this style. If you're

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.150
a programmer who's written sequential programs, the transitions

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.560
paths to writing an explicitly parallel program is

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.940
easier if there is this. Notion of shared

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.190
memory, because it is natural to think of

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.300
shared data structures among different threads of

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.180
an application. And that's the reason making the

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.560
transition from sequential program to parallel programming, using

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.490
for instance the P thread library or SMP

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.680
is fairly intuitive and easy pathway. On

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.160
the other hand, If the programmer has to

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.310
think in terms of coordinating the activities on

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.600
different processes by explicitly descending and desisting messages

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.320
from their peers. That is calling for a failuratical change

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.600
of thinking in terms of how to structure a program.
