00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here's my solution--I defined a function "search,"

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
which is the only function I'm going to run in the end. It's like the main routine.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
To check cells once they're expanded so we don't expand them again,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I define an array called "closed" as the same size as my grid,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and it has two values, 0 and 1--0 being it's still open, 1 meaning it's being closed.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
You could also use Booleans.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This over here assigns an array of the same size as the field grid.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I initialize the starting location as checked

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and assign the coordinates to x, y, and a g-value of 0.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
My initial open list is going to be just 1 element of my initial coordinates and the g value of 0.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So far what I've done is I've defined a array called closed of the same size.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
All the check marks are not there except for the ones in the left corner,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and this is my starting location in my open list right over here with a g-value of 0.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Inside my code I use two flags--one is found,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
which will be true when the goal position is found, and one is resign,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
which will be true if I don't find a goal position and I've explored everything.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The second one will be the case when my open list just turns empty without finding the goal.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
That's really important for the case where I can't find a path to the goal.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Those print commands were the ones I used to debugging.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
You can look at them. They print out the existing open list. Nothing else.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
But here is the code.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I repeat the following while I haven't found a path to the goal

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and I haven't proven that the problem is unsolvable.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Both found and resign are false.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
If my open list is empty, there's nothing to expand, then resign is true, and I print "fail."

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
This is one of the 2 terminating conditions.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You can convince yourself there's no path from S to G.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
You'll expand every node on the left side

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
of the barrier until we finally run out of nodes to expand

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
at which point the open list will be empty, and our search failed.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
If there is still elements in the open list, the else case comes into place.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Here is how I remove the element with the smallest g-value.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I use the list sort function, which sorts elements in increasing order

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
from the smallest g-value up.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Now I want to pop the element with the smallest number.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Unfortunately pop pops at the end, so I'll just reverse the list

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and then pop the element with the smallest g-value from that list.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
There's a little bit of a trick here. It's not very elegant.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It's also not very efficient, but it does the job for now.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
That here gets me the element with the smallest g-value.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
For that it's important that the g-value comes first in each of the triplet's.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
That's why I put it first, right before the x and the y.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I then assign the 3 values to x, y, and g, which is my expansion.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Again, g is the first, x and y are the second and third.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Now I'm in the position to test whether I reach the goal.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
If x is the goal 0 and y is the goal 1, I'm done. I call found equals True.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I print out this triplet, and that gives me the triplet over here.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
This "print next" over here is this triplet and that's the one I was looking for,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
asking you about printing exactly this solution over here.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Now, if I'm not done yet, then here's the interesting case.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
That's the meat of what I'm programming.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I'm going through all the possible actions. There are 4 of them.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Delta is an array of 4 different actions.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I apply the action to x and y with this addition over here

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
by applying the corresponding delta vector to construct x2 and y2.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:48.000
If x2 falls into the grid and y2 falls into the grid and [x2, y2] is not yet checked,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
which is tested by this field called "closed,"

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and the grid cell is navigable--there is no obstacle here.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
If all these things are correct, then I found an expansion that I now add to the open list.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I increment the cost from g to g2 by adding 1. In this case, cost is 1.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Then I append the new [g2, x2, y2] to my open list,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and I check the coordinate [x2, y2] so I never expand it again.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
That is the recursion.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Put differently, when I drew down this element over here, for example,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
I looked at possible ways the robot could move.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
In my software, this means the robot has to stay inside the grid,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and the grid cell has to be unoccupied, which is this test over here.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I also check whether there was already a check mark by the cell,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
which is this test over here. It is always true.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
I added the new element to my open list

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
with the new g-value incremented and the new coordinates.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
That is exactly happening over here.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
I increment the g-value, and I add it with the new coordinates.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
This is the key of a search algorithm.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
The only remaining thing now is that I call the search routine

00:05:01.000 --> 99:59:59.999
that prints me out this thing over here.
