00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.300
Let's take a look at a generic router

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.030
architecture. As a summary of basic router function, a

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.660
router receives a packet. It then looks at the

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.440
packet header, to determine the packet's destination. It looks

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.770
in the forwarding table, to determine the appropriate, output

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.630
interface for the packet. It modifies the packet header,

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.680
such as decrementing the time to live field and

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.200
updating the IP header check sum appropriately. And finally,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.140
it sends the packet to the appropriate output

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.370
interface. The basic I/O component of a router architecture

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.390
is the line card, which is the interface by

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.670
which a router sends and receives data. When a

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.330
packet arrives, the line card looks at the header

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.550
to determine the destination, and then it looks in

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.056
the forwarding table. To determine the output interface. It

00:00:47.056 --> 00:00:50.206
then, updates the packet header, and finally, sends the

00:00:50.206 --> 00:00:53.490
packet to the appropriate output interface. Now this

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.405
drawing shows just a single line card. But in

00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:59.393
fact, when the packet is sent to the output

00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:04.539
interface, it must traverse the router's interconnection fabric, to

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:07.588
be sent to the appropriate output port. So

00:01:07.588 --> 00:01:10.363
in fact, we can zoom out from that depiction

00:01:10.363 --> 00:01:15.238
of a single line card, and what we have, is a bunch of line cards, that are all

00:01:15.238 --> 00:01:18.941
connected via an interconnection fabric. Each of these

00:01:18.941 --> 00:01:22.139
line cards has a lookup table, the capability to

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:25.883
modify headers, and a queue, or buffer, for packets,

00:01:25.883 --> 00:01:28.607
as they enter and leave the line card. In

00:01:28.607 --> 00:01:31.775
other lessons, we talk about several important questions. Such

00:01:31.775 --> 00:01:34.699
as how big queues should be and how lookup

00:01:34.699 --> 00:01:37.299
works. In the rest of this lesson, I'll discuss

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.740
important decisions in router design. Such as, the placement

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.770
of lookup tables on each line card and the design of the interconnection fabric.
