00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.698
Our first shot at multiplying each of the terms in the first expression by every

00:00:04.698 --> 00:00:09.600
term in the second set of parenthesis, gives us this long disgusting expression.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.206
But wait, maybe it's not really that gross, let's take a closer look. When we

00:00:14.206 --> 00:00:18.805
notice which terms we have that are like terms, we see a minus y squared z and a

00:00:18.805 --> 00:00:23.620
plus y squared z. So these directly cancel each other out. We do the same thing

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.878
with the other 2 middle terms positive yz squared and negative yz squared. All

00:00:28.878 --> 00:00:34.300
that we're left with in the end is a really simple expression, then. This long

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.473
factorized form is actually just equal to the sum of 2 cubes. Y cubed plus z

00:00:39.473 --> 00:00:43.698
cubed. This is really incredible. Math is just so gorgeous.
