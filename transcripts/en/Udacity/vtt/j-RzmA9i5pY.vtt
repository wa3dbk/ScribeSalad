00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.020
We've updated the rock,

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.870
paper, scissors app so that it keeps a
running history of each match you play.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:05.470
The challenge for

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.530
this lesson is to add an additional
view with a table to show the history.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.961
This is one example of how
the completed app could look.

00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:15.660
Note that the challenge combines
the material of the past two lessons.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.080
We'll segue to a new view and
the new view will be a table.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.320
Let's take a look at
the code that's been added.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.840
Here you can see that
the RockPaperScissorsViewController

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.980
has a new property,
an array named history.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.730
We know that this array is going to be
filled up with results from matches.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.250
Let's find where the matches
are being added.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.150
Here in the throwDown method,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.100
in this line, you can see where
the matches are being added.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.040
The history array will be
the model that drives the table.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.283
The model that determines
the number of rows, etc.

00:00:45.283 --> 00:00:47.840
Right now the history
table is kind of bare.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.670
The cells are using the right detail
cell without adding an image.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.830
For the challenge up you're free
to create any cell you want.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.170
You can create images for winning and
losing, different text sizes, fonts.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.170
Go nuts!

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.260
If you are interested in adding
your own custom cell views,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.470
in the next section we have a few notes
to steer you in the right direction.
