That was an example of one type of memory, but there are three types of memory.

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:08.899
The first type of memory is called Sensory memory, do you remember back in

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:14.194
lesson three the brain lesson? And also our sensation and perception lesson,

00:00:14.194 --> 00:00:18.698
how we talked about our different sensory systems? And how they're stimulated

00:00:18.698 --> 00:00:23.922
by the things that we smell, taste, touch, feel, hear and experience. Sensory

00:00:23.922 --> 00:00:27.506
memory is made of the brief traces of the sensation left by the firing neurons

00:00:27.506 --> 00:00:31.911
in the brain. These traces don't last very long sometimes a half a second or up

00:00:31.911 --> 00:00:36.345
to two to three seconds. Nos, sensation is the first step in our ability to

00:00:36.345 --> 00:00:40.365
create long term memories, now there's two types of sensory memories let's talk

00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:42.909
about those next.
