00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.670
let's try one of these out together to see what happens. How about one of these

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:09.604
more difficult ones. Let's say g of g inverse of x. g of x is 1 4th times the

00:00:09.604 --> 00:00:14.910
quantity x minus 9. So in place of x, we need to plug in the function g

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:23.978
inverse, which is 4 x plus 9. So, look at 4 4th times 4x plus 9 minus 9. What

00:00:23.978 --> 00:00:28.530
does this simplify to? Inside the parentheses, we just end up with 4x and 1 4th

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:34.198
times 4x is equal to x. Hmm, I'm going to go through and find all these other

00:00:34.198 --> 00:00:39.660
compositions right now. Let's see what happens. And it looks like each of these

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.791
composite functions is in fact just equal to x. This confirms another

00:00:43.791 --> 00:00:48.571
fascinating property of inverse functions. The composition of a function with

00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:52.111
its inverse and vice versa will both give us what is known as the identity

00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:58.123
function. It's just the independent variable, which in this case is x. So,

00:00:58.123 --> 00:01:01.966
another way to think about inverse functions is that the function f inverse

00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:07.542
will undo whatever the function f has done to the independent variable. In this

00:01:07.542 --> 00:01:12.050
case, f is adding one and f inverse is subtracting one. Here, g is subtracting

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.485
9 and then dividing by 4. And g inverse is multiplying by 4 and then adding 9.

00:01:17.485 --> 00:01:23.012
Lastly, h cubes and h inverse takes the cube root. I think we're really getting

00:01:23.012 --> 00:01:25.592
down to what it fundamentally means for functions to be inverses for one

00:01:25.592 --> 00:01:27.930
another. That's really awesome.
