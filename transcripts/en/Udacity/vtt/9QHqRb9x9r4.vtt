00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:05.601
First, we'll talk about inter-rater reliability. First, the rater has to know

00:00:05.601 --> 00:00:10.515
the ratee well ,for a long period of time and have observed the person in many

00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:17.724
different situations. Second, ideally we would have many different raters rate

00:00:17.724 --> 00:00:24.373
the personality of an individual to reduce or avoid bias. With children or even

00:00:24.373 --> 00:00:29.521
animals who cannot read their own personalities we need to have observers rate

00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:36.197
personality. Traits such as introvert, extravert, anxious, worrying, friendly,

00:00:36.197 --> 00:00:41.007
warm and dependable for example, have particular behaviors associated with

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:46.567
them. But rating other people's personality is not as simple as it may first

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:52.178
seem. As we just mentioned, the rater must know the person well, and we need

00:00:52.178 --> 00:00:58.232
inter-rater reliability, that is, consistency between different raters. For

00:00:58.232 --> 00:01:02.264
example, if someone is deemed hostile by one person and friendly by another

00:01:02.264 --> 00:01:07.150
person, then we do not have a reliable reading of personality.
