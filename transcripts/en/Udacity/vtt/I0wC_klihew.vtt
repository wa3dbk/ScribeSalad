00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.770
So we have come across this high level architecture for deliberation earlier.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.800
Today we will talk about a specific cognitive architecture for deliberation.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.440
This architecture is called SOAR. I should mention that SOAR not only

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.090
covers deliberation, SOAR can also cover certain aspects of reaction, and some

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.840
aspects of meta cognition. But we are going to focus mostly on the deliberation

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.890
component and so on. SOAR was initiated by Allen Neville, John Lear, and

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.750
Paul Rosenbloom. And John Lear and Paul Rosenbloom have been working on it for

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.540
the last 30 years or so. The highest level consists of a long term memory and

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.690
a working memory. The [INAUDIBLE] itself contains different kinds of knowledge.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.700
In particular SOAR talks about three kinds of knowledge. Procedural, semantic,

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.500
and episodic. Episodic knowledge has to do with events.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.580
Specific instances of events, like, what did you have for dinner yesterday.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.530
Semantic knowledge has to do with generalizations in the form of concepts and

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.350
models of the world. For example, your concept of a human being, or

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.450
your model of how a plane flies in the air.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.570
Procedural has to do with how to do certain things. So as an example, how do you

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.530
pour water from a jug into a tumbler. Notice that this makes an architecture.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.930
There are different components that are interacting with each other.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.210
This arrangement of components will afford certain processes of reasoning and

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.550
learning. That's exactly the kind of processes of reasoning and

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.320
learning that we'll look at next.
