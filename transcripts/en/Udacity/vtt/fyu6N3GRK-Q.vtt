00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.197
If we're thinking of x plus 3 squared minus 6, as being in the form a squared

00:00:05.197 --> 00:00:10.382
minus b squared, then in our case a is equal to x plus 3, and b is just equal to

00:00:10.382 --> 00:00:15.812
the square root of 6, since the square root of 6 squared is just 6. That means

00:00:15.812 --> 00:00:21.089
that to factor this we need to take this minus this times this plus this. So,

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:26.948
this is our final answer, y equals the quantity x plus 3 minus the square root

00:00:26.948 --> 00:00:31.334
of 6 times the quantity x plus 3 plus the square root of 6.
