00:00:00.067 --> 00:00:03.859
So,let's make sure we understand BFS and the problem that we're going to solve.

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:08.618
If we have a graph, an arbitrary graph with n nodes, what is the minimum possible

00:00:08.618 --> 00:00:13.364
maximum depth of that graph, and what is the maximum possible maximum depth of that graph?

00:00:13.364 --> 00:00:17.016
And by that I mean we can draw any graph we want, okay?

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:21.891
And we would like to draw it to minimize the biggest number that we write in here.

00:00:21.891 --> 00:00:25.402
Or we'd like to draw a different graph with N nodes and we'd like to

00:00:25.402 --> 00:00:28.125
maximize the biggest number that we write in here.

00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:30.560
So, I'd like you to express these as functions of N.
