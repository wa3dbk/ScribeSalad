00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.160
To get the constant term to be on the left side instead of the right side, we

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.509
just need to subtract 15 from both sides. This gets rid of it on the right and

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:12.888
makes this so we have a new constant on the left. Now we're left with y minus 15

00:00:12.888 --> 00:00:14.421
equals x squared minus 8x.
