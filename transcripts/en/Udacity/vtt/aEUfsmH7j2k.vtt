00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now let's put them all together into a single piece of software.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Upfront it took me about a whole day to do this.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm not going to ask you to do it all yourself,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
because it's going to cost you probably at least an hour if it takes me a day.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But I still want to be able to take all the lessons that we did together into a single system.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm going to help you a little bit--bits and pieces--

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
but up front here is the environment that I wrote for you,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
which is very much derived from the environment we studied in the past.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We have a class robot that has certain kinds of noise characteristics you can find over here.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:47.000
As I scroll down, you can see the familiar init function, the position-setting function,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
the set_noise function, and then we have two checking functions--

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
whether we have a collision with the world called "grid," which I will show you in a minute.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and we have a check_goal function to see if we reached a goal

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
according to a certain distance threshold.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The move function should be very familiar at this point.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
It applies noise to the motion command.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It the same code that you originally wrote.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Then we have a very simple sense function, which measures the robot's (x, y) location,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000
similar to a GPS on a car but with substantial measurement noise.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Corresponding to this sense function we have a measurement probability function

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
that you might want to use in your filter, and it evaluates the probability

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
of a measurement relative to the ground truth coordinates of the robot using Gaussians.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Armed with all this here is the problem.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I'm going to give you a grid. Here is an example grid. Let me draw this for you.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
This specific one happens to be of dimensions 6 and 5,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and there are a number of blocked off cells like this.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
If we look carefully into the code, you'll find information about the initial starting location

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
on the left upper corner and the goal location, which is the bottom right corner.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
In putting everything together, you're going to build a robotic car using our bicycle model

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
that'll drive through the free space through the continuous free space

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
on something close to the shortest path all the way into the goal.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Here is my solution that I implemented

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and that you will get to see for the most part towards the end of this class.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I am starting up over here. These are my obstacles.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
They implement as circles through the center of these grid cells.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
It's not exactly correct but good enough for my implementation.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Here are multiple runs using the same code, and you can see they're far from optimal.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
They are non-optimal because there is control noise,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and there is also measurement noise.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000
But they all make it safely through free space into the corner where the goal objective is.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
If we look at them in detail, like this solution over here.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
You'll find that the spacing of the circles is somewhat variable.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
You'll find that there's little corners over here that are either the result of control noise

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
or of measurement noise or of my somewhat deficient implementation.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
You'll also find the control set points that are the smooth points of my A-star planner

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
as shown here in green.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
In the version that I implemented for you, the controller does something very, very different.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
It actually chooses as the control objective to head straight to the goal,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
using the atan2 function, executes the action at a speed of 0.1,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and then reports a collision whenever the robot is moving.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Just looking down to the output where we see the robot's coordinates

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
along with the orientation there are very frequent collisions

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
that the robot undergoes in its attempt to reach the goal,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
which it eventually does, but you can see 2 big regions of collisions

00:04:01.000 --> 09:59:59.000
until the goal is finally reached.
