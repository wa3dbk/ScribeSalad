00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.900
This course is more than just lessons. There's problem sets, a final

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.990
project, and a whole community of other people just like you taking

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.710
this course. You'll find the problem sets at the end of each

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.290
lesson. The purpose of these is to give you a chance to

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.490
practice the skills that you learned in the previous lesson. After you

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.530
finish all the lessons, you're going to create a final project, which is

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.350
an app of your choosing that you're going to build, with all those

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.320
things that you've learned. Finally, there's

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.590
the community. If you ever get stuck,

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.200
or just want to chat about your incredible app

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.400
ideas, you can go to the discussion forum.
