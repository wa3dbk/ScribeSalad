00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For this question, we're just going to discuss threat models and the one-time pad from Unit 1.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In order to know that a one-time pad provides confidentiality,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
which of these do we need to assume about the adversary?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Is it necessary that an attacker has limited computational power?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Is it necessary that the attacker doesn't know anything about the key?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Or it is necessary that the attacker cannot modify the message?

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check all that apply.
