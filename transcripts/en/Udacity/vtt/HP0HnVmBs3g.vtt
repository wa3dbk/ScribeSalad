00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What we need is something called oblivious transfer, and in particular,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
we need what we'll call "one-out-of-two oblivious transfer"

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and what that means is Alice can create two values, X0 and X1.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Bob will obtain one of those values, but Alice doesn't learn which one Bob learned.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Bob can only obtain one of the two values but Alice doesn't know which one Bob obtained.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
There are lots of different protocols that provide this.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The one I'm going to describe was invented by Even, Goldreich, and Lempel in 1985.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It builds on RSA encryption and we're going to look at it

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
as we need to use it in the garbled circuit protocol.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Our goal is that Alice has two wire labels; this correspond to the inputs to some gate,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and she wants to transfer one of them to Bob without revealing the other one.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We're going to use Alice's public key.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We'll assume that is known to Bob before the protocol starts.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Our goal is to transfer one of these two wire labels to Bob.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The first step is to create two random values.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
These are separate from the wire labels. These are going to be transferred to Bob.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
These have no meaning. They're just two random nonces created by Alice.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Depending on which wire label Bob wants, Bob has some input either zero or one.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
He's going to pick either the first or the second of these. So, he is going to pick Xb.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Is it equal to either X0 or X1, depending on his value of b.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Then Bob will pick some random value r. Bob is going to use this to blind the response.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
He can allow Alice to learn whether he pick X0 or X1. That would reveal his input.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
What he's going to do instead is use this random value to blind the response.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
He'll compute this new value, which is the value of the X that he selected

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
plus the random value raised to that public exponent modn.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
We're going to hide the value of Xb by adding a random value raised to the e power to it.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
That value is what sent back to Alice, and Alice is going to perform two different RSA decryptions.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
She knows the values that she selected for X0 and X1.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
She's going to subtract each of those from V.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
She'll decrypt it using her private key and we'll call the first one K0,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
that was the one constructed using X0, and the second one, K1,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
that was the one constructed using X1.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
The question is if b selected, what is it's input?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
That means b has the value for Xb is equal to X1.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
What are the values of K0 and K1? Select the best answer for each choice.

00:02:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
It could be meaningless, it could match X0, X1, or r.
