A lot of teachers have to add up all their students scores to calculate final

00:00:03.557 --> 00:00:07.263
grades. When I was in middle school a lot of my teachers had a paper grade

00:00:07.263 --> 00:00:10.463
book, but by putting scores into a computer, teachers might save themselves

00:00:10.463 --> 00:00:15.029
some work. We're going to build a HomeworkScores class that will read all of

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:19.467
the scores for one student and give useful summaries of their work. Eventually

00:00:19.467 --> 00:00:23.460
it will be able to calculate the total and average scores, and drop the lowest.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.732
But first it needs to read the scores for one student. I started the class for

00:00:26.732 --> 00:00:30.557
you. It'll save the scores in an array of doubles, which will be partially

00:00:30.557 --> 00:00:34.167
filled. We'll allow the teacher to enter whatever number of scores they feel

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:37.320
like. Let's not worry about re-sizing for right now, we'll just make the array

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.490
very big to start with. Before I ask you to implement the readScores method I

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.848
want to show you one more thing that's going to help.
