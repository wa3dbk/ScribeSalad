00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Narrator] Now let's look into particle filters, the subject of today's class,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and it's really interesting to see the answers for particle filters.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
First, the state space for particle filters is usually continuous.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So, you can get into the more interesting version of state spaces,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but we're not confined to unimodal distributions.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We can actually represent arbitrarily multimodal distributions.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
They are also approximate just like the other 2 filters,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and in terms of efficiency the world is still out there.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
In certain incarnations, they clearly scale exponentially,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and it is a mistake to represent particle filters over anything more than say 4 dimensions.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But in other domains, mostly in tracking domains,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
they tend to scale much, much better, and I've not seen a good treatment

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
yet of the complexity in practice for particle filters.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
However, the key advantage of particle filters

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
is actually none of those things over here.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The key advantage, at least in my life, has been

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
they're really easy to program.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
As you hopefully see today,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
writing a particle filter is really, really easy.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
In fact, you will write your own particle filter for a continuous value localization problem,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
which is in many ways more difficult than any of the problems we talked about before.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So, let's dive in and see a particle filter in action.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So, here is a floor plan of an environment

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
where a robot is located and it has to perform what's called global localization,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
which is it has no clue where it is and it has to find out

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
where it is just based on sensor measurements.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
This provides his range sensors as indicated by the blue stripes

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
those use sonar sensors, which means sound, to range the distance of nearer obstacles,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and it has to use these range sensors to determine a good posterior distribution as to where it is.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
What the robot doesn't know it's starting in the middle of the corridor.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
In fact, it is completely uncertain as to where it is.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Now, the particle filter represents this using particles.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Each of these red dots of which there are several thousand here

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
is a discrete guess where the robot might be.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
It's structured as an X coordinate, a Y coordinate, and also a heading direction,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and these 3 values together comprise a single guess,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
but a single guess is not a filter.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
It is the set of several thousands of such guesses

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
that together comprise an approximate representation for the posterior of the robot.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So, let's start the video.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
In the beginning the particles are uniformly spread,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
but the particle filter makes them survive

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
in proportion of how consistent 1 of these particles is with a sensor measurement.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Very quickly the robot has figured out it's in the corridor, but 2 clouds survive

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
because of the symmetry of the corridor.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
As the robot then enters 1 of the offices,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
the symmetry is broken and the correct set of particles survive.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Let me play this again.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
The essence of particle filters is to have

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
these particles guess where the robot might be moving,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
but also have them survive using effectively survival of the fittest

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
so that particles that are more consistent with the measurements

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
are more likely to survive and as a result

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
places of high probability will collect more particles,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and therefore be more representative of the robot's posterior belief.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Those particles together--those thousands of particles

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
are now clustered in a single location.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Those comprise the approximate belief of the robot as it localizes itself.
