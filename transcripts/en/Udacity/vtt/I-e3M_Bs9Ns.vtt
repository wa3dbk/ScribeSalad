00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.240
Let's have a little bit
more fun with operators.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.970
We'll start by using just
literals to demonstrate but

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.610
these operators work with variables,

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.885
constants and if you're accessing struct
property values like we've seen so far.

00:00:11.885 --> 00:00:14.473
First, let's add two numbers together.

00:00:14.473 --> 00:00:17.165
And as you expect, 5 + 3 is 8.

00:00:17.165 --> 00:00:18.695
We can subtract two numbers.

00:00:19.755 --> 00:00:22.295
And notice if we use subtraction
between these two numbers,

00:00:22.295 --> 00:00:27.275
5 and 2.5, where one is a floating point
number, we get a floating point result.

00:00:27.275 --> 00:00:30.715
And that's because the Swift compiler
is smart enough to know the difference

00:00:30.715 --> 00:00:34.480
between subtracting two integers here
and getting an integer result and

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.340
subtracting out a floating point value
here to compute a floating point result.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.500
We'll go ahead and do the same for
multiplication and division.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.360
But here's something that's
a little bit interesting.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.930
How come when we divide 5 by
3 we just get the value of 1?

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.020
Well, since the Swift compiler
knows both of these literal values

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.230
are integers.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.820
When it performs the division,
it does not include the decimal part.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.005
Instead it truncates
the decimal part and

00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:02.072
leaves you with this whole value of 1.

00:01:02.072 --> 00:01:06.187
Now let's see what happens with
the dreaded divide by 0 case.

00:01:06.187 --> 00:01:10.394
It looks like the Swift compiler's smart
enough to know that this is a divide by

00:01:10.394 --> 00:01:13.860
0 and it can't execute this,
but enough with these literals.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.010
Let's try some actual variables now.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.440
I've created these ahead of time so
I'm just going to paste them in.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.860
And we have a variable for
the value 5, 3 and 0.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.424
And now we're trying to do
the same 5 divided by 0 or

00:01:26.424 --> 00:01:30.530
a divide by 0 case but,
what's going on this time?

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.410
Last time the Swift compiler was
able to detect the divide by 0.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.960
Well this time since
we're using a variable,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.730
the Swift compiler cannot
automatically detect the issue.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.390
Instead, the playground file tries
to run this code and as you can see,

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.420
the execution's interrupt
because it can't execute this.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.410
And we can tell that the execution of
the playground stopped because if I try

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.160
to go a line below and

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.610
do anything, we can see that it never
reaches this line, it stops right here.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.907
So let's just remove this and
comment this line out.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.360
There's one more operator I want to
introduce which belongs with add,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.820
subtract, multiply and divide and

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.170
that's the remainder operator,
also called the modulus operator.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.120
Many times you'll hear it called mod for
short.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.670
The mod operator allows us
to perform division and

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.920
then return only the remainder and
this operator's

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.790
really useful when determining
multiples or if a number's even or odd.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.655
By the way, the modulus operator is the
percent sign and we can see if we mod

00:02:32.655 --> 00:02:38.340
10 by the number 2, the remainder is 0
so we know that 10's an even number.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.475
Let's try this with an odd number.

00:02:40.475 --> 00:02:44.265
And in this case, because the result
is 1, we know that the number's odd.

00:02:44.265 --> 00:02:45.980
But you don't just have to do even and
odd.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.400
Let's try an example for,
say, multiples of 5.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.635
We know that 5 is a multiple of five but
6, 7 and 8 are not and

00:02:52.635 --> 00:02:54.330
we can see the remainders here.
