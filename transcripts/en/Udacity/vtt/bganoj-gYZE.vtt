00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.935
&gt;&gt; Our solution for parsing the atlas definition is pretty straightforward.

00:00:03.935 --> 00:00:08.002
First, we're given atlasJSON data that's been loaded from an xhr request. The

00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:12.028
first step that we need to do is actually go through and call JSON.parse on

00:00:12.028 --> 00:00:15.726
that. This will turn the text JSON data into an actual JavaScript object with

00:00:15.726 --> 00:00:19.570
members and values that we can iterate over. We use this to affect here. The

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.266
parsed object has a frames dictionary that we'll actually iterate over to load

00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:26.896
all of our sprites. We'd like to fetch each key inside of our dictionary. And

00:00:26.896 --> 00:00:30.546
then, fetch the associated sprite object that comes with it. From here, we now

00:00:30.546 --> 00:00:34.256
have the sprite name and effectively, the sprite values. The next step we take

00:00:34.256 --> 00:00:38.220
here is to actually define the center of the image. So, we actually multiply the

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.307
width and the height times 0.5, which would give us the half width and half

00:00:42.307 --> 00:00:46.371
height. Now, we store this value in the cx and cy as a negative offset. The

00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:50.531
reason for this is that we'll use the cx and cy values a little later on, during

00:00:50.531 --> 00:00:54.768
rendering, to transform our object into proper space. We store them as negatives

00:00:54.768 --> 00:00:58.278
here so that we don't have to do the mathematics later on when we're drawing the

00:00:58.278 --> 00:01:01.643
image. Once we've got this data, we go ahead forward and call the defSprite

00:01:01.643 --> 00:01:05.060
function, passing in the image name as a key. And then, the frame.x, frame.y

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.744
with height and center data that you've already seen before.
