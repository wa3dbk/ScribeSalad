00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.380
So let's look at our solution. When we have a problem like this,

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.620
we first figure out the dependencies. There is one from here to here, and

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.640
another one from here to here. And there is also dependence here from R7 to R7.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.379
So now let's look at our ILP. So for

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.310
ILP, we can do this and this in the first cycle, they don't depend on anything.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.320
This one needs to be done in the second cycle, because it depends on the first

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.960
instruction. This one, however, can be done in the first cycle. This one cannot,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.080
it needs the R7 to be used by this one. So this gets done in the second cycle.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.250
And then this one actually, doesn't depend on anything, so

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.530
it can also be done in the first cycle. So as far as ILP is concerned, we have

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.678
a total of six instructions executed over two cycles. so the ILP is going to be

00:00:43.678 --> 00:00:48.050
three. For the IPC, we have to worry not only about these dependencies, but

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.090
also that this is a three-issue processor and that it's in order. So

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.340
this can still be done in the first cycle. This can be done in the first cycle.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.370
As far as three-issue is concerned, this could be done in the first cycle but

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.880
because it has a dependence we still have to delay it by one cycle. And

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.720
now the problem is that in an in order processor. Once we don't execute

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.890
an instruction, we cannot execute instructions past it because that would be

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.520
out of order. So this is all that happens in the first cycle in this processor.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.680
In the second cycle we are able to execute this instruction,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.880
because now the first two are done.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.960
We can execute this one, because now that this one is done, this is eligible for

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.510
execution. And then we have to stop here because of this dependence. So

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.268
this would have to be done in the third cycle. And again we cannot do this. So

00:01:34.268 --> 00:01:38.634
in the last third cycle, we will be able to finally do this, and then this.

00:01:38.634 --> 00:01:42.663
Because they don't depend on each other, so they can be done in the same cycle.

00:01:42.663 --> 00:01:48.020
So now we have six instructions over three cycles, for

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.590
an IPC of two. It turns out that even if this was a two issue processor,

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.050
the in order property really would still limit us to IPC of two.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.920
So sometime one of the things is going to be a limitation,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.500
sometimes. Another limitation is going to play a dominant role.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.760
Sometimes all of the limitations are going to play a role in limiting our IPC.
