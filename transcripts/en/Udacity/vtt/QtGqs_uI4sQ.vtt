00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.056
Here are some more numbers written in scientific notation. Thinking about what

00:00:04.056 --> 00:00:07.826
you know about exponents, try to figure out which of these quantities matches

00:00:07.826 --> 00:00:13.004
each of these distances. You might want to think about the order of the sizes

00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:18.610
in each list to figure this out. Here are the numbers that are your options.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.384
1.5 times 10 to the 11th meters, 2.4 times 10 to the 22nd meters, 1.7 times 10

00:00:23.384 --> 00:00:27.696
to the 1st meters, 8.8 times 10 to the 5th meters, and 2 times 10 to the

00:00:27.696 --> 00:00:34.078
negative 4th meters. Each of these matches one of these distances and here are

00:00:34.078 --> 00:00:38.560
those distances. The distance from the earth to the sun, the height of a human,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.322
the distance from San Francisco, California to Paris, France, the distance to

00:00:42.322 --> 00:00:48.320
the Milky Way's nearest neighboring galaxy Andromeda, and the size of an ant.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.880
Now, just in case you didn't know, a meter is a little bit shorter than a yard.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.144
It's about the length from your nose to your fingertip if you hold your arm out

00:00:55.144 --> 00:00:56.440
sideways.
