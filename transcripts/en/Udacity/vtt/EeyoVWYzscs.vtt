00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:07.534
we would get 11X plus 46 divided by the factors x plus 2 times x minus 6 times X

00:00:07.534 --> 00:00:12.975
plus 6. Fantastic work if you just added these numerators together. When we add

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:17.625
the numerators we just want to add the like terms, like 6X and 5X Which would

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:22.959
equal 11x. Likewise we would add the constant terms. Positive 36 and positive 10

00:00:22.959 --> 00:00:28.163
equal positive 46. So here's our numerator and here's our denominator.
