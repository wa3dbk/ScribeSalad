00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Narrator] So, now we know about our class robot

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
who can turn and then move straight after the turn,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and which it also can sense the distance to 4 designated landmarks,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
L1, L2, L3, and L4, and these distances

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
comprise the measurement vector of the robot.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We told you the robot lives in a world of size 100 x 100,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and what this means if this robot falls off 1 end,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
it disappears on the other.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So, it's a cyclic world.

00:00:35.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So, let's now talk particle filters.
