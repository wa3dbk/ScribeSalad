Naturally the next question is,

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.520
what would you expect the parameter this to get bound to?

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.420
In order to answer that we must recall the rule that we plan to

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.540
use when deciding what the keyword this will refer to.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.350
Take a moment to try and restate the simplified rule that we'll be using to

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.680
determine what value this gets bound to.
