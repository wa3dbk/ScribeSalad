00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What do we do about computing statistics like those in an unsorted list.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Well, plan A, especially for mathematical-minded people, might be to sort the list first,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
which as we say reduces the problem to one previously solved so that is safe.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We know how to sort. We can sort the list and then apply the ideas the we had just been talking about.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We're going to be talking more about sorting in a little while, but for now,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
the important thing to know is that the running time of sorting is Î¸ (n log n) for a list of length n.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
this is under the comparison model, but the important thing to make note of here is that

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
it's worse than just running through the list, right?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You have to run through the list repeatedly log n times essentially

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and that may be overkill in some cases.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If you're interested in a very quick and possibly entertaining introduction to sorting,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I've got a music video on the topic called The Sorter,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
which you can find on YouTube, we'll try to send the link.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Plan B is to try to extract the statistic that we're looking for

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
in effectively one scan through the data so Î˜(n)

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and the time that it takes to zip through the list looking at the values

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
we should be able to get certainly the min and the max.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It turns out that we can actually get the median as well, which is really interesting result.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Let's start off with the very straightforward one.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The mean of a list with the average of a list this is how a statistician might write it.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Âľ or the mean is the sum over all the elements on the list from 0 to n-1

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
We look up the value, we sum them all together, and then we divide by the number of values.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
It's just the definition of an average, and it's really straightforward to do that in Python as well.
