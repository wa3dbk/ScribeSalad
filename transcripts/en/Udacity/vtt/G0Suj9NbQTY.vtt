The last mental disorder that we will discuss, is one that has affected people

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.659
throughout history and is a chronic, severe, and disabling brain disorder. And

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:14.070
that's schizophrenia. People with schizophrenia may hear voices that no one

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.318
else hears. They think people are plotting against them to harm them. Or, they

00:00:19.318 --> 00:00:23.634
believe people are reading their minds or controlling their thoughts. In order

00:00:23.634 --> 00:00:27.540
to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, symptoms must persist for at least one

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.473
month. In addition, at least one of the symptoms must be either dilusions,

00:00:32.473 --> 00:00:37.916
hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The other symptoms must be grossly

00:00:37.916 --> 00:00:44.038
disorganized behavior or catatonic behavior, and negative symptoms. By negative

00:00:44.038 --> 00:00:48.028
symptoms we mean for example a person not speaking or being unable to

00:00:48.028 --> 00:00:52.451
experience emotion. Let's go back to Susan to look at some of these in more

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:53.410
detail.
