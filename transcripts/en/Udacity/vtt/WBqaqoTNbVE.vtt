00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
That actually does it for Unit 6.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We basically got to the main points that I wanted to tell you about.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I wanted to kind of express the notion of NP completeness and give you a chance

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to play with that a little bit, and in the homework, we're going to look at that in a little bit more depth.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So I will give you more practice problems to think about.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
In a smaller class, you would probably be writing proofs, but for this class,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
you're going to write some programs and do some multiple choice questions.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So good luck on the homework, hang in there. We're almost done.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The next unit is just going to be interviews and a song that I put together for you,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and a kind of a summary of what we did in these units.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So thanks a lot for listening.
