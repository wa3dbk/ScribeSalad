00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.620
Before we discuss the widely
used public key algorithms,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.600
RSA and Diffie–Hellman,
let's go over the background first.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.430
Both RSA and Diffie–Hellman
are based on number theory.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.350
An ancient and yet
active field in mathematics.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.030
These public key algorithms use
modular arithmetic, including

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:29.150
modular edition, modular multiplication
and modular exponentiation.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.400
And they make use of
results from number theory.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.220
Let's briefly introduce
the background of modular arithmetic.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.590
First, let's explain modular addition.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.090
Given a modular M, x plus y,

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.460
Mod m is the remainder of
x plus y divided by M.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.120
For example, 2 plus 8 divided
by 10 the remainder is 0.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.140
So therefore 2 plus 8
MOD 10 is 0 whereas,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.630
3 plus 8 MOD 10 is 1,
because 3 plus 8 is 11.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.113
And 11 divided by 10, the remainder
is 1 therefore, 3 plus 8 MOD 10 is 1.

00:01:13.113 --> 00:01:19.260
The modular addition if we add a number
and its inverse, then the result is 0.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.110
For example,
If the modulus is 10 then for

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.760
k equal to 2 is inverse is 8
because 2 plus 8 MOD 10 is 0.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:38.130
Having additive inverse means that
modular addition is reversible.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.740
That is, by adding the inverse we can
reverse the result of modular addition.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.720
This is very convenient for
encryption and decryption because, as we

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.180
have discussed, we want the encryption
process to be reversible, meaning that

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.830
ideally, the decryption process is just
the reverse of the encryption process.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.180
For example, given plain text,
p = 3 Suppose the key k is 2,

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.389
and the way we include the plain
text p is to add the key

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:13.980
under modular addition to plain text
p and the result is cipher text c.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.250
So the c equal to p plus k,
which is 3 plus 2 MOD 10.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.210
The result is 5.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.730
There is the cipher text c of
plain text p equal to 3 is 5.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.310
Now how do we decrypt?

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.000
To decrypt we use the same process but

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.590
instead of using the key
we use the key's inverse.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.620
We know that the inverse of 2 is 8.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.530
So therefore c plus k inverse is 5
plus 8 MOD 10 that is, 13 MOD 10.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.178
The result is 3,
which is exactly the plain text.

00:02:50.178 --> 00:02:54.678
And so this is how we can do decryption
by using the exact same process as

00:02:54.678 --> 00:02:59.959
the encryption, and instead of using the
key, we use its inverse in decryption.

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.585
And we take advantage the fact
that under modular addition,

00:03:03.585 --> 00:03:05.360
each number has a inverse.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.573
Therefore each key has a inverse and

00:03:07.573 --> 00:03:10.610
we just use the inverse
of the key in decryption.
