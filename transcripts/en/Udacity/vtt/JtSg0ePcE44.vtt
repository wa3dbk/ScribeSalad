00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.550
So let's look at the answer to
our simple implementation quiz.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.700
If we issue the next access only when
all prior accesses are complete,

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.380
what is the memory level
parallelism we get?

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.190
And the answer is, the memory
level parallelism is exactly 1.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.840
Remember that memory level
parallelism is about

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.960
having a load that misses and
gets sent to memory.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.930
And then our processor continues
finding independent instructions

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.410
here in the hope of finding
another load that is a miss and

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.090
sending it to memory while
the first miss is still going.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.340
What that does, is that if we look
at all the misses in our program,

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.970
we will do some execution, and
then wait for memory to respond.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.330
And then do some execution, and
then wait for memory to respond.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.420
Then sometimes a very little execution,
and wait for memory to respond.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.140
So basically, our execution with memory
level parallelism of 1 ends up being

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.870
the execution without the misses
plus the time to access memory,

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.450
which is very large,
times the number of misses we have.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.880
With memory level parallelism,
we execute,

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.200
we send the request to memory,
now we'll wait for it.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.780
But meanwhile, we execute a little bit
more and hopefully find that next miss.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.140
In which case, we can overlap misses,

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.580
and hopefully we will
find more than just two.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.900
So, in this case,
we have that the cost of each miss

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.420
in terms of memory access
was not paid every time.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:45.770
We paid really the cost of
maybe something like one and

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.890
a half misses total, but
we satisfied three misses here.
