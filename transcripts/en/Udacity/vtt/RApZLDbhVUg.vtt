00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.221
Since you did so well with the last rational inequality I gave you, here's

00:00:04.221 --> 00:00:08.546
another one. We have 18 minus x over 3x minus 6 is less than 5. This is great,

00:00:08.546 --> 00:00:12.771
except for one big issue. In order to find our critical points, we're going to

00:00:12.771 --> 00:00:17.232
need zero on one side of our inequality. So, first things first. Can you tell me

00:00:17.232 --> 00:00:21.596
what we need to do to get 0 on the right hand side over here? What do we need to

00:00:21.596 --> 00:00:25.355
do to both sides of the inequality to make this happen? In this box, I'd like

00:00:25.355 --> 00:00:29.080
you to fill in the proper operator and number that we need to do to both sides.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.868
So for example, you could add a number, you could subtract a number, you can

00:00:32.868 --> 00:00:35.469
multiply a number, or you could divide by a number.
