Are you excited yet? We hope you are. We

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.140
think you should be. Just look at all of these

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.060
pictures of Google data centers. All the Google services run

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.680
on the infrastructure that you see. And with the Google

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.890
cloud platform and app engine, this infrastructure is also available

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.030
to you. That means that the code you create in

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.300
this course will execute alongside all of the other Google

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.950
services. And can leverage from the same scale security and

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.090
performance that Google has built out over the years. We

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.830
can't wait to get started and have you on your way

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.130
to write and deploy your own code into these data centers

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.650
on your journey to writing scalable applications in the Google Cloud.
