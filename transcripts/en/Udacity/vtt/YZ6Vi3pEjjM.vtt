00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.975
So, the important thing about types is what we can do with objects of that type.

00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:07.943
Depending on the type of an object, we can do something with it, but not others.

00:00:07.944 --> 00:00:13.195
So, here's an example. The string type, or STR type as it's actually called, has

00:00:13.195 --> 00:00:18.155
an operation find so if we have a string, we can do find on the string and that

00:00:18.155 --> 00:00:23.319
gives us 2, the position of the 3 on the string. The list type does not have a

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:28.167
find operation. If we try to access the find attribute of a list object, it

00:00:28.167 --> 00:00:32.958
doesn't have one, and we get an error. The error is giving us an AttributeError

00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:37.182
that says, well, we had a list object, that's the object 1, 2, 3 that we created

00:00:37.182 --> 00:00:41.274
here, and it has no attribute find, so Python doesn't know what to do when we

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:45.538
ask to find on a list. There are other operations like multiply that might work

00:00:45.538 --> 00:00:49.113
on different types but have different meanings on different types. So, when we

00:00:49.113 --> 00:00:53.401
do multiply where the inputs are integers, we get the results of multiplying

00:00:53.401 --> 00:01:00.766
those 2 integers. When we do multiply when the first input is a string, we get

00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:03.803
repetition of that string.
