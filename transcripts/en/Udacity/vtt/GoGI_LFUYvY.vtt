00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
[Evans] The answer is there are 41 different positions for the first wheel,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and we multiply that by 31 different positions for the second K wheel.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And so that means that every 1271 letters those wheels would repeat,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and there are only 1271 different possible settings for the K wheels.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Remember that based on the intercepted messages

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
they had learned enough about the structure of the machine

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
to know what the bits are around these wheels.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So it's only necessary to figure out the right configuration.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So certainly today, being able to try 1200-some possibilities

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
would be trivial with a modern computer,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and you might wonder why when they encountered this at Bletchley Park

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
they didn't just go down to the store and buy a computer to solve it,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
but this was 1941. Computers didn't exist yet. They had to invent one first.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And in fact, arguably, the first computer was invented to solve exactly this problem.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Before we get to that, I want to make sure that we actually have enough of an advantage here

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that trying these configurations will help.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So let's look at the probability that if we guess the right key

00:01:10.000 --> 99:59:59.000
we'll be able to tell that we got the right message.
