00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.141
The graph has increased vertically 2 units. So, we'll call the rise 2. Slope is

00:00:05.141 --> 00:00:10.039
always rise divided by run, so the slope of this graph is just 2 divided by 1,

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:13.562
or just 2. Excellent work if you figured that one out.
