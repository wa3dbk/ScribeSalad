00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.268
Let's look at the solution for what
happens in our directory MOESI quiz.

00:00:05.268 --> 00:00:09.640
When Core 0 issues a read it
sends a request to the directory.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.790
The directory doesn't forward or get any
responses, it just sends a response.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.420
When there is a write, the Core 0

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.790
gets this block A in exclusive state
because MOESI has such a state.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.850
Core 0 can do the right
without telling anybody.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.040
So there is no request
sent to the directory, and

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.950
then there is no direct
activity as a result of that.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.400
When Core 1 reads A,
it sends a request to the directory.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.820
The directory will now
send a request to the only

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.350
core that is involved in sharing
this block, which is Core 0.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.270
So it sends one message.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.340
Core 0 responds with the data and

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.750
acknowledges that now it's
okay to read this block.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.330
And when the directory gets this
message, it sends to Core 1 a response.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.410
Now, Core 1 can read the block.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.650
So now we have Core 1 has
the block in the shared state.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.850
Core 0 is now in the own state,

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.570
because it downgraded itself
from modified to owned.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.500
Core 2 now tries to read.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.520
Sends the request to the directory.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.660
The directory,

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.350
if it has only the state that we
have seen on the previous segments.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.480
Does not know who is
the owner of this block, but

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.660
it doesn't need to send anything,
so it gets to memory.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.370
The directory here doesn't
send any messages forwarded,

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.970
because it no longer sees
the block in the directory state.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.730
So it doesn't forward anything,
it doesn't get responses,

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.460
it just sends a response back to Core 2.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.470
Note that here we're unable to
benefit from the own state.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.980
Simply because the directory doesn't
know to ask Core 0 to provide the data.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.450
With a fancier directory,
we would be able do that.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.630
But not with a directory that only
tracks presence and dirtiness.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.840
So now C2 also has the block
in the shared state.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.080
The same thing happens for
C3's request, there is a request,

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.180
the directory doesn't forward anything,
it just sends a response,

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:14.900
because it has to read the data from
memory, and now, Core 0 writes.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.430
Because it's in the own state, it is not

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.230
able to write without notifying the
directory, so it notifies the directory.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.010
This write is an invalidation
request because we have the data.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.250
But we need to send invalidations
to these three processors, so

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.390
that the directory knows that Cores 1,
2, and 3, their caches have the block.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.480
So it sends three messages
to these three destinations.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.670
It gets three responses
from each of them.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.440
Once they have all acknowledged
that they have invalidated,

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.210
it sends a response back to Core 0,
and now it's able to write.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.950
So over all we had five requests
sent to the directory and

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.170
that also means that there are five
responses from the directory.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.170
Because every request
will have a response.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.650
The directory has
forwarded four messages.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.670
Note that this is not like four out
of five, got messages forwarding.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.800
In fact, one of these was for
one message and the other three were for

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.270
the second message.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.520
And then we got four
responses to these messages.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.010
Again, every message needs to get
a response because the directory cannot

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.320
acknowledge and allow a core to
write until all of the sharers have

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.230
indicated that they have invalidated
their state in the cache.
