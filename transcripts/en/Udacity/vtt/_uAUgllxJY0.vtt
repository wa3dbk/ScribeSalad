00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.390
In the Andrew file system, the sequence, client sending a

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.070
newly generated, random number, and the server responding with

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.430
an increment of that random number back to the client. This

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.170
exchange establishes one of two things. Either that the

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.901
server is genuine or the client is genuine. The second

00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:31.960
question is the sequence, the server sending a newly-generated random

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.390
number, Yr, and the client responding by taking the random number, incrementing

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.470
it by 1, and giving it back to the server That

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.650
establishes, that the server is genuine, or the client is genuine.
