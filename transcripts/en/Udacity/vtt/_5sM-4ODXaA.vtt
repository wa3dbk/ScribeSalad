00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.218
So the 2 algorithms that we're going to look at are by Hillis and Steele and by Blelloch.

00:00:04.218 --> 00:00:07.395
Both of them are going to be more efficient than the implementation we just saw,

00:00:07.395 --> 00:00:09.882
but they have different performance characteristics.

00:00:09.882 --> 00:00:13.131
What we'll learn is that Hillis and Steele's formulation of scan

00:00:13.131 --> 00:00:15.779
is more step-efficient than Blelloch's,

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.296
but Blelloch's formulation is more work-efficient than Hillis and Steele's.

00:00:19.296 --> 00:00:21.903
They're both quite relevant today in parallel computing,

00:00:21.903 --> 00:00:25.105
and I hope you find their implementations as interesting as I do.
