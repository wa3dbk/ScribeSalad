00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.780
Find the equation of a line that is perpendicular to the line uc and goes

00:00:04.792 --> 00:00:09.779
through the midpoint between u and c. In order to complete this question, we

00:00:09.791 --> 00:00:14.657
need to brainstorm the process to do this. So, first of all, you're going to

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:19.089
want to find the slope of line uc. Then, you're going to want to find the

00:00:19.101 --> 00:00:24.698
perpendicular slope to uc. And finally, use the slope intercept form, y equals

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.591
mx plus b, to find the equation of the line.
