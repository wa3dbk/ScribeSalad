Well, if we square a, and if we square b, and add those two together, we'll get

00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:09.624
c squared. So a squared, the area of this square, plus b squared, the area of

00:00:09.624 --> 00:00:15.885
this squared, equals c squared, the area of our largest square. Now that's

00:00:15.885 --> 00:00:18.780
great thinking if you found this equation.
