Now one important detail we'll need to understand is how to get our image data

00:00:05.123 --> 00:00:10.272
that our artists create into our game. For example, the image file name. Also

00:00:10.284 --> 00:00:15.482
the width and height of the image, whether it's been rotated at all and various

00:00:15.494 --> 00:00:20.643
other pieces of information we might need to know. Now to do this, we're going

00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:26.515
to use JSON, which is a very lightweight data interchange format that's based on

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:32.354
JavaScript object syntax. Now, since it's based on JavaScript, it turns out that

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:38.085
it's really easy to use with JavaScript. Much easier than, say XML. Now, here's

00:00:38.097 --> 00:00:42.885
an example of a JavaScript object, right here. Now, this is in JSON.

00:00:42.885 --> 00:00:43.941
Technically.

00:00:43.948 --> 00:00:49.154
It is the JavaScript object representation of JSON that has been passed in. The

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:54.347
difference between a JavaScript object and JSON is that JSON is simply a string

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:59.273
that we can then parse to create a java script object. And that's what we're

00:00:59.285 --> 00:01:00.005
going to do.
