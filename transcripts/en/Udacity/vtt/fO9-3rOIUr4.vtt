00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.380
When you first start out,
having never created a game before,

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.290
it feels like there's a bunch of stuff
you don't know, you're not doing right,

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.020
it's not working out, but games
are really like other forms of art.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.630
You use the skills you have to
create something for yourself, and

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.970
then you decide when and
if you want to share it with others.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.990
Some people are comfortable
putting their raw work in progress

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.250
right out there.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.270
Others work privately for years
before publishing their first game.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.400
As you learn more about how to make
games and you get better at it.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.870
The games you create just naturally
tend to become more sophisticated.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.050
Maybe you start with really
rudimentary bad guys, but

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.440
then you figure out how to do AI or
pathfinding.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.000
Or maybe at the beginning,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.460
you do all your own artwork,
even though you're not really an artist.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.880
While later on, you might collaborate
with someone who really knows what

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.090
they're doing and can contribute
amazing art direction to your project.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.680
But hey there's nothing
wrong with program work.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.870
Regardless of how big or complex though

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.800
the best games you'll ever write are the
ones that you think are fun the play.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.770
And you can make a fun game no matter
how little experience you have so

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.000
don't get too hung up on
doing it the right way or

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.239
being an expert on everything
related to game development.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.720
It's more important that you
just keep building games.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.490
You'll learn what you need
to know as you go along,

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.160
and eventually it will
all make perfect sense.
