00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.880
Why didn't that work? We put n equals 1 in

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.540
our div parameter but when we checked for it in

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.790
our template, it was saying n does not equal 1.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.230
Is it because n was modified going into the template? Is

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.200
it because jinja has a different notion of equality? Maybe

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.270
it evaluates double equals differently? Was it cause we have a

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.560
syntax error, or is it because n is a string,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.340
but we're comparing it as an int. These are plausible situations,

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.270
see if you can figure out which is the cause of the

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.420
error in this particular case, because what we just did, should work.
