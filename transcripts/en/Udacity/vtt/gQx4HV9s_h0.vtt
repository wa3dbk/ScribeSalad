00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.160
Martin's Acyclic Dependency Principle states that the dependencies between

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.040
packages must not form cycles. Expressed in terms of D.S.M.'s this

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.750
says that you should be able to permute the rows and columns of the D.S.M.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.100
in such a way that the transitive closer of the matrix is lower triangular.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.460
What this means is that there's a strict ordering among the Components,

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.960
such that a Component only depends on other components beneath it,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.060
and never on one above it. A violation of this property is seen in

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.610
a system where component A depends upon component B,

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.010
and component B depends directly or indirectly on component A.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.570
Not only is it difficult to maintain such systems it is even hard to

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.660
understand them in other words, you can't understand A without understanding B,

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.330
and you can't understand B without understanding A. There are several ways to

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.800
deal with violations of the Acyclic Dependency Principle. If you have

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.750
a situation where A depends on B and B depends on A, you can invent a module C,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.790
take the part of A that B depends on and place it in C, and have both A and

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.910
B depend upon C. Another way to break the cycle where the packages

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.360
are siblings is to add an interface class into b and have a implement it.
