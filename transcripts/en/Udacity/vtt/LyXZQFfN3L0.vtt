00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.250
The first assignment you can chose to do for this course is to talk about how

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.040
these semantic networks can be used to represent Raven's Progressive Matrices.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.920
We saw a few different problems in the first lesson. So take a look at how

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.040
the semantic networks we've talked about today can be used to represent some of

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.620
those other problems, and write your own kind of representation scheme.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.590
In addition to writing a representation scheme, also talk about how that

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.270
representation scheme actually enables problem solving. Remember what Ashok

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.010
mentioned about the different qualities of a good knowledge representation that

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.560
is complete. It captures information at the right level of abstraction, and

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.130
it enables problem solving. So write how your representation can enable problem

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.580
solving of two by one, two by two, and three by three problems. You don't need

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.830
to use the exact same representation scheme that we use, and in fact you can and

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.660
should use your own. Also remember that your representation should not capture

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.630
any details about what the actual answer to the problem is, but rather it

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.520
should only capture what's actually in the figures in the particular problem.
