00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.270
Now you're going to write the code to make

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.330
sure that the user's logged in, if they

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.630
try to use the saveProfile function. Look for

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.470
the places marked TODO 2 in the saveProfile

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.710
method in the Conference API class. You're going to

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.660
want to go ahead and add final User

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.540
user as the first argument to saveProfile. The

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.250
user argument has to be the first argument and

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.270
the argument that defines the data structure of the

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.030
input fields is the second argument and in our case,

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.680
that's profile form. Then go ahead and add the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.610
check to make sure that the user is logged in.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.990
If the user is null, throw an UnauthorizedException exception.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.440
You'll also want to get the userid. And the users

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.030
email out of the user object that gets passed

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.520
in. And then use the user id and email to

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.120
set the appropriate fields. Test your app by

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.120
using the API's Explorer on local host. You should

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.400
find, that when you try to use the saveProfile

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.090
method. You must be logged in and you can

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.690
use that simulation button in the top right

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.220
of the API's Explorer to simulate logging in. When

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.580
you've made your code changes and verified they work

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.430
on local host, go ahead and deploy to appspot.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.910
Then go ahead and enter your APP Id here, so that Udacity can test your app
