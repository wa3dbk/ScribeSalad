00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.900
So today we've talked about meta-reasoning. This very strongly leveraged and

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.035
built on nearly everything we've talked about so far in this course.

00:00:07.035 --> 00:00:10.140
Meta-reasoning is, in many ways, reasoning about everything we've covered so

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.930
far. We started off by recapping learning from correcting mistakes and

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.020
the related notion of gaps. Then we covered two broad metacognitive techniques

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.960
called strategy selection and strategy integration. We then discussed whether or

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.890
not meta-meta-reasoning might exist. And

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.340
we decided, ultimately, that such a distinction isn't even necessary. After all,

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.770
the structures involved in meta-reasoning, like cases, and

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.340
rules, and models, and the same as those involved in a reasoning,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.175
itself. So, meta-reasoning is already equipped to reason about itself. Finally,

00:00:37.175 --> 00:00:40.255
we discussed a particular example of meta-reasoning, called goal-based autonomy.

00:00:40.255 --> 00:00:43.510
Meta-reasoning is in many ways the capstan of our course.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.120
It covers reasoning of all the topics we've covered so far, and

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.280
it provides a way that they can be used in conjunction with one another.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.950
We do have a few more things to talk about though, and

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.680
we'll cover those in our Advanced Topics lesson.
