00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.430
These next three blocks of code are actually where a lot of

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.350
the magic happens with d3.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.970
This first block binds our data to our SVG elements.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.640
Now, this is one of the most confusing parts of d3,

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.090
for newcomers to the library.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.480
We first access the SVG chart element.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.270
Find every possible group tag that may be in there.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.150
And the group tag can be thought of as analogous to the div tag in HTML.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.160
It has no visual display, but serves to group and

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.310
organize content that may be contained within it.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:39.100
We then bind data, passing in the data that our draw function receives,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.425
to the .data function, which binds it to the groups.

00:00:43.425 --> 00:00:48.810
.enter actually returns a sub-selection of the call to .data,

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.320
which represents every datum that has not already been placed on the page.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.170
In this case, in the first call to .data,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.932
there are no elements on the page which have bound data to them.

00:01:01.932 --> 00:01:07.122
So .enter actually contains one element for every point in our data.

00:01:07.122 --> 00:01:11.700
.append g instructs the browser that for

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.960
every point in the enter selection append a g element to the chart.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.570
And then for each of those group elements we want to transform them according to

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.790
this function.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.600
Now there's a lot going on there I want to unpack it a little bit, but

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.210
we'll get much more into the details of what's happening with .data and

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.690
.enter in later lessons, and

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.230
also learn about other types of selections that aren't necessarily .enter.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.860
&gt;From a very high level, this code basically says, look into my SVG.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.020
Find whatever g tags there are there.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.760
If there are zero g tags, the selectAll will be an empty selection.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.230
Attach data to our selection.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.590
A .enter basically says, for every point that's in our

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.630
data which doesn't have a corresponding element in the initial selection.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.590
In this case,

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.275
since our initial selection was empty, because there weren't any g-tags yet.

00:02:10.275 --> 00:02:16.055
.enter, again, contains one element for every point in our data.

00:02:16.055 --> 00:02:18.730
.append instructs D3 and

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.390
for every one of these new group elements, change the transform attribute.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.440
Which is unique to SVG according to whatever gets returned from this function.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.150
Again if that wasn't perfectly clear we'll get more into those details and

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.170
specifics in later lessons.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.630
I just wanted to show you what it looks like and

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.930
how to create a data driven chart
