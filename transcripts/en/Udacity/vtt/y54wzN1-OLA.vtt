We're going to use a strategy to tackle this problem just like we've done

00:00:04.082 --> 00:00:08.624
before. We're going to make this problem easier. So we're going to use different

00:00:08.636 --> 00:00:13.079
fractions instead of 2/5 and 1/4. Let's use 1/2 and 1/3 instead. So I rewritten

00:00:13.091 --> 00:00:17.695
my question down here. Before we answer this problem, let's actually predict. So

00:00:17.707 --> 00:00:21.964
if we frost 1/2 of the cake in vanilla icing and 1/3 of it in strawberry icing.

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:26.053
What fraction of the cake is actually frosted? Would it be less than 2/5?

00:00:26.435 --> 00:00:31.467
Exactly 2/5 Or more than 2/5? Draw some diagrams to help you out. Let's actually

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:36.052
consider a round cake. And here's what 2/5 of a round cake frosted would look

00:00:36.064 --> 00:00:40.687
like. Notice I have my whole chocolate cake, and 2/5 of it has been frosted in

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.595
this blue icing. So, what do you think 1/2 and 1/3 of a cake covered in icing

00:00:45.607 --> 00:00:47.590
would look like? Make your choice.
