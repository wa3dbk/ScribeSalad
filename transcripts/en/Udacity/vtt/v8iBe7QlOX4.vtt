00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.110
The specific lesson objectives for this lesson are,

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.540
we will look at the photographic process for both digital and film cameras.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.980
I will describe to you, the eight different layers that constitute a color film.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.590
I will also describe the five layers of a generic CCD that's found in

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.899
most common cameras.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.100
We will discuss the differences between a charged couple device, a CCD and

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.560
a CMOS sensor.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.870
And I will discuss some of the benefits of using a camera raw format.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.040
This will connect back to the lecture we had on different types of

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.440
image formats.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.380
Remember, it's the image format that basically captures the pixels.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.710
And it's the pixel values,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.750
the intensities, which we want to be doing most of our processing on.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.610
We will just take that up a notch and

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.010
talk about a camera raw format a bit today.
