00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.170
So, we have seen that the duplication of

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.660
all the register values that have all, ever been

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.840
produced is a problem. So we will located registry

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.450
naming, which is another scheme that can provide relief

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.430
from false dependencies, but in a way that

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.230
actually is more manageable. How does the registry naming

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.850
work? So, register renaming separates the concept of architectural

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.210
registers, which are the registers that the programmers and

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.130
the compilers use. So, this is when you write

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.420
an instruction like add r1, r2, r3, the r1,

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.260
r2, and r3 that you're referring to are the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.170
architectural registers. In register renaming, there is also. A concept

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.030
of physical registers, which is all the places that

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.970
we can actually put a value in the processor. So,

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.910
there is of course a place for, kind of,

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.340
the latest value of R 1, for example, but there

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.720
could be additional places where we could potentially store

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.200
values that should be going to R 1, and then

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.570
what we do is. As the processor reads instructions and

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.390
figures out which registers they're using, and remember the program

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.349
is referring to architectural registers. As it's fetching instructions, and

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.870
decoding them, it also does register renaming which pretty much

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.530
means that it re-writes the program to use the physical

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.000
registers. So, basically if it sees Add R1, R2, R3.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.130
It is going to rename that into our ad or something else and so on, in order to

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.340
basically refer to the places where it has actually

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.180
put those values, and how does it know where

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.040
the values are? Well, it uses a table called

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.170
the register allocation table or. RAT, and you should

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.580
remember this because we will be very frequently referring

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.270
to the RAT because it's used very very often.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.050
What the RAT is, is a table that says which physical registers has the

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.100
value for which architecture register. So, for

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.090
each of the architecture registers, there will

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.950
be an entry in this table and it will say. What is the current

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.170
location in the physical registers, where the

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.200
value for that architecture registers can be found?
