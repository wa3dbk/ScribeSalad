00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.889
This is a slightly tricky question, so if you found it a little bit difficult,

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:13.593
no big deal. If we plug in 2 and 3 for a and b for example, we get 2 3rds or

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:21.575
point 6 repeating as a rational number. And if we plug in 8 and 7, we get 8

00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:29.944
7ths, or 1 point 1 4 2 8 5 7 with that decimal repeating. Neither of these are

00:00:29.956 --> 00:00:37.013
integers. But, if we plug in 10 and 2 for a and b, we get 10 over 2 which is

00:00:37.025 --> 00:00:43.890
just equal to 5 which we know is an integer. So it turns out that all integers

00:00:43.902 --> 00:00:49.690
are rational numbers. And some numbers that are not integers are also rational

00:00:49.702 --> 00:00:54.275
numbers. And that means we need to draw the circle for the rational numbers, so

00:00:54.287 --> 00:00:57.266
that it completely surrounds the integer circle.
