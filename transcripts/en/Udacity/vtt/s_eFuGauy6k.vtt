00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.370
Now I'm going to walk you
through the process of

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.640
getting your workspace set up on Mac.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.250
And the process on Linux is similar.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.350
There are also written instructions
in the instructor notes.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.920
If you're using Windows, there
are instructions in the previous video.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.300
First I'm going to download
two files that are needed for

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.940
the set up I just showed you,
one to enable tab completion, and

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.540
want to enable the special
Git features in the prompt.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.503
So I'll go to the webpage
with the first file and

00:00:25.503 --> 00:00:29.010
you can find the link to this
file in the instructor's notes.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.805
Then I'll right-click anywhere
on the page and select Save As.

00:00:32.805 --> 00:00:34.995
And I'll save the file in
my Downloads directory.

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:39.030
Now I want to make sure that
Hide extension is unchecked, so

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.105
that I can see the exact name
the file is being given.

00:00:42.105 --> 00:00:45.820
And by default,
it's suggesting Redirecting.txt.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.670
But I want to change this
to git-completion.bash, and

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.500
then I'll Save the file.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.890
Now I want to move the file
to my home directory,

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.050
which I'll do using the Terminal.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.650
Now when I first open the Terminal,
I start out in my home directory, or

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.520
I can type cd ~ to get to
the home directory if I need to.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.630
Now I'll use the command mv,
which stands for

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.720
move, to move the file I just
saved into my home directory.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.830
The first argument is
the file I want to move,

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.892
which is in my Downloads directory and
it's named git-completion.bash.

00:01:15.892 --> 00:01:21.530
And I want to move it into the current
directory while keeping the same name.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.490
Then I'll go through the same process
to save the second file linked in

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.010
the instructor's notes as git-prompt.sh.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.390
Next, I'm going to create
a file called .bash_profile,

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.780
which contains configuration for
the Terminal.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.740
I recommend using the configuration file
that I used when filming this course.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.040
To do that, you can download the file
called bash_profile_course in

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.290
the downloadables section.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.920
Next, use the Terminal to move
this file to your home directory.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.980
You should name it .bash_profile and
don't forget the dot at the beginning.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.030
Now if you already have a bash profile,
then don't run this command, and

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.280
instead you can copy and

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.320
paste the content from this file
into your existing bash profile.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.830
And if you're running Linux,

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.090
then you might need to name this file
.bashrc instead of .bash_profile.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.220
Now I don't see any changes made to my
prompt yet, and that's because I'll

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.420
need to close and reopen the Terminal
before the changes take effect.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.600
I'll do that at
the the end of the video.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.740
In case you're curious about
what's in this bash profile, or

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.780
if you'd like to pick and

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.150
choose just the lines you're interested
in, I'll go through what each line does.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.195
Now, don't worry if you don't
understand how each line works though.

00:02:31.195 --> 00:02:34.605
Even experienced Unix programmers
frequently copy and paste this kind of

00:02:34.605 --> 00:02:36.735
thing from their friends,
rather than writing it from scratch.

00:02:38.605 --> 00:02:41.545
This first line loads one of
the files you downloaded earlier and

00:02:41.545 --> 00:02:42.725
enables tab completion.

00:02:44.145 --> 00:02:46.775
These lines define some colors,
which will be used in your prompt.

00:02:47.795 --> 00:02:50.580
This line loads the other
file you downloaded earlier.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.600
And it's necessary for

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.330
the git related stuff like commit
IDs to show up in your prompt.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.370
This line is what makes sure that
the asterisk will be shown in your

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.460
prompt if you make changes
in a git repository.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.450
And this line actually defines
what the prompt will be.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.880
The prompt will show
your username in purple,

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.740
the commit you currently have checked
out or other git related stuff in green.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.230
And the director URN followed
by a dollar sign in blue.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.360
Then any text after that will be
displayed in the default color.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.500
If you're curious to learn more
about how prompts work in bash,

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.300
check out the link in the instructor's
notes, but it's not necessary for

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.060
the rest of this course.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.810
Next, it's important to make sure
you can launch your favorite text

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.120
editor from the Terminal so

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.740
that you'll be able to set it as
your default editor within git.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.820
I'll show how to do this for Sublime.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.610
If you're using another text editor,

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.490
I recommend that you Google to figure
out how to use it from the Terminal.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.260
Now, I can launch Sublime from the
Terminal by running this long command.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.770
Where this is where Sublime
is stored on my computer, but

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.720
I'd like to have a shortcut.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.570
To create one I'll use Sublime to
add a line to my bash profile.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.980
Files with a dot at the beginning of
the name don't usually show up in

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.700
file system explorers, so

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.330
I'm going to have trouble opening
my batch profile with Sublime.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.330
To fix this I'll use the trick
of moving my bash profile

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.730
to a file without a dot at
the beginning of the name.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.370
Then to open the file in Sublime, I'll
first navigate to my home directory,

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.790
which I can do by pressing Cmd+Shift+H.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.980
And then I'll select
the file bash_profile.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.420
Then I'll add this line to it to
make the subl command stand for

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.370
the same command that you
saw me enter earlier.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.600
You can copy and

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.360
paste this line from the instructor's
notes if you're using Sublime.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.260
Now I'll save the file and

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.590
I'll change the name back to have a dot
at the beginning using the Terminal.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.465
If I don't do this,

00:04:41.465 --> 00:04:45.320
then the bash profile won't take
effect when I open the Terminal.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.010
Again, this command won't work
until I've restarted the Terminal.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.440
Now I'll configure git to
use Sublime as my editor for

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.470
things like commit messages.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:05:00.340
To do that I'll run git config
--global core.editor and

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.070
here I need to put in double quotes
the command to open my text editor.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.584
For Sublime that's subl -n -w.

00:05:08.584 --> 00:05:12.502
Where -n will open
Sublime in a new window,

00:05:12.502 --> 00:05:16.440
and -w will wait until you close
your file before continuing.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.730
If you use a different editor,

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.190
you will need to modify this part of the
command to use the editor that you like.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.920
See the instructor's notes for
more details.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.460
Next I'll run these two
git config commands,

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.040
which will come in handy
later in the course.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.750
Please copy and

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.790
paste these commands from
the instructor's notes and run them.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.730
Finally I'll close the Terminal and
reopen it.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.610
Now I can see that my prompt has
changed to become more colorful.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.100
And if I want to view my
bash profile using Sublime,

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.390
I can run subl .bash_profile.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.010
Remember to close and reopen your
Terminal when you're finished, or

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.190
your changes won't take effect.
