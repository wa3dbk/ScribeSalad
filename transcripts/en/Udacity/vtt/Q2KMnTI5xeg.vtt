00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.930
JP, thank goodness you're okay.

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:04.660
&gt;&gt; Any reason I wouldn't be?

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.870
Say did I tell you I got
someone from the Firebase team

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.170
that offer to chat with us
about data best practices?

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.240
&gt;&gt; No, but

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.000
actually I think that might be just
the kind of guidance that we need.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.160
It's incredibly important
that we get the stuff right.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.910
Crap though, I've got Bouche Ball
game with the investors.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.880
Do you think that you can take notes?

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.440
&gt;&gt; Or better yet
the developer can come over to Google.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
That sounds like a player.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:37.940
Want to bar the company
&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.170
I'm here with Abe again and

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.330
I'm joined by Puff, Puff is also
an engineer in the fire base team.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.010
Welcome, Puff.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.610
Thanks for having me.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.460
So I'm trying to advise
a friend on how to correctly

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.540
come up with a database schema for
firebases.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.060
I imagine there could be some pitfalls.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.530
Is there an issue in getting
your schema right up front.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.750
Now one of these Firebase really allows
you to be flexible about how you

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.040
structure your data.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.710
And that's one of the great benefits
of using a scheme on this no SQL

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.269
database.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.880
Unfortunately, it's also one of
the pitfalls because people tend to

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.760
not think up front of how they
need to model their data.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.480
And that's one of the things where at
some point during the lifecycle if your

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.410
application you need to start
hammering down to structure.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.410
You need to start validating your data.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.650
If you don't you're going to run into
issues later with either scalability, or

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.430
especially when you're
an Android developer,

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.440
you need to start mapping your
schemaless JSON into your Java classes.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.540
And that becomes progressively
more expensive if you make

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.280
changes later on in the cycle.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.040
An important point thing to note about
Firebase is that when you start,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.370
when you get a new fire base, you can
pretty much do whatever you want.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.290
You can write in any
type of crazy structure,

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.430
you want to when you're developing,
and when you're testing.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.150
And this is easier on web then it
is on Android where your structure

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.150
can be very, very loose, but
once you get something in your this is

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.810
what we're going with this
is how we're building.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.100
You can lock that structure in.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.040
And you can write schema validations and

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.350
you can make sure that the only data
in your firebase matches these rules.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.970
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.538
&gt;&gt; Initially, it's very free form.

00:02:08.538 --> 00:02:12.060
But once you have you have it more
concrete about what you're building and

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.190
how you want to build it,

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.390
you can lock it in just like you
would in any other database.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.720
So when you're developing apps and
you're first laying out your scheme,

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.690
how do you go about doing it?

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.110
Do you sketch it on paper?

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.260
Do you build, so you take some
JSON data and sort of model it?

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.240
How do you go about actually doing it?

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.940
&gt;&gt; I usually start with
just some some code where I

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.460
write some of the sample data.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.450
Is that the same as you did do?

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
I think for sure,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.550
if you get a little bit of
code where you start saying,

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.540
all right, here is a very loosely
defined user creation page.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.410
Well I can start writing what
a user object looks like.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.020
I start figuring out what I need.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.760
And then that data can start showing up
in your Firebase right away because it's

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.970
so easy to get up and running with,
that then you can be like I need

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.480
this profile information or I need
a list of their likes or whatever.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.770
And you can just start
very free forming,

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.520
building out your data structure.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.730
And then once you're confident

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.770
with your structure like I
said you can lock it in.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.680
But up until then you
can just very casually

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.380
add in things where you need to and
experiment with the structure.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.890
For most cases, I find that works.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.960
Sometimes if it's a very large app and
you know there's going to be

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.860
tons of different types of data in
there I'll whiteboard it out and

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.150
sketch out like, all right here is this
and this will have a list that points to

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.560
this other type of data or
something like that.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.740
But it's much more common that
I just start playing around and

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.400
then develop a structure that way.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah and it actually because
what you then notice is that after

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.380
you figure out your structure and

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.960
how you want to store today tell
what data you want to store mostly.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.750
Then you start worrying about
scalability of the day time.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.960
And that's something you
can then do later so

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.660
you now know which data you want.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.700
Now let's think about how
we can make this scalable.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.490
So.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.730
But starting with some
exploratory coding and

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.200
just structuring today takes
you go is very common.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.760
&gt;&gt; Great so what are some
of the biggest mistakes you

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.310
see new developers doing
when they design a schema?

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.130
&gt;&gt; I think people,

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.010
because firebase can have this
very complicated nested structure.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.590
Where you can essentially mimic
any Json structure you have,

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.550
which could be users and then under
users a list of user names, and

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.660
under that each user could
have a list of their friends,

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.170
which could have a whole bunch of
profile information about them.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.680
They could have a profile, you end
up with this very nested structure.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.860
And that doesn't work very well in it's
very hard to be specific about your what

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.210
you're loading if you have this
very complicated deep structure.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.780
So that nesting,
I think is a very common issue.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.240
It does, it's not that it doesn't work,
it's just that it doesn't scale as well.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.640
&gt;&gt; And also it's very natural.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.980
You see, that lots of developers, right,
I mean most of us come from a SQL

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.360
background where we work
with relational databases.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.630
And there you cannot do
hierarchies very easily.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.990
So when you get to a hierarchical
database like Firebase,

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.450
it's very natural to want to start
building these nested structures,

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.530
because you've never
been able to do them.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.040
And that's when, as Abe says, we need
to start paying attention to not overly

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.940
nesting the data, because you're
going to run into issues later on.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.290
So you typically want to stay
relatively flat in your data structure.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:11.150
And that's That's not very appealing to
developers coming from SQL backgrounds.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.420
&gt;&gt; Okay do you guys have any good like
war stories some like where you give

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.560
assistance to customers that had some
hiccups because they didn't follow

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.540
best practices?

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.690
&gt;&gt; Yeah you don't get to a quarter of
a million developers without some war

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:22.650
stories so.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.230
No what we see quite often is that
people start gathering lots of data and

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.390
long lists.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.140
And that is fine if you
need all the data, but

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:37.040
one of the ones we saw was we had
a developer that was tracking couriers,

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.170
were delivering packages across the
city, and each courier was, I imagined

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:46.840
him being on their mopeds and their
phone was pinging the Firebase server.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.230
So there's lots of data being generated.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.080
And they were keeping this data in one
long list, which would last essentially

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.850
for days on end, and that would
be half a million items easily.

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.340
And they were showing
this in a dashboard and

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.760
things were sluggish in general.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.580
It was not the performance they were
looking for, so it's like well,

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.430
okay how many items do you want to show
in this list and it turns out they

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.890
were actually showing like,
at most the last five minutes of data.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.910
And this is one of the things that you
have to start explaining to them or

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.780
if you only want to show five minutes
of data then why are you keeping

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.530
a day's data in one big list.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.150
Because you will have to query all of
it's to just get the top ten items.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.900
That's a very common one we see where
people are not separating their

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.520
active data from their historical data.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.460
And yeah, these hurt so
we see this quite often.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.790
You have something for us?

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah, another common issue related
to that is people will go and

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.370
they'll build some application
with Firebase really quickly

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.570
because it let's you do that and
they'll start getting a ton of data.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.960
And then they'll make one
mistake in their code and

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.040
they will clear out their Firebase.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.860
This is not normally possible, if you're

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.980
adhering to what our best practices
that we provide in our documentation.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.940
Which is basically that you
restrict things in your Firebase,

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.750
you say only this type
of data can exist here.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.800
Only these people can write to this and
that.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.140
That way when you're developing,

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.530
you don't accidentally delete
all your Firebase data.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.360
But because we don't enforce that
because in the early like we want you to

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.150
be able to experiment and play around.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.670
We don't know if you're trying to clear
out your Firebase because you're tired

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:15.980
of the structure you made.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.560
Or if you made a mistake
in your code and

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.250
you know some bug it's cleaning it out.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.180
So we see that a lot especially like
things like hackathon where people

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.550
are trying to write code very quickly.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.430
And they're like,
I'll not bother with the security rules,

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.280
I won't bother enforcing a schema,
and then they make one mistake, and

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.890
they're like, where is all my data.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:35.330
And the answer is, it's gone.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.940
Luckily, we have backups for that.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.260
We do backups of your
Firebases all the time,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:44.730
and we can recover that if it's
important mission critical data.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:49.480
But in general, it's a very easy mistake
to make if you're not following our best

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.029
practices and implementing security and
validation roles.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.600
Good point.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.480
Last one I remember is I was
talking to a game developer and

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.710
they were doing a IOS app I think,

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:06.300
where you got to vote on either the blue
egg hatched or the red egg would hatch.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.510
And they were looking for okay,

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.100
so we would probably use transactions
to keep the count right?

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.690
Of who voted for what.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:19.070
And this is a common one where it's like
well how many players do you get and

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:23.200
how often do they or
how how fast do they vote?

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.210
They had half a million in like thirty
seconds and that's typically something

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:30.370
where if you start doing transactions,
yeah it will not skill very

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:34.990
well anymore because everyone will be
hitting that same counter at that time.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.530
So there you see that you know you need
to stare into a direction where you're

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.740
actually instead of increasing
a counter you keep the votes and

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.100
start counting them separately.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.140
And it is always fun to explain
because yeah people are used to doing

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:47.810
transactions.

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.750
&gt;&gt; Well guys,
really appreciate your time today.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:57.370
Thank you very much I'm sure that our
developer will really go take this

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.010
advice and
continue on developing their app.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:08:59.980
&gt;&gt; Cool, okay.
&gt;&gt; Glad we could help.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.549
&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks.
