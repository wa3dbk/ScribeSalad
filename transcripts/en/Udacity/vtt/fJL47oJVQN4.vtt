00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I spent a couple hours porting all the code over into this new format,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and I want to spare you all this editing work so in the final code

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that is a little bit incomplete still, we have a grid.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We've got a function called "main."

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Main then runs a path planner, A-star, smooths it, and then runs the controller, as in "run."

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Then the controller even implemented for you our particle filter that you're familiar with.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
There's nothing new here.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
You're going to get the exact same code from class that you programmed yourself.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Then I go through a loop where I compute a crosstrack error,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
apply my only PD controller--here is no I term here--

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and I run my particle filter as before to estimate where the robot is.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
What I would like you to do is to implement the crosstrack error function,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and I want you to use as an input the estimate, not the actual robot position,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
but the best estimate, which you can get by running filter.get_position.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Now here is the difficulty, and I can tell you confidently it took me more than an hour

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
to solve this problem myself just for this class.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Our path now is a sequence of linear pieces.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
When our robot drives along, it has a certain crosstrack error,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
but as the robot state project beyond the end of a line segment, as is happening here,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
we have to change the corresponding line segments to be the next one.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I addition, to calculating the assigned error relative to an arbitrary line segment,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
not just the y-axis, we also have to detect when the robot steps beyond

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
the end of a line segment and switch over to the next one.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Now, suppose this is our line segment.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The path is given by the coordinates of the beginning point, p1, and the end point, p2,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
both of which are (x, y) coordinates, which you get straight in the path.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Suppose our robot's position is something like this

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
where it has its own (x, y) estimate that comes out of the particle filter in your case,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and it has it's own orientation, theta.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Then both the cross track error as well as how far it has progressed

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
along the line segment--call this "U"--can be calculated using a dot product.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Specifically, let's call this vector over here delta x and delta y

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
as defined in x2 minus x1, and y2 minus y1--this vector over here.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Let's call this vector over here our Rx, which is x minus x1, and Ry.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Then U, the ratio of how far we've progressed along this segment is given

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
by the dot product Rx times delta x plus Ry times delta y

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.000
divided over the sum of squares delta x times delta x plus delta y times delta y. Why?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Well, this normalizes the vector length to 1, and this is the dot product of this vector over here

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and the green vector, which happens to define the distance.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
If this is larger than 1, we know we've left the segment and it's time to move onto the next one.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Finally, the crosstrack error--the red one over here--is given by a similar

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
but not identical dot product of Ry times delta--

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
notice we are now multiplying a y with an x--

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
minus--instead of plus--our x times delta y

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
with the exact same normalizer as down here.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
You can see the normalizer over here.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
What I want you to implement are these pieces of math over here.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
When you run your controller, you will find that I setup for you a variable called "index"

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
that's the index into your path.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
When U exceeds 1, we should increment this index

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
to make sure it never goes beyond what's legal in path length.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
The crosstrack error should be computed relative to the current index

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and is, of course, the assigned error using the exact same dot product I've shown you.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
The last thing I want to tell you is what the path is.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I want you to use the following path.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
The path is called "S" path.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
It is given the run function as one of the parameters over here.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
You can see it up here.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000
S path index is the indexth element of this path and 0 stands for x and 1 stands for y.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Please fill in the missing code over here.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
I should tell you, when you run our controller with the missing code included,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
you get actually a valid, nice path that mostly doesn't collide.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Occasionally it does, because of randomness in the system,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
but it should be mostly collision free.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
For this example, it will require about 130 or so robot steps.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Just so that you see a typical answer, here is a random run.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
You read this as follows--true means the robot actually found the goal,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
zero means zero collisions, and it took 137 steps.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Let me run it again, and here is another outcome.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
The robot didn't collide and reached the goal in 145 steps.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
I should warn you that sometimes I do get collisions here,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and it's because our obstacle surfaces are relatively large.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
The noise in the system makes it hard to navigate.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
But most of the time we should be able to get to the goal without difficulties

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
if we implement this piece of code correctly.

00:05:28.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Just to warn you, it took me quite a while to work this out.
