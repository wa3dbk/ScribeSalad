00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.912
The first thing we're going to do is look for two numbers that add to equal

00:00:03.912 --> 00:00:07.779
negative 28. So we can write this middle coefficient in expanded form and factor

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.352
from there. We know that those two numbers also need to multiply to equal the

00:00:11.352 --> 00:00:15.382
product of these outer two coefficients. So, 5 times negative 12 in this case,

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:20.392
which is negative 60. So, what adds to equal negative 28 but multiplies to equal

00:00:20.392 --> 00:00:25.442
negative 60? Well, 60 is just equal to 30 times 2. So, we have negative 30 times

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:30.477
positive 2, then negative 30 plus 2 equals negative 28. So those must be our two

00:00:30.477 --> 00:00:35.212
numbers. That means we can rewrite this expression as 5 x squared plus the

00:00:35.212 --> 00:00:40.001
quantity 2 minus 30 times x minus 12. I personally think that's the hardest part

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:44.409
of the problem, is figuring out how to rewrite that middle coefficient. From

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:48.864
here, it's pretty straightforward. Now, we just factor within the first two

00:00:48.864 --> 00:00:53.352
terms and then within the second two terms. We recognize a common factor of 5 x

00:00:53.352 --> 00:00:57.640
plus 2. And finally, we get to our official answer of 5 x plus 2 times x minus

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.787
6.
