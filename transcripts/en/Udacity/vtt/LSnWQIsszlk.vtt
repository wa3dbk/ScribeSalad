00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.859
Once you've initialized your array,

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:04.939
chances are you're going to
want to add or remove items.

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:09.370
To add an item to the end of an array,
I can use the append method like this.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.460
Or to add an item to
a specific place in an array,

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.670
I can use the method, insert at index.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.090
To remove an item,
you use the method, remove it index.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.980
So for example,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.120
to take out Flo Rida, we need to
specify that he's at index three.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.621
But I don't think this playlist
has enough country music, so

00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:31.201
we'll insert Keith Urban, and
we'll put him at index three.

00:00:33.337 --> 00:00:35.446
And then if we look over
here in our sidebar,

00:00:35.446 --> 00:00:38.070
we can see that Keith Urban
has been added to the array.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.040
If I want to know how many items are in
my array, I can use the count method.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.280
If I want to retrieve an item,
I can do so using sub script syntax.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.850
I just write the name of the array, and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.300
at the end, add the items index as
a sub script between square brackets.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.815
And here in the sidebar we can see that
the value Dej Loaf has been assigned to

00:00:57.815 --> 00:00:59.915
the constant musician.

00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:03.475
We've written exercises to give you
plenty of practice working with arrays.

00:01:03.475 --> 00:01:06.105
I think you'll find the syntax
to be fairly intuitive.

00:01:06.105 --> 00:01:08.955
For now, let's continue on to
dictionaries in the next section.
