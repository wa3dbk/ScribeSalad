00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.780
So before proceeding with the candy bowl data, I wanted to take a moment and

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.710
describe the data that we collected in order to perform this analysis.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.040
So if you recall, the goal is to understand what influences consumer choice.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.330
In this case, the influencer's a candy selection, and so

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.310
we elected to record any attributes which we

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.600
thought might possibly have an impact on selection preference.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.470
So, each record corresponded to someone selecting a candy.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.140
For each record, the attributes that we thought to collect, which might have

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:39.310
an influence on candy preference were, name, gender, the type of candy.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.550
We lumped color and flavor into one giant category.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.720
Age of the person who's selecting, and ethnicity of the selector.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.400
Now in addition to that attribute, in order to establish a baseline,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.430
we also want to include a spurious attribute.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.350
That way, any attribute that was ranked as having a weaker relationship than

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.010
that one, we know that we can safely ignore it.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.590
So as our selection of a spurious attribute, we chose shirt color.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.570
I think we can all agree that shirt color shouldn't have

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.620
an impact on what candy someone selects.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.970
So, when we're evaluating the strength of relationships of any one of

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.420
these other attributes to candy choice, we know that if it

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.450
has a weaker relationship than that of shirt color, we can safely ignore it.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.320
Now in addition, the records are chronological,

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.590
meaning that the records appear in the order in which selections were made.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.080
Now that you know what all of the attributes mean, go grab ahold of

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.530
the data yourself so that you can follow along while we do the analysis.
