00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.663
So, here are the answers. In this first part of the graph, we're moving down as

00:00:04.663 --> 00:00:09.212
x goes up, so the graph is decreasing. Then f of x starts to increase again as

00:00:09.212 --> 00:00:13.972
we continue to move to the right, so this must be increasing. Then the value of

00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:18.372
g of x doesn't change at all as we go here, so it must be constant. Moving up

00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:23.100
again means we're increasing. And then lastly moving down means decreasing.
