00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.440
Again, I want to stress that one of the most powerful features of

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.310
D3 could be considered its API and how it makes you think.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.860
Since every method in D3 returns the element or

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.570
elements that it was called on, you can naturally chain methods one to the next.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.650
Don't worry about all the changes we've been making to the page.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.220
Any changes we make are purely on the client side, meaning only within our

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.570
local browser, and of we refresh the page Udacity's site goes back to normal.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.080
So now, let us refresh the page and

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.600
then start manipulating with a fresh HTML page.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.430
After we've refreshed the page,

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.440
you can see that the navigation bar has its original background and

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.580
the title is back to Data Visualization rather than Jon's Pretty Pictures.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.400
I wanted to walk through how to actually change the logo and

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.850
what's happening behind the scenes in more depth.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.450
The first step, as always, is to inspect the element and try to find some

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.570
unique identifier, either a class ID or tag, to use with D3 select function.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.530
As you can see here the logo is in image tag but it doesn't have any classes or

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.000
ID's defined on it.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.030
Does this mean that we will not be able to select it?

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.810
No, we simply have to look one level up or as many levels up as we need and

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.280
navigate the dom tree from the closest identifiable element.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.940
What does that mean exactly?

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.040
Well, going one level up to its parent, the image tag is contained

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.570
within an a tag, and this a tag, as you can see when you hover, highlights

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.270
the Audacity logo, meaning that the image is indeed a subselection of the a tag.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.725
And looking at its class of logo and

00:01:43.725 --> 00:01:49.335
navbar brand, I'd be willing to bet that if I search for a with both logo and

00:01:49.335 --> 00:01:53.625
navbar-brand, I'll find a unique element which returns this selection.

00:01:53.625 --> 00:02:00.753
So calling d3.select with a.navbar-brand.logo, which again is looking for

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:05.757
both navbar-brand and logo classes defined on the a tag.

00:02:05.757 --> 00:02:10.729
Again, as you see here, we get a return with a D3 Array object.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.230
And inspecting inside we see indeed there is an a tag

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.060
that has .logo.navbar which uniquely identifies it and

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.830
corresponds to the logo that we're looking to change.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.825
Since this a tag also has an id,

00:02:24.825 --> 00:02:30.340
header-logo, we can select it using a CSS selector for the id.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.760
The syntax for CSS selectors to select an ID is simply the hash or

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.160
pound symbol, and then the ID following.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.030
Let's save this selection into a variable.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.520
Let's call it, parent_element.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.340
And now let's try to find a way to get the image tag

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.650
to actually mutate its source.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.030
Again, because what's returned from the selection has all of

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.030
D3's methods defined on it, we can make another sub-selection.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.730
Scrolling through the list of methods defined, we find select.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.210
We can select within this element and

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.180
arbitrarily select however deep we may need to go.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.700
In this case, we're lucky and only have to go a single level down.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.330
Also in this case, since there's only a single item within the a tag,

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.140
we know that subselecting an image tag on the previous selection of

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.090
the a with ID header-logo, we're guaranteed to get the element of interest.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.100
As you can see here, the image tag we hover and it corresponds to the logo.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.150
To finish our remodel of Udacity's site,

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.540
we simply need to change the source attribute defined on the image tag.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.750
You can change any attribute defined on any HTML tag using the .attr or

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.030
attribute method defined on a selection or D3 object.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.620
While we're interested in just changing the source,

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.010
you can actually change any attribute, alt text, maybe a class, or an ID.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.010
In this case, let's just try to change the alt text and see what would happen.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.620
Notice as we change the alt to Jon's logo since was displayed in

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.540
the chrome developer console is the dom and not the stated source of the page.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.940
The alt name actually changes in real time to Jon's logo.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.720
To change the source you simply need to change alt to the string source.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.660
And in our case, I've already found the URL for

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.260
the Zipfian logo and stored it in a variable zipf.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.090
Running this line, the source should dynamically update and

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.790
that logo image should change.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.010
And voila.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.000
As you can see here the logo has changed to Zipfian Academy's logo, and

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.190
if we hover over the dom representation of this we can see that

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.670
indeed the source has changed and it corresponds to the Zipfian Academy logo.
