00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.210
Most simply, conditional wait variables allow you to take one thread

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.180
off the scheduling que until there is a signal from another

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.090
thread, that it should be put back on. This is useful

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.810
if we don't want one thread to continue it's work until

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.160
the work of another thread is finished. To give an example,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.760
let's oppose that we have a thread A over here, and

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.890
a thread B over here. Thread B wants to stop until

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.710
thread A's work is done. Now to use a conditional weight variable,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.910
we need three things. A variable indicating whether the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.350
work is done, or some other condition that can be

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.050
tested in memory. A lock that we can apply to

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.680
this variable... And a special conditional wait variable. Now after

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.160
finishing the work, thread A is going to acquire the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.160
lock, change is_done to true and then send a signal

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.330
to anyone waiting on this condition, a signal that they

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.790
should wake up, and then he'll unlock the lock. Thread

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.730
B, for his part, will first acquire the lock, and

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.750
then check if the work is done. If it isn't,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.760
he will wait. Now, it's important that this cond-wait not

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.870
only makes thread B wait, but it also unlocks a mutex.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.340
This will allow thread A to acquire the lock and

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.570
eventually send the signal. The call blocks until the signal

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.650
is received and thread B acquires the lock again. Hence

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.140
the need to unlock it at the end of the code.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.390
At first this might seem unnecessarily complicated. Why do we need

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.040
this if statement, before the cond_wait procedure call, for instance? Well,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.690
if it weren't there, then it's possible that the signal will

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.590
have already come, and we would never see it. So it's important

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.090
to check that there's something to wait for, before you actually

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.310
wait. Given that there is such a condition to check We better

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.110
also have a lock for it. Otherwise we might decide that

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.280
we need to wait. But before we actually execute the wait function,

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.395
the signal might come. And of course, the

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:46.460
cond-wait method had better unlock the mutex. Otherwise

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.870
thread A would never be able to acquire

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.510
and change the condition that we're waiting on.
