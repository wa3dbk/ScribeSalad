00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In this problem, we're given a new data structure that is a list of universities

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
where each entry is another list that contains the name of the university,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the number of students that attend that university, and the tuition costs.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
What we want to calculate are the total number of students enrolled at all universities in this list

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and the amount of money that all of them are paying.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What we're going to do is sum the number of students, so we're going to keep track

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
of all the students and keep adding for each university the second value on the list.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Then we're also going to keep a second counter

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that is the amount of tuition that they're paying, and so what we're going to do for each entry

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
is we're going to multiply these two values and add those.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We're going to have 50 times 2, which is 100, and 100 times 1, which is also 100.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The end result would be the tuition is 200, and the number of students enrolled in 150.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This is what we'll return--both those values.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Let's write the function that does that.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I've declared the function. It takes in a list, and I've started my 2 sums--

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
the number of students enrolled and the total tuition all the students are paying.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I've added a little trick here to make the code a little shorter.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This is a Python thing that you probably didn't know, but feel free to use it in the future.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
What I'm saying is that for each value in the list, I have the name,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
which is going to correspond to the first entry in the sublist,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
the students correspond to the second entry in the sublist,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and price corresponds to the third entry in the sublist.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
If I had the other version where I just say for i in p

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and then assign the variables names, that's all we're doing here.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It's just a little short cut to save you this time of writing the 3 lines to write this out.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Here for each school I update the number of students by simply

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
adding the number of students to the total count.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I update the total tuition by simply adding

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
the amount the students are paying at this particular university to the total tuition.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Then in the end I return both values, which you can do by simply adding the comma.
