00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.560
So, the process from an MVP to
getting funded is really depending on

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.752
many factors, perhaps the main
one being the domain you're at.

00:00:07.752 --> 00:00:13.140
So there some domains, like security for
example, that may be an MVP,

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.620
plus an early pilot would be
enough to get seed funding.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.310
There some domains,
perhaps a mobile application,

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.120
that more often than not requires
more than just a basic MVP, but

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.920
actually some proof in the market that
this can be something interesting.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.150
Clearly, there's no rules,
and no right or wrong, but

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.030
it really does depend on the domain
you're at, but once you're ready,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.360
it's about having everything
you need in order to fundraise.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.330
You need to show that you have
some plan of what you want to

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.070
do with the market or what you want to
do with the money when you fundraise.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.290
You have the team, and
the MVP is a good indicator that,

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.520
you know what, maybe it's
interesting what you've built.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.940
And this MVP shows not only your
ability as a team to execute, but

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.930
the market is receptive
to what you have built.
