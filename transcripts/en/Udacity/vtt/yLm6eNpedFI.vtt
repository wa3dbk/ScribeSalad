00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.770
With respect to the three other blackboard qualities, performance,

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.580
because there's a lack of well-defined control flow, may lead to redundant and

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.070
administrative behavior.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.980
For example, the polling of a repository.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.520
Maintainability is enhanced because having independent com,

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.430
components can lead to in, increased flexibility.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.330
But if we make changes to the common control paradigm wherein the blackboard

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.010
components are updating the repository, or if we change the repository's data

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.020
format, this can have pervasive negative effects on maintainability.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.180
As far as safety is concerned, because the blackboard is a common repository

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.870
accessible to all the components, if you somehow get bad data un, that

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.560
might lead to a safety problem, this can easily spread to the other components.
