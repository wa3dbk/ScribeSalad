00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.090
Clients and servers can be most
simply understood as computers

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.900
communicating across the Internet.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.750
We define the client as the computer
that wants information, and the server

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.160
as the computer that has information
that can be shared with clients.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.600
This means that a client has to initiate
communication to request information,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.690
while the server constantly stays
listening for any clients to communicate

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.130
with it, and responds with the data
that the client requested.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.190
Let's briefly discuss some of the
important concepts in order to better

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.500
understand how this actually happens.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.540
So we know that clients and servers
can communicate with each other, but

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.880
how do we know that they're all
speaking the same language?

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.660
Well, protocols are like the grammatical
rules that we use to make sure all

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.700
machines on the Internet
are communicating in the same way.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.720
There are several protocols that
computers on the Internet adhere to.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.390
The most common three
are the Transmission Protocol, or TCP,

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.780
the Internet Protocol, IP, and
the HyperText Transfer Protocol or HTTP.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.410
The Transmission Control Protocol or
TCP enables information

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.100
to be broken into small packets and
sent between clients and servers.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.570
If a packet is lost somewhere along the
way the sender and receiver have a way

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.842
of figuring out which of the packets is
missing and request that they be resent.

00:01:07.842 --> 00:01:12.690
The counterpart to TCP is UDP, User
Datagram Protocol, which is good for

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.140
streaming content like music or video.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.220
Similar to postal addresses, IP
addresses allow messages to be properly

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.310
routed to all participants
on the Internet.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.540
For simplicity's sake, we can assume
that every device on the Internet gets

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.520
an IP address that is
either statically or

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.480
dynamically assigned by
the Internet service provider.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.600
Here's the IP address of my laptop,
and here is the IP address for Google.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.380
When I type google.com into my browser,
my computer first figures out the IP

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.120
address of Google by looking it up
in a Domain Name Server, or DNS.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.510
Think of DNS as a big online phonebook
that finds theIP address of web URLs.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.410
Once DNS gives my computer the IP
address, it uses that address to

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.530
initiate communication with
the server for Google.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.030
Since multiple applications using
the Internet can run on one machine,

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.280
operating systems use ports to
designate channels of communication

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.880
on the same IP address.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.590
Placing a colon after an IP address,
with another number indicates that we

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.200
want to communicate on a specific port
on the device using that IP address.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.609
On most machines,
port numbers can range from 0 to 65,536.

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:20.641
The first 10,000 ports are often times
reserved by the operating system for

00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:22.050
a specific use.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.640
Port 80 is the most common port for
web servers.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.780
So most websites we use every day
are hitting port 80 when they

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.370
reach a server.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.090
8080 is also a common port for
web communications.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.170
When client and server applications
are on the same machine

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.800
we indicate this with
the term localhost.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.629
Localhost also has a special
IP address of 127.0.0.1.

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.195
Whenever we type localhost, or this
special IP address into a browser or

00:02:47.195 --> 00:02:50.000
web application,
the operating system knows to look for

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.640
this resource locally and
not go out to the Internet.
