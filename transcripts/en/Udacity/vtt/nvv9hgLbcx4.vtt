00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.812
Try simplifying these expressions. Write your answer as a fraction in this box

00:00:04.812 --> 00:00:09.448
and if your answer is something like 2 squared over 3 squared, I want you to

00:00:09.448 --> 00:00:14.612
evaluate the number. You would want to write your answer as 4 9ths, because 2

00:00:14.612 --> 00:00:16.740
squared is 4 and 3 squared is 9.
