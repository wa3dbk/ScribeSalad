00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
It's been awhile since we last met Alice. It was working on vertex cover.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.310
And actually, the last time we left off, Alice wasn't happy like that.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.410
Actually, Alice was quite unhappy because we proved vertex cover to be NP complete.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.730
The last time we left off, there was little hope for her to ever solve

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.790
her vertex cover problem that she was working on.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.630
Now, I promised to show you an intelligent algorithm for vertex cover.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.870
At least one that's more intelligent than brute force.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.480
But in order to do that, let's first start out with a brute force algorithm.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.570
Let's say Alice is running her algorithm on a very simple graph like this.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.670
Just four vertices and five edges.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.480
What her simple algorithm or brute force algorithm was doing was it was considering

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.320
all possible assignments of 0 and 1 to the vertices.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.830
For four vertices, we had a total of 16 possibilities that her algorithm needed to look at.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.970
Her algorithm starts out, for example, by saying,

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.560
"Oh, let's put no vertices into the vertex cover."

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.310
And of course this leaves all edges uncovered so it's not even a valid solution.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.959
Then, it would maybe start out by saying, "Oh, let's put one vertex into the vertex cover."

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:09.650
There's actually four different ways of doing this and at least this time we have some edges covered.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.780
None of these solutions is the valid solution because we still have uncovered edges

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.450
and I've drawn a red here so you can better see them.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.540
No valid solution for any of those.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.030
The algorithm continues and says, "Oh then, let's put two vertices into the vertex cover."

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.850
Finally, the algorithm has found a valid vertex cover for our small network

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.920
but of course it has also found many, many vertex covers that are actually invalid

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.270
because not all edges are covered so again redundant, redundant, redundant.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.890
And all the algorithm proceeds and although it has already found a solution where

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.890
two vertices are enough for the vertex cover, it now puts three vertices into the vertex cover

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.940
which has the advantage that it will always find a valid vertex cover but the disadvantage that

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.500
it's totally redundant and unnecessary work.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.400
Same thing if you put all four into the vertex cover. Valid solutions but not the best possible ones.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.810
This is what your brute force algorithm is doing and you can see why brute force is so stupid

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.949
because first of all it considers many solutions where you could have immediately said,

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:15.940
"Look, this is not valid." You've taken an edge and none of the two end points is in the vertex cover.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.070
Why even consider all the other possibilities?

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.150
As soon as you have an edge that is not covered, you can basically scrap that solution

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.150
and go looking for another one and the other thing that her algorithm did that wasn't very smart was

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.190
once it had found a solution with two vertices it still tried all the solutions

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.360
with three vertices and four vertices.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.190
It could've stopped right here because it knew that it would not be able to find

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.120
any vertex cover that is smaller.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.880
And that is the difference between brute force and intelligent force.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.670
In brute force, we go through all of the possible assignments of the vertices into the vertex cover

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.260
out of the vertex cover whereas what we're now going to do is we're going to avoid stupid choices.

00:02:52.260 --> 99:59:59.000
And that is the basis for intelligent force.
