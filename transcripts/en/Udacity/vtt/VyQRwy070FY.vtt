00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.320
To provide access to this function via dot notation on Amy and

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.000
Ben we'll add a move property to each car as it's being built.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.620
But notice the function that we're adding there is no longer being used in

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.170
such a way that it takes a first argument.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.180
Instead we will see that the target object is going to

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.710
appear on the left of the dot when the function is invoked.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.070
Luckily, JavaScript supports the automatically bound parameter this.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.930
Which will refer to the object on the left of the call time dot.
