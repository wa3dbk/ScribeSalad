We often use extrinsic rewards not only in the workplace, but also in our daily

00:00:03.775 --> 00:00:08.646
life. We see that extrinsic rewards can be used outside of the workplace as

00:00:08.646 --> 00:00:12.416
well, for example, we can use extrinsic rewards to get children to brush their

00:00:12.416 --> 00:00:18.046
teeth, do their homework, or even make their bed. This is no different than

00:00:18.046 --> 00:00:22.990
employers using rewards to increase worker productivity as well as accuracy.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.565
Although extrinsic rewards have been shown to be effective in the workplace,

00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:30.085
there are some circumstances where extrinsic rewards can have the opposite

00:00:30.085 --> 00:00:35.050
effect. How does this work? Let's say that you enjoy cooking, and you do so

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.854
often. You're always trying out new recipes. If your mom starts to pay you for

00:00:39.854 --> 00:00:45.010
cooking, it turns out that you may start to cook in order to get paid. Rather

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.850
than for pleasure. So what was once intrinsic enjoyment, your cooking, is no

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.510
longer so because it has been rewarded by an external source, which is money.
