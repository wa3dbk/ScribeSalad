00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.990
So now we come back to our original parallel program and the parallel program is

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.710
making normal data accesses and synchronization accesses.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.315
There are different threads running on all these

00:00:11.315 --> 00:00:13.820
processors. They're all making these normal data

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.630
accesses and synchronization accesses. And if the underlying

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.990
memory model is an RC memory model, it

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.810
distinguishes between normal data accesses and synchronization accesses.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.660
And it knows that if there are normal read/write data accesses, it doesn't have

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.880
to do anything in terms of blocking

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.970
the processes. It may start initiating coherence actions

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.070
corresponding to these data accesses, but it

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.100
won't block the processor for coherence actions

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.410
to be complete until it encounters a

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.770
synchronization operation, which is of the release category.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.090
If a synchronization operation which is a release

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.959
operation hits this RC memory model, it's going

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:59.350
to say, ah-ha. In that case all the

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.880
data accesses that I've seen from this guy, I

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.300
want to make sure that they're all complete

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.650
globally, communicated to all the processors. It's going to

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.095
ensure that before allowing the synchronization operation to

00:01:12.095 --> 00:01:15.783
complete. So the coherence action is only when the

00:01:15.783 --> 00:01:17.120
lock is released.
