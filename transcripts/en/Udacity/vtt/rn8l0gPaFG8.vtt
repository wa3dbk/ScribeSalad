Okay. Welcome to Unit 5 Office Hours. We had a lot of great questions in the forums.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Before we get into those, I think you wanted to mention something about memcache that you--

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
eah. &gt;&gt;--you were worried you weren't too clear on.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Sure. Yeah. Somebody asked me a question I received this morning that made me think.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
There's a 10-second piece of advice I can give you that'll make the homework or Unit 6

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
actually a lot easier, which you should be working on right about now.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We're using memcache basically to store strings and integers.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
In your code you can say something like memcache.set.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I realized as I was writing this stuff I'm trying not to speak while I'm writing so they can edit it.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
But anyway, you can say memcache.set and then you give it a key.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It'll just be a string. It's always a string. That's the memcache protocol.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And in the memcache protocol it says the value has to be a string as well.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
However, we're using this library--this Python memcache library that Google provides

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and most Python memcache libraries have the same behavior which is

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
you can put just about anything as the value.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The value can be another string. It can also be just an integer.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Or it can even be a Python data structure.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
You can give it a little dictionary.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
What might be useful in the homework you'll find

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
would be a tuple with maybe a time stamp and another string.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Something like that perhaps. We'll see.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
But you can store this value and then when you get the value back out of memcache

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
the library will take the encoded string and convert it back into your Python data structure.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So as long as there are simple things in here and by simple things I basically mean lists, dictionaries,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
primitive data types, you can get away with some objects but they have to be picklable.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
That's the Python library they're using called "pickle," which converts a Python object into a string.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Most simple objects will work as well.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Everything we do in this class should be memcacheable without any trouble.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Data for entities can be memcached with no trouble, so you can actually store whatever you like.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So that should help with the homework.
