00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.910
And the answer to that is that we only need to install 2 devices--

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.310
one up here and one down here.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.070
This one up here covers those 3 cables,

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.000
and this one down here covers these 3 here, so this one is covered twice.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.680
But we need at least 2 devices to cover the whole network and actually,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.130
in this case, this is the only possible solution for this.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.180
But of course, a computer can't just see that 2 devices suffice.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.920
So Alice's algorithm 'trying all possibilities' would have to go through

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.005
all of the possibilities that you could have of installing a device

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:38.940
at a certain communication point or not installing one.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.750
So, in this case here, that would be 16 different possibilities

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.120
if we give the communication points little letters here

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.160
so we can better distinguish them.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.360
So Alice's algorithm 'trying all possibilities' would have to consider

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.750
installing no device at all, which would of course not be a valid solution.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.610
It could try installing just a device at 'A' which, again, would not be a valid solution,

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.920
and so on.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.430
And of course the algorithm would also find solutions that are valid

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.050
but would use more than the minimum number of monitoring devices

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.470
that are actually needed.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.170
But since the algorithm tries all possibilities, it will also find this solution here

00:01:21.170 --> 99:59:59.000
using just 2 devices.
