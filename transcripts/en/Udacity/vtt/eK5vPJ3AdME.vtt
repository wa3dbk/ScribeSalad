00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.020
Memory is a precious resource. You don't

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.670
want to waste it. You want protection for the

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.590
virtual machines from one another. But at the

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.560
same time if there's an opportunity to share

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.630
memory so that the available physical resource can

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.090
be maximally utilized you want to be able

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.480
to do that. So the question is can

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.980
we share memory across virtual machines without affecting

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.820
the integrity of these machines? Because protection

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.960
is important, but without affecting the protection, can

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.980
we actually enhance the utility of the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.340
available physical memory in the hyperviser? And the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.740
answer is yes, think about it. You may have one instance of Linux contained in a

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:51.330
virtual machine, maybe hosted by me. And maybe you have the same Linux hosted in

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.970
another virtual machine, virtual machine number two. And in

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.310
both of our virtual machines, the memory footprint of the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.130
operating system is exactly the same. And even the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.540
applications that run on it are going to be exactly

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.650
the same, in terms of the contents. Because of

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.440
the same operating system, it is just that we have

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.297
two different instances. And let's say that we have Firefox

00:01:12.297 --> 00:01:16.364
running on this VM, and similarly this Firefox running on

00:01:16.364 --> 00:01:21.530
this VM. This copy of Linux is going to have a page table, unique for this

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.850
particular Firefox instance. Similarly, this instance of Linux

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.570
is going to have a piece-table deal structure unique

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.330
for this instance of Firefox and if all

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.370
things are equal, in terms of versions and so

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.280
on, then a particular virtual page of, the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.460
Firefox instance running here and the Firefox instance running

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.530
here is going to have the same content, whether we are talking about this VM or

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.660
this VM. And so there is an opportunity

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.390
to make both of those page table entires to

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.260
point to the same machine page. If we

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.020
can do that, then we are avoiding duplication. We're

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.824
not comprimising safety, but we're avoiding duplication. This

00:02:02.824 --> 00:02:06.610
is particularly true for the core pages. The core

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.560
pages are immutable. So, the core pages for this Firefox instance and this

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.210
Firefox instance could actually share the same

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.650
page in physical memory. And if it

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.560
does that you're using the resources taht much more effectively in a virtualized

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.940
setting. One way of doing the sharing is by a cooperation between the virtual

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.784
machines and the hypervisor. In other words the

00:02:34.784 --> 00:02:38.200
guest OS has hooks that allows the hypervisor to

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.860
mark pages, copy on write, and have the

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.310
PPNs point to exactly the same machine page. And

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.772
this way if a page is going to be

00:02:48.772 --> 00:02:51.690
written into by the operating system, it'll result in

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.640
a fault and we can make a copy of the page that is currently being shared across

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.150
two different virtual machines. That is one way of doing it. That is, with the

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.800
cooperation between the hypervisor, and the virtual machines.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.890
So that we can, with their connivance, share machine pages

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.720
across virtual machines, but mark the entries in the individual

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.000
page tables as copy on write, meaning that, so long as

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.950
they reach here, perfectly fine. The minute any one of these

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.250
guys wants to write into a particular page, at that point, you

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.660
make a copy of it and make these two instances point

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.950
to different machine pages, so that is one way of doing it.
