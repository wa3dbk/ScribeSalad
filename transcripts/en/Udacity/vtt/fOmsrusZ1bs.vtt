00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.819
So what'd you think?

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:03.620
I thought that was
a really cute algorithm.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.715
And if you know anything about binomial
heats, which a lot of data structures

00:00:07.715 --> 00:00:11.940
101 classes cover, then you might of
recognized the basic idea right away.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.260
And if not,
you now have a new trick for your bag.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.058
The original paper on this
approach is a very nice read.

00:00:18.058 --> 00:00:19.780
So I'd also encourage you
to take a look at that.
