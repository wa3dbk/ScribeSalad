00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So, at this point we have seen that writing perfect assertions that cover all bugs would be pretty hard,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
but this shouldn't keep us from writing assertion that catch as many bugs as possible,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and this is particularly useful in debugging.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Since assertions are automated, they can check

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
several executions of a function at once--actually all executions.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
However, they can also check large portions of data at the same time and all automated.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
What do I mean by large portions of data? Let me illustrate this by an example.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Let's assume we want to implement a time class.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
A time that consists of hours, minutes, and seconds and we want to use assertions

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
to automatically check whether a time object is consistent.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
That is whether the hours are in the right range, minutes are in the right range,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and seconds are also in the right range.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Here is our time class--we start with an initializer or a constructor that takes

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
three arguments: the hour, the minute, and the seconds,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
with default values of 0 for each and we assign these to individual attributes

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
named hours, minutes, and seconds within a time object.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Here's a number of inspector method that gives us access to the internal attributes--

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
hours, minutes, and seconds.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
After adding inspector methods that gives us the hours, the minutes, and the seconds,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
we now need a way to print out the time object.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
For this, Python provides a special method. It is called the repr for representation method,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
the internal method with two underscores before and after and what this thing does is

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
this method is called whenever an object of the particular class is to be printed,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and this returns a string representation of the object.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So what does it do, we're using the string format method here, which takes a number of arguments,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and formats each of these arguments given to the format specification written here in that string.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So for instance :2d prints the numerical argument here with two digits--

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
self minutes also comes in two digits, self seconds also comes in two digits.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
This format is not perfect yet.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
We actually want leading zeros in here

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and we want hours, minutes, and seconds separated by colons.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
So here's a string, first the hours two digits leading zero, then the minutes two digits leading zero,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and then the seconds two digits leading zero.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Let's try out how this works

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I'm initializing a time object here 13 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
We're using a 24-hour clock here and I'm printing this out.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
In printing this out should now invoke this repr method, which would automatically

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
provide a nice string representation of our time.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Let's run this whole thing and we get nice representation

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
13 hours, 0 minutes, and 0 seconds, 1 pm in the afternoon.
