00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.580
We keep using this word responsiveness, but what are we actually talking about?

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.541
People use many different devices to access the Internet.

00:00:07.541 --> 00:00:11.628
Everything from large desktops, to laptops, netbooks, or

00:00:11.628 --> 00:00:13.900
maybe even tablet's or phones.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.320
In fact, more and more people every year are accessing the Internet

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.000
primarily through their phones or through their tablet's.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.690
In fact right now, there's a pretty good chance that you're watching this

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.670
video on your phone or tablet.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.770
And every one of these devices uses a different size screen to show you

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:29.940
the same content.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.000
But what do we mean by different size?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.320
Of course, we're not talking about the physical size of the screen,

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.310
the height and width of it.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.000
We're talking about its resolution.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.890
Specifically, we want to talk about the resolution of the screen in pixels.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.233
Today, we commonly see desktop screens with widths of say, 1,440 pixels or

00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:49.314
1,920 pixels.

00:00:49.314 --> 00:00:54.020
Some large screens today are even going as large as 2,560 pixels wide.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.860
But not too long ago,

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.990
people were using screens that were only 1024 pixels wide or 1200 pixels wide.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.490
For screens like these, it was common to set max widths of

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.820
960 pixels meaning that web sites were only 960 pixels wide.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.020
The reason it wasn't the full 1024 or

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.890
1200 was to actually leave room on the side of the screen for scroll bars.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.166
To this day creating content with the width of 960 pixels is

00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.740
still pretty common.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.770
On larger screens of 1920 pixels or 1440 pixels, you can

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.720
simply center the 960 pixels wide content to make sure it still looks good.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.650
This max-width CSS style allows us to

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.840
insure that our content won't be any bigger than 960 pixels or

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.690
whatever value we choose regardless of the size screen that we're using.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.400
Following the principles of responsive design means that

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.450
your website isn't fixed with single size.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.560
It doesn't matter the type of device.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.210
The page is going to respond and

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.050
resize correctly to make sure everything looks great and is legible.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.280
It's also important to note that for devices like tablet's and

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.200
phones users are using their thumbs, not a mouse, to manipulate the page.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.220
Which means that you may need to change your layout a bit further to make it

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.590
easier to use.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.660
This is called adaptive design.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.220
For now though, we're simply going to focus on responsiveness,

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.820
which means simply changing the size of the page to fit.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.570
Let's use the Reddit homepage to see an example of responsive design.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.910
Pay attention to his left column containing all of the posts on the homepage.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.660
I'll resize the screen and we can see that the posts on

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.220
the left side got smaller as we made the browser window smaller.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.950
These posts are responsive.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.700
They're changing their width based on the width of the browser.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.940
And note that the column on the right wasn't responsive.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.310
The width here is the same as the width when the browser is full screen.
