00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.170
So, we've gotten a lot of feedback
now from a couple of different users.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.050
Next, we need to figure out if
the prototype did well or poorly.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.560
Remember, we don't need to
have users love our app

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.570
design as a whole at this point.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.830
We are working with a low fidelity
prototype, so our goal is simply to get

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.110
a sense of whether the story
of the app makes sense.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.020
Could users go through and
actually make sense of the app?

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.930
Could they do the things
we wanted them to?

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.728
When considering whether the prototype
got us the information we needed,

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:31.040
we need to look at whether we have
answers to all the critical questions

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.560
around our app's story.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.710
Questions about how to fix flaws in
our app, after we have found them,

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.820
may also become critical.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.490
The only way to find this out is to look
at the feedback we got from our users.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.070
Here I have the notes I took from
the conversation with Hugh and

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.860
Poornima about this, and it looks like
we got pretty solid feedback on that.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.430
Both of them jumped straight to
the floating action button, and

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.420
were certain that it
did the right thing.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.530
We can call that part
of our app a success.
