00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Here's what I did. I introduced two global variables--the previous hand and previous results.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I am making a cache, like a memoization cache, but it's only for one hand,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
because we're only dealing with one hand at a time.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Then I say, we then find_prefixes if the hand that you were given is equal

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to the previous hand, then return the previous results.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm only going to update the previous hand and the previous results

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in the case where the prefix is the empty string.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And that's how I know I'm at the top level call when the prefix is the empty string.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
For all the recursive calls, the prefix will be something else.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I'm only storing away the results when I'm at the top level call

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and I'm updating previous hand and previous results.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
With that, efficiency improvement to find prefixes, now when I do timedcalls

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
of row plays for this fairly complex row, it's only about a thousandth of a second.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
If I had a complete board that was similarly complex and say fifteen rows or so in the board,

00:00:58.000 --> 09:59:59.000
then it'd still be around one or two hundredths of a second and that's pretty good performance.
