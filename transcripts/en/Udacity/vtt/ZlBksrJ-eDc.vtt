00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.660
The variable we used to refer
to Rebecca's address we titled

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.550
RebeccasAddress with a capital R and
capital A.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.780
So this is the same variable that we
used to update the address here and

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.810
the ZIP code here.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.910
So that's what we need to add
to the session and then commit.
