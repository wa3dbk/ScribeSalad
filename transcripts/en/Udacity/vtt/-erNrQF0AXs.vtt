It's the activation of the sympathetic nervous system that allows us to flee or

00:00:04.424 --> 00:00:09.036
fight in dangerous situations. Here's a real example I like to share with my

00:00:09.036 --> 00:00:13.360
students. I had completed almost a 13 hour hike to the top of Half Dome at

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.546
Yosemite National Park. I was exhausted, my knees hurt, I was so tired. I

00:00:19.546 --> 00:00:24.750
didn't think I could make it down. When all of a sudden, somebody yelled, bear.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.099
Sure enough my sympathetic nervous system became activated. I was able to run

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.060
almost the entire way down the remainder of the mountain, one mile. That is a

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.080
great example of fleeing or fighting and activation of the sympathetic nervous

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.469
system.
