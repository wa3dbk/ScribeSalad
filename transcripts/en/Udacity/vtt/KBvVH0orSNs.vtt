00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.140
Okay. Well, in this case we're really just picking whether or not the thread is even or odd.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.212
Each warp will have some even threads and some odd threads, so it's a total slowdown of 2.

00:00:07.212 --> 00:00:09.965
Here we're doing an integer divide, okay?

00:00:09.965 --> 00:00:15.052
So threads 0 through 31, when divided by 32, will return case 0,

00:00:15.052 --> 00:00:21.431
and threads 32 through 63 will return this expression, will evaluate to 1.

00:00:21.431 --> 00:00:25.677
They'll evaluate case 1 and so forth. So, here we're getting no slowdown at all.

00:00:25.677 --> 00:00:30.745
All the threads in a 32-thread warp will still end up taking the same case.

00:00:30.745 --> 00:00:33.446
And finally, threadIdx.x/8.

00:00:33.446 --> 00:00:38.388
So now there will be 4 different distinct values

00:00:38.388 --> 00:00:41.703
that this expression evaluates to for the threads in a warp.

00:00:41.703 --> 00:00:46.954
And so we'll end up evaluating cases 0, 1, 2, and 3 in the 1st warp,

00:00:46.954 --> 00:00:51.128
4, 5, 6, 7 in the 2nd warp, and so forth.

00:00:51.128 --> 00:00:53.365
So this time we'll take a 4x slowdown.
