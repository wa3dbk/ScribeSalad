00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.381
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; These three equations all graph parabolas. Even though they might not quite

00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:08.752
look like it right now. With a little bit of rearranging though, all of these

00:00:08.752 --> 00:00:13.233
can be put into that general form for the equation of a parabola. Which you'll

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:17.695
remember, is y equals a x squared plus b x plus c, where a is not equal to zero.

00:00:17.696 --> 00:00:22.012
Now this first equation, 3 x squared plus 3 x minus 7 equals zero, does not

00:00:22.012 --> 00:00:26.617
contain a y variable. The only variable it has is x. So this is just an equation

00:00:26.617 --> 00:00:30.962
that we can solve for x. But it's not something that we can plot. There's no

00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:35.373
information here about y that would let us graph on a coordinate plane. Or at

00:00:35.373 --> 00:00:39.954
least, not on the kind of coordinate plane that we've been interested in. With

00:00:39.954 --> 00:00:44.504
two variables. This equation actually already is in standard form. The y just

00:00:44.504 --> 00:00:49.257
happens to be on the right side, and the other expression on the left side. But

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:53.988
you can see that A, equals negative 1. B, the second coefficient is 5, and C is

00:00:53.988 --> 00:00:58.676
negative 6. This one is also in standard form. We have A equals 1, B equals 0,

00:00:58.676 --> 00:01:03.359
and C equals 1. However, the only requirement we have, about general form Was

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.347
that a couldn't be 0. Either of the other two constants can be and will still

00:01:07.347 --> 00:01:11.273
get a parabola, I'll show you the graphs for all of these in a second. But first

00:01:11.273 --> 00:01:15.173
let's look at this last equation briefly. The only thing that is preventing it

00:01:15.173 --> 00:01:18.886
from being in this general form is the negative sign in front of the y. If we

00:01:18.886 --> 00:01:22.666
just multiplied both sides of the equation, by negative 1 and rearrange the

00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:26.326
terms on the right hand side, we end up with an equation of a parabola in the

00:01:26.326 --> 00:01:31.425
form of. We can recognize. Y equals X squared minus 2X plus 1. Now let's pick up

00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:36.230
these graphs. This third parabola down here is produced by tehe equation y

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.387
equals negative x squared plus 5X minus 6. This purple corresponds to Y equals X

00:01:41.387 --> 00:01:45.947
squared plus one. And the orangeish yellow one of y equals x squared minus 2x

00:01:45.947 --> 00:01:49.962
plus 1. Now just take a second here and think about what's different about these

00:01:49.962 --> 00:01:54.070
graphs and what's different about their equations. Just form some ideas in your

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.997
head and keep them in mind for later. We'll keep revisiting a lot of different

00:01:57.997 --> 00:02:01.737
kinds of parabolas. And of course the differences in their equations that

00:02:01.737 --> 00:02:02.460
produce them.
