00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
Let's see what the "Take 2" algorithm would do if it's given this graph here.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.270
The algorithm of course doesn't know the minimum vertex cover,

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.190
but I'd keep those vertices marked here to help you answer the next quiz.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.750
What I would like you to think about is, how many vertices from the minimum vertex cover,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.340
does the "Take 2" algorithm put into its solution in each loop?

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.190
By loop I mean this part here.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.630
So each time that this part here is run, how many vertices that the "Take 2" algorithm

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.810
puts into the vertex cover actually belong to the minimum vertex cover?

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.990
I'm going to give you 5 choices for this.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.940
Is it something that we can't make a general statement about?

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.740
Is it at least 1? Is it at most 1?

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.970
Is it exactly 1? Or is it exactly 2?

00:00:47.970 --> 99:59:59.000
Please select the correct answer here.
