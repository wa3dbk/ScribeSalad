00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.480
So let's take a look at the code for

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.290
getting the profile out of the data store. So

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.730
here's the getProfile method. Throws an exception if the

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.080
user is not authorized. We get the key, get the

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.219
user ID to use as the ID for the key. We create the key, and then we get the

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.380
profile. Now ofy.load returns an object. So, in this

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.950
case, we want it to be kind profile, class profile.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.480
So, we have to cast it as a profile
