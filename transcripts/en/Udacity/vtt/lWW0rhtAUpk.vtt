00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.825
This new refactoring called inline class is the reverse of the extract class

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:06.700
refactoring. And know that this is kind of a general situation in the

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.500
sense that it is often the case that the refactoring also has a

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.480
reverse refactoring that does exactly the

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.202
opposite. So basically, un-dos, in a sense,

00:00:13.202 --> 00:00:16.830
the operation of the other refactoring. In this case, the motivation for the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.760
refactoring is that during system evolution, we might end up with one or

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.530
more classes that do not do much. In this case what you want

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.350
to do is to take the class that is not doing that much and

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.740
move its features into another class. And then delete the original class.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.010
So let's use an example similar to the one we've used for

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.000
the previous refactoring to illustrate how this works. Here we have in

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.750
this case, two classes, person and office. And the person class is

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.720
using the office class, but this latter class, the office class, only

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.000
contains a phone number. So it doesn't really do that much. What

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.020
we can do is therefore to fold the office class into the

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.470
person class, by simply moving its only field into the class. And so

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.260
the result will be this person class that also contains the information

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.600
about the office number, and overall a simpler design for the code.
