And with that,
we're already at the end of lesson one.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.520
I encourage you to not just stick with
the plugins and commands that we just

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.060

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.860
&gt;&gt; Take your time and

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.110
try out lots of plugins from
the package control website.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.840
Or see how Sublime feels with
codes you have already written.
