00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.690
Here's the answer.

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.870
The process of filling out
the table was rather mechanical, so

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:05.850
I won't walk through that step.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.650
We end up with a cost of 3.5, so
that must have come from this neighbor,

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.960
here, which also has a value of 3.5.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.520
Diagonal steps like this correspond
to matching the two letters.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.860
So we write down that alignment here.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.790
Next we have 3.5, which could've come
from either these two neighbors here.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.400
Let's choose this one for now,
that corresponds to leaving w unmatched.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.850
So we'll write that
down in our alignment.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.163
Next we have a cost of 2.5,

00:00:37.163 --> 00:00:42.380
which must have come from this north
west neighbor here, who has a cost one

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.380
and that corresponds to matching these
two characters together o and n.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.950
Then we have a cost one which must have
come from this north west neighbor so

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.040
these ends get matched.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.000
Again we have a cost of one and

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.120
since u doesn't match s this must
have come from the west neighbor.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.530
Meaning that u is left unmatched and
we can write that down like so.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.020
And, lastly,
the s's must be matched together.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.810
Often there will be more than
one path through the grid.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.920
In this example there was some
ambiguity at this step here.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.728
Instead of skipping w,
I could have matched it with n and

00:01:20.728 --> 00:01:23.492
then we could have left the o unmatched.

00:01:23.492 --> 00:01:26.654
And that would of left us with
this alignment here which

00:01:26.654 --> 00:01:28.240
has the same minimum cost.
