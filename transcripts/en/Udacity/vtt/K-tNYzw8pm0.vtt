00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.819
What we're doing is compacting the items that have a 0 as the least significant bit.

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.187
So if you recall, when we compact what we need to do is have a predicate

00:00:09.187 --> 00:00:14.015
that are going to tell us which of these input elements to keep.

00:00:14.015 --> 00:00:17.227
So if we call each of these elements an unsigned integer

00:00:17.227 --> 00:00:19.565
and that unsigned integer is named i,

00:00:19.565 --> 00:00:25.336
what is the predicate on each one of these integers that is going to allow us to return true

00:00:25.336 --> 00:00:27.942
only for this set of integers?

00:00:27.942 --> 00:00:32.011
So write this in this box in the C programming language, please.
