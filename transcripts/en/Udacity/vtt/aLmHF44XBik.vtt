00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.576
We just found the last two zeroes of our function, f of x. They are 3 plus 2i

00:00:04.576 --> 00:00:09.228
and 3 minus 2i. To at long last get our function in fully factored form, we

00:00:09.228 --> 00:00:13.920
just need to figure out what linear factors correspond to these two zeroes.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.484
Please write 1 in each of these boxes.
