00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.650
Welcome back.

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.240
We've just finished taking in user
feedback on our low fidelity prototype,

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.920
and we've made the decision to move
on to a medium fidelity prototype.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.140
&gt;&gt; Now that we've made that decision
it's time to learn about medium fidelity

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.600
prototypes, interactivity,
and what tools are available.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.560
&gt;&gt; To do that we brought in Jonathan,
an expert on interactive prototypes.
