00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.520
Numpy also comes with bunch of
handy functions to generate arrays

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.160
filled with random values.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.040
These functions are defined
in numpy's random module.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.810
The random function
generates uniformly sampled

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:19.380
floating point values between 0 and
1, with 0 inclusive and 1 exclusive.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.240
More formally,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.805
we can say that it generates values in
the half open interval 0.0 and 1.0.

00:00:25.805 --> 00:00:28.370
Let's go ahead and print this.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.240
Here is the generated array with
five rows and four columns.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.480
Note that we pass the array
shape as a tupple.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.410
A slightly radiant of this function
is rand which randomly accepts

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.960
a sequence of numbers as arguments and
straight of the tuple.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.990
It is otherwise equal valid.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.170
Observe that, we directly pass
the values of the rows and

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.950
columns through the function and
did not define a tuple.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.530
Here it is the area with same shape
as before five rows and four columns.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.820
Numpy provides this to achieve
a greater compatibility

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.830
with the more established
math lab syntax.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.300
We highly recommend using a more
consistent num pi function

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.899
that explicitly accepts a shape tuple.

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:15.140
Now both the function, rand and
random, sample, uniformly,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.790
from the rain 0 and 1.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.538
What if you wanted a sample
from a different distribution?

00:01:19.538 --> 00:01:25.010
To sample, or normal distribution,
we can use the normal function.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.820
Recall the normal function
from numpy dot random and

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.670
pass the shape of the array required.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.290
Let's run this.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.850
The core produced a 2 into 3 array

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.550
of random numbers with
a standard normal distribution.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.260
That is 0 mean, and
unit standard deviation.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.570
You can change the mean and
the standard deviation as well.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.530
Let's see how to do that.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.090
We change the mean to 50 and
standard deviation to 10.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.330
Now, let's see the output.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.960
Notice that the values
are centered around 50.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.540
To generate integers,

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.230
we can use the randint function
in one of the several ways.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.419
Passing to values 0 and
10 will not divide randint to generate

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.650
a single integer between the range 0 and
10.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.280
We can also specify randint how many
integers we want between between 0 and

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.320
10 by specifying the size attribute and
giving it a value.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.510
So, this statement
will give us a 1d array

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.610
of 5 integers between the range 0 and
10.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.330
Going forward with that, we can pass
a tuple value to the attribute size,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.130
which will create a 2d array with all
the values between the range 0 and 10.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.140
Now, let's see the output.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.790
These are the single random integers
between the range 0 and 10.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.990
Next, we created a 1d
array with five values.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.830
Note that,
we mentioned the number of values needed

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.808
in the one dimensional array
with the parameter size.

00:02:53.808 --> 00:02:58.630
Passing a tuple to the size
parameter gave us the 2d values.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.690
And also note that all the values
of the array are between 0 and 10.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.840
Check out the random sampling
routines on the numpy website for

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.700
