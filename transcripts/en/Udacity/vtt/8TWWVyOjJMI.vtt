00:00:03.608 --> 00:00:07.380
thing. If two equations are equivalent to one another, then they have all the

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.148
same solutions. And if they have all the same solutions, and if they have all

00:00:11.148 --> 00:00:15.042
the same solutions, then they graph all the same points, which means they graph

00:00:15.042 --> 00:00:16.274
exactly the same curve.
