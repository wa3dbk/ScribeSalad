00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.842
So, one of the things for me going into programming and even engineering, was

00:00:04.842 --> 00:00:08.811
that it was an area that I never thought was actually like important to me as a

00:00:08.811 --> 00:00:15.201
person. growing up with a very strong art background. I went to an arts high

00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:18.680
school, like, my mother is an artist, my grandmother is an artist. Like, I

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.213
just, I never really realized like off the bat, like how applicable it is. Like

00:00:23.213 --> 00:00:27.955
nowadays, I'm, so I tie the two together. I I make large paintings that have

00:00:27.955 --> 00:00:32.150
circuits embedded into the canvas. And I use an adreno which I program, so that

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.656
I can do sequence of like, different light displays at the time. Or, like I'll

00:00:36.656 --> 00:00:39.856
use like capasitive sensors which I can like program like, and tweak like how

00:00:39.856 --> 00:00:44.317
the can work and what distances. These are things like me, a couple years ago,

00:00:44.317 --> 00:00:48.674
would have been like, oh, wait, I, I didn't even know I could do this. This is

00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:52.008
like a whole new form of art. And I think that's one of the things that people

00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:55.672
don't initially think like, oh, you know, someone's programming. They're just

00:00:55.672 --> 00:00:59.070
sitting at a computer, but like even the way that you program is an art. Like

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.535
you can be so meticulous about it, like the same work ethic that I use towards

00:01:02.535 --> 00:01:07.573
making like a painting is the same one I use towards programming. And it's

00:01:07.573 --> 00:01:11.349
something that like, the two are so entwined for me that I can't see how, like,

00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:16.557
it wouldn't be for other areas. Like, I have friends that are writers and it's,

00:01:16.557 --> 00:01:20.091
it's also the same kind of, they have the same kind of feelings towards it as

00:01:20.091 --> 00:01:24.759
well. And it's like, it's something that where even now if I'm doing like an

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.675
interactive art piece. I want to do a simulation, like that's an art in itself,

00:01:28.675 --> 00:01:33.298
and like to sit down and like program with open frameworks or something. And

00:01:33.298 --> 00:01:36.796
like that's just something like for me is like how could you not want to think

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:40.680
that these two go together. Like they totally go together.
