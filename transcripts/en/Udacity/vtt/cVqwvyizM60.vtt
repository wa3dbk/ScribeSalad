00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.170
So if you're thinking about joining an
accelerator, one of the downsides could

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.720
be the amount of equity that you
have to give up in return for

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.622
the money that you're getting.

00:00:09.622 --> 00:00:15.660
Most accelerators will take a fairly
significant piece of equity

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.400
in return for all of the mentorship and
the guidance that they provide.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.390
And what you have to ask yourself is,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.480
do you already have that network that's
going to provide you all that feedback?

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.130
Or are you interested in
having the accelerator do it?

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.870
Because there is a cost
associated with it.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.530
Otherwise, when you look
at an accelerator and

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.540
you evaluate it, you really need to
evaluate the accelerator based on that

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.700
group of people that's going to help
you, and whether you think that they're

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.420
going to help you solve the specific
problem you're trying to solve.
