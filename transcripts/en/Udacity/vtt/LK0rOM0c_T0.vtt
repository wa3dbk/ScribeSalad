00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.362
Here, the correct answers were 1 plus or minus root 3, all divided by 2. You

00:00:05.362 --> 00:00:09.583
may have listed your answer as 1 half plus or minus root 3 divided by 2. These

00:00:09.583 --> 00:00:13.190
would be correct as well. To solve this equation, we need to first start by

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.200
setting it equal to 0. So we'll subtract 1 from both sides. We identify a, b,

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.288
and c using the coefficients in front of each term. a is positive 2, b is

00:00:23.288 --> 00:00:28.343
negative 2, and c is negative 1. We do the negative of b, which would be

00:00:28.343 --> 00:00:34.637
positive 2, and then, plus or minus b squared minus 4ac, all divided by 2a. We

00:00:34.637 --> 00:00:39.101
simplify our answer by cleaning up this radical to get 2 plus or minus root 4

00:00:39.101 --> 00:00:45.596
plus 8, all divided by 4. Negative 2 squared is 4 here. And negative 4 times 2

00:00:45.596 --> 00:00:51.374
times negative 1 is positive 8. This radical simplifies to root 12, which is 2

00:00:51.374 --> 00:00:56.222
times root 3. These two terms share a common factor of 2, so we can rewrite our

00:00:56.222 --> 00:01:01.368
numerator as 2 times 1 plus or minus 1 root 3. We notice that the numerator and

00:01:01.368 --> 00:01:04.715
denominator share a common factor of 2, so we simplify that to 1, leaving us

00:01:04.715 --> 00:01:06.990
with this expression.
