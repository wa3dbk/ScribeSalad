00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What I'm going to do is introduce a new concept that we didn't see before

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
in our initial listing of the concepts,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but which is an important one--the notion of a prefix of a word.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It's important only for efficiency and not for correctness--that's why it didn't show up the first time.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The idea is that given a word there are substrings, which are prefixes of the word.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The empty string is such a prefix. Just W is a prefix.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
W-O is a prefix. W-O-R is a prefix.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now, we always have to decide what we want to do with the endpoints.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I think for the way I want to use it I do want to include the empty string as a valid prefix,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but I think I don't want to include the entire string W-O-R-D.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I'm not going to count that as a prefix of the word. That is the word.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I'm going to define this function prefixes(word). It's pretty straightforward.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Just iterate through the range, and the prefixes of W-O-R-D are the empty string

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and these three longer strings.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Now here's the first bit that I want you to do for me.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Reading in our list of words from the dictionary is a little bit complicated

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
in that we want to compute two things--a set of words and a set of prefixes

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
for all the words in the dictionary.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The set together of prefixes for each word--union all of those together.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I'm going to put that together into a function readwordlist(), which takes the file name

00:01:21.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and returns these two sets. I want you to write the code for that function here.
