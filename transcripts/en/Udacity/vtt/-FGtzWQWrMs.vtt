[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:04.315 --> 00:00:07.180
I'm in the Santa Cruz mountains
in Northern California.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.900
And these are redwood trees.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.633
Redwoods are huge, unbelievably huge.

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:16.757
The ones behind me look like
they're about 50 meters tall,

00:00:16.757 --> 00:00:18.148
it's kind of hard to tell.

00:00:18.148 --> 00:00:22.130
But the biggest in the world
is 115 meters tall.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.406
That's 380 feet.

00:00:23.406 --> 00:00:28.440
As I said,
these trees are absolutely enormous.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.040
I want you to remember this scene, and
especially the shape of these trees.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.970
We'll be coming back here later on.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.700
Trees are going to be a recurring theme
throughout your web development career.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.310
In fact, at times, it may even feel
like your life revolves around them.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.112
Anyway, think it's time to
start diving into some code.

00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:48.490
I'm going to start by showing
you the basics of HTML.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.360
You'll be writing code at first
inside the Udacity classroom, but

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.390
later on in the lesson you'll be using
a text editor specially made for code.

All right, let's get started.
