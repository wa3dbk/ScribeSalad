00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.100
So the correct answer is the third one. So you might have been

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.820
tempted to chose the first one here, because it's the shortest. Because you're

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.450
trying to respect the fact that Debbie is on the go, and she's

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.340
busy, and doesn't have a lot of time to engage with your application. But

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.350
actually she'll have to spend more time if you use a notification like

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.560
this. She actually has to press the notification, and go into the app to

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.460
see what book is overdue and for how long. It actually doesn't really

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.060
tell her anything. So in the end this is actually a really bad choice.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.483
The second one might look tempting because it does give her some

00:00:28.483 --> 00:00:31.340
more information. But she still has to either launch a navigation app,

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.038
if she doesn't know where the library is. She might be really

00:00:34.038 --> 00:00:36.813
far away. Or if she wants to extend the books, let's say that

00:00:36.813 --> 00:00:39.336
your application allows her to do that, she still has to go

00:00:39.336 --> 00:00:43.570
into the app. And that's not really respecting her limited time and

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.600
her split attention in with the real world. So the best one,

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.430
is the third option. Because in

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.200
one glanceable notification, she can completely engage

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.530
with your application, and not actually have to enter it. And she has these nice

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.020
contextual actions where she can extend the book

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.760
or navigate there with just one button press.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.370
&gt;&gt; That was awesome. I did notice one thing,

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.200
Debbie is holding her phone with a single hand.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.400
&gt;&gt; yes, that brings us into our next mobile constraint, which is handedness.
