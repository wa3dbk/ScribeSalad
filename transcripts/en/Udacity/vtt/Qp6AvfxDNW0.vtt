00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.730
So now that i have my user
model in place, I will make

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.230
a use.pi file to handle the logic
of actually registering a new user.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.770
I will structure this inpoint such that
a client can register a new user with

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.100
a post request to slash users.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.620
The body of this request needs to be
a JSON object that has username and

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.190
password fields.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.330
Let's take a look at the implementation
of this flask [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.000
The user name and

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.970
password arguments are obtained from
the JSON input coming from the request.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.420
And then validated.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.920
If the arguments are valid,
then a new user instance is created.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.560
The user name is assigned to it.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.920
And the password is hashed
using the hash_password method.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.750
The user is then finally
written to the database.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.010
The body of the response shows the user
representation as a JSON object,

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.570
with the status code of 201, so
let me run my application and

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.920
try registering a new user
with Postman like so.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.950
We'll build this request in curl by
using the following command line text.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.450
My server response that a new user
has successfully been created.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.380
The views dot pi and model dot pi files
are available in the instructor notes.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.470
It's also important to point
out that in a real application,

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.570
login should always be done
over a secure HTTP connection

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.850
If the login credentials are going to
travel through the networking,

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.240
clear text, they're are easily
visible to a potential hacker.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.080
