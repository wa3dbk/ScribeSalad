00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now I'm going to define the parser, and I want it to have this signature.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm going to define a function pare, which takes a symbol,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
saying I want to parse something like an expression.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It takes text that we're going to parse, and it takes the grammar

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that defines that symbol and all the other symbols.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I want it to return--when we had regular expressions we looked at returning a set of remainders.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm going to have this return a single remainder.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The idea is that we want the author of the grammar to have some control over what's going on

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and make this grammar be unambiguous so that there is a single result for each parse

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
rather than having to keep a set of results.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The idea is that for each symbol we're going to consider the alternatives in left-to-right order.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
If we're asked to parse an expression, we'll say can we parse this alternative.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
If we can, if we can parse in succession a term and then a plus or minus

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
then an expression and then we'll commit to that.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We'll say that's the result we're going to return.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
That's the single remainder, and we're not going to even explore the other alternatives.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Because we have this left-to-right choice, that's why we decide to write the expressions in this order.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We don't write them in the opposite order because if we wrote the rule this way

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and we were trying to parse the expression a + 3,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
we'd be asked to parse this, we'd try to parse a term, we'd say, yes, a is a term,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and then we'd stop, and we'd say that's the end.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We wouldn't even consider parsing off the term plus the expression.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
This is no good.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It's up to the author of the grammar to write rules in the correct order

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
so that the longest thing gets tried first.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Our regular expression functions are what is known as recognizers.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
They told us--yes or no--is a string part of a language.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Here what we're doing is different. It's a parser.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
It tells you--yes and no--is it part of the language, but then it also gives you

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
an internal structure, a tree structure of the parts of the expression.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Here it would be a + 3.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
If we had m * x + b,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000
then that would parse into a structure that had m * x + b.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Here I said we were a remainder, but actually I want to return a two element tuple

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
of the tree followed by the remainder.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Here's what we're going for.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
If I asked to parse the expression a * x with the grammar G,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I want to get back this tree structure. It looks kind of complicated.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
All it's really saying is that we have an a in the first element, then the multiply sign,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and then an x in the third element, and there's no remainder.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
We parse the whole string.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
That's what it says, but there's all these intermediate parts here because that's the way the grammar is defined.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I should say here that this is a tree, remainder result.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
We're going to use the convention that Fail corresponds to a value of None.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Let's think then about what we have to do to be able to parse a text.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I can think of four cases that we have to deal with.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
One, we want to be able to parse an expression or a symbol like the expression keyword.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
To do that we've got to be able to look that up in the grammar G.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
We've also got to be able to parse a regular expression, plus or minus,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and we've seen how to do that before, so we reduce that to a solved problem.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
We're going to have to be able to parse a tuple of alternatives.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Here one alternative or another alternative done in left-to-right order.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Finally, we're going to have to be able to parse a list of atoms representing a sequence--1, 2, 3.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Now, I'm going to tell you the plan for how we're going to implement this as code

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
within the function parse.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So this first case I'm going to handle with a subroutine called "parse_atom."

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
This is an atomic expression. We should be able to handle that.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000
The second part, the regular expression, is a type of atom so it occurs within the parse_atom routine.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
We're going to define a variable called "tokenizer" to help us do that.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Then we're going to use the built-in re.match along with the tokenizer

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
to recognize those regular expressions.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Then for the alternatives, a tuple of alternatives is what you get when you look up

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
the symbol, like exp, in the grammar.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I could have had a separate function called parse_alternatives

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
but instead I just decided to have that be part of parse_atom,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
because it was so simple it was just an immediate step

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
to go from the symbol to the list of alternatives.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Finally, to parse this sequence of atoms, I have a subroutine or function called "parse_sequence."
