00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.404
Now we're going to do a full 1 sample t test from start to finish. And that

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:09.835
includes the t test, the confidence interval, Cohen's d and r squared. We're

00:00:09.835 --> 00:00:13.160
going to do the whole thing, just like we would in a real research study.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.890
Before we do, it's important for you to gather some important information and

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.436
some important tools. I'm going to list these tools and the information right

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:22.976
here, be sure you get them. You'll need some paper and some pencils. You'll

00:00:22.976 --> 00:00:27.528
also need a calculator that has a square root and an exponent button. You're

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:29.998
going to need the following formulas, so right them down on a separate sheet of

00:00:29.998 --> 00:00:33.781
paper and keep them handy throughout this example. You're going to need to do

00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:37.750
degrees of freedom, n minus 1. You'll also need the standard error of the mean,

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.822
which is a sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample

00:00:40.822 --> 00:00:45.598
size. You're going to need the formula for the one sample t test and recall

00:00:45.598 --> 00:00:49.690
that is the sample mean minus the population mean divided by the standard error

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.302
of the mean. The formula for the confidence interval is X bar plus or minus the

00:00:55.302 --> 00:00:59.440
margin of error. Remember the formula for the margin of error is t critical

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.516
times the standard error of the mean. You will also need Cohen's d, which is

00:01:03.516 --> 00:01:07.778
the mean difference divided by the standard deviation for the sample. And

00:01:07.778 --> 00:01:13.790
finally, r squared, which is t squared over t squared plus degrees of freedom.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.129
Again this is not t critical, this is the t that comes from the t test.
