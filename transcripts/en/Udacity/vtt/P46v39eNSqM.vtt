00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.819
I'll start with the good.

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:03.940
One thing that the bar chart does well,

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.670
is highlight the years in which the data is missing.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.610
Both in between World Cups, so

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.480
it's very obvious the World Cup only happens every four years.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.950
But also through the use of negative space,

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.580
we can see complete years in which there was no World Cup at all.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.480
Can you think of what major event occurred in these years?

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.000
Somewhere between 1938 and 1950 that would cause the World Cup to be canceled.
