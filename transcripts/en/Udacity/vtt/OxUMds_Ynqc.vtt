00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.400
In this lesson, we will cover the design of

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.050
big, fast, modern routers. Here's a picture of two modern

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.440
router chassis. On the left, we have a picture

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.630
of the Cisco CRS-1, and on the right, we have

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.850
a picture of the Juniper M320. The M320 has,

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.630
for some time, been used at the border of the

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.100
Georgia Tech network between Georgia Tech and the rest of

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.090
the Internet. Here's a picture of a couple of line

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.790
cards that go into these chassis. These kind of

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.260
look like network interface cards, except the ports are

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.510
special, instead of terminating ethernet, these ports terminate high

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.970
capacity fiber links. As you can see, these cards

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.390
are actually a whole lot bigger than your typical

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.310
network interface card as well. And, as a result,

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.400
these chassis are often anywhere from three to six

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.740
feet tall, and can fill up an entire rack.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.940
There's a significant need for big, fast

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.070
routers. Links are getting faster. Traffic demands are

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.220
also increasing, particularly with the rise of demanding

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.190
applications, such as streaming video. Networks are getting

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.725
bigger too, in terms of the number of

00:01:05.725 --> 00:01:08.760
hosts, routers, and users. So there's a perennial

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.300
need to design big, fast routers, particularly in

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.890
Internet backbone networks. The rest of this lesson

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.770
will focus on how a router works, in particular,

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.100
how it goes from the process of taking a

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.050
packet as input and sending it on to where

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.790
it needs to go. The Internet's routing protocols, of course,

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.300
are responsible for populating the forwarding tables on a

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.860
router. But once those tables are populated, the router still

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.770
has the hard job of taking a packet as

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.170
input and ultimately getting it to the appropriate output port,

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.800
so that the traffic can proceed and route to the destination.
