Hey Anthony, what are you working on?

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.760
&gt;&gt; Hey, Georgia.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.200
I'm working on web app to share photos
of my travels from around the world.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.120
I call it, Project Compass.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.530
&gt;&gt; That's awesome, how's it coming?

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.850
&gt;&gt; Actually, I'm a little stuck.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.460
I worked with a designer and
we made some mock ups but

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.020
I don't know how to take these
designs and turn them into code.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.960
&gt;&gt; That's what front end programmers do.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.720
Front end programmers take designs
from designers and use HTML,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.030
CSS and JavaScript to create
full fledged websites.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.530
Let's take a look.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.600
We interact with websites on a daily
basis, and we rely on these websites for

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.550
just about everything we do.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.730
But how often do we stop and think
about how these websites are created?

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.480
Every image, link, and
interaction on a website

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.760
has been intentionally created
by a front end programmer.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.910
Front end developers
solve a lot of problems

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.660
that users are faced with every day.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.750
They need to find ways to
optimize website loading speeds.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.790
The Google home page loads quickly
because front end developers have

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.800
organized the code in a way
that prioritizes loading speed.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.370
They also think about how websites
will fit on different screen sizes,

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.115
which is called responsive design.

00:01:12.115 --> 00:01:14.670
Uber's home page is designed so

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.300
that the content adopts to
the screen size as it changes.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.810
You can see all the elements and

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.960
you can notice the person in the image
is intentionally centered on the page.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.690
They also take design mockups
created by designers and

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.410
use them to make websites using HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.310
Front end of helpers at Udacity took
this mockup created by designers and

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.840
used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make
functioning and interactive web sites.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.730
Front end developers also work on
many different types of projects.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.330
They use the jQuery library
to add interactivity and

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.380
animation to web pages.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.100
The Spotify Year in Music website
uses JavaScript and jQuery

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.015
to create interactions and animations
as users scroll on their website.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.130
Many front end developers also
create video games using JavaScript.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.720
Front end developers can also use
JavaScript to create games like Foxes

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.780
and Shotguns, which was made by Florian,
a former Udacity student.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.660
Finally, they make requests to APIs,
such as Yelp and

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.190
design how data will be displayed.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.268
Trulia has added a restaurant's feature
using the Yelp API and front end

00:02:24.268 --> 00:02:28.370
developers designed how the structure
and data would look to home buyers.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.260
Front end developers work on many
different types of projects and

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.970
solve lots of problems.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.545
Let's hear from Kevin,
a front end developer at Udacity.
