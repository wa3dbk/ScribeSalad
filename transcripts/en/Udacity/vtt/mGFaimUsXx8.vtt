00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.984
Here's how I solve this problem. There are four different conditions. All four

00:00:03.984 --> 00:00:07.814
had to be true. So I join them with the and operator. So let's start with the

00:00:07.814 --> 00:00:15.490
x-axis. x has to be at least width over 3, and it should be at most twice that.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.550
The y value should be at least height over 3, and it should be at most twice

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.156
that. So, here are my four conditions joined by and. When all of them are true,

00:00:24.156 --> 00:00:29.264
then the pixel should be blue, otherwise it should be white. Now, you may be

00:00:29.264 --> 00:00:32.627
wondering, what's the deal with the greater equals versus less thans,

00:00:32.627 --> 00:00:36.047
particularly, if you didn't do it just so and your answer wasn't counted

00:00:36.047 --> 00:00:42.682
correctly. This is easiest to see with a specific example. So let's say we have

00:00:42.682 --> 00:00:50.154
300 by 300 flag. That means that the x and y positions range from 0 to 299. We

00:00:50.154 --> 00:00:55.005
want each of these three areas to have equal size, so the first one goes from 0

00:00:55.005 --> 00:01:02.618
to 99, the next one from 100 to 199, and the last one from 200 to 299. So to be

00:01:02.618 --> 00:01:07.598
within the second, of these, you want to be greater equal 100 and less than

00:01:07.598 --> 00:01:12.673
200. That's why you have a greater equal here and a less than there. I know it

00:01:12.673 --> 00:01:16.627
seems like a fine point, but it is worth paying attention to. And here is what

00:01:16.627 --> 00:01:18.583
it looks like, when I run it.
