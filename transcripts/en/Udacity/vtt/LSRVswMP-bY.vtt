Awesome work if you got this one right. First we distribute a negative 1 to each

00:00:04.465 --> 00:00:08.957
of the terms, so we change the signs. Next we combine our like terms and regroup

00:00:08.957 --> 00:00:13.720
them in our next line. 6a to the 4th, and 6a to the fourth make 12a to the 4th.

00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:17.832
A squared and a cubed just need to be listed down here. Notice that I switched

00:00:17.832 --> 00:00:21.782
the order of them, that's okay. I know 2 plus 1 is the same thing as 1 plus 2.

00:00:21.782 --> 00:00:25.947
We can use the commutative property of addition to rewrite our expressions. The

00:00:25.947 --> 00:00:29.906
order doesn't matter. And finally on the end, we have negative 2. If you're

00:00:29.906 --> 00:00:33.874
wondering why I switched the order of these, it's because we usually have the

00:00:33.874 --> 00:00:38.548
powers decrease as we list the terms. We have a to the fourth, a to the cubed, a

00:00:38.548 --> 00:00:42.972
squared, there's no a term here and then our constant. If you're having any

00:00:42.972 --> 00:00:47.327
trouble with adding or subtracting polynomials, that's a great time to ask some

00:00:47.327 --> 00:00:51.657
questions in the forum. We love to hear from you. Maybe you're wondering about

00:00:51.657 --> 00:00:55.790
like terms, or maybe you're wondering about intergers. If so, let us know.
