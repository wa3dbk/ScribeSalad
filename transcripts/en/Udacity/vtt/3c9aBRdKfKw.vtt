00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.273
We've already found one of the factors of our original polynomial. So, what

00:00:04.273 --> 00:00:08.680
should be our next step in continuing this factoring process? Should we factor

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.396
by grouping for the polynomial inside the parenthesis? In other words, should

00:00:12.396 --> 00:00:15.654
be factor the first two terms and then the second two terms? Should we

00:00:15.654 --> 00:00:19.634
distribute multiplication by x to all the terms inside the parenthesis? Should

00:00:19.634 --> 00:00:23.944
we combine like terms? Should we divide both sides of the equation by X? Or

00:00:23.944 --> 00:00:27.220
should we find factors of negative 13 and 2, and then apply the rational zero

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.489
theorem?
