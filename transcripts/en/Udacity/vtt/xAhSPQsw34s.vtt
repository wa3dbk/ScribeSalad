In the context of data centers, let's
first talk about internet services.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.880
An internet service is any type
of service that's accessible via

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.440
web interface.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.960
&gt;From checking current weather conditions
at weather.com to searching or

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.079
checking email via Google search and

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:21.150
mail services, to making online bank
transactions or flight reservations.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.790
The common way in which
these services are used is

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.330
end users send web requests via web
browsers and then receive a response.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.560
Most commonly, these types of services
are then composed into three components.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.990
A presentation component that
interfaces with the end users,

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.430
it's typically responsible for static
content related to the web page layout.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.100
A business logic component,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.360
this is a component that integrates all
of the business-specific processing.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.970
And this would be all of the dynamic,
user-specific content.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.610
And then a component that deals with
all of the data storage and management,

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.190
typically in a database.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.420
These components are commonly referred
to as the presentation, the business and

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.740
the database tiers.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.580
Although these are separate components,
they are not always implemented as

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.010
separate processes running
on separate machines.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.980
What makes sense will depend
on the service complexity,

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.140
the resource requirements,
expected loads.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.940
And also in the underlying
technologies that are used.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.430
For example, the Apache http web
server can be used to implement both

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.090
the presentation logic,
to serve static content,

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.090
and also, as part of the same process,
php modules for

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.672
php processing can be used to
generate the dynamic content.

00:01:32.672 --> 00:01:36.540
There are in fact many open source as
well as proprietary solutions that

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.290
are available that offer technologies
for either one of these tiers.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.580
To put these applications using
these kinds of tiers together,

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.190
there are various integrated software,
or rather middleware,

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.310
components that are used, that
provide commonly used functionality.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.990
Messaging services, service
configuration and management, security,

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.880
accounting, some persistence guarantees,
recovery management, and many others.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.445
One important point to make is that for

00:02:05.445 --> 00:02:10.417
services that are organized as
multiple processes, the inter-process

00:02:10.417 --> 00:02:15.547
communication between those processes
is carried out via some form of IPC,

00:02:15.547 --> 00:02:19.252
such as RPC or RMI, or
from Java based architectures.

00:02:19.252 --> 00:02:23.009
As well as, some use of optimizations
that are based on shared memory,

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:27.100
in case that different processes
are running from the same machine.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.950
So these are some of the examples of the
interprocess communication mechanisms

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.680
that we already dis,
discussed in this course.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.320
And these are relevant in the context
of real world deployments of

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.110
Internet services.
