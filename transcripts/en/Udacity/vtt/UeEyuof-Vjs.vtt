00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.182
Here are the portions of the domain out of these choices that, when applied to

00:00:04.182 --> 00:00:09.164
g of x, would make it have an inverse. If we look only at the portion of the

00:00:09.164 --> 00:00:13.854
graph where x is less than or equal to 0, that's this part right here. That

00:00:13.854 --> 00:00:17.693
definitely passes the horizontal line test. If we look only where x is greater

00:00:17.693 --> 00:00:22.860
than or equal to 3, that's from here, onward, to the right. That also works.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.518
For negative 2 is greater than x, we have again, a part of this side of the

00:00:26.518 --> 00:00:30.950
graph. And for 7 is less than or equal to x, we have part of this branch over

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.740
here, as well. So this is yet another case where looking at only parts of the

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.739
domain of a function can make that function have an inverse.
