00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.350
A denial of service attack is an

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.490
attack on availability. Denial of service attacks typically

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.480
are an attempt to overwhelm the network or a network host in some way by

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.309
consuming its resources. A common way of

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.840
launching a denial of service attack is to

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.960
send a lot of traffic at a victim,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.670
often from many distributed locations. If the attacker

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.360
is in fact distributed, this is called not just a

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.000
denial of service attack, but a distributed denial of service attack.
