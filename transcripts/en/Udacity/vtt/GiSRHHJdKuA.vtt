00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.635
Before we speak to Doctor

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:02.093
[UNKNOWN],

00:00:02.093 --> 00:00:06.064
let's discuss the basics of Operant Conditioning. Now Operant Conditioning

00:00:06.064 --> 00:00:09.155
looks at consequences of behavior. We have the A, B, C's of Operant

00:00:09.155 --> 00:00:15.012
Conditioning. The A is the antecedent. There has to be a queue and a motivation

00:00:15.012 --> 00:00:19.072
to perform the behavior. As you will see, Doctor

00:00:19.072 --> 00:00:19.624
[UNKNOWN]

00:00:19.624 --> 00:00:25.577
uses a target as the queue. The fish reward or the praise is the motivation to

00:00:25.577 --> 00:00:31.430
do the behavior. One thing we should note is that fish is a primary reinforcer

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.346
and praise is a secondary reinforcer. So food would be a primary reinforcement

00:00:37.346 --> 00:00:41.900
because we need it. Praise is a secondary or conditioned reinforcer because we

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.221
learn to enjoy praise. Next we have B, which as you might have guessed, is

00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:51.666
behavior. The behavior you saw on the first clip was a kiss from Saki, the sea

00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:56.835
lion. And finally, C, which is the consequence. By getting the fish or the

00:00:56.835 --> 00:01:02.144
praise, we increase the likelihood of repeating the behavior in the future. So

00:01:02.144 --> 00:01:05.987
in this case with the kiss, the consequence was something good. Saki received

00:01:05.987 --> 00:01:10.438
praise and a fish for giving the kiss. However, if the consequence for the kiss

00:01:10.438 --> 00:01:14.440
was something bad, it would decrease the likelihood of the behavior.
