00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.010
The first and

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.160
probably the most popular of Kruchten's five views is the logical view.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.680
This conveys the structural breakdown of the computational, communicational, and

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.660
behavioral responsibilities of the system.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.120
There's lots of ways of conveying logical views.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.560
Probably the most frequently used is a box and arrow diagram.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.766
We'll see a slide in a second.

00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:29.060
You've already encountered some of the UML diagrams

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.030
that can be used to convey the logical view, including the class model diagram,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.230
interaction overview, and collaboration diagrams.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.010
And also, we will be seeing the components and

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.380
connectors that are part of architectural description languages.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.940
Here's a random box and arrow diagram.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.280
It contains boxes which indicate the, the the functional components of a system,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.320
and arrows connecting them indicating some kind of dependency between the boxes.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.522
Box and arrow diagrams have the benefit of being familiar.

00:01:00.522 --> 00:01:04.879
And usually can convey a whole lot about the high-level architecture in terms of

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:05.530
a single slide.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.740
However, they have the disadvantage of being imprecise.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.400
Just what is it that those arrows mean?
