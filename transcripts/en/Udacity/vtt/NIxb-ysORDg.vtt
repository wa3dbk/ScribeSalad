00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.336
If you're acing these problems, then great work. I don't think they're the

00:00:04.336 --> 00:00:07.188
easiest, so let's try one more problem broken down into parts just like the

00:00:07.188 --> 00:00:14.040
first one. For this quadratic inequality, I want you to tell me the 0s first.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.773
Find the values of m that would make this left side equal to zero. Write the

00:00:18.773 --> 00:00:23.393
lesser value for m here, and the greater value for m here.
