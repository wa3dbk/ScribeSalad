00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The error is due to the variable tag being set. How do we know that this variable is being set?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let me introduce you to one of the most powerful

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
debugging tools ever invented which is the assert statement.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The statement assert followed by a condition, evaluates the condition and aborts the execution

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
raising an exception if condition is false--that is if the condition holds, we proceed as usual.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
If the condition does not hold, we throw an exception.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
With the statement, we can now go and check the value of tag all through the loop.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So again we say, in our hypothesis tag is being set and we use assert to check that.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
With this statement assert not tag should tag ever be set will we immediately get an exception

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and again we can check this with foo enclosed in double quotes.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So in order to confirm the hypothesis, we would expect an assert exception.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
What is the output really? Let's make this a quiz.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Now that we change the program to include assert not tag, what's going to happen?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Does the program raise an exception or is the case that the output is still foo as before.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The assertion is not violated and tag is not set during the entire loop. Over to you.
