00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.310
Now it's your turn to setup the client ID's, so

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.850
that you can use the My Profile page in your Conference

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.570
Central application. After you get everything hooked up, you'll find

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.350
that more and more of the web pages start to work,

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.920
as you add more functionality in the coming exercises. So

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.870
I'm just going to go over the things that you need to

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.940
do to hook up the web UI to the backend

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.440
API. going to need to get the client ID. To do that,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.600
just go to the developer's console and in your

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.350
web, in your client ID for web application, you

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.110
can get your client ID. And then you're going to

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.820
set the web client ID in Constants.java so that your

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.000
end points API knows which client IDs are allowed

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.630
to access it. Then you're also going to add the client

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.290
ID in app.js so that your web UI can

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.140
identify itself properly when it goes through the authentication process.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.000
Then you're going to need to make sure that

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.390
the developer email and the product name are set

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.530
in the consent screen. And then also in

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.340
the developers console, you're going to need to set

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.030
the JavaScript cross origin so that the client

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.570
application knows which URL's are allowed to access it

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.110
when they run JavaScript. So this you do

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.300
in the developer's console. These two are in code.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.680
And these again, you do back in

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.770
the Developer Console. So after you've gone through

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.450
these steps, then deploy your app. And you

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.020
could do it on localhost or on appspot.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.050
And then go to, to My Profile page, and test it. And as you go through

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.870
each of these steps, come here and just check off the step, as you do them.
