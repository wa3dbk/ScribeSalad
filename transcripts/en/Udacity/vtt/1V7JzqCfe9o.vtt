00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.290
So we have to find the mean and standard deviation of the sampling

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.188
distribution. Sorry I'm making you calculate this again even though you did it

00:00:07.188 --> 00:00:11.131
in the previous lesson. I just want to make sure that you continue to get

00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:16.129
enough practice doing this. So for the sampling distribution, where we take all

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:22.500
samples of size 20, because in this case our sample consisted of 20 students.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.410
We have that the mean is the same as the population mean, and the standard

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.994
error, which is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution, is the

00:00:28.994 --> 00:00:34.920
population standard deviation, divided by the square root of the sample size.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:43.259
So this is about 0.14. So then this means that this sample mean has a z score

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:52.590
equal to 7.13 minus the mean 7.5 divided by 0.14. If you put the more exact

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.418
values into your calculator, then you'll get a more precise z score rather than

00:00:56.418 --> 00:01:04.830
using the rounded standard error. So we get about negative 2.59. If we look at

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.437
the distribution of sample means and here is 7.5 the population mean and the

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:18.883
mean of sample means negative 2.59 is way over here, so what does this mean.
