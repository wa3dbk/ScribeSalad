00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.690
This puts us in a good position to be able

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.019
to go back to that question we looked at before,

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:06.080
so let's look at it a little bit differently this

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.440
time. If our hypothesis space is the set of functions that

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.970
take 10 bit inputs and there is a hypothesis corrisponding

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.360
to returning each of those 10 bits, seperate hypthesis, one

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.990
returns the first bit, one returns the second bit. And

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.360
so on, and now we have a target of Epsilon equals

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.620
point 1, so we would like to, return a hypothesis whose error is less

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.080
than or equal to point 1, and we want to be pretty sure of it,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.740
the error, or failure probability needs to be less than or equal to point

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.290
2, and let's just say for concreteness,

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.680
that our distribution of our imput is uniform.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.270
&gt;&gt; Ok.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.640
&gt;&gt; So given this setup, how many samples

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.550
do we need to pack learn this hypothesis set.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.680
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.370
&gt;&gt; And remember the algorithm that we're going to use is we're going to

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.662
draw sample of the size that we want. Then we are

00:00:53.662 --> 00:00:58.190
going to be confident that we've epsilon exhausted that, that, version space.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.510
And so anything they left in the version space should have low

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.155
error. And that procedure should fail with probability, no more than .2.

00:01:05.155 --> 00:01:08.291
&gt;&gt; Right. So it's just exceeds probability .8.

00:01:08.291 --> 00:01:08.524
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:08.524 --> 00:01:09.390
&gt;&gt; Or. Better.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.440
&gt;&gt; Okay, think we can work that through?

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.490
&gt;&gt; I think we can.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.670
&gt;&gt; Alright let's do it.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.820
&gt;&gt; Okay. Cool.
