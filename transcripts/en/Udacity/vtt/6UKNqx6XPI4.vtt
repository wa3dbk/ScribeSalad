00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.490
If the function f(n) is contained in O(g(n)), this means that g(n) grows at least as fast as f(n).

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.520
Now this might sound a little more complicated that it actually is.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.440
Let's use some examples to see how functions outgrow each other.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:28.940
Here I have a graph and is on the x axis and I'm going to draw three functions on this graph.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:36.510
The first function is called f(n), the second function is called g(n), and the third function is called h(n).

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.280
What I would like you to tell me know is which of the following statements is true.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:57.030
Is f(n) contained in O(g(n))? Is f(n) contained in O(h(n))? Is g(n) contained in O(f(n))?

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:18.820
Is g(n) contained in O(h(n))? Is h(n) contained in O(f(n))? Or is h(n) contained in O(g(n))?

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.110
So more than one of these is true and I would like you to check each one that is true.

00:01:23.110 --> 99:59:59.000
So every time that this function here outgrows the other function, I would like you to check this box.
