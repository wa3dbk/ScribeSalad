00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
Which actually brings me to my next question.

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.010
Now, we have always said that NP-complete problems

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.410
are very hard or challenging problems.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.710
Are there problems that are even more difficult to solve than NP-complete problems?

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.710
And the answer here might surprise you.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.170
Actually, finding an optimum strategy in most games, such as chess or checkers,

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.240
turns out to be harder than NP-complete.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.930
Of course, when I say chess or checkers, I do not mean the normal 8 x 8 board

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.700
that you're playing on, but rather its generalized versions of those games

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.750
where you can have an arbitrarily large board.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.380
The reason, of course, being that if you fix this as 8 x 8,

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.200
then the problem size or input size is always fixed.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.480
So a concept like NP-completeness does not apply; you always need an input size.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.610
But if you take the dimensions of the board as an input size,

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.480
then certain questions about these games become provably harder than NP-complete.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.900
So the problem of determining for a given game position on an n x n chessboard:

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.330
if white can force a win, which means that no matter how good black plays,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.660
white can always find a strategy to win.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.910
Asking that question is believed to be much harder than solving an NP-complete problem.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.330
Now, I say "believed to be," because this hardness requires that P does not equal NP.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.060
If P equals NP, then, actually, many variants of this question here

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.550
and their different ones will also be solvable in polynomial time.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.090
But in the case that P does not equal NP,

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.750
this problem here is much harder than NP-complete problems.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.470
There are even some problems that are provably harder than NP-complete problems.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.930
So even if P were equal to NP, these problems would be harder.

00:01:40.930 --> 99:59:59.000
And I'll give you 1 example for that.
