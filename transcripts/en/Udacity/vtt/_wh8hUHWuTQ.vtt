There are variety of ways that we could start this problem. But we're going to

00:00:05.037 --> 00:00:10.350
start by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4 and then distributing the 3

00:00:10.362 --> 00:00:15.650
with the quantity x plus 2. You can continue simplifying the problem combining

00:00:15.662 --> 00:00:21.660
like terms. This gives us negative 62 equals 9x. You can now divide both sides

00:00:21.672 --> 00:00:27.509
by 9, and our solution is negative 62 divided by 9 equals x.
