00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.200
Now let's look at all the heavy lifting that needs to be done by runtime in

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.090
order to facilitate this map-produced style of programming.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.810
The app developer writes his map function and reduce

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.260
function, and instantiates the programming library by calling

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.610
map produce. And the programming library splits the input

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.430
files that is provided by the user, that

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.830
is a key value space provided by the user,

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:32.159
into M splits. The number of splits of the input key value pairs,namely M,

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:38.010
can be automatic by the programming system. Or M can also be specified by

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.870
the user. In any case, once M is specified or automatically determined by the

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.720
programming framework, it splits the input key

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.870
value space into M splits. The next

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.000
thing that happens in the programming environment

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.710
is to spawn the master for this particular

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.420
map reduced computation, and all the worker

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.380
threads That are going to carry out the

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.470
work involved in map functions and reduce

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.650
functions. The master is special because the master

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.680
is the one that is sort of overseeing

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.310
the whole operation and keeping tab on which

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.905
workers are doing what functions, when are they

00:01:17.905 --> 00:01:22.040
done,when to start new work, when to say

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.240
that the computation is done. All of those

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.583
chores are being orchestrated by this master. The next

00:01:28.583 --> 00:01:31.190
thing that happens is that the master is

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.192
going to assign some number of worker threads

00:01:34.192 --> 00:01:37.036
as the mapper worker threads and the number

00:01:37.036 --> 00:01:40.670
of mapper working threads may correspond to the number

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.477
of splits that it has done in the beginning. So there are M splits, then M

00:01:45.477 --> 00:01:48.517
worker threads are going to be assigned to mapping

00:01:48.517 --> 00:01:52.017
function. So each worker thread is going to take

00:01:52.017 --> 00:01:55.086
one portion of the input file split that

00:01:55.086 --> 00:01:58.434
have been done, and apply the map function

00:01:58.434 --> 00:02:02.160
on that particular input split. The next thing

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.030
that happens is that the master assigns reduce

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.860
tasks to some number of worker threads and the number of reducers to be

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.350
assigned to the workers, R, is something that is decided by the application.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.400
Recall in the example that I gave you about looking for specific names. In

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.400
an input corpus, the number of unique names is something that

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.240
the app developer is specifying. That's where the

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.720
number R comes from. That's the number

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.110
of splits that the user is specifying, and

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.265
that parameter is going to be used by the

00:02:39.265 --> 00:02:43.270
master to assign some number of workers as

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.110
reducers. The next thing that the master does. Is to plumb the mapper to the

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.560
reducers. Because now when the mappers produce that

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.730
output. That output has to be sent over

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.660
to the consumers of the intermediate results of

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.130
the mapper, namely the reducers. And setting up this

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.300
communication path between the producers of data The

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.930
mappers and the consumers of data that it uses

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.990
is the plumbing that the master does as the next thing. Now it's time to get to

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.210
work. The map phase, what it is going to

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.010
do is, it is going to read its respective split.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.270
So each of these workers is assigned to the

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.370
mapping function. So each of the worker is working

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.060
on a particular split. And what they're going to do

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.080
is read from the local disc, the split that

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.100
they've been assigned, parse the input, and then call

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.670
the user defined map function. The user defined map

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.660
function is the one that is doing the core

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.060
of the work that needs to be done on the

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.400
input data set to produce the intermediate output.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.720
The rest of it are things that needs to

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.810
be done in order to facilitate the work

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.000
to be carried out by the domain expert in

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.920
the map function. And the intermediate key value

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.790
pairs that we produced by the mapper will be

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.640
buffered in memory, so each one of these workers

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.170
Is doing a portion of processing the input key

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.630
value place and producing the respective

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.920
outputs. And periodically the intermediate results are

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.980
going to be written to files, which are on the local disks of the

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.130
worker or the respective workers. For this guy, on its local disk, its

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.470
going to write intermediate files corresponding to the

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.330
output of the map function. Similarly this

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:43.200
worker is going to write to its local disk, the intermediate files and so on.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.330
And because the application developer has specified that there are R splits in

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.150
the reducers. Each worker, meaning each

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.440
map function that is associated with that

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:03.480
worker, is going to produce R intermediate file. One for each of the R workers

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.720
that are going to be doing the reduce operation.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.030
And all these intermediate files are stored on

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.090
the local disk associated with each of these

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.160
computational nodes carrying out the worker function corresponding to

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.890
the map phase. And when they are done

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.950
with the map operation for the split that they

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.530
are handling, the worker will inform the master

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.910
that i'm done. And what the master's waiting on

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:35.430
is waiting on all of these mappers to get done before letting the workers to get

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:41.290
going on the input data set. So in this sense, the master is like the conductor

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.230
of an orchestra. He is started this mapping

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.550
function waiting for all of these guys to

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.130
get done, and when they indicate that they

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.250
have done the work by notifying the master.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.420
And all of the M mappers that have

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.390
been assinged to these workers have completed that

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:04.620
work, then the masters say, okay now it is time to move on to the reduced phase.
