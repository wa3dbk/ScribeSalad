00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.310
I've mentioned before there are two
ways to add the constraints to our

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.590
record button.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.400
There's another way if you don't want to
use the align button I’ve shown you

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.930
previously.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.800
This is just to show you another way to
accomplish the same auto layout task,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.620
you don't have to do this step.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.780
First, I’m going to delete these two
constraints by highlighting them and

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.420
pressing the delete key.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.420
Then, with the record button selected,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.820
I'm going to hold down the control key,
and drag diagonally here into the view.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.780
Now if I hold down the shift key
I can select center horizontally,

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.500
center vertically in container, and
then press the add constraints button.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.670
This adds the exact same constraints
we did earlier using the align button.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.630
I know this may seem like a bit of work
just to start understanding auto layout

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.570
and to get the button to be in
the center of the screen, but

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.480
as the saying goes you have to
learn to crawl before you can walk.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.250
In the next section we're going to
wire up our button to the code in

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.360
the viewcontroller.swift file and make
the record button actually do something.
