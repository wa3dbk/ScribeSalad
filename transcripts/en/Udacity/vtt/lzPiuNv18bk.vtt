00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
[Norvig] And the answer is that it would, in fact, get some of the cases right.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In fact, it would get many cases right.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It would get all the test cases that we've seen so far correct

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
because in each one of those we can distinguish between 2 hands

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
just by a single number.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We can distinguish that a full house is better than a straight

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
just because looking at the numbers that get returned.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
For a full house we would return a 6, and for a straight we would return a 4,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and we know 6 is greater than 4,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and so max would do its job and would give us the right answer.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
But it wouldn't give us the right answer in all cases.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So for example, what happens if somebody had a pair of 10s and 3 other cards

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and another player had a pair of 9s and 3 other cards?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
With what we had written so far, pair turns out to be ranking number 1,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and so the hand rank for this would be equal to 1

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and the hand rank for this would be equal to 1,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and those would be the same and it wouldn't be able to choose between them.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
But we know that we want the pair of 10s to outrank the pair of 9s,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
so we've got to come up with some way to make that comparison

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
so that we're able to distinguish between 2 rankings that are the same

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
in terms of what they're called.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
They're both called pairs, but they differ in what they are:

00:01:38.000 --> 09:59:59.000
a pair of 10s versus a pair of 9s.
