00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.590
So let's take a look at our
blogging platform from before.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.250
We're heard from users that the original
design was confusing to use, both for

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.390
finding a particular blog and
posting on your own blog.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.530
Since this platform has
multiple functions, posting and

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.250
reading, we will need to choose one
of them to be the main function.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.040
And one of them to be the secondary
function in order to decide

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.490
which screen a user should start on.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.130
Let's pretend that we have decided
that the platform should focus on

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.120
posting your own content easily.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.860
Which of these two layouts would
be better for that purpose?
