00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.970
So today we've talked about constraint propagation,

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.950
which is a method of inference where we assign values to variables to

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.850
satisfy certain external constraints. By doing so, we arrive at

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.030
strong inferences about the problem, like which shapes represent objects, or

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.020
how the words in a sentence interact. After defining constraint propagation,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.850
we talked about how it can be useful in interpreting images by using prior

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.700
knowledge of constraints to anticipate predictable shapes out in the world.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.830
Then we talked about natural language understanding,

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.710
where prior knowledge of the rules of grammar and

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.930
parts of speech allow us to make sense of new sentences. Now,

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.160
constraint propagation is actually an incredibly complex process. We

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.250
have numerous constraints for visual scenes and verbal sentences that we haven't

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.530
discussed here. We all see this constraint propagation in other areas as well,

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.500
such as in making sense of auditory and tactile information. Reading braille for

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.490
instance, can be seen as an instance of constraint propagation. We'll pick up on

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.220
this discussion later when we talk about visual and spatial reasoning.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.200
But this will also come up in our discussion of configuration, which can be

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.640
seen as a specific instance of constraint propagation in the context of design.
