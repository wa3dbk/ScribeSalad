00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.190
One of the most important and simplest
ways to ensure your system is secure

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.270
is to keep your software up
to date with new releases.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.800
Because Linux systems focus on
reliability and they run a variety of

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.930
complex applications that have numerous
dependencies of their own, most Linux

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.320
distributions do not auto-update
the software installed on the system.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.780
You'll need to do this yourself and

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.380
test your apps to make sure any recent
updates don't break your application.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.410
The first step to upgrading your
installed software is to update your

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.570
package source list.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.950
We do this with the command
sudo apt-get update.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.250
See the sudo there?

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.160
We have to run this as the root user.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.236
The update command will run through all
of the repositories we saw within our

00:00:45.236 --> 00:00:49.940
etc/app/sources.list file, and it will
check to see what all software is

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.690
available and
what those version numbers are.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.720
This command doesn't actually
perform any changes to the software

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.940
on your system.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.720
It just makes sure your system is
aware of the latest information stored

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.300
within all of these repositories
that you're making use of.
