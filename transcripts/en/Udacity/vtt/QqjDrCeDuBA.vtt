00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.980
Now let's go back to the two pathways activated during stress response. The

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.420
second pathway that's responsible for our stress response, is the hypothalamus

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.070
pituitary adrenal axis, or HPA access, for short. When we're experiencing our

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.900
stressful emotional response to a stressor our hypothalamus releases something

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.075
called the corticotropin releasing factor or CRF for short. Then like a domino

00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:31.974
effect, this causes the pitutary gland to release adrenocorticotropic hormone,

00:00:31.974 --> 00:00:38.265
ACTH for short, which then causes the adrenal gland to secrete cortisol.

00:00:38.265 --> 00:00:43.500
Cortisol is a major gluccocorticoid produced in humans. Which is commonly

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.326
called the stress hormone. This secretes from hypothalamus to pituitary gland

00:00:49.326 --> 00:00:55.605
to adrenal gland is why it's called the HPA axis, H P A.
