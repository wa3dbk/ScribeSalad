00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.600
So, we can informally talk about the correctness

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.890
of the distributed mutual exclusion lock algorithm. The correctness

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.010
is based partially on some assumptions and partially on

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.480
the construction. The construction is that the Q's totally

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.670
ordered by Lamport's logical clocks and the PID to

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.620
break the ties. But that's part of the construction

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.370
of the algorithm. But it also is based on

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.200
some assumptions that we make and the assumption is,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.700
messages between any two processes arrive in order.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.720
So messages don't crisscross each other but if I

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.780
send a message and I send another message,

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.310
the first message is going to reach the destination first,

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.080
second message is going to reach the destination second.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.250
And that's what is meant by saying that messages

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.070
arrive in order at every node in the

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.400
distributed system. And the second assumption is that there

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.550
is no loss of messages. So every message that is sent

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.810
is definitely received, in order. So these are two fundamental assumptions

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.620
that are responsible for this algorithm being correct. Now that you

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.210
have seen Lamport's mutual exclusion lock algorithm, time for another quiz.
