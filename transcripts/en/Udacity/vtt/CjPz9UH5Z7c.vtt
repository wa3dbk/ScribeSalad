Let's show off the drinking bird. Replace the directional light in this scene

00:00:03.148 --> 00:00:06.595
with a spot light having the following characteristics. Don't worry, these are

00:00:06.595 --> 00:00:09.531
in the comments, too. I recommend reading the documentation for how to set the

00:00:09.531 --> 00:00:13.246
target position, which is where the spot light is pointing. When you're done

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:16.068
the scene should look like this. It's not a huge change, but does look more

00:00:16.068 --> 00:00:19.579
dramatic. Things will get even more interesting in a minute or two.
