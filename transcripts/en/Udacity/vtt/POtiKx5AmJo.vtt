00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.980
&gt;&gt; Now, in order to update the cx and cy offsets for trimmed sprites, we have to

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.039
do a couple of interesting things. First off, you need to understand that

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.924
[unknown] will only do a smart trim from the edges to the center. So, for

00:00:11.924 --> 00:00:15.706
instance, if you end up in a situation where you got a nice box and pixels in

00:00:15.706 --> 00:00:19.550
the top left quadrant, it won't actually trim that sprite because it can't

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.369
shrink it to the center. Because of this, we don't actually need any of the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.385
information from the frame in order to create the new cx and cy values. Instead,

00:00:27.385 --> 00:00:31.225
all we have to do is figure out the half dimensions for the sprite and create an

00:00:31.225 --> 00:00:35.159
inverse of that, which represents our offset. Now, we store the cx and cy here,

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:38.999
which means if the sprite is or is not trimmed, it doesn't really matter in the

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:41.482
drawing function that uses these values later.
