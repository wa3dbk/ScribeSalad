00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Before we get started with automatic control, let's try manual control.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We want the driver to slam on the brake from 0 second to 0.7 seconds, then release the brake,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
then slam on the brake again from 1 second to 1.7 seconds, release the brake and so on.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The code of the simulation runs twice--the first time with the strength of the brake close to optimum

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and the second time re-release slamming on the brake.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Your job is to do something about that second time.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
In that case, this volume variable is pumping becomes true

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
by the way these parenthesis are just for readability.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Without them, the code look somewhat strange, and when we are pumping, simulate

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
that this value of p is being modulated, which means that we have to complete this line here.

00:00:49.000 --> 09:59:59.000
What is the velocity of the rim of the wheel in the next step.
