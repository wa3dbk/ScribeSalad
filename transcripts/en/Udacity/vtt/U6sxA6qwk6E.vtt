00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.290
At the end of this code, we are not done,

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.850
because we have not processed the last key. Be careful when

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.430
you exit the loop. We haven't yet output the data

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.160
for the last key. That's what these two last lines are

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.310
for. We write out the last key and value. If

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.090
we didn't have these two, we would not have the result

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.940
for the final store. Now let's have Ian talk about

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.880
testing the code and then actually running it on a cluster.
