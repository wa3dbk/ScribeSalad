00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.540
When we rewrite things like the square root of 180, instead as 6 times the

00:00:04.552 --> 00:00:09.469
square root of 5. We say that we've written this radical expression in simplest

00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:14.448
form. What this means is that the number that's still under the radical sign, or

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.969
5 in our case, doesn't have any factors that can be written in the form n

00:00:18.981 --> 00:00:23.905
squared, where n here is some rational number. Since the square root of 40 was

00:00:23.917 --> 00:00:28.211
one of the other side links in our quadrilateral earlier, I would like you to

00:00:28.223 --> 00:00:30.184
try writing it in its simplest form.
