00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This problem asks you to define a function

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
called "find_last" that takes in 2 parameters:

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
one string that we're searching in, another string that we're finding.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The whole point of this function

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
is to find the position of the last occurrence of "t".

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So let's use a variable called "last_pos".

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The overall plan here

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
is while we keep finding occurrences of "t",

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
we're going to keep running the "find" function

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and updating our offset.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So let's do that: "while True:"--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and since we don't know when we want to terminate yet,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
we're going to update a position

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
using the "find" function,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
where we're searching for "t",

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
but we're starting at the last position, plus 1.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The "+1" is important so that we

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
don't keep finding the same string over and over again.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
If this returns "-1",

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that means we didn't find another occurrence of "t".

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So we want to return the previous refound occurrence,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
which we stored in "last_pos".

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Otherwise, we want to update "last_pos"

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
with the position that we just found.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So the one thing left is: what do we initialize "last_pos" to?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
If we never find any occurrence of "t" in "s",

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
the goal is to return "-1".

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So if "position" equals negative 1

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
in the first iteration, we're just going to return "last_pos".

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So it makes sense to initialize it to "-1".
