00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.710
Let's look at the solution to
our N-module redundancy quiz

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.550
where we had three computers that are
totally identical on the same desk, and

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.840
we use them as a three module or
redundant system.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.239
And the question is what type
of event can we always overcome?

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:20.920
A single alpha particle strike is going
to effect only a single processor, and

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.690
that means that the two computers
that are not affected by this will

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.405
still agree.

00:00:26.405 --> 00:00:29.905
A building collapse will
either be another building and

00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:33.595
not affect anything, but if it is
the building in which these systems are,

00:00:33.595 --> 00:00:37.115
then the building collapse is probably
going to destroy all three computers, so

00:00:37.115 --> 00:00:39.740
we cannot tolerate this type of event.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.870
Earthquake is going to do
a similar thing, and a mistake

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.810
in processor design, because the three
are identical, if there is a mistake in

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.530
processor design it's going to affect
all three processors at the same time.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.300
So, again, we cannot tolerate this.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.940
So as you can see, replicating
the hardware with identical hardware and

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.280
in an identical location

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.910
only really ensures that we can survive
something like a particle strike.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.390
If we wanted to tolerate earthquakes and
building collapses,

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.900
we would need to geographically
distribute these three computers.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.120
If we want to tolerate
a mistake in processor design,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.102
we would need to use three computers
with different processors.

00:01:20.102 --> 00:01:24.850
So the N-module
redundancy doesn't really

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.990
guard against these types of
faults unless the modules

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.200
are in different places and
of different designs.
