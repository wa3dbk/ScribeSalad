00:00:00.457 --> 00:00:05.409
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:05.409 --> 00:00:09.630
The heart and soul of this course are its projects. I can't really teach you to

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.600
design. You have to learn it by doing it yourself. The best I can do is to

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.050
introduce you to some specific techniques, such as modeling, and technology,

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.960
such as UML, that you can use in thinking about how to solve design problems.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.640
The learning experience comes from applying them to a problem and getting a feel

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.010
for how they work. A course on software design faces an important challenge.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.550
Interesting design typically occurs when confronting large complex problems but

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.400
those can't be dealt with within the constraints of a single course.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.680
I have taken a different approach to structuring projects called design studies.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.060
The idea here comes from a world of building architecture in which

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.170
the architect often constructs a variety of small scale models in order to

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.840
explore a design space. For each of the projects in this course,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.540
I ask you to solve it several different ways and then to systematically study

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.530
the differences. The projects themselves are relatively small, and

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.730
although some coding is involved, you will be working on teams with

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.550
enough members that you should have enough resources to get the job done, and

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.670
then study the variations. I've also tried to make the projects similar to

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.450
those in the real world. The first similarity is that you will be

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.700
working with team members that you are not colocated with. You will have to

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.600
learn to quickly organize yourself to work in a parallel distributive fashion.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.040
The second similarity, is that the projects are some what open ended. That is,

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.170
though they are basically requirements, there is room for

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.990
you to be creative in your solutions, and to go beyond those requirements,

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.990
if you believe you can significantly add value to the product you are producing.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.640
Of course, the danger with an open ended project is you might get engaged in

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.220
polishing an extension and not have a working solution to the basic problem.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.050
I strongly suggest that you tackle these projects in an incremental manner,

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.960
that is, begin by producing a trivial working program providing only

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.610
minimal functionality then add one new feature at a time.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.460
Ensuring that the older functionality still works.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.060
The third similarity to the real world is that the projects are phased. What

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.210
this means is that the three projects all deal with the same problem domain and

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.580
each subsequent project builds on the solutions developed in the previous ones.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.780
In fact, you're specifically encouraged to make use of code. From your own or

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.430
other teams that was developed earlier. This situation is typical of

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.170
the real world, where successful projects often have long lifetimes in

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.140
which the additional features are added and released to customers.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.860
The fourth similarity is that the members of your project team change for

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.400
each phase. In the real world, turnover of teams is common and

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.860
you have to learn to work with a variety of people. One specific benefit is that

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.070
by having team members with different teams, you will have familiarity with and

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.690
access to a variety of working solutions from which you can choose components

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.990
from previous phases. More over, managing teams in this fashion provides

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.740
a motivation for designing your solutions in a way that they can be reused on

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.320
future projects. Even if you don't know exactly what those projects are.
