00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.070
Let's look at our in order versus out of order quiz solution.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.710
We said already that we have to fetch the code and issue instructions in order.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.050
Dispatching is happening in the order of dependencies not necessarily totally in

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.110
program order so this is out of order. Execution then happens out of order.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.250
We broadcast results. When we finish execution out of order.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.920
But then commit has to happen in order, and

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.790
then because we commit in order, the rest of the pipeline after commit,

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.080
if there is anything will be also in order. So this is what happens in order and

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.710
what happens out of order in an out of order processor.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.870
If this were an in order processor, these would also be here.
