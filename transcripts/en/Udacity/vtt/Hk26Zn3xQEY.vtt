00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.870
To change what our box plots look like, we just need

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.780
to adjust the Y axis. We can use the [UNKNOWN] parameter

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.680
inside of Q plot to do so. Here, I can set

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.850
the upper and lower limits. The lower limit will be 0

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.500
and the upper limit will be 1000. Now, you may or

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.910
may not have gotten a warning message here about removing data

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.900
points. When we use the ylin parameter, we're actually removing data

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.570
points from our calculations. So the original box plots that we have

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.620
might look slightly different from this. Another way to create the

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.280
same plot is to use the scale y continuous layer. So we

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.570
can use this same bit of code here and then just

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.405
close off our parenthesis. [UNKNOWN] the scale wide continuous layer, I can

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:41.190
set the limits to be between 0 and 1000. Running this

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.460
code, we can see that we get the same exact box plots.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.025
What I want to draw your attention to, is the female box

00:00:47.025 --> 00:00:50.490
plot. Notice how the top of the box is just below 250.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.280
So this value might be around 200 or 230. But this

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.970
value might not be accurate for all of our data. When we

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.610
use the ylim paramater or the scale_y_continuous layer, we actually remove

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.580
data points from calculations. So a better way to do this is

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.060
to use the cord Cartesian layer to set the y limits

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.860
instead. So, we'll use the same bit of code and then instead

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.740
of adding scale wide continuous layer, we'll add the cored Cartesian layer.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.690
And here I'll set the y limits from 0 to a 1000.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.660
Notice how the top of the box has moved slightly closer to

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.050
250 for females. I'll explain this difference in more detail in the

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.090
next video. We'll also discuss what the top of the box means.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.190
What the bottom of the box means. And what this black line means.
