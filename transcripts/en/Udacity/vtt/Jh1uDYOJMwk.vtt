What Susan and Greg said is true. It's very important that we try to step

00:00:03.687 --> 00:00:08.189
outside of an event to examine the positive experiences we can get from it.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.934
Having dealt with it myself, as I'm sure many of you have, I understand how

00:00:10.934 --> 00:00:13.859
difficult it can be, to see the positive side of a traumatic event, like losing

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:19.002
a loved one. However, I can assure you, that finding something meaningful or

00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:23.130
good in an event can result in less suppression and more optimism.

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.604
Unfortunately, another way that people seek to reduce stress is through drug

00:00:27.604 --> 00:00:31.270
use. Now let's go to Susan and talk a little bit more about this.
