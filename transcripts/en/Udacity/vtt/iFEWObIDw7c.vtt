00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.476
We start by multiplying 1 and negative 12, the coefficient of the x squared

00:00:04.476 --> 00:00:09.515
term, and our constant term. That gives us the top number. Negative 4 is with

00:00:09.515 --> 00:00:14.036
the x term, so this goes in the bottom of our number puzzle. Here are the factor

00:00:14.036 --> 00:00:17.920
pairs for negative 12. I know one of the numbers needs to be negative in each of

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.635
the pairs since a negative times a positive is a negative. We want to find the

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:27.540
factor pair that sums to negative 4. That must be this pair, 2 and negative 6.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.223
Next we use our factor pair to rewrite the x term. We'll have x squared plus 2x

00:00:33.223 --> 00:00:37.483
plus negative 6x minus 12. I'm just showing you where these two factors come

00:00:37.483 --> 00:00:42.306
from in our number puzzle. But it's best to write this part as negative 6x. We

00:00:42.306 --> 00:00:46.454
can use factoring by grouping to remove an x from the first two terms, and a

00:00:46.454 --> 00:00:50.784
negative 6 from the last two terms. I need to remove a negative 6 from both

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:55.418
these terms, so I wind up with x plus 2 for both of these parenthesis. Remember

00:00:55.418 --> 00:00:58.733
to distribute, to always have a quick check, to make sure you're doing the step

00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:04.006
right. We can factor one last time to get x minus 6 times x plus 2, our

00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:06.233
completely factored form.
