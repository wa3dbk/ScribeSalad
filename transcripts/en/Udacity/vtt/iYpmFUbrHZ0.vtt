00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.980
You should recall that when we
last saw Marla in Lesson 5B,

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.860
she was seeing her new pulmonary
specialist, Dr. Jones,

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:15.270
who received Marla's XML-formatted CCD
using Direct from Dr. Johnson.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.170
Under Meaningful Use Stage 2's
VDT mandate, Doctors Johnson and

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.580
Jones and all of Marla's other
physicians are encouraged to provide

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.520
electronic access to these clinical
summaries to their patients.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.640
So Marla is able to access that
information, and once she has it,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.667
she can do what I just showed you and
load it into her HealthVault record.
