00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.253
Try a fraction that's equivalent to 5, but has a denominator of 3x minus 6. We

00:00:05.253 --> 00:00:09.630
need to multiply it by 1 in the form of 3x minus 6 divided by itself. To

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.830
distribute multiplication by 5 to each term in the numerator, we get 15x minus

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.409
30, as the numerator of this fraction.
