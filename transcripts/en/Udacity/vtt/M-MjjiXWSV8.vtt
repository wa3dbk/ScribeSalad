When our sensory neurons are activated, what occurs? Remember our sensory

00:00:04.656 --> 00:00:10.560
neurons are important for receiving incoming information from our senses.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.520
Touch, taste, smell and hearing. The sensory neurons carry signals from the

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.180
peripheral nervous system to the outer parts of the body to tell us how we

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.030
feel. The sensory neurons will carry signals from our senses to our central

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.385
nervous system. Or the sensory neurons will carry signals to the motor neurons,

00:00:30.385 --> 00:00:34.129
which then send that message to the brain.
