Here's the code that I wrote for this. We're going to use with, to deal with all

00:00:04.446 --> 00:00:08.266
the file operations. This saves us from having to remember to close the file.

00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:13.790
And within the with, all we need to do is use pickle, which we imported the

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.752
pickle module, to dump the corpus in the file. If it's successful, we'll print a

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:23.162
nice message. If it's not successful, well, we should catch this error. That

00:00:23.162 --> 00:00:27.162
could happen because we failed to open the file, perhaps it's not writable.

00:00:27.162 --> 00:00:29.490
We'll print an error message
