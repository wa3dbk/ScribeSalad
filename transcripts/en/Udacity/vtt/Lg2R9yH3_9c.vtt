You'll sometimes run into textures being flipped top to bottom, with the y axis

00:00:03.906 --> 00:00:08.025
reversed. In 3js, you can correct this by setting the flip y parameter on your

00:00:08.025 --> 00:00:13.520
texture. The texture coordinates are a bit trickier when the texture's flipped.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.426
Say our image is 512 by 512 pixels in size, with the upper left hand corner of

00:00:17.426 --> 00:00:22.460
this texture being 0, 0. This is different than how U,V gets defined which use

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.242
the lower left hand corner as 0, 0. Also recall that each of the U,V

00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:30.159
coordinates point at the outer edge of the image, not the texel center. The

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:34.965
question to you is what Texel corresponds to U,V coordinates 0.2, 0.7? What I

00:00:34.965 --> 00:00:39.298
want here are two integers, not floating point numbers. Each Texel has a

00:00:39.298 --> 00:00:42.148
location in an array. I want this location.
