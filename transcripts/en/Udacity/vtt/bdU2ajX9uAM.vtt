00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.240
Another percept of the clock radio is the tiny bar on the front that indicates

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.780
the current station. This device is physically controlled by the StationKnob,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.740
and like the knob, can take an infinite number of positions.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.340
It can be modeled as a single state with no transitions. Now, we would expect

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.650
that the StationKnob and the station indicator are coordinated with each other.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.840
After all, when you turn the knob you would expect the indicator to move.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.770
And later we'll figure out how, using our state chart modeling notation,

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.980
we can connect those two, those two concurrent activities together.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.160
But for now we'll just treat them as separate machines.
