00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.006
Here's an RGBA texel value that is not pre-multiplied. Let's called it

00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:07.764
unmultiplied. If we pre-multiply the RGB value by the alpha value, we get this

00:00:07.764 --> 00:00:12.614
result. If we undo this multiplication, we get the unmultiplied RGBA values

00:00:12.614 --> 00:00:17.192
back. All unmultiplied RGBA values can be converted to premultiplied RGBA

00:00:17.192 --> 00:00:22.074
values and then back again to unmultiplied if needed. Precision could be lost

00:00:22.074 --> 00:00:24.954
in converting back and forth like this, but otherwise it's always valid when

00:00:24.954 --> 00:00:28.926
starting with an unmultiplied value. However, you can start with a

00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:32.061
premultiplied RGBA value that cannot be properly converted and stored as an

00:00:32.061 --> 00:00:37.274
unmultiplied RGBA, and so could not have come from unmultiplied values. The

00:00:37.274 --> 00:00:40.058
question to you is, which premultiplied texels below come from valid

00:00:40.058 --> 00:00:44.878
unmultiplied numbers. Valid means that all four values of the unmulitplied RGBA

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:50.092
are between 0 and 1 inclusive. The order of values below is RGBA as usual. My

00:00:50.092 --> 00:00:53.128
advice is to think about what the premultiplied RGBA value is representing, if

00:00:53.128 --> 00:00:56.164
you have any concerns about whether it can be converted back to an unmultiplied

00:00:56.164 --> 00:00:57.880
value.
