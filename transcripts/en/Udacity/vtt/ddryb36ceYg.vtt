00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.840
So far, we've examined the basic structure of AJAX request alongside some

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.520
basic use cases.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.770
We've used def tools to identify that Facebook and

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.410
Twitter use AJAX request to load content on the fly.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.360
We've seen how Reddit and the Reddit enhancement sweep use AJAX request to

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.870
load data inline as users request information.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.870
And, we've briefly taken a step back to examine how even big websites like Yelp!

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.280
Take advantage of external API's to add functionality to their website.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.220
In the next part of the lesson, you'll be diving into building the moving

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.110
planner app which is going to integrate Google Street View in the background.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.800
The New York Times API to give us these articles, and

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.580
the Wikipedia API to give us these articles.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.710
For this quiz, I want you to spend a moment to brainstorm what kind of APIs you

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.080
could use to mix and match in interesting ways.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.300
Take a look through the massive list of APIs in the instructor notes, and

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.340
take a moment to think about some kind of cool,

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.160
novel way you could integrate different APIs together in a single web app.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.020
Once you finish your brainstorm, type what APIs you want to try out in this box.
