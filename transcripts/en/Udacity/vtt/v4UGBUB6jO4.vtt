00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.860
So far we've seen how to examine a variables

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.720
distribution using histograms, and how to check our hunches

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.430
with visualizations and numerical summaries. But there's another type

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.530
of plot that let's us compare distributions, and it's called

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.490
the frequency polygon. Frequency polygons are similar to histograms,

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.610
but they draw a curve connecting the counts in

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.130
a histogram. So this allows us to see the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.590
shape and the peaks of our distribution in more detail.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.630
You might remember from before that we were looking at

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.570
friend count using this code. This code gives a histogram of

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.300
our user's friend counts, and then we added a facet wrap

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.970
and broke it out by gender. Remember we were trying to

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.070
answer the question, who on average has more friends, men or

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.120
women. We said we couldn't tell based on this histogram, so

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.915
we ran some numerical summaries instead. And instead of having these

00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:51.040
2 histograms side by side, we can actually use a frequency

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.910
polygon and overlay these histograms together. Here's how we can

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.430
create that frequency polygon. I'll copy and paste the same code,

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.550
except I need to make an addition. By default q plot's

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.000
going to create a histogram when I pass it just one single

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
variable. So I need to tell it to create a frequency

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.220
polygon instead. I can use the geom parameter to do that.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.120
Here, I'll pass it frequency polygon, so that way we create

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.370
a different type of plot, and I won't need this facet

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.160
wrap by gender anymore. To get the distributions of each

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.950
gender on the plot, I'm going to pass the parameter color

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.770
to q plot and set it equal to gender. So

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.380
here's my color parameter, and now I'm going to pass it gender.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.655
When I run this code, I get one plot with

00:01:30.655 --> 00:01:34.890
2 frequency polygons one for males and one for females. And

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.790
notice how gender has been assigned a color, so color

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.380
is indicating which frequency polygon I'm on. And this is what

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.315
the frequency polygon is really good for. We can compare

00:01:44.315 --> 00:01:48.790
2 or more distributions at once, but again, this plot

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.260
doesn't really answer our question who has more friends on

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.440
average men or women. Let's change the y-axis to show

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.100
proportions instead of raw counts. This is going to involve

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.500
some funky syntax, so I want to explain it. To

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.340
change this count variable, we're going to pass in y

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.580
to our q-plot function. I'm going to assign the parameter y

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.130
this expression. This allows me to get proportions instead of the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.500
actual raw counts on the y-axis. And I'm just move this

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.250
around so that way my code looks a little bit cleaner.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.110
And finally, let me change the labels to more accurately explain the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.890
plot. Alright, it looks like I have everything. Let's run this

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.450
code and see the differences. Zooming in on the plot, we can

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.270
see that we've changed the y-axis scale, and we have our

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.820
labels appearing here and here. And while it may appear that males

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.630
have higher friend counts on average than women, we can

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.570
see that many males or a high percentage of them have

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.770
low friend counts. It's probably in this tail region of the

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.750
graph where females overtake males. I encourage you to play around

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.810
with this yourself in RStudio to see where women overtake

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.080
men in this side of the x-axis. Try using limits or

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.900
try using breaks to explore more. We've learned some new syntax

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.270
here, so let's see if you can put it into practice.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.050
Your task is to determine which gender creates more

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.180
likes on the world wide web. To answer that

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.770
question, I want you to create a frequency polygon

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.340
and explore it in many different ways. Remember that

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.960
the first plot that you make doesn't need to

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.040
be final. I want you to create a couple

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.460
of plots and make adjustments to the limits and

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.780
the breaks on the x axis until you're satisfied.
