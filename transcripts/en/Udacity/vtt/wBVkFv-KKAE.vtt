00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
So here's a file in sublime, where we're going to put some of the code for

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.100
our game.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.990
I'm going to save this as run.js.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.550
Maybe we'll call the game run.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.460
So where should we start our program?

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.110
Let's add some cars to the program,

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.830
which we can represent using values that are stored in variable.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.600
So if we call the first enemy driver in this game amy,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.170
then we might make a variable for her car that we would give that same name.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.980
In that variable, we'll store an object to represent amy's car.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.810
As you add lines of code to your program, you'll expect a different in-memory

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.980
model to be built up by your program as it's running.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.400
So here, I'm going to build a diagram that you can see what I

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.280
believe the in-memory model should be as a result of the code that I'm writing.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.380
You'll see that in this diagram, we have a box, which is a global variable.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.390
And it points to some in-memory value.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.170
Now these two boxes are extremely different in that one of them, represents

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.700
the idea of a variable and the other represents the idea of an in-memory object.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.793
Variables are allowed to point to objects and

00:01:00.793 --> 00:01:03.778
that's why this arrow extends from the variable to the object.

00:01:03.778 --> 00:01:06.981
To keep track of how far along the street amy's car is,

00:01:06.981 --> 00:01:09.850
her object should include a location property.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.940
And that property will point to some number reflecting her position.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.370
Now the number is an object too, just like nearly every value in JavaScript is.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.430
Here you can see the amy object, the object stored in

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.700
the variable amy has a property .loc, which is pointing to yet another object.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.810
That object is itself, representative of the number 1.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.248
Now somewhere, your program might try to move that car further along the street.

00:01:35.248 --> 00:01:39.028
And even though the code for a real game would be more complex than this,

00:01:39.028 --> 00:01:43.000
we can show that change on just one line in order to keep our example simple.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.701
Now since there are many enemies in this game, there will be some point down

00:01:46.701 --> 00:01:50.406
the line where you'll probably find yourself building a second object and

00:01:50.406 --> 00:01:53.578
then you'll repeat a lot of the same code that you did already for

00:01:53.578 --> 00:01:54.733
the first car object.

00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:55.532
Now of course,

00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:59.540
the sample code that we see here in run.js is ridiculously oversimplified.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.300
But it gives us just enough of an example that we can start to

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.430
demonstrate the techniques for improving it.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.460
So we should be asking ourselves the question.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.440
What parts of this code are repeated and

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.350
might be good to move out into some area of reusable code.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.010
So just take a moment to look at this code and

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.720
ask yourself, which parts you'd like to factor out.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.140
I see two of them.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.950
I see that we're repeatedly building objects that look pretty similar and

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.040
I see that we are then incrementing the location property of those objects.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.000
I'm going to focus on the second of them.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.120
Let's take a look at how we would use a function in order to remove this

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.090
code duplication of incrementing the location property
