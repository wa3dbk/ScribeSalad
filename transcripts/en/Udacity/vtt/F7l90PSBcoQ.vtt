Now, how about we switch the order of the y from 3, 5, 8 to 8, 5, 3?

The mean stays the same, but several of these values over here change.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And before I compute it, let me again test your intuition.

00:00:11.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Is r larger than 0? r = 0? Or r smaller than 0? Pick one.
