00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
As we go deeper the force of gravity shrinks,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and it does so by a factor of 2.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's see in detail why this has to be the case.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The trick is to add an imaginary sphere of half the radius.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Then we can look at the force from the core part

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and the force from the shell,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and this is where the name "shell theorem" comes from.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The core part is again a sphere

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
as is the complete object, so we can compare what's going to happen as we go

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
from the large sphere to the small sphere.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Distance is multiplied by 1/2 as we go down that hole.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The mass is multiplied by 1/8 as we are shrinking the original sphere

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
to half of its radius.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We're shrinking the volume to 1/8.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And hence the mass to 1/8 of the original value.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If we take these two together, the original force will be multiplied 1/8,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
because the mass appears in the numerator,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
divided by 1/2 squared, because the distance squared appears in the denominator.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And in total, this is a factor of 1/2.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And to see what's happening with the force from the shell,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
let's put an imaginary sphere close to the inside of that shell.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
If there is a gravitational force on the surface of that sphere,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
it has to be rotationally symmetric, for instance, like that.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Can this be? No. Where would the water be flowing?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We would have to drain that water somewhere, which we don't.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Can the force points to the outside? No.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Where would that water come from in the first place?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So the only reasonable value for the magnitude of the force is 0.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And hence, in total, the force goes down to 1/2 of its original value.
