00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.960
So go ahead and update the query conferences function to

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.830
use filters. This time make sure you're editing the query

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.090
conferences method. Not the playground method that you were using

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.580
before. So things you're going to need to do. You're going to

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.690
need to get the conference query form out of the

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.450
Lesson 4 folder, and put it in the form package

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.000
of your project. You're going to need to update the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.940
signature of query conferences and conference API. To take an input

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.630
parameter of conferenceQueryForm, and

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.200
then just Call conferenceQueryForm.getQuery

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.357
to actually run the query. And then optionally, if

00:00:34.357 --> 00:00:38.016
you want the optimization to pre-load the organizers' profile

00:00:38.016 --> 00:00:40.510
entities. So what are some of the things that

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.210
you need to be aware of? We're including a

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.870
UI like the show conferences page, that let's users

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.730
add multiple filters in any order. You have to

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.360
consider whether the deployed app has to have composite

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.810
indexes for every filter combination. You have to think about

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.140
the fact that multiple filters per query, increase the data

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.300
store rights. And you need to think about whether multiple

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.870
index entries take up more space in the data store.
