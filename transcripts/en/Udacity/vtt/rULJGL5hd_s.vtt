00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.760
Here we are in storyboard and to address
the first two questions in the quiz,

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.310
we want to double check that our
actions and outlets are all connected.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.830
First let's check
the roll the dice button.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.730
So, we'll look at the pop-up menu here,
and we can see roll the dice down here,

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.390
the roll the dice action, but
it's not connected to anything.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.490
So, that's one connection
that's missing.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.650
Let's go ahead and fix that.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.090
And we also need to check the action for
the OK button.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.890
So, that looks fine, that's hooked up.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.659
And there's two outlets we need
to check, the two outlets for

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:34.510
the dice image views.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.373
So, let's look at our
Dice View Controller.

00:00:36.373 --> 00:00:41.907
Here, the first die outlet is set,
you can see it highlights there, but

00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:46.920
the second die outlet is not set,
so let's go ahead and fix that.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.314
To see where the images for
these dice are stored,

00:00:49.314 --> 00:00:51.940
we need to open up
the project navigator.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.980
Here, if you click on this
folder images.xcassets,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.019
you'll see all the dice images here.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.760
And next we're going to go into
the RollViewController.swift file and

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.200
go ahead and
close our project navigator.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.350
And then if you look in the Roll the
Dice method, you can see that the first

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.490
value, the dice value, is coming from
calling this function randomDiceValue.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.270
And then if you go into the function
randomDiceValue, you can see that

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.479
the method arc4Random is what's
actually generating the random numbers.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.380
Now, if we go into the Dice
view controller file,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.720
we can see how these random numbers
are matched up with images.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.270
Here in this line, a view will appear.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.835
You can see where
the image names come from.

00:01:36.835 --> 00:01:42.314
Remember that the Dice images
have the names D1, D2, D3, etc.

00:01:42.314 --> 00:01:44.774
Which means that the strings for

00:01:44.774 --> 00:01:48.792
the image names can be built
up from the dice values.

00:01:48.792 --> 00:01:51.800
Let's take another look
at these dice values.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.330
Why do they have question
marks at the end?

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.240
We declare these properties
with optional types

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.190
because we expect them to be nil until
the rollTheDice method is called.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.860
Remember from the first Swift
session that it's okay for

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.000
optional types to be nil.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.199
The question mark specifies
a wrapped optional, and you can see

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.790
that the dice values are conditionally
unwrapped here in viewWillAppear.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.410
This if let construction unwraps the
first value optional by assigning it to

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.870
a new variable under the condition
that first value is not nil.
