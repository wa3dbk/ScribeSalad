00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:04.735
So how do we know that? Well, researchers gathered data from people who worked

00:00:04.735 --> 00:00:08.215
closely with animals for a long period of time and particular species of

00:00:08.215 --> 00:00:15.062
animals. Such as animal trainers, zoo keepers, and wildlife experts. The key

00:00:15.062 --> 00:00:19.149
was that people had to be very familiar with many individuals of a certain

00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:25.533
species, so they could rate unique behavioral tendencies, that is personality.

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:29.949
What they found was that members of the same species acted in unique ways over

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.669
a long period of time. That is they possess unique personality traits and

00:00:35.669 --> 00:00:40.633
surprisingly the dimensions of personality that we use for humans is relatively

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:46.981
similar to those seen in animals. Let's look at this figure, here we see we

00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:54.368
have ocean. So open this to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion,

00:00:54.368 --> 00:01:00.908
agreeableness and neuroticism. Here we see that these animals have a unique

00:01:00.908 --> 00:01:06.668
trait of openness so they vary in their openness to new experiences. We see

00:01:06.668 --> 00:01:12.602
consciousness in chimpanzees and horses. So within these two species, there's a

00:01:12.602 --> 00:01:18.060
variation of how conscientious different animals are. As for extroversion, we

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.533
see that nearly all of the animals, except the hyena, rat and chickadee show

00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:29.164
variations in being extroverted. Similar to extroversion we see agreeableness

00:01:29.164 --> 00:01:35.458
is seen in many animals, except for guppies, chickadees and octopus. And for

00:01:35.458 --> 00:01:40.499
neurotocism, we see that many animals exhibit this feature, except for a few.
