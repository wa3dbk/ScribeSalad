00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.732
The first thing that I notice when I look at this, and really the first thing

00:00:03.732 --> 00:00:07.572
that you should check for whenever you look at any polynomial expression, is

00:00:07.572 --> 00:00:11.464
that there's a common factor of 2, in every term in the expression. So let's

00:00:11.464 --> 00:00:15.333
start by pulling that out. Now we only need to concern ourselves with what's

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:19.176
inside these parenthesis, just have to make sure that we don't lose track of

00:00:19.176 --> 00:00:24.008
this 2. Now it's time to factor by grouping. You can pull out 2x squared, out of

00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:28.616
these first 2 terms, and the last 2 terms are a little bit tricky, because they

00:00:28.616 --> 00:00:33.048
only share a factor of, well, 1, so that is what we will write. Luckily, we

00:00:33.048 --> 00:00:37.899
still see that we have a common factor, between the two terms we have left. The

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.805
fully factored form of this is then, 2 times the quantity x minus 3 times the

00:00:41.805 --> 00:00:45.934
quantity of 2x squared plus 1. Now in the event that you forgot to pull out the

00:00:45.934 --> 00:00:49.964
common factor of 2 at the very beginning, all is not lost, we can still solve

00:00:49.964 --> 00:00:53.847
the problem that way too, let's check it out. If we start off by grouping,

00:00:53.847 --> 00:00:58.137
instead of pulling the common factor of 2, then we can just proceed by factoring

00:00:58.137 --> 00:01:02.575
by grouping as normal. We end up with x minus 3, times 4x squared plus 2. At

00:01:02.575 --> 00:01:07.191
this point, however, when we think that we're fully factored. We have to take

00:01:07.191 --> 00:01:12.001
that last step to double check, and make sure that neither of these factors has

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:16.684
a greatest common factor greater than 1. We see, however, that this term, 4x

00:01:16.684 --> 00:01:21.556
squared plus 2, has a common factor of 2 between its terms. Then we pull that

00:01:21.556 --> 00:01:25.994
out. And that is what gives us our final factored form, which of course is the

00:01:25.994 --> 00:01:30.051
same answer that we got doing the problem the other way. Awesome job.
