00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.490
To practice filtering queries by property you're going to add

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.090
a new function to the conference API class. You can

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.050
all the function whatever you like maybe something like Filter

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.550
Playground. The name doesn't matter because this function isn't going to

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.360
be called by the UI. You'll be using this function

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.770
to experiment with filters. You can think of it as a

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.807
playground method for exploring queries. This time you can leave

00:00:21.807 --> 00:00:25.240
off the @Api Method annotation. You don't have to but it's

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.710
a good chance to see what happens if you do.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.450
The method will still be exposed as an endpoint function but

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.640
it'll use default values for the publish function name, the path

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.350
and the http method. Since we won't be using a form

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.710
to post values to this method we don't need to

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.990
set the http method to post. It'll work fine to use

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.670
the default http method. Define a function to create a query

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.380
to get all conferences where the city property has the value

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.490
London, sort the query results by conference name. Run

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.680
the app on the local host and use the API's

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.650
explorer to test it. Look for the new function name

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.080
in the list of functions. I called mine filter playground

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.170
and you see it shows up here as, conference.conferenceAPI.filterPlayground.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.780
You won't be able to test your new function in

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.640
the conference central UI because nothing in the UI calls

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.570
your function. I want to emphasize again that you must

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.110
run the query first on local host, before you

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.320
deploy the App, Appspot and run the query there.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.270
If you deploy it to Appspot first, you'll get

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.300
an error when you run the query. Let's execute it

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.780
and yes, I have some conferences in London. Obviously, you

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.600
need to make sure that you have some conferences in London

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.080
or else you won't get any results in this query.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.820
After you got your query to work come back to the

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.450
code for your playground method and add another filter. This

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.410
time run a filter to check if the topic includes Medical

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.120
Innovations. Pay attention the fact that the topics property has a

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.820
plural, it's topics. And make sure you spell medical innovations right.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.560
The topics property can have multiple values but you

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.750
can create a filter for topics just as you would

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.780
for property with a single value. The results will include

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.500
applicable conferences, whose topics include

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.110
the value, medical innovations. After

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.420
you've made the changes to your code run the app

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.485
on local host and try out the function in the

00:02:13.485 --> 00:02:16.200
API explorer. You'll need to make sure you have some

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.070
conferences in London and that the topics include medical innovations.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.920
If you don't get any results check that you

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.280
really do have some conferences that meet all those criteria.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.860
Oops, I don't, I'm going to have to go add another

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.530
conference. You just wait to create conferences is to use

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.530
the create conference page in the UI. So I added

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.810
another conference has very good name, chocolate for health and

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.450
the topics includes medical innovations, you see that its not

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.120
medical innovations is not the only topic, its just one

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.280
of the topics and the city is London. So my filters do work. So when you've

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.170
got your filters to work go ahead and check the box yes that they're working.
