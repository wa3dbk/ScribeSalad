00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.976
All right. 
We're just going to add

00:00:01.976 --> 00:00:03.982
a few more details to the app.

00:00:03.982 --> 00:00:06.740
We're going to implement 
a weather notification preference

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.660
We'll do this by adding a new preference
to the app settings

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.050
to turn off notifications.
And then, use that preference

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.640
to turn off the notification.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.650
Hint: you're going to want 
to use a CheckBoxPreference.
