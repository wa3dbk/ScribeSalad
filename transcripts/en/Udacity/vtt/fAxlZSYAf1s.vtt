00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Just to remind you from last time, the structures that we're talking about mostly in this course

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
are graphs--also sometimes called networks,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which is a discrete structure consisting of a set of nodes--sometimes called vertices--

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and edges--sometimes called links.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Interestingly, usually the people who call the nodes "nodes" call the edges "links,"

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and the people who call the nodes "vertices" call the edges "edges,"

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
because these both come from geometry.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
But, for whatever reason I mix them together. I apologize.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I tried to change, but it just didn't work.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Here's an example of a graph that has six nodes--the blue circles here--

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten edges connecting those nodes together.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
In these kinds of graphs, the edges just link up two of the nodes--

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
not more than two, not fewer than two.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
In what we're going to be talking about, the edges don't have any direction to them.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
They just link them together.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The particular positioning of them on the page is really irrelevant.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
What matters is which nodes are connected to which other nodes.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
What we're going to be talking about for the next little while are special networks

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
that have particular structures and that usually fall into different families.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
One particular family of networks is called chain networks.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Chain networks consist of a set of nodes and a sequence of edges between them

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that basically connect them into a single chain.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This is an example of a chain network with five nodes--one, two, three, four, five--

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and four edges--one, two, three, four--connecting them together.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
There's essentially only one such network.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We can imagine flipping it around or relabeling the nodes,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
but topologically, there really is only one way of connect five nodes into a chain.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Now, I mentioned that this is part of a family of networks.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Now, you get a different chain network for each different possible number of nodes.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Now, a question I'd like to have you answer is how many edges do you have

00:01:39.000 --> 09:59:59.000
in a network that has n nodes if it's a chain network?
