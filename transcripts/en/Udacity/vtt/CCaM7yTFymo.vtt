00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.510
This is the kitchen area of the

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:10.610
Edacity. The coffee machines and two refrigerators,

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.030
well let's go look at them. Look

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.990
inside the refrigerator compartment, two controls. One labeled

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.900
freezer, one labeled refrigerator with numbers four,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.680
two, what does that mean? How do you

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.540
use it, how do you set it?

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.580
It's a bad conceptual model. Now interestingly enough,

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.690
Edacity has two refrigerators, and they have different models. The other

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.240
one has the correct conceptual model. Here, let me show you.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.290
If a refrigerator. The control's on the outside. One marked freezer, the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.718
temperature four degrees Fahrenheit. The other

00:00:44.718 --> 00:00:47.238
marked refrigerator with a temperature 37 degrees

00:00:47.238 --> 00:00:52.110
Fahrenheit. Makes it really easy to set. Really easy to understand exactly what

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.340
is happening. The good conceptual model which we also discussed in the lesson.
