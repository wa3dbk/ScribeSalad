00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:07.610
So now, we're assuming that this sample mean is one of the 98% that falls within

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:14.940
2.33 standard deviations of the population mean, in this case Mu sub BT. And if

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.982
that's the case, then Mu sub BT must be, in turn, within 2.33 standard

00:00:20.982 --> 00:00:27.619
deviations of this sample mean. So, the sample mean minus 2.33 standard

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:35.387
deviations, which is 1.01, will be our lower bound for this confidence interval.

00:00:35.388 --> 00:00:42.696
So, this comes out to about 37.65, and then our upper bound for the 98%

00:00:42.696 --> 00:00:51.717
confidence interval be 40 plus 2.33 times 1.01. So, this is 42.35 approximately.

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:57.115
So basically, we got the sample mean 40, and we decided that it's possible that

00:00:57.115 --> 00:01:02.510
it's either here or here on the distribution, such that 1% of the data is either

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.662
above it or below it. Before, with the 95% confidence interval, we said most

00:01:08.662 --> 00:01:14.722
likely it's going to be a little bit closer to the mean, so that 2.5% of the

00:01:14.722 --> 00:01:20.360
data is above it and 2.5% is below. But now, we're being a little more lenient.

00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:26.025
We're allowing this sample mean to be a little bit further from the population

00:01:26.025 --> 00:01:31.820
mean. And, so now, we have a slightly bigger interval. But now, we're more sure

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.987
that the true population mean will be in this interval. Recall that before the

00:01:37.987 --> 00:01:44.785
95% confidence interval was from 38.01 to 41.99, so it was a little smaller than

00:01:44.785 --> 00:01:46.813
this. Good job.
