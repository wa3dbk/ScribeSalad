00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.520
&gt;&gt; You know, one of the things we, both of us have

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.760
talked about for a long time is the importance of a conceptual model.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.660
&gt;&gt; True.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.270
&gt;&gt; And, the fact that, you know, the designer has some model of

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.510
what this thing is, and the person using it is trying to figure out

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.690
what the model is, and the only thing to go on is the device itself. And,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.698
you said, you had trouble with this. And it looks to me

00:00:25.698 --> 00:00:29.810
like it's a pretty straightforward bowl, so what's the story?

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.060
&gt;&gt; Well I, I came across this at a hotel in, in Stockholm, Sweden. They

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.780
had a whole big stack of them jumbled up for us to put our breakfast cereal

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.060
in. And so, I made the mistake of putting my breakfast cereal in it. I happen to

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:51.260
have some cereal here. [SOUND] I poured the the cereal into the bowl, and

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.970
then I added some milk. And I do like my milk, so.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.132
&gt;&gt; All the way up to the rim.

00:01:00.132 --> 00:01:03.432
&gt;&gt; Yeah, because that's just the way I like it

00:01:03.432 --> 00:01:07.904
and then I put it down on the table. [NOISE]

00:01:07.904 --> 00:01:09.918
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

00:01:09.918 --> 00:01:16.469
&gt;&gt; Because the base of the bowl is at an angle to where the bowl is.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.820
&gt;&gt; Now that does not require an, a warning notice. That requires a redesign.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.140
&gt;&gt; So the conceptual model of a bowl is that it's flat.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.670
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.724
&gt;&gt; And horizontal. And you.

00:01:29.724 --> 00:01:31.087
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] And that's what people expect.

00:01:31.087 --> 00:01:32.788
&gt;&gt; And as long as you're holding it this way, it looks like it is, right?

00:01:32.788 --> 00:01:36.080
&gt;&gt; Yes, and particularly the way it was jumbled one bowl on top of the other.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.242
&gt;&gt; Right, so, and actually.

00:01:36.242 --> 00:01:37.600
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] And there was nothing that let you know.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.490
&gt;&gt; You were, you were holding it in your hand when you

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.930
filled it. If you had filled it while it was on the table,

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:43.860
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.010
&gt;&gt; Then it would have been okay.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.250
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.505
&gt;&gt; Except, you maybe couldn't have put as milk in as you want.

00:01:47.505 --> 00:01:51.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but this is a breakfast buffet, so you're standing there with the

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.660
bowl in your hand. Now what was it, it was intended for was to

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.590
make a nice presentation for having the chef fill this bowl and then a

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.930
waiter bring it out to your table. So they pressed it into a different service.
