00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Narrator] Welcome back to programming languages.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It's an exciting time, and the story thus far

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
we have already completed lexing and parsing,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
but remember that our goal was ultimately to make a web browser?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Let's see how things are going towards that goal.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We are going to start with your average web page,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
a string of HTML with some embedded Java script,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and we wanted to break it down into tokens or words,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and that process is called lexical analysis.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Once we have a bunch of tokens, we were going to parse those into a tree like one of these trees,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and that approach is called syntactic analysis or just parsing,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and now we want to walk that tree and understand it, and do useful work,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and this is called either symantics, a fancy word for meaning, or interpreting.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We want to look at this abstract syntax tree that has 5 and 3 as a child of plus,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and say that means 8.

00:00:54.000 --> 09:59:59.000
And we want to do this for web pages, and the meaning that we're going to extract from them is what they look like.
