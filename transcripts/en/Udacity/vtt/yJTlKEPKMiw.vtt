00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.216
Well, we know the rate has to be the distance divided by the time. An easy way

00:00:04.216 --> 00:00:09.623
to think about it is just a rate, like miles per hour. We know miles is a

00:00:09.623 --> 00:00:14.278
distance, per, which means we'll use division, an hour, which is time. If we

00:00:14.278 --> 00:00:18.494
want to solve using algebra, we'll take this equation and we'll divide both

00:00:18.494 --> 00:00:23.881
sides By the variable t. This will isolate the r. So we know the rate is

00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:28.475
distance divided by time. If we want to solve for time, then instead of

00:00:28.475 --> 00:00:33.384
dividing both sides by t, let's divide both sides by r. When we divide this

00:00:33.384 --> 00:00:39.926
side by r and this side by r, we'll get d divided by r is equal to 1 t. So we

00:00:39.926 --> 00:00:42.915
know the amount of time an object traveled would be its distance traveled

00:00:42.915 --> 00:00:44.630
divided by its rate.
