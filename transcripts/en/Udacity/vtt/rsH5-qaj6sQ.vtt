The Google Developers Console is
an online resource that helps you manage

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.620
the data that comes in
through various Google APIs.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.880
When using Google Services it
is required, in many cases, for

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.120
you to set up a project here.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.270
Now when you visit it you'll
see all of your projects.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.820
And I have quite a few here but
I'm going to add a new one to this app.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.130
Of course you'll have a different
list or you may not have any yet.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.850
But before I create a new app
I'm going to set up billing.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.220
While the vast majority of
functionality doesn't carry a cost,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.270
you still need to set up billing because
under your project you could have things

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.550
that are charged such as, App engine,
or cloud storage or things like that.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.130
So in order to create a new project,
you do need to have billing.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.410
So when you set up billing,

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.020
if your only going to be using maps
don't worry your never going to get

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.110
billed for using the maps because maps
functionality and Android has no cost.
