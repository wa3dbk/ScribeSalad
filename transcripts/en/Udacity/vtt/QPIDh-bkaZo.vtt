00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.080
In the last lecture,
we proved the Cook-Levin theorem

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.689
which shows that CNF
satisfiability is MP complete.

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.954
We argued directly that arbitrary

00:00:08.954 --> 00:00:12.860
MP can return into the satisfiability
problem with efficient reduction.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.610
Of course, it is possible to
make such a direct argument for

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.040
every MP complete problem.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.970
But usually this is not necessary.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.910
Once we have one MP complete problem,
we can simply reduce it to

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.250
other problems to show that they,
too are MP complete.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.090
In this lesson we use this
strategy to prove that a few more

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.720
problems are MP complete.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.250
The goal is to give you a sense
of the breathe of the class of MP

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.290
complete problems, and introduce some of
the techniques used in those reductions.
