00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.744
Although this scale can be useful for helping determining situations that may

00:00:03.744 --> 00:00:06.830
be stressful, it's important to know that we can also experience many small

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.692
hassles throughout the day, and that can lead to stress. So the accumulation of

00:00:12.692 --> 00:00:16.462
minor irritations, such as waking up late for work, getting stuck in traffic,

00:00:16.462 --> 00:00:21.971
doing poorly on a test or even your significant other not calling you back. All

00:00:21.971 --> 00:00:27.388
those things can add up and the result is stress. However, it's important to

00:00:27.388 --> 00:00:32.240
note that what you may find stressful, I may not. Therefore, stress is what we

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.698
call an individual response. The important thing to remember here is that it's

00:00:36.698 --> 00:00:42.138
the person's perceived ability to meet the demands of the situation. That

00:00:42.138 --> 00:00:45.970
determine whether or not it's stressful. For example, what you may find

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.346
stressful, I may not. Now, this skill is used for, but it doesn't tell us

00:00:50.346 --> 00:00:54.820
everything about every type of stressful situation. In addition there are some

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.110
items that are a bit outdated. For example, one item says, wife begins or stops

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.620
working. Nothing about a husband working, or a partner working, just a wife.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.782
Now, this leads us to the second way to look at stress, and that is stress as a

00:01:07.782 --> 00:01:12.456
response. When we see that everybody handles stress differently, we're talking

00:01:12.456 --> 00:01:15.858
about how does that person handle stress, both psychologically, as well as

00:01:15.858 --> 00:01:20.236
physiologically. Now we're going to go to Lauren, and look at the psychological

00:01:20.236 --> 00:01:22.650
vantage point of how people handle stress.
