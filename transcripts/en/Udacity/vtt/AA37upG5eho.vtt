00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.970
Quality reporting is a particularly
interesting and challenging area

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:11.410
generally done by reporting
process and/or outcome measures.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.980
While outcome measures
are usually preferable,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.130
we often don't have
practical ones available.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.550
Hemoglobin A1c is a test
done on a blood sample

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.860
that can serve both as a process and
an outcome measure for diabetes care.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.540
Hemoglobin, the red stuff in your blood
cells, is the oxygen carrying molecule.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.420
The level of its A1c variant tracks with
the amount of glucose out in the blood.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.249
Glucose is the molecule that is not
properly regulated in diabetes.

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:45.513
So the more that's out of the blood,

00:00:45.513 --> 00:00:48.369
the more of it that enters
the red blood cells.

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:52.770
The more glucose in the cells,
the higher the A1c level.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.821
As we can see here,
not much glucose, a low A1c level.

00:00:57.821 --> 00:01:03.610
Lots of glucose, an unhappy red blood
cell because its A1c is very high.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.174
But this increase occurs over time,
so hemoglobin A1c is proportional

00:01:09.174 --> 00:01:14.387
to the average blood glucose level
over the prior couple of months.

00:01:14.387 --> 00:01:19.118
This is great, since the goal of
diabetes therapy is to keep the same

00:01:19.118 --> 00:01:23.025
average glucose level within
normal ranges over time.

00:01:23.025 --> 00:01:26.765
As you can see here,
the blood glucose levels go up and

00:01:26.765 --> 00:01:31.441
down depending upon what's eaten,
exercise and other factors.

00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:35.351
However, it may go up and
down here the hemoglobin A1c

00:01:35.351 --> 00:01:39.522
level remains constant at 7,
indicating good control.

00:01:39.522 --> 00:01:45.168
In fact, good control is defined as
an A1c under 9 by most organizations,

00:01:45.168 --> 00:01:51.460
but the highly regarded Mayo Clinic
uses this number 7 as its benchmark.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.120
Which of these would be
an outcome measure for diabetes?

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.370
Recording of key data, testing for
HbA1c level on a regular basis,

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.254
a HbA1c level under 9?
