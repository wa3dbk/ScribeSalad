00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The last mode of operation I'm going to talk about is called

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Cipher Feedback Mode--also known as CFB--

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
There are many different modes of operation. We won't talk about them all.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But the ones that I've talked about will give you a good sense

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
of the modes of operation work.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This one's a bit different from the others that we've seen so far.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It does use some encryption function as a black box, like the others,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We'll call the input to that encryption the X-values.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So X&lt;u&gt;0, X&lt;u&gt;1, X&lt;u&gt;2... are the inputs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
of successive encryptions. So the first one will be an initialization vector

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Similarly to how we've used that in other modes of operation.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And that would be in the input to encrypt. There's also a key.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The output of encrypt is some encrypted block. We'll use n as the encryption size.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So for AES, we'll assume n is 128 bits.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Whatever the block size is--so that size of input block

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and the size of output from encrypt is 128 bits.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This cipher has an additional parameter, which we'll call S,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and S is how we're going to divide the output.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We're going to take the first S bits of the output

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and those will be EXOR'd with that message b lock

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
producing the output cipher text.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
This looks very similar to CFB, except for we haven't used the entire output here

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The other thing that we're going to do is we're going to use the cipher text

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
to update the X-value--so we're going to take these S-bits

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
we're going to put them into the next X-value

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and we're going to move the old value S-bits to the left.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So that means we're going to be taking the n - s bits

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
that are the right part of the previous value

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
of X&lt;u&gt;0 and we're going to be moving those into here.&lt;/u&gt;

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Everything else proceeds the same way--with--we encrypt the X-value--

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
we get our output block--we take the left-most S bits of it

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
we EXOR that with a message, we get our ciphertext block.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and this keeps going. So we can describe that process

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
first we'll describe what happens with X-values

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So value X&lt;u&gt;i is the result of taking the previous value of X&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
so that's value X&lt;u&gt;i - 1, so the left value of X&lt;u&gt;i.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Taking from position n - S to the end, I'm going to use Pythonic notation for this--

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
we're taking from position S to the end of the previous value of X

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and we're concatenating that with the value of the previous ciphertext.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So this is to find--as recurrence--we need to find the initial value

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and that was given by the IV--

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
the Initialization Vector--so that's how we update those values--

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
how we compute the ciphertext values--we compute the ciphertext values

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
by taking the outputs here--that's the result of encrypting

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
using key K--the X-value for that position--

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And we're going to take just positions up to S, and then we're going to

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
EXOR that with the message. So this is how we compute the ciphertext blocks

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
in the Cipher Feedback Mode. The important thing that you should notice here

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
is that there's this additional parameter S, and what S means is that

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
size of the message block. And the value of S should be less than the value of N

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
--that's the normal block size of the cipher--otherwise, we wouldn't have any

00:03:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
input left--it would end up being a different mode.
