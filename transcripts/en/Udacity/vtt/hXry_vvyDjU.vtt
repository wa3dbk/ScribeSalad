00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.700
This concludes the first part of this lesson in which

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.080
we discussed the basic object-oriented concepts. And, we started to

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.830
look at how to perform object-oriented analysis. In the second

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.630
part of the lesson, I will introduce UML, and we will

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.990
perform the object-oriented analysis steps that we just saw using

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.240
an example. A course management system so before getting to

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.380
the second part, let me introduce the example. As we

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.420
mentioned before, the first step is to start from a textual

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.800
description of the system the we need to analyze and

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.080
that we need to build. So that's exactly what I'm going

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.272
to do. I'm just going to read through this description then we'll

00:00:33.272 --> 00:00:36.590
reuse throughout the rest of the lesson. The registration manager sets

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.090
up the curriculum for a semester using a scheduling algorithm and

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.600
the registration manager here is the registrar. So we will refer

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.510
to the registration manager both as registration manager and as registrar

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.500
in the rest of the lesson. One course may have multiple

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.860
course offerings, which is pretty standard. Each

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.490
course offering has a number, location, and a

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.160
time associated with it. Students select four primary

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.410
courses and two alternative courses by submitting a

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.860
registration form. Students might use the course management

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.460
system to add or drop courses for a

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.660
period of time after registration. Professors use the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.250
system to receive their course offering rosters. Finally,

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.280
users of the registration system are assigned passwords which are used for

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.882
login validation. So, as you can see, this is a kind of a

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:25.440
high-level description of a standard course management system. So, if you ever

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.160
used a course management system, you'll

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.836
recognize some of the functionality described here.
