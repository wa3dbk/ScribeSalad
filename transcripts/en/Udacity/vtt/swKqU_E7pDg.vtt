00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.536
You might be wondering what this rectangle has to do with this expression. Well,

00:00:04.536 --> 00:00:09.024
really the multiplication of this factor, and this factor, represents the total

00:00:09.024 --> 00:00:13.342
area inside a rectangle. We know this answer should be x squared and 2x, or x

00:00:13.342 --> 00:00:17.892
squared plus 2x, you would have to add these two areas together to get the total

00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:22.699
area. If we distribute the x to each term on the inside of the parenthesis. We

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.466
would have x times x, which is x squared, and x times 2 which is positive 2x. If

00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:32.211
we list the sum of the terms to represent the total area, we've really found the

00:00:32.211 --> 00:00:37.413
multiplication of 2 factors. Some students have trouble remembering x times x is

00:00:37.413 --> 00:00:42.796
x squared, sometimes I think it's 2x. But we know that can't be the case because

00:00:42.796 --> 00:00:47.844
if we have x by x or x times x, we formed a square or x squared. I hope this is

00:00:47.844 --> 00:00:52.465
a powerful visual for you to remember x times x is always x squared.
