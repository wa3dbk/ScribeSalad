00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.116
Let's suppose that you're trying to figure out the best places to open a chain of stores in the United States.

00:00:06.116 --> 00:00:09.100
So let's say you have a list of cities in the United States.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.007
And here I went and traced a map from the United States.

00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:12.616
I can't draw this well.

00:00:12.616 --> 00:00:20.073
I traced a map onto the tablet, and I dotted in, I think, the 50 largest cities in the U.S.

00:00:20.073 --> 00:00:24.420
And let's say that you're trying to open a chain of stores across the United States, and you want to know

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.852
the accessible population of each city, meaning

00:00:27.852 --> 00:00:31.006
how many people could easily get to a store in this city?

00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:36.961
So let's define accessible population as all the people that live in cities within 300 kilometers of this city.

00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:41.461
So these are people who could go for a long drive and get to your store.

00:00:41.461 --> 00:00:45.512
How are we going to find the accessible population of each city?

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:50.920
You could launch a thread for each city and have it look at every other city. You get the idea.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.700
And then it could compute the distance to all those other cities, and if it's

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.639
under 300 kilometers, then add the population of that other city to a running total.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.665
So in practice, most of these would be more than 300 kilometers away,

00:01:02.665 --> 00:01:05.212
and you'd just discard them.

00:01:05.212 --> 00:01:09.092
That would be really inefficient, right? You can imagine that--having every city check every other city.

00:01:09.092 --> 00:01:11.293
I've only drawn 50 cities here--if I'd drawn

00:01:11.309 --> 00:01:14.977
the 2,000, or 3,000, or 10,000 cities that actually exist in the United States,

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:17.460
this would quickly become way too much work.

00:01:17.506 --> 00:01:24.436
So instead we could create a spatial data structure, such as overlaying let say a 300 kilometer grid onto the map

00:01:24.436 --> 00:01:27.316
and then creating a list of cities that fall in each grid cell.

00:01:27.316 --> 00:01:32.270
So this cell will be empty. This one would have 3 cities. This one would have 1, 2, 3, 4 cities.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.386
I think that one has 3, this one is 1 and so on.

00:01:36.417 --> 00:01:40.700
Right, so we could make a list of all the cities that fall into each grid cell.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.996
And now if you want to find all cities within 300 kilometers of a given city,

00:01:45.996 --> 00:01:49.037
say Denver here, you only need to look at the grid

00:01:49.037 --> 00:01:51.125
cell that that city falls in and the neighboring cells.

00:01:51.125 --> 00:01:53.823
So I need to check these 3 here.

00:01:53.823 --> 00:01:59.376
There are two cities so close together, you can not even tell that is Denver and Boulder. I need to check these cities.

00:01:59.376 --> 00:02:05.378
So I still have several checks to make but this is still vastly fewer checks than I would have

00:02:05.378 --> 00:02:11.591
to make if I were checking all of the cities against all of the other cities.

00:02:11.591 --> 00:02:16.508
So by creating these grid cells, these bins that contain the

00:02:16.524 --> 00:02:18.966
cities and therefore being able to restrict which sections, which bins I need

00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:25.098
to look in, I've drastically reduced the amount of work that I need to do

00:02:25.098 --> 00:02:29.613
to define this accessible population that I'm trying to figure out.

00:02:29.613 --> 00:02:33.375
So this is a great example of binning. Let's have a quiz.

00:02:33.375 --> 00:02:39.179
Which of the following operations would probably benefit from the geographic binning stage described above?

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:42.614
Suppose that for all U.S. cities in the list we wanted to compute a

00:02:42.614 --> 00:02:46.825
histogram of city distances from a central warehouse in Denver, Colorado.

00:02:46.825 --> 00:02:51.637
What if you had a list of roads, each of which was represented as a list of line

00:02:51.637 --> 00:02:56.545
segments, and you wanted to compute the population of cities within 20 kilometers of that road.

00:02:56.545 --> 00:02:59.846
Would it help to use the geographic binning that we described?

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:03.997
Most U.S. cities are in geographic administrative divisions called counties.

00:03:03.997 --> 00:03:07.287
To give you a sense of what a county is if you're not from the U.S.,

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:10.878
I've pulled out the Wikipedia map of U.S. counties and I've zoomed in so you can

00:03:10.878 --> 00:03:14.702
see some of the counties in our states.

00:03:14.702 --> 00:03:19.101
And as you can see there's thousands of counties. There's about 3,000 counties across the U.S.

00:03:19.101 --> 00:03:23.765
So given a list of counties and a list of cities, each of which contains an index to the

00:03:23.765 --> 00:03:26.994
containing county, the county that it's inside, what if you needed to compute

00:03:26.994 --> 00:03:29.411
the city dwelling population of all counties?

00:03:29.411 --> 00:03:32.743
Would this geographic binning operation help?
