00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.103
In an equation like this, in order to calculate the value of y, we need to pick

00:00:05.103 --> 00:00:10.049
a value of x to plug in to the right side. And then that, in turn, will tell us

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.430
what y is equal to. Now, of course you can always rearrange equations and solve

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.274
for x instead, but we tend to write equations like this when we've assigned

00:00:18.274 --> 00:00:22.180
variables in such a way that y is generally what we're going to be looking for

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.827
and x is more what we're given. So, for example in the situations we've talked

00:00:26.827 --> 00:00:30.670
about, the independent variable has been things like time, a sort of more

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.891
fundamental quality, and the dependent variable has been things like number of

00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:40.242
sodas spit out, or height of a throw. Overall in the natural state of things, y

00:00:40.242 --> 00:00:42.802
is going to be determined by x.
