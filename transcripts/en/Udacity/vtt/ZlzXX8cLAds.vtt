00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.620
Say you have a very simple texture pattern, a checkerboard consisting of just

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.541
four texels. What happens if you put this texture on a square? There are now

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:12.680
many pixels all sampling the same texel. The obvious answer is that you want

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.980
this texture to continue to look like a checkerboard, with a sharp edge between

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.590
the squares. In other words, you want something like this, nice and crisp.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.995
However, if you viewed this texture from a different angle, it doesn't look so

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:27.277
great. This is a zoomed-in view, just to drive home the point. You get this

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:32.183
stair-stepping effect instead of nice smooth edges. This is called the jaggies.

00:00:32.183 --> 00:00:35.477
The problem is that the texture will return either black or white at every

00:00:35.477 --> 00:00:40.545
pixel. You'd like 50 shades of gray or so, but there's only these two levels.

00:00:40.545 --> 00:00:45.657
Sampling the texture in this way is called Nearest Neighbor. Whatever texel

00:00:45.657 --> 00:00:49.588
center is closest to the pixel center, is the color the pixel gets. The other

00:00:49.588 --> 00:00:54.337
option is bilinear interpolation, or linear for short. What this mode does, is

00:00:54.337 --> 00:00:58.564
takes the four closest texel centers and interpolates among them. The closer

00:00:58.564 --> 00:01:02.796
the pixel is to the texel center, the more of that color you get. If you turn

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:06.786
on bilinear interpolation this is what you get. That's definitely too much of a

00:01:06.786 --> 00:01:09.890
good thing. You'd like blurring along the edges of the squares, but not across

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.015
the whole texture. The problem here is that one texel covers a huge number of

00:01:14.015 --> 00:01:19.910
pixels. Let's say we aim to change this ratio to be about one texel per pixel.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.060
In other words, say our original two by two checker pattern covers 100 by 100

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.677
pixels. To bring the ratio of texels to pixels to be closer, let's make the two

00:01:27.677 --> 00:01:31.520
by two checker pattern be represented by an image texture of 64 by 64 texels,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.067
so that each checker square itself covers 32 by 32 texels. In other words,

00:01:38.067 --> 00:01:41.640
we'll just make the same pattern, but with a larger texture. Each texel in this

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.236
larger texture will now cover around one pixel. This turns out to look pretty

00:01:46.236 --> 00:01:49.522
good. The stair steps are gone. You'll try the demo in a minute and see for

00:01:49.522 --> 00:01:53.086
yourself. In Three.js, setting the filtering to be nearest or linear is

00:01:53.086 --> 00:01:57.548
straightforward, there's not a lot to it. Using bilinear interpolation causes

00:01:57.548 --> 00:02:01.452
more taps to occur, that is more texture samples to be retrieved, but it's

00:02:01.452 --> 00:02:06.890
usually what you want. Generally, you should use Linear, which is the default.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.574
At the same time, you want to avoid situations where a texel covers a lot of

00:02:09.574 --> 00:02:14.950
pixels. Here's our original two by two texture. When we have a situation where

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.544
a texel covers more than a pixel, this is called magnification. When

00:02:19.544 --> 00:02:23.684
magnification is occurring, the texture's mag filter is used. Another way to

00:02:23.684 --> 00:02:26.908
say it is if a number of texels divided by the number of pixels is less than 1,

00:02:26.908 --> 00:02:33.154
magnification is happening. You're magnifying the texture. Say we zoom out on

00:02:33.154 --> 00:02:36.980
our two by two texture and it all falls within one pixel. If a texel covers

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.945
less than one pixel, that is, one pixel contains more than one texel, this

00:02:40.945 --> 00:02:46.426
situation is called minification. In this situation the mag filter is not used.

00:02:46.426 --> 00:02:49.462
Weâ€™ll deal with minification and how to set the corresponding Min Filter in the

00:02:49.462 --> 00:02:53.550
next lesson. At this point I want you to study a demo as Iâ€™ll be asking you

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.120
about it. Try out various resolution textures and see how they work with

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.223
nearest neighbor and linear filtering. Try the higher resolution texture

00:03:01.223 --> 00:03:05.190
patterns and try tilting the view to see what happens, then play with the zoom.
