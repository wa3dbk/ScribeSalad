00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.420
There are several types of caches
when it comes to which blocks can be

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.060
placed where in the cache.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.020
The cache examples we have seen so
far are the fully associative caches.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.840
In this type of a cache,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.310
any block from memory can be
placed into any line in the cache.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:25.400
So if the cache has room for 16 lines,
then we need to search up to 16 tags

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.400
in order to find whether the block we're
looking for is actually in the cache.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.460
The opposite of that is
a direct-mapped cache where for

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.140
a given block that is exactly one place
in the cache where that block can go.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.000
That means that we only need
to check one line in the cache

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.140
if it contains that block because that's
the only line that it can possibly be.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.120
Different blocks, of course, will still
be able to map to different lines, but

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.500
a particular block can only go
into one place in the cache.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.130
And then, of course, there is the middle
ground between them, which is called

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.400
a set-associative cache, where there
are N lines where a block can be.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.860
Now, N typically will
be larger than one and

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.660
smaller than the total number
of lines in the cache, so

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.575
we can really view the direct-mapped
cache, as a case of a set-associative

00:01:16.575 --> 00:01:21.345
cache, where N is one and
a fully associative cache is an extreme

00:01:21.345 --> 00:01:26.935
case of a set-associative cache where
N is equal to the lines in the cache.

00:01:26.935 --> 00:01:29.745
But what we normally call
a set-associate cache

00:01:29.745 --> 00:01:34.690
has a relatively small N compared to
the number of blocks in that cache, yet

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.060
that N typically is two, four or
eight so it's larger than one.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.970
Now let's look at each of
these types of caches.
