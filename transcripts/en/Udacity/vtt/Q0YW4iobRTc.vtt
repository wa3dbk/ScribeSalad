F plus g of 0 equals positive 1. Good thinking you found this number. We know

00:00:05.364 --> 00:00:12.165
that f of 0 equals 2, since when x equals 0, the function has a y value of 2. G

00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:18.874
of 0, however, is negative 1. When I plug in 0 in for this value of x for this

00:00:18.874 --> 00:00:25.515
function, we'll get a y value of negative 1. So, to find f plus g of 0, we

00:00:25.515 --> 00:00:31.983
simply added these two y values together. 2 plus negative 1, which equals

00:00:31.983 --> 00:00:33.433
positive 1.
