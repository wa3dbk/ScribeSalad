00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.524
Here the solution is 8 thirds, great thinking if you found this fraction. To

00:00:05.524 --> 00:00:11.940
find this number we'll have f of 2 divided by g of 2. We just want to take

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.244
these two outputs when the functions inputs are x equals 2. We'll divide the

00:00:17.244 --> 00:00:23.320
output of g into the output of f. So f of 2 is 8 and g of 2 is 3, which is how

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.328
we get 8 thirds. Now I want to caution you, this will only exist so long as

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:34.919
this output does not equal zero. Remeber that fractions can not have zero in

00:00:34.919 --> 00:00:39.197
the denominator so, so long as the output of g of x does not equal zero then, f

00:00:39.197 --> 00:00:46.642
divided by g of some number will exist. In other words, we just want to make

00:00:46.642 --> 00:00:51.683
sure that this output for the function of g is not equal to zero.
