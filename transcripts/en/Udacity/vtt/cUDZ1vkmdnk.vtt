00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.000
To convert age to age with months, we know we're

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.660
going to need to add some fraction to the age variable. Since

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.810
there are 12 months in a year, we know 12 will

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.680
be the denominator. Now, let's think carefully about age. For a

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.560
given year, someone who was born in March would be

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.480
older than someone born in September. So we need to subtract

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.900
the birth month from 12 to reflect this. This should make

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.370
sense, since someone born in March would be born on the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.930
third month of the year. So our numerator here would

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.610
be seven. So for the 36 year old born in

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.610
March, their age would be 36.75. If the user was

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.590
born in September and was also 36, then the user's

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.410
age would be 36.25. So let's run this bit of

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.670
code and convert our age variable, measured in years, to

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.400
age with months. And it looks like I made a

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.880
mistake. I forgot to include my data frame for DOB month.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.930
Now we're ready to go.
