00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.364
We've been talking a lot about complex numbers together, but what if we have a

00:00:04.364 --> 00:00:08.988
situation like this, where we have one complex number divided by another complex

00:00:08.988 --> 00:00:13.610
number? Since right now, both the numerator and the denominator each have a real

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.030
and an imaginary component and one is not directly a factor of the other one, we

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.752
can't do anything with this expression. We often encounter fractions like this,

00:00:22.752 --> 00:00:26.587
and usually, what we do to manipulate them differently is to change the

00:00:26.587 --> 00:00:30.595
denominator in some way. What I'd like us to do then is to figure out how to

00:00:30.595 --> 00:00:34.755
change the denominator of this fraction so that it ends up being the smallest

00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:38.655
real number we can make it, other than 0, of course, since we don't want to

00:00:38.655 --> 00:00:43.118
divide by 0. So, think critically about the past few quizzes we've done and what

00:00:43.118 --> 00:00:47.341
you can multiply one complex number by to get a real number. Fill in whatever we

00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:50.999
need to multiply at the top and bottom of this fraction by, to come up with an

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:54.883
equivalent fraction that has a real number in the denominator. I know this is

00:00:54.883 --> 00:00:58.665
new and it probably feels a little bit difficult right now but just give it a

00:00:58.665 --> 00:01:02.447
shot, and if you feel like you need to review a little bit to prepare for this

00:01:02.447 --> 00:01:05.545
question, you can go back and what the past couple of videos.
