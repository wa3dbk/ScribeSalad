00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And the key really was simply calling the stats function with two list.  

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
One which had an even number of elements, the other with an odd number of elements and then

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
furthermore at least one of the list had to not read the degenerate list containing only one element.    

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So if you do something like what I did here, you'll achieve full statement

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
coverage and let's just look at that quickly. 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So here we can see that out of the 34 statements in the program, 34 will run

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and none were missing--so we achieved full statement coverage.
