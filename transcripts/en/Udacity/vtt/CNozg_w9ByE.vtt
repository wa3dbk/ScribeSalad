00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.630
So one of the key aspects of

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:08.490
Quicksilver implementation is Log Maintenance. The transaction managers

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.360
write the log records for recovering the

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.500
persistent state. They're written in the log records

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.140
that are in memory data structure of

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.420
the transaction manager, and every so often, the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.030
transaction managers do a Log Force. Of the

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.180
in memory log segment to the storage, for

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.300
persistence. And the frequency of log force impacts

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.450
performance, of course, because they are synchronous I/O operations.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.260
And log force can also be initiated by

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.815
an application if it is concerned about about its

00:00:38.815 --> 00:00:43.280
persistent state. Getting onto storage but in Quicksilver

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.550
an app has to be very careful about often

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.920
they do a log for us. Because log maintenance

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.410
is done by the transaction manager at a site,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.560
for all of the processes that are running at that node. And so the large record

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.440
in Quicksilver actually contains all the modifications to

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.580
persistent state. Required by all the processes that

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.830
are running at this node. And therefore, if

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.730
an individual client at a node decides to

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.370
do a log force, it is actually impacting

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.150
the performance of not only that particular client,

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.890
but all the other clients as well. Therefore, services have to be very careful

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.350
about choosing the mechanisms That is available

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.420
in operating systems. Commensurate with their recovery requirments.
