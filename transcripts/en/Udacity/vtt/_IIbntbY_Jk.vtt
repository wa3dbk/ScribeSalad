00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.344
welcome back. Now that you've seen a bit about comparisons, let's look at some

00:00:03.344 --> 00:00:09.970
trickier cases. In this program here, I start out with the number 2. I take its

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.732
square root. Then I square the root, multiply it by itself. If that gets me

00:00:15.732 --> 00:00:20.356
back to the original value, I print a message, they're the same. And otherwise,

00:00:20.356 --> 00:00:26.771
I print what the root squared actually is. Go ahead and run this program and

00:00:26.771 --> 00:00:30.064
tell me what answer you got.
