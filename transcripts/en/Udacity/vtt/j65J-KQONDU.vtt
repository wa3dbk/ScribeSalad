00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.940
So, here I have the equation written,
and I've written it both ways.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.510
Just the original the way using
the gradient imagery dot product way, or

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.470
in the algebraic way.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.210
Question.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.450
How many unknowns and
how many equations per pixel?

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.820
The number of unknowns is easy.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.670
What was I trying to solve for?

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.360
U an v, right?

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.550
U and
v is which way is this point moving?

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.640
Great.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.040
How many equations?

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.980
Well, yes, there are two equations up
there, but they're the same equation.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.850
I have two unknowns, but
only one equation per pixel.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.380
This should bother you, all right?

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.080
It's very hard to solve things that
you've got twice as many unknowns as you

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.710
have equations, because remember,
I have a different u and v possibly for

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.110
every pixel.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.120
So I've got 2 times the number
of pixels unknowns, and

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.240
I've got one equation per pixel,
2 times the number of pixels.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.030
What's going on here?

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.350
So intuitively we can think about what
this constraint means as follows.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.519
The component of u v that's in
the direction of the gradient,

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.140
that's what we can measure, right?

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.580
That amount will tell us how
much the image will change.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.800
That's why that's the amount of It I
sub t, the derivative, all right?

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.980
So what this is saying is if this is the
direction of our gradient as indicated

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.897
here, right, here it,
suppose this is my real u,v right there.

00:01:25.897 --> 00:01:27.940
Well any other u, v

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.160
that has a component of the same
amount in the direction,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.500
but I've got a u prime v prime,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.580
that's in an extra component that's
parallel to the edge, all right?

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.740
And this new vector here, which was
the original u, v plus u prime v prime,

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.610
it has the same amount
perpendicular to the edge, in the,

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.260
in the direction of the gradient, but
a different amount along the edge.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.380
Remember when we were doing corner
finding and we put up the thing and

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.200
we said, well if you slide it up and
down, on fu, if, whe,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.090
if your little patch is on the edge of,
of the black square.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.180
If we slide it up and
down, we can't tell at all.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.520
We can only tell how much is being
moved perpendicular to the edge.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.170
That's what's going on here.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.700
Locally, we can only
tell the amount of motion

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.880
that is perpendicular to
the edge in a little area.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.360
When you think about this little area,

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.090
you can think of it like
looking through a little hole.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.040
Remember, from our talk about cameras,
that that's called an aperture.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.060
And this general problem,
this is called the aperture problem.
