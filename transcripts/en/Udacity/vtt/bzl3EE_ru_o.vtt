00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.700
This trinomial is the quantity x plus 3 squared. We get the sign and the number

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.254
of the binomial from the value b divided by 2. This 3 winds up inside of our

00:00:10.254 --> 00:00:14.974
parentheses or our perfect square. Now this is also the perfect time to check

00:00:14.974 --> 00:00:19.277
your work. If you square this or if we multiply this out, we should wind up

00:00:19.277 --> 00:00:23.810
with this trinomial. We can quickly write this out to get a product of x

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.269
squared plus 6x plus 9. You could also probably do this in your head. This is a

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.040
great way to check to see if you went from this step, to this step correctly.
