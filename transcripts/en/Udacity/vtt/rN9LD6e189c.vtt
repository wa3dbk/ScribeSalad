00:00:00.023 --> 00:00:03.757
Let's think a little more carefully
about how the NavigationController is

00:00:03.757 --> 00:00:05.572
keeping track of ViewControllers.

00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:08.753
A navigation controller has
a stack of ViewControllers.

00:00:08.753 --> 00:00:12.983
Remember that a stack is
a Last-In-First-Out data structure,

00:00:12.983 --> 00:00:14.349
like a stack of cups.

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:16.113
It has two operations.

00:00:16.113 --> 00:00:21.233
Items are popped off of the stack,
and items are pushed onto the stack.

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:22.873
When we start the Settings app,

00:00:22.873 --> 00:00:26.410
the top level settings page is
displayed with the title, Settings.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.261
If we click on Notifications,

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:31.264
a new ViewController gets
pushed onto the stack.

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:33.992
We can choose to push a number
of different views next.

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:36.592
Phone, Messages, Passbook.

00:00:36.592 --> 00:00:39.309
Now the stack is three
ViewControllers deep.

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.584
We only have one choice
if we want to pop.

00:00:41.584 --> 00:00:43.651
That corresponds to the Back button.

00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:47.536
You can see here beside the Back button
that the navigation bar shows the title

00:00:47.536 --> 00:00:49.642
of the next ViewController on the stack.

00:00:49.642 --> 00:00:51.885
In this case,
it's the Settings ViewController.
