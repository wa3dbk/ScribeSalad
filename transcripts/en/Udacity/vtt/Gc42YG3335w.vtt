00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now let's say in the same company now with a mean salary of 70,000

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and a standard deviation of 10,000, I decide to double everyone salary,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and please don't tell my people about that--I'm contemplating with.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Don't discuss this in the forums. That's kind of secret, but what does this mean?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
What do you think is the new mean and what's the new standard deviation important?

00:00:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I'm not asking about the variance but just the square of this just the standard deviation.
