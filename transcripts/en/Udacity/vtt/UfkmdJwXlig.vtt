00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In this problem set, I want you to create a function that models the orbit of the moon around the earth.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We're going to assume in this case that the moon's orbit is perfectly circular,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which means that we can model it using just sine and cosine functions.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This assignment should then help you practice translating

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
simple mathematical ideas into expressions in Python.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So if you look over at the supplied code right here, you can see that we've helped you out

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
with some pretty important parts of the code already.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We've already told you that the moon's distance from the earth is 384 million meters,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and we've also defined a function called orbit for you.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Inside orbit, you can see that the number of time steps that we're going to look at

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
as the moon moves in its orbit around the earth is 50.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We've also created a 2-dimensional array called x, which is initialized with zeros.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The number of rows in x is equals to the number of time steps in the moon's orbit plus 1.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The reason for this is that if you're watching the moon step around the earth 50 times,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
then the number of positions that we're actually looking at it is 50 + 1.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Looking back at x, we see that there are two columns in the array--

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
one for the horizontal position of the moon compared

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
to the earth and one for the vertical position.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
One important thing to note is that the cosine and sine functions from Python math library

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
that we're using in this problem, take arguments that are measured in radiant not in degrees.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
When you finish filling in your code here and run the program, you should get

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
a plot of a circular trajectory of the moon around the earth.
