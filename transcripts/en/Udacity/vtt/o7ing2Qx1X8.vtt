00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.170
Question 5 is a trickier question about loops.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.910
For each of the loops shown below,

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.840
your goal is to determine whether or not the loop always finishes

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.280
no matter what positive value is initially assigned to "n."

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.580
So, for each of the 3 loops, and you can see the loop code shown below,

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.720
your goal is to determine that no matter what value is initially assigned to "n" --

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.220
whether the loop always finishes--

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.230
that would mean for any possible value "n" is initialized as--

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.930
as long as it is a positive integer--

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.430
the loop will eventually finish.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.030
The second option is that the loop sometimes runs forever,

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.230
that there's some value that could be assigned to "n"

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.850
that makes the loop run forever--that it never finishes.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.070
And the third choice,

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.980
is that it is unknown--and that doesn't mean that it is unknown to you--

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.510
that means that it is unknown to anyone in the known universe.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.510
Whether that loop will always finish for all initial values of "n."
