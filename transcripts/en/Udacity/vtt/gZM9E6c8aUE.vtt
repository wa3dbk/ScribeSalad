Throughout this course, we will be
using materials drawn from a number of

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.520
different textbooks and papers.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.510
You'll find specific references
to all these sources for

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.210
this examples in the Class Notes.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.320
Generally, however,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.750
we will use a handful of books from
which we will draw a lot of material.

You don't have to buy
any of these books.

knowledge beyond what we'll discuss in

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.160
this class, you may want to
consider both these text books and

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.000
