For example, when the frequency knob is turned,

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.730
which was event four, three responses are required.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.340
The physical knob ends up in a new position. The radio channel must be changed.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.090
And the white vertical line indicating the current station must be moved.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.760
The position of the vertical bar is in the province of

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.860
a different machine from the one that was recording the moving of the knob.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.460
Somehow, it must be, this, this other state must be informed of the new station.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.460
This can be accomplished by using, by issuing a new internal event which

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.900
we'll just call event A to which the station machine responds.
