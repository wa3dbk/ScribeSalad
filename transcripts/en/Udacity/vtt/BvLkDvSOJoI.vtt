To draw the last graph or the last several graphs I had to use a set of axis.

00:00:04.757 --> 00:00:09.580
One for each variable we have in our equation. The standard way to set this up

00:00:09.592 --> 00:00:14.320
is to label the horizontal axis the x axis. This demarcates how are x values

00:00:14.332 --> 00:00:19.370
change. And the vertical axis is the y axis, showing how y values change. Now,

00:00:19.472 --> 00:00:23.840
every point on this plane is associated with both a value in the horizontal

00:00:23.852 --> 00:00:28.500
direction, an x value, and a value in the vertical direction, a y value. I also

00:00:28.512 --> 00:00:33.245
mentioned earlier that we identify points on our coordinate plane with a special

00:00:33.257 --> 00:00:37.600
notation. The first number listed is our x-coordinate, or our horizontal

00:00:37.612 --> 00:00:42.300
position. And the second number in the ordered pair is the y-coordinate or the

00:00:42.312 --> 00:00:46.565
vertical position of the point. The areas that you see on the ends of each axis

00:00:46.577 --> 00:00:50.900
represent continuation, so the x axis continues all the way out to infinity and

00:00:50.912 --> 00:00:55.225
also in the other direction, all the way out to negative infinity. And the same

00:00:55.237 --> 00:00:59.575
is true of the y axis so this coordinate plane are really able to represent, if

00:00:59.587 --> 00:01:03.720
we want to take as much time and paper as possible, any combination of 2 real

00:01:03.732 --> 00:01:08.039
numbers. And then of course we can depict it graphically. There is 1 single

00:01:08.051 --> 00:01:12.135
point on this graph however, 1 point out of that infinite number of points,

00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:16.611
that's really special. And we call it the origin. Which point of all these ones

00:01:16.623 --> 00:01:20.926
highlighted in teal do you think is special enough to have such an illustrious

00:01:20.938 --> 00:01:23.580
title as the origin? Click where you think it is.
