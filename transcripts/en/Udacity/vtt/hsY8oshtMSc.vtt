Welcome to lesson four. Lesson four is all about authentication. This is

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.982
one of my favorite lessons, actually. We're going to build a complete log

00:00:06.982 --> 00:00:09.520
in system, or learn how to build a complete log in system

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.520
rather. And then you're going to build a complete log in system for

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.450
your blog. So users can actually log in and register on the

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.600
blog that you've been working on so far. We're going to learn about

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.280
cookies, which is a little bit of information your browser stores to

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.600
know what user is logged into your blog. We're going to talk about passwords,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.790
an hashing passwords, an how to store those securely in your database. An

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.060
we'll also just talk about hashing in

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.760
general, because it's a really handy little

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.070
tool that'll come up, many times throughout

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.160
your, programming career. It sounds simple but

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.960
it's actually quite complex. It'll be a lot a fun. So, let's get started.
