00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.920
Their major issue is reliability, which we've alluded to already.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.920
We have a complex system that has multiple pieces to it and

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.690
that means a piece might go down, or might, be overloaded at,

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.070
at some particular point and how does the rest of the system, respond to that.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.290
Overall we can call that a reliability question.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.930
That is what percentage of the time is the overall application providing the,

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.140
the services that it should be providing. Typically you learn about

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.340
a reliability problem when some message that is sent is not delivered. Or

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.690
at least you don't get an acknowledgment back from it.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.140
When strategy is to try sending the message again. The danger there of

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.790
course is that the, recipient receives two copies of the message,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.660
and does whatever action is doing twice which also may be a problem.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.180
This is an example of a classic reliability performance tradeoff.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.670
That is. Whenever you use replication that's going to take more time and

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.620
more resources, as well as, as, as compromising the integrity of the system.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.680
You can do it faster but it may not be as reliable. Various policies for

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.830
dealing with reliabilities use have arisen such as the,

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.720
the client making its best effort. The client's saying it will do at most once,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.450
as far as message sending, at least once, exactly once and so on.
