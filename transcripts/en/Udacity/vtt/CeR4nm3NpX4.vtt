00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.827
It's an interesting question
about finding people early on,

00:00:02.827 --> 00:00:04.774
especially those first
couple of key hires,

00:00:04.774 --> 00:00:07.850
which can give you a lot of anxiety
because you feel like you're betting

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.543
the whole company on those first,
especially the first one.

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:14.081
But the first two or three, and people
will tell you that the first ten can

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:17.260
make or break your company,
and it's absolutely true.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.460
For me, what I usually did was find
fans of the product in the community.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.140
Because typically, I wasn't looking for,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.860
in the early days, technical skills
because I was able to do that work.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.410
And super enthusiastic users that
loved the product were the best

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.700
people to bring in.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.010
So I remember the first person,

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.110
I told you, I had trouble with
operations, it turned out somebody that

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.710
loved the product had been
an accountant in a previous life.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.450
And so I brought him in, and
he sort of took over all that for me.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.710
Oddly enough,
my second employer was my wife.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.408
And she was amazing,
a little difficult to work with, but

00:00:56.408 --> 00:00:57.463
[LAUGH] did a great job.

00:00:57.463 --> 00:01:01.691
And but yeah, for me, it was actually
finding users of the product that had

00:01:01.691 --> 00:01:04.620
skills, so they were already passionate.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.955
They were all excited, and
I've seen this model elsewhere.

00:01:07.955 --> 00:01:10.660
37 Signals talks about this too,
they find people that already

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.750
use the product,
they're really passionate about it.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.255
They're active in the community,
helping people already in forums.

00:01:16.255 --> 00:01:19.800
But this is the best people because
they've already sort of self-selected,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.450
based on their passion for the product.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.104
In my experience, finding people that
are already passionate about your

00:01:24.104 --> 00:01:25.129
product, even just a tiny,

00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:27.840
you're going to have a tiny audience
at that point when it's just you.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.260
But that's great,
that those people are super passionate.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.500
They sought you out.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.910
And so finding people with the skills
you need in that group has always really

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.150
worked well for me throughout my
sort of entrepreneurial career.
