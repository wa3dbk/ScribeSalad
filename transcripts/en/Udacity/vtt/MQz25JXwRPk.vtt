As we've said, health informatics
serves healthcare delivery,

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.440
the translation of medical knowledge
into the care of actual patients.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.350
Its key components are electronic
medical records, which are created and

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.070
used by licensed professionals, patient
generated personal health records.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.470
And a technology called
Health Information Exchange

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.490
that can be used to share information
among providers and patients

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.960
in order to aggregate information
to create a more comprehensive and

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.760
holistic electronic health record,
to manage patient populations and

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.040
the public health at large and
to support research of various kinds.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.780
Accomplishing this data exchange demands
technologies to assure privacy and

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.470
security of health data
as required by law.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.410
And other technologies
to define standards so

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.460
that data from diverse sources
can be meaningfully combined.
