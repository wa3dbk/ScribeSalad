00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
To make this process of simplifying even more rewarding Mozilla would offer rewards.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
For five problems simplified, a volunteer would be invited to the Mozilla launch party.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
For ten test cases simplified, he or she would also get an attractive stuffed animal

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
the Mozilla mascot.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
For 20 test cases one would get a t-shirt signed by the grateful engineers.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Let's see whether I can earn a stuffed animal.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Let's remove this part.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We invoke Mozilla. Failure still is there.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We remove another part, invoke Mozilla, failure is still there.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We remove another part, see how it gets simpler and simpler,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and the failure still is there. Mozilla still crashes.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Now I'm going to remove this entire Bugzilla page to a single line.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
If I now invoke Mozilla and invoke print, Mozilla crashes.
