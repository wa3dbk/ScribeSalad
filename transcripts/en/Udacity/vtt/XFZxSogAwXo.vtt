00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.548
The goal of the first three units in this course is to build a Web crawler

00:00:03.548 --> 00:00:06.281
that will collect data from the Web for our search engine.

00:00:06.281 --> 00:00:08.831
And to learn about big ideas in Computing by doing that.

00:00:08.831 --> 00:00:13.697
In Unit 1, we'll get started by extracting the first link on a web page.

00:00:13.697 --> 00:00:16.748
A Web crawler finds web pages for our search engine

00:00:16.748 --> 00:00:21.997
by starting from a "seed" page and following links on that page to find other pages.

00:00:21.997 --> 00:00:27.431
Each of those links lead to some new web page, which itself could have links that lead to other pages.

00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:31.064
As we follow those links, we'll find more and more web pages

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:34.513
building a collection of data that we'll use for our search engine.

00:00:34.513 --> 00:00:38.698
A web page is really just a chunk of text that comes from the Internet into your Web browser.

00:00:38.698 --> 00:00:40.730
We'll talk more about how that works in Unit 4.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.463
But for now, the important thing to understand is that

00:00:43.463 --> 00:00:47.564
a link is really just a special kind of text in that web page.

00:00:47.564 --> 00:00:50.881
When you click on a link in your browser it will direct you to a new page.

00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:53.998
And you can keep following those links as a human.

00:00:53.998 --> 00:00:58.331
What we'll do in this Unit is write a program to extract that first link from the web page.

00:00:58.331 --> 00:01:18.213
In later units, we'll figure out how to extract all the links and build their collection for our search engine
