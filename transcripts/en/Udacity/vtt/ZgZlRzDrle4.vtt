00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
So let's get the facts. The optimum solution contains, at most, N objects,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.999
simply because there's no more than N objects in the input itself. So it's almost a very coarse estimate,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.932
but it'll do for us. So due to the rounding, we may introduce some error. So the algorithm, when working with the rounded objects,

00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:26.232
might tell you that it's best thing to take this object here, this object here, this object here, and this object here, for example.

00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:31.966
But instead, it could have been better to actually take this one here instead of that one here.

00:00:31.967 --> 00:00:36.832
Or this object here instead of this object, and so on. Well, some, some might also be the same,

00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:42.232
but sometimes we might make mistakes by just taking the wrong objects. So we know that these kind of mistakes

00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:52.566
can only be made if the value of A divided by X, rounded down, is the same as the value of B divided by X, rounded down.

00:00:52.567 --> 00:00:58.532
So mistakes of this kind, taking the wrong object, can only be made if, to the algorithm, object A, value-wise,

00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:04.799
looks the same to the algorithm as object B, value-wise. Which means that the value of A--

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.266
so the original value, divided by X, rounded down, is the same as the value of B divided by X, rounded down.

00:01:11.267 --> 00:01:17.066
But that actually allows us to quantify a mistake. So mistakes can only be made if this condition here is fulfilled.

00:01:17.067 --> 00:01:23.032
Now, the amount of value lost in each mistake that we make is, of course, the value of the object, B,

00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:28.132
which is the more valuable object we should have taken, minus the value of object A.

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:34.332
And now my question to you, and this is of course a bit challenging, is what is the maximum difference in value

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:41.166
that actually objects B and A can have? And the way to figure this out is to look at this condition, because the mistake is only made

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:50.032
if this here is fulfilled. So what I would like you to figure out is what is the maximum difference in value between the objects B and A?

00:01:50.033 --> 00:01:52.000
And please enter your answer here.
