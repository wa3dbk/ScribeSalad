00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.040
We're down to the last
item on our checklist.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.680
Let's see where we are.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.070
Here's some footage I took earlier of
one of our video producers Hezekiah

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.360
stuffing a paratha in his mouth and

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.340
I want you to take note of
the space above his head.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.630
That's how we'll be able to tell whether
the video has been cropped to square.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.400
Now I'll trim the end a little bit and
there's our GIF.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.690
You can see that it's trimmed,
it's no longer distorted and

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.480
that space above
Hezekiah's head is gone.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.510
So we know that our GIF has
been cropped to square.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.230
So now we can check off
the last item on our list.
