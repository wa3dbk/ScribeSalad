00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.504
And the way search depends on how the index and ranks are represented is through

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:08.858
the outputs. So, the crawl_web procedure outputs two things, an index and a

00:00:08.858 --> 00:00:13.000
ranks list. Both of those are represented as dictionaries, the index maps the

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.900
keyword to a list of URLs and the ranks map the URL to its ranks score. In the

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.124
search module, a procedure like lucky_search depends on getting both of those

00:00:21.124 --> 00:00:25.105
things as inputs. So, this is quite a complex dependency, and this is the kind

00:00:25.105 --> 00:00:28.625
of thing that makes it much harder to maintain code, it makes it much harder to

00:00:28.625 --> 00:00:32.124
understand code, and it makes it much harder to change code. If we decide to

00:00:32.124 --> 00:00:35.772
change something about the crawler, well, we've gotta worry about all these

00:00:35.772 --> 00:00:39.985
procedures in search that use these outputs. So, our goal is to hide all that

00:00:39.985 --> 00:00:43.272
complexity. In general, the way we hide things is to use Abstraction.

00:00:43.272 --> 00:00:48.156
Abstraction is about hiding details. Our goal is to find a way to restructure

00:00:48.156 --> 00:00:51.747
the code so we don't need to know all those details and that's a form of

00:00:51.747 --> 00:00:55.752
Abstraction, Abstraction is all about hiding details. What we want is an

00:00:55.752 --> 00:01:00.376
abstract object that the crawler creates that has the properties search needs to

00:01:00.376 --> 00:01:04.660
be able to do its work but without search requiring to know the details of how

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.927
that's represented. So, our goal is to replace all this with one abstract

00:01:08.927 --> 00:01:14.224
object. We'll call that a Web Corpus, and that will be the output of the crawler

00:01:14.224 --> 00:01:19.404
and the input to the search. And we'll end up defining this Web Corpus object in

00:01:19.404 --> 00:01:23.484
a new module. What this is, is actually a new type, and Python provides a way to

00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:27.909
define new types. They're called classes. Before we get into how to create our

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.169
own type like the Web Corpus type that we need here, we're going to step back

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:34.933
and learn more about how types work in Python.
