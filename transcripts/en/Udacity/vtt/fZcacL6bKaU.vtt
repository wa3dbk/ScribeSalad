00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.000
As in the previous lessons,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.990
we will be using the iPython Notebook to perform the analysis.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.320
Look in the instructor's notes if you have any further questions as to how to

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.940
get started with the notebook for this lesson.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:21.200
We now set up some of the libraries that we will need to use for this lesson.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.020
We're going to use seaborn and matplotlib for plotting.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.600
We're going to use pandas for handling the data set.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.446
If you scroll down further, you will see a file in the medicare data folder.

00:00:37.446 --> 00:00:42.456
That says Medicare_Data_IL_2012.csv.

00:00:42.456 --> 00:00:46.280
This is a comma separated variable file.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.390
We created this file especially for

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.470
you so that you don't have to use the entire dataset.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.370
If you're interested in using the entire dataset.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.890
Use this commented out codes here to load the entire dataset.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.330
Now use the reads CSV library from pandas to read the data and

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.280
load it into a data frame.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.530
As before, to run this piece of code, we just use the play button here.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.488
Once the dataset is finished loading you will receive a message like this.

00:01:21.488 --> 00:01:27.710
The f_IL is the pandas dataframe.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.320
We can use the describe function to look at a summary of this data.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.740
Let's run this piece of code.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.580
Once this finishes running you should have a table that looks like this.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:47.600
The total number of events we have in the data frame is 387,623.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.080
You can slide this bar here to look at the rest of the table.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.560
Now let's look at the top five lines of the data frame.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.350
We can do that by using the head command.
