00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.724
Now if we compare this to the vertex form that we just came up with, we can see

00:00:04.724 --> 00:00:09.808
that we're already filling in things in most of the slots that we need. The left

00:00:09.808 --> 00:00:14.541
hand side is good to go. We have our a set with this 3, and we almost have this

00:00:14.541 --> 00:00:19.410
x minus h squared figured out. This isn't quite a perfect square yet though,

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.938
like x minus h squared is. So what do we need to add on to the expression x

00:00:23.938 --> 00:00:28.510
squared plus 2x? Which we have inside these parenthesis, in order to have a

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.912
polynomial that we can factor to be in the form, x minus h squared, where h is

00:00:32.912 --> 00:00:37.367
unconstant. Remember that if h is negative here, we end up with x plus some

00:00:37.367 --> 00:00:41.971
constant. So don't worry if you're wondering how to get x minus a number here.

00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:45.100
Just think about what we need to complete the square.
