00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:04.220
Pop quiz for you and for you.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.297
What was the last website you visited?

00:00:06.297 --> 00:00:07.980
Don't say Udacity.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.057
I'll pause for
a moment to let you think.

00:00:12.057 --> 00:00:15.217
Cam?

00:00:15.217 --> 00:00:17.130
&gt;&gt; Maybe Twitter?

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.091
I can't remember.

00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:19.429
Maybe [LAUGH].
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:20.652
&gt;&gt; You know, there's a pretty good

00:00:20.652 --> 00:00:23.110
chance that you are like me, and
you didn't immediately recall.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.190
And that's okay,
because everybody forgets things.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.920
It's not a big deal, but
as a developer you should do what you

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.570
can to help people remember what they're
doing while they're on your site.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.033
&gt;&gt; The good news is that
we've got the label element.
