00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.460
So, here's our x-y coordinate system and let's just forget about z for now.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:09.666
Let's start with a normalized vector 1,0 pointing along the x-axis. If I draw a

00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:17.505
normalized vector here at 0.8,0.6, the dot product between these two vectors is

00:00:17.505 --> 00:00:24.993
simply the x component, 0.8, with the vector 0.707,0.707, a 45-degree angle

00:00:24.993 --> 00:00:31.692
here. The dot product is again, the x component, 0.707, with the vector of

00:00:31.692 --> 00:00:37.868
0.6,0.8, the x component is 6, and that's the dot product. It's always the x

00:00:37.868 --> 00:00:42.754
component. Continuing on with the vector 0,1, the dot product between this

00:00:42.754 --> 00:00:47.476
vector and this vector is 0. Vectors at right angles to each other always have a

00:00:47.476 --> 00:00:51.283
dot product of 0. If you work your way around with more vectors, you'll form a

00:00:51.283 --> 00:00:56.475
circle. As you may recall from Geometry, the cosine is often defined as the

00:00:56.475 --> 00:01:01.801
distance in x of a point on the circle. So, as this vector angle increases, the

00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:06.715
cosine of this angle is computed by taking the dot product. I've known this fact

00:01:06.715 --> 00:01:10.940
for 30 years, but it's still slightly magical to me that taking a dot product of

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.360
two normalized vectors, which just multiplies and adds them together, gives you

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.286
a trigonometric function. If you're still not convinced, what you can do is plot

00:01:19.286 --> 00:01:23.163
out the various angles and what dot product you get out of them. And you'll see,

00:01:23.163 --> 00:01:27.309
you actually get a cosine curve. So, here are two normalized vectors. When you

00:01:27.309 --> 00:01:31.664
take the dot product geometrically, what is happening is that one normalized

00:01:31.664 --> 00:01:36.342
vector is being projected onto the other. That is, the dot product shows how far

00:01:36.342 --> 00:01:41.779
one vector extends with respect to some given vector. So, for 0.6,0.8, the

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:48.526
vector extends 0.6 along our initial vector. Another way to say this is that one

00:01:48.526 --> 00:01:53.095
vector projects onto the other vector to give this distance. This works both

00:01:53.095 --> 00:01:57.424
ways. Our initial vector can also be projected on to the second vector and get

00:01:57.424 --> 00:02:01.168
you the same length, 0.6. In other words, the dot product operation is

00:02:01.168 --> 00:02:05.849
commutative. A dot B gives the same answer as B dot A. Projecting one way gives

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:09.268
the same answer as projecting the other. That's it in a nut shell. The dot

00:02:09.268 --> 00:02:13.452
product projects one vector onto another vector. If both vectors are normalized,

00:02:13.452 --> 00:02:17.019
the dot product gives the cosine between them. We'll see in the next unit on

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.305
transforms, what happens when one or both vectors are not normalized. For

00:02:21.305 --> 00:02:24.880
computing the shade of the material, however, we have the tool that we need, so

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.543
let's use it.
