00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.070
To answer this question, let's think
about what commits were present on

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.210
GitHub and in your local repository
before and after git fetch.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.600
When you cloned the repository,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.900
the latest commit on it was Larry's
commit adding the chili recipe, so

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.330
that also became the latest
commit in your local repository.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.230
Of course,
there were other previous commits, but

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.810
I'm leaving them out here for
the sake of space.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.240
Now you made a commit
adding a new spice, so

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.590
that commit is also present
in your local repository.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.815
And that's where your master branch is.

00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:31.530
origin/master still points to
the commit that was on the remote at

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.210
the time that you cloned.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.654
After you cloned, Sarah added
the no cumin commit on GitHub, but

00:00:36.654 --> 00:00:40.280
your origin/master branch
won't reflect that yet.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.960
So, this is the state
of master on GitHub.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.890
Now, this was the state of

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.800
both repositories right
before you ran git fetch.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.640
So, if you ran git log origin/master,
you should have seen that Larry's commit

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.760
adding the chili recipe was present,
but your commit adding a new spice and

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.490
Sarah's commit removing cumin were not
present on the origin/master branch.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.865
If you run git status, you should have
seen that your branch was ahead of

00:01:03.865 --> 00:01:06.390
origin/master by one commit.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.720
This makes sense because git log and git
status both run without internet access.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.940
Suppose you were somewhere
without internet access when you

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.340
ran these commands.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.510
Your local git repository would have
no idea that the cumin commit existed.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.220
So, of course, the cumin commit
wouldn't be shown when you ran git

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.505
log origin/master.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.380
And git status wouldn't know that your
branches were actually out of sync.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.660
It thinks that your
branch is just ahead.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.710
Now when you run git fetch,
git fetches the no cumin commit and

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.370
updates the branch origin/master
to point to that new commit.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.420
Your local master still points at
the new spice commit like it did before.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.350
So at this point, you have a local
copy of the no cumin commit saved, and

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.030
you can access it via git log.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.340
If you run git log now,
you'll see both the no cumin commit and

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.760
the chili commit.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.740
You still won't see your new
spice commit since that's only on

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.350
your local master branch.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.340
Now, since both origin slash master and

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.955
master have one commit that
is not present on the other,

00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:07.325
git status will show that your branch
is out of sync with origin/master.
