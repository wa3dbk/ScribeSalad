00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.503
I know that 2 plus 5 makes 7 and 4 plus 10 makes 14, so I really have 7/14. We

00:00:04.515 --> 00:00:09.342
need to remember that when working with fractions, we can only simplify factors.

00:00:09.446 --> 00:00:13.762
We can only take out numbers that appear both in the numerator and in the

00:00:13.774 --> 00:00:18.265
denominator. So I can take out a 7. I know that 7 is the same as 7 times 1 and

00:00:18.277 --> 00:00:23.115
14 is the same thing as 7 times 2. So the 7's reduce to give me 1. And I'm left

00:00:23.127 --> 00:00:27.657
with 1/2. If you chose 1/2, nice work. We want to be careful when carrying out

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.347
this math. There are some other options that you might have thought about. You

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:36.898
might have thought about dividing 2 and 4 by 2, and 5 and 10 by 5. If you would

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.785
have cancelled out the terms, you would have gotten 1 plus 1 over 2 plus 2. This

00:00:41.797 --> 00:00:45.725
simplified to 2 force, which is the same as 1/2. But this thinking isn't

00:00:45.737 --> 00:00:50.170
correct. We know that we can only simplify factors. That is, numbers that appear

00:00:50.182 --> 00:00:54.575
in the numerator and the denominator as multiplication. We can't simplify terms.

00:00:54.672 --> 00:00:58.985
We did get the correct answer using this route. But it's not the correct mode of

00:00:58.997 --> 00:01:03.638
thinking when we simplify fractions. Some students work from here and then split

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.473
up this fraction into 1/2 plus 1/2. We know this isn't correct thinking because

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:12.439
we have a division bar. We have to keep our numerator together and our

00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:16.582
denominator together. Besides, we were canceling terms and not factors.
