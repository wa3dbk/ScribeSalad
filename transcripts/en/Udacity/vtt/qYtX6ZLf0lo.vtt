00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Without plotting it, I suggest the answer is no.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The size goes up monotonically, but the cost jumps up and down.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You won't find a way to drive a linear line through the data

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
when the size is increasing by the cost is bumping up and down.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I'll leave the drawing of a scatter plot to you as an exercise,

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but it looks about like that.
