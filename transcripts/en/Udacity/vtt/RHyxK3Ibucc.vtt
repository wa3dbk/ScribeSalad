00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.710
Now, we don't expect our predictions to be 100% accurate. There will almost

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.040
always be some error in our predictions. And that's in terms of the residuals.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.910
How can we quantify how much error we have? Well, remember mean and standard

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.500
deviation when we just had one variable? We had distributions that were fat and

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.600
skinny. And our expected value was always the mean. But we could always pick a

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.870
random value that's out here in the tails, and that's due to error. And how did

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.550
we measure this error? We used standard deviation as a measure to tell us how

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.090
far we expect most scores to fall from the mean. Now, let's take a step back.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.740
We have two data sets. We'll just call them red and blue for now. They have the

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.100
same regression line, as shown by this black line. You're trying to estimate

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.710
the y value when x equals 12. The expected or predicted value will be the same

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.560
for both, since they have the same regression line. But we can bet that the

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:10.420
actual or observed value won't be exactly equal to this. It might be somewhere

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.760
up here or down here, we won't know. We can only guess. But, for which data

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.580
set, red or blue, do you expect the actual measurement will be closer to the

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.330
prediction.
