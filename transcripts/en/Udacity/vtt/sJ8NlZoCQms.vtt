00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.220
The answer is that any column
corresponding to a positive entry of rD

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.730
is a good candidate.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.570
We want the entry to be positive
because the corresponding value of xD

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.210
is also going to be
positive as we increase it.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.091
Just picking the greatest entry, rD,

00:00:17.091 --> 00:00:20.250
doesn't work because this
still might be negative.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.950
This idea then becomes the basis for
the simplex algorithm.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:30.670
Pick a q such that rDq is positive and
we'll let xD just

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.530
be some scalar times the unit vector
along the qth coordinate axis.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.830
This choice simplifies the optimization
even further, since D times xD is

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:47.930
now just gamma times the Dth
column of the matrix D.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.840
We'll define this B inverse
time this column as u, and

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.820
we'll define B inverse times b as v.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.940
Of course,
the greater the gamma the more I get to

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.410
increase the objective value, so
i want to make it as big as possible.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.340
But how big can I make it?
