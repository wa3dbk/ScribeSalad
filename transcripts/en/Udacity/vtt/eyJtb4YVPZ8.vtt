00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.180
For working with time series data,

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.680
pandas provide a number of functions
to compute moving statistics.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.530
We use rolling mean function to
compute the rolling mean of the SPY.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.670
Note that rolling mean is
not a DataFrame method but

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.790
it is a function with
the pandas library.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.190
So we wouldn't be able
to call def.rollingmean.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.230
Instead we pass in a set of values for

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.650
which rolling mean has to be
calculated as the first parameter.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:28.920
Now let's go for this.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.840
Firstly, let's get SPY data in
our data frame for the year 2012.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.830
We also go ahead and plot the SPY data.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.720
Notice that we retain
the matplotlib axis object so

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.460
that we can add to it later on.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.190
Next we call the rolling mean
function from pandas library, and

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.300
pass in two parameters.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.320
As explained before the first
parameter would be the values for

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.050
which the rolling mean
has to be calculated.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.120
Hence we pass our data frame
containing SPY values.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.690
The next parameter is the window size,
for which the mean will be calculated.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.050
We use a period of 20 days.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.030
This will return a series
consisting of the rolling mean.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.220
It is always good to
visualize the rolling mean.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.740
So we plot the series
using the plot function.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.190
This time, while plotting the rolling
mean, we pass in the matplotlib

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.920
axis object so
that it gets added to the existing plot.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.040
Notice that we specified a label
is equal to rolling mean.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.290
This will be used to
create a plot legend.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.930
Let's add the legend and
some access labels to our plot.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.560
So here we add our legend to
the upper left corner of the plot

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.150
at the X label and the Y label.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.810
Finally we are all set to view the plot.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.810
Observe that the rolling mean
has missing initial values.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.080
The reason is that we defined
a window period of 20 days, so

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.100
the first 20 days there are no values.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.070
Also notice how it follows
the movement of the draw prices, and

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.090
is also less spiky.
