00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:06.780
The next key concept to consider is design documentation. If we're talking about

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.200
the software design of large systems, the systems are likely to be complex and

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.530
the scale and complexity beg for having good design documentation.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.620
If you've invested all that energy in developing the system, it's likely that

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.910
that system is going to around for a while and is going to be under maintenance,

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.550
maybe by people that were different than the original designers. And having some

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.190
form of written communication can be a big help. Different kinds of methods,

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.220
different kinds of applications, require different kinds of documentation.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.590
Those may range from formal, multi-volume documents,

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.860
to scribbled notes or, or slides in, that are used for presentations
