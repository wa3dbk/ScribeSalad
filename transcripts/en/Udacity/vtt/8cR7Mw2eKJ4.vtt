00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.016
Let's discuss the solution for our newest Iron Law quiz. We have 50 billion

00:00:05.016 --> 00:00:09.572
instructions with different CPIs, so clearly we need to use our newest version

00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:14.604
of the Iron Law of performance. Execution time is a sum of number of

00:00:14.604 --> 00:00:20.010
instructions of a particular type times the CPI for the type.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.217
In this case, it's 10 times 10 to the 9th,

00:00:25.217 --> 00:00:32.202
which is 10 billion, times 4 for branches, plus 15 billion

00:00:32.202 --> 00:00:39.580
times 2 for loads plus 5 billion times 3 for stores. And we said

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.220
the remaining instructions are integer add instructions. We have 30 billion

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.320
instructions here, so 20 billion are integer adds at CPF1. And all of that

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.220
times the clock cycle time, which is one over 4 times 10

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.450
to the 9th. Again, 4 gigahertz is the clock frequency.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.474
The clock cycle time is 1 over that. Now, let's do the math here. This is

00:01:05.474 --> 00:01:10.505
40 plus 30 plus 15 plus 20 times 10 to

00:01:10.505 --> 00:01:15.407
the 9th divided by 4 times 10 to the 9th,

00:01:15.407 --> 00:01:20.309
so 10 to the 9th can be crossed out and we get

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:25.930
105 over 4, which amounts to 26.25. So this

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.050
is how long it takes to run this 50 billion instructions

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.450
at 4 gigahertz, assuming these CPIs and this distribution of instructions.
