00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
If you remember I said engineering was doing waterfall development.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Waterfall development is just a step by step process that says

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
marketing rights are requirements of what the product should do.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Engineering takes that and translates that into features. Engineering then designs the product.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Either codes it or builds the hardware.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
They test it and they maintain it and this is kind of a waterfall life cycle step by step.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But if you really look at this, there's an implicit fallacy that no one ever noticed for 40 years.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
To write the requirements and do the design, assumes on day one

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
you know the problem or need the customer has.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Let me say it again, waterfall development assumes

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
you understand the customer problem and need on day one.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now in a large company with existing customers, existing products, existing sales channel,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
you know what, this might actually be true but in most startups all you have is the founder's vision

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and what you tend to do in a startup is confuse a faith-based vision

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
with customers facts about problems and needs and what happens?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The consequence of assuming you know the customer problem

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
means you assume you know every possible feature to ship on day one.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So therefore you shut the door and you start implementing

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and instead of just implementing a piece at a time,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
you actually implement every possible feature you could think about for version 1.0.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The irony is that we now know somewhere between

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
85 and 90% of most software product features are unwanted and unneeded by customers.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
That's an enormous amount of waste of time and money that ends up on the floor.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
We now know that waterfall and product management execution on two knowns

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
is just kind of the wrong way to approach it in a startup.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It makes all the sense in the world in a large company.
