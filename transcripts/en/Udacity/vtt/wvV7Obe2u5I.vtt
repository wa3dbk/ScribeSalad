00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.160
Scaffolding is a way of creating
a starting point structure for

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.800
your project based on a couple
of assumptions that you control.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.620
If say, all you do is create single page
movie promotions during your work hours,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.590
your gulp file might look
very similar every time.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.350
In that case, writing it from scratch
over and over is inefficient.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.310
And it's very likely that you've already
done the most basic form of scaffolding

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.500
plenty of times, copy and paste.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.350
To be fair, that's a perfectly
valid way of doing things.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.450
But it's not the most elegant
in the world of web development.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.310
Let's take a look at some
premade scaffolding tools.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.425
You'll find links to all three
in the instructor notes.

00:00:35.425 --> 00:00:36.465
If you're just starting out,

00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:40.035
the HTML5 Boilerplate is a nice
scaffolding starting point.

00:00:40.035 --> 00:00:43.805
All it does is give you a decent basis
for your CSS, HTML and JavaScript.

00:00:43.805 --> 00:00:47.506
It makes sure your HTML is well formed,
that fall backs are provided and

00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:49.080
that your CSS is normalized.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.925
On top,
it ships convenient stuff like JQuery.

00:00:52.225 --> 00:00:55.100
It has a simple build script to
combine and minify files, but

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.850
doesn't come with Gulp or
any other advanced build tool.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.820
You already passed that stage.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.630
For an intermediate solution,
check out the Web Starter Kit.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.190
It's an opinionated starting
point that we've built at Google

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.860
that already includes a built
configuration with live editing and so

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.020
on, but
it won't fit every project out there.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.900
And finally, Yeoman for the advanced
users, to which I'm counting you now

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.520
that you've reached almost
the end of our course.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.000
Yeoman is the most flexible
solution of the bunch.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.480
Use it together with so
called generators that fit the job.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.080
After calling Yeoman with the generator,
in this case the web app one,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.470
Yeoman asks you a few
questions about what you need,

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.600
then creates an empty project
template based on your preferences.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.840
It's basically a much fancier
version of copy and paste.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.770
Okay, why talk about this now,
at the end of the course?

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.510
There's no point in letting a
scaffolding tool generate a project and

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.020
build template that you have
no idea how to use and modify.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.750
Now that you know all the basics,

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.470
you'll be much more confident
trying out various Yeoman tasks.
