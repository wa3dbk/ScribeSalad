00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.280
I decided to do example number two. First off,

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.440
we request the page and start receiving the HTML.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.570
We start parsing it immediately and building the DOM.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.790
We come across two style sheets. Style.css and print.css

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.390
with a media query for print. We aren't printing,

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.050
so print.css isn't a part of the critical rendering

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.220
path. We only have to send out a request

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.520
for style.css. And then we continue parsing the DOM.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.330
We run into two script tags at the end of

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.600
the body. One for app.js and another for analytics.js. analytics.js

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.960
is async, so it's not a part of the critical

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.570
rendering path. We fire off a request for app.js and

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.380
halt building the DOM while we wait for CSS to

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.401
arrive and the CSSOM to be built. Now that we

00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:47.384
have the CSSOM, the job script engine is unblocked, so

00:00:47.384 --> 00:00:50.556
we can run app.js, finish building the DOM and then render

00:00:50.556 --> 00:00:52.680
the page. That wasn't to bad.
