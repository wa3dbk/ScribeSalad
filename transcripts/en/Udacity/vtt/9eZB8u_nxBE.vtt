00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.350
In the last exercise that you did with Sarah, something remarkable happened.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.189
Here we have a string we call toUpperCase. And then, we look at what's in the

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.030
variable on which we just invoked the method. And we notice that it does not

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:19.500
contain the upper case version. So, calling this method did not modify or as we

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.650
say, mutate the object. We say that toUpperCase is an accessor method, it

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.520
leaves the object on which it is called unchanged. Instead, it returns a value

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.770
and that value is then stored in this variable. The uppercased string is here,

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.800
the original string is still here. Contrast that with that method call. Here we

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.090
have a picture and we call the translate method on it. When the method is

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.600
called, the picture changes. It is moved to a different location. We say the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.660
object has been mutated. It is now different than what it was before. And we

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.680
call the translate method a mutator. So again, an accessor leaves the object on

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.476
which it operates unchanged, and mutator changes or mutates the object.
