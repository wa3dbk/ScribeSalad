00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.020
First we multiply by the LCD, rs on both sides of our equation. This gives us t

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.194
on the left side and, and the quantity t plus r times r on the right side. Next

00:00:10.194 --> 00:00:15.158
we distribute the rt to these terms to get this equations. We subtract rt from

00:00:15.158 --> 00:00:20.554
both sides to get t minus rt equals r squared. Remember, we want to solve for t

00:00:20.554 --> 00:00:24.852
so let's get it on one side. I'm going to rewrite our equation up here and now

00:00:24.852 --> 00:00:29.404
we have to factor. We want to get one t out of these two terms. If we factor our

00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:34.816
t, we're left with t times 1 minus r equals r squared. Finally we divide by 1

00:00:34.816 --> 00:00:40.032
minus r to get t is equal to r squared divided by 1 minus r. Fantastic work if

00:00:40.032 --> 00:00:43.941
you got this. Now I know this is pretty challenging so don't worry if you don't

00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:47.744
have the hang of it yet. Let's try working through a couple more and see if you

00:00:47.744 --> 00:00:48.313
pick it up.
