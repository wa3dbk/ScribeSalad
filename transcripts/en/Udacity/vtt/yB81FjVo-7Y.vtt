00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.399
If we take a closer look at the slopes, we can see that these slopes are

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:08.568
actually reciprocals of one another and opposite in sign. The slopes of

00:00:08.568 --> 00:00:12.724
perpendicular lines are always opposite reciprocals of each other. The

00:00:12.724 --> 00:00:16.398
reciprocal of four thirds is three fourths and then we make it negative. We

00:00:16.398 --> 00:00:19.304
change the sign. Now that we know a little bit more about parallel and

00:00:19.304 --> 00:00:22.460
perpendicular lines, let's put this knowledge to use.
