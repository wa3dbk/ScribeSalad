&gt;&gt; Note that the median splits the data in half. So we have the same amount of

00:00:05.463 --> 00:00:11.441
data points on the left as on the right. Now, let's include the geography major,

00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:17.444
Michael Jordan, who makes $500,000 a year. Where do you think the median is? Do

00:00:17.444 --> 00:00:28.656
you think it's 48,670? 53,160? Anywhere in between 48,670 and 53,160? Or exactly

00:00:28.656 --> 00:00:32.095
in between these two?
