00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.964
We're going to use our knowledge of perfect square trinomials to help us

00:00:02.964 --> 00:00:07.390
complete the square. To complete the square means to change a polynomial into a

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:13.330
perfect square trinomial. Let's consider this polynomial, x squared plus 4x.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.818
Now, let's use some tiles to help us visualize this polynomial. Here, we have a

00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:23.290
square that measures x by x. So its area is x squared, and here, we have 4 x's.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.536
We know that this side is also x and this side is just one unit long. So, 1

00:00:28.536 --> 00:00:33.307
times x equals x, the area of this tile. So, if we wanted to have a perfect

00:00:33.307 --> 00:00:38.730
square, how many one tiles do you think we needed to add here to do that? In

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.030
other words, what number should we add to our polynomial in order to get a

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.740
perfect square?
