00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.000
We claim that run.py is fast, very fast.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.610
So let's confirm this.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.670
But before that, we need to learn
how to time a particular operation.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.460
We need to import a library for that.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.280
We import the time library to help
us know how fast our operation is.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.810
We use the time function
from the imported library.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.380
The idea is to capture the time
snapshot before the operation, and

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.820
then again capture the time snapshot
after the operation is performed.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.100
We then subtract the two times.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.420
Simple, right?

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.010
Let's check the code.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.240
Here we will check how much time
a Python print statement takes.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.266
So we capture the time before
the print statement and

00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:44.854
then record the time after
the print operation is performed.

00:00:44.854 --> 00:00:48.193
Then, finally, subtract t2- t1.

00:00:48.193 --> 00:00:50.490
Let's run the code, now.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.690
Here, we get the time taken
by a print statement.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.570
Oh, the number is really very small.
