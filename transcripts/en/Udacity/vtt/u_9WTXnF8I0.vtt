00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.010
So let us return to our overall
process for case based reasoning.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.240
We have looked at
adaptation a little bit.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.260
Let's not look at evaluation.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.610
The adaptation step has not
given us a candidate solution.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.420
The evaluation step is
concerned with how to

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.390
assess the suitability of the candidate
solution to the problem at hand.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.960
So one method of doing evaluation
of a case based solution is

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:24.720
through simulation.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.432
Consider the problem going from
the home to the restaurant.

00:00:28.432 --> 00:00:33.364
Case based reasoning proposed
a candidate solution.

00:00:33.364 --> 00:00:35.730
In order to find out whether
this solution actually works,

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.200
I can do a simulation.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.260
I can even do an execution
in the [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.050
In this case, we might find out
if solution actually works.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.160
And we might accept the solution.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.020
Now, consider an alternative problem.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.510
This time, we have to go from
the restaurant to the home, and

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.690
we decided we would simply
flip all the turns.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.050
But as we execute the solution,

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.219
we find out that some of
the turns are only one way.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.850
Now this particular solution fails.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.170
In this particular domain, the cost
of executing a solution may be low,

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.480
therefore we can just go ahead and
execute it.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.880
In other domains, the cost of execution
may in fact be quite high and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.860
the best we can do is to first simulate
it before we decide to execute it.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.690
&gt;&gt; So evaluation is built very
closely into our programming example.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.130
Every time we run a program and see
whether or not it worked, we're in fact

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.880
evaluating whether or not our adaptation
successfully solved our new problem.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.860
When it didn't, we return to
the adaptation phase and we try again or

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.820
we might return to the retrieval phase,
and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.980
retrieve another case to
use to inform our solution.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.900
&gt;&gt; In design more generally,
we can simulate the design, or

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.890
we can actually prototype a design.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.290
Under the matter for
evaluating a design could be to

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.180
share it with other designers and
let them critique it.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.370
So there are a number of different
methods that are possible for

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.090
evaluation as well.
