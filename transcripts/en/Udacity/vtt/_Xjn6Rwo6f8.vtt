00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.600
So far, you've defined the profile entity class in

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.020
your application. We don't actually yet do anything with it.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.348
The next step is to add the code to saveProfiles

00:00:08.348 --> 00:00:10.950
in the datastore. But you've already been working in the

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.190
conference api.java class and remember that it defines a saveProfle

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.170
method, which doesn't actually yet do any saving. But it

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.860
will, when we're done with it. The next step is

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.260
to actually write the code, that saves the entity in

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.700
the datastore. And it's marked in the file for

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.980
you as TODO 3. But before I set you

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.020
loose to do that, I just want to review

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.710
how to save entities in the datastore using objectify.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.280
Okay. So, we're going to look at how to

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.200
save entities in the datastore using objectify. You use

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.530
your objectify service. The, the ofy method, you call

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.540
the save method, call the entity method passing the entity

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.250
to actually save and then, now. The now means,

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.850
go ahead and do it right now. It's usual

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.500
practice to define a static ofy method, so you

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.410
can simplify the code like this. Just call ofy. So,

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.060
if you remember we talked about recipes a little

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.890
while ago. Here's how you might save a recipe. So,

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.970
this assumes that we've created a recipe entity bound

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.720
with variable recipe one, so we just pass in recipe

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.270
one as the entity to save, and there it is.
