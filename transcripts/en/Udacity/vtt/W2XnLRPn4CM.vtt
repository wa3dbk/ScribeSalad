00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.840
So what went wrong in this application? It

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.980
was this right here, the 3G data connection.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.990
What ended up happening is this application is

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.750
currently violating data and battery constrains of mobile.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.970
&gt;&gt; So what the application should have done is by default download

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.800
the video at 480p or the lowest resolution, because the user's on 3G.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and what ends up happening is if you're trying

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.510
to download this humongous video over this really slow network connection,

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.210
it'll take forever to download the video,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.430
which will drain your cellular, because it's

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.460
cellular radio. It's going to drain your battery.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.740
Two, it will take forever to download

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.550
the video, so the playback is going to be really janky anyway. And so just

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.160
avoid it. Just downgrade to a lower resolution or queue it for playback later.
