00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.760
Let's try another example,
follow along with me.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.360
This time we're going to write
a function that takes in a string and

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.840
returns a string with
the first letter removed from

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.868
the beginning of the string,
and instead placed at the end.

00:00:11.868 --> 00:00:14.680
We've got the func let's give it a name.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.880
Let's call it a placeFirstLetterLast.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.550
It's going to take in
a string as a parameter.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.720
Let's call that parameter myString and
it will return a string as well.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.582
And now comes the meat of the function.

00:00:29.582 --> 00:00:33.010
Just going to put a placeholder
string here to quiet the compiler.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.350
Let's start out by adding the first
letter to the end of myString.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.172
We can do that using
the append function.

00:00:38.172 --> 00:00:42.360
Append is a method, a function
that's part of the String class.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.208
So we call the method append on an
instance of the String class using dot

00:00:46.208 --> 00:00:47.070
syntax.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.430
We just type the name of the string,

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.430
a dot, and the name of the method
followed by parentheses.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.570
We place any input parameters
between the parentheses.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.450
In this case the parameter is
a character to append to myString.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.058
So how will we get the first
character of myString?

00:01:02.058 --> 00:01:05.730
Well, we just wrote a function that
returns the first character of a string.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.140
Let's use that and
put it here is the argument to append.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.100
Hm, okay the compiler's
upset about something.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.210
Let's see what this error says.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.262
Immutable value of type String only
has mutating members named depend.

00:01:19.262 --> 00:01:23.630
See, because myString is a parameter,
it defaults to being a constant,

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.270
as if it were declared with let.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.130
If we declare it with var,
the error should go away.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.350
Sweet, so far we've appended the first
letter to the end of the string.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.830
Now we need to also remove it
from the beginning of the string.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.225
For that we can use the function,
removeAtIndex.

00:01:43.225 --> 00:01:45.900
RemoveAtIndex takes
an index as a parameter.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.200
The index we want to
remove is the startIndex.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.900
And of course instead of returning
placeholder, we want to return myString.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.190
And that ought to do it.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.562
So let's test it out by
calling the function, and

00:01:58.562 --> 00:02:00.820
we'll call it on the string Mom.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.223
Over here in the sidebar you can
see that Mom becomes omM, and

00:02:04.223 --> 00:02:06.160
we're ready for yoga.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.758
But before we move on, I'd like you to
notice the difference between how we

00:02:09.758 --> 00:02:12.598
call global functions,
and how we call methods.

00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:16.080
For example, append is called on
an instance of the string class

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.470
using dot syntax, it's a method.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.170
Global functions, on the other hand,
like placeFirstLetterLast,

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.260
are not called by any
object in particular.
