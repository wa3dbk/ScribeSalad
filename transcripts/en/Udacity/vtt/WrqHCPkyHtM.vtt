00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.010
In this example, we're going to start from an informal specification, and the

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.670
specification is the one shown here in file spec.txt. This is the

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.210
specification for the maintenance function in a specific system. So what we're

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.630
doing is that we're taking the description of the functionality of a system,

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.219
and we're building a model, in this case a final state machine

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.710
for it. And there is no need to look at all the details

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.350
for this specification, but I want to point out that if you

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.640
look at the way the specification is written, we can identify specific cases

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.210
that we need to take into account. Like here if something

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.920
happens, something else will follow. Again, if something happens something else

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.690
will follow. So we have multiple choices here. Here will determine

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.140
the next steps and so on. So all we have to

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.420
do is to go through this process, identify these cases and

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.300
then build a machine that represents these cases. For the spec

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.830
that we just consider this is the state machine that will

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.960
result. Again there is no need to go through all the details,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.090
but what I want to point out is that we have

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.710
a set of states. So for instance, we have state zero,

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.380
which is no maintenance, and if a request comes in, the

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.350
system will move, and the system wait for pickup. Then if

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.400
the pickup actually occurs, the system will move to the repair

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.540
state, and so on and so forth. So this is just

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.070
a more systematic representation of what was in the former specification.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.160
And I will argue that this is much easier to understand at

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.170
least for somebody who has to develop tests for this system. In

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.770
fact what we're going to see next is how we can go from that

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.790
representation to a set of test cases. And the way which we do

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.950
it is by covering the behaviors represented by defining state machine. And we

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.500
can decide how we want to cover them. For example we might want

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.080
to cover all the states. So we might want to identify paths in

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.310
the state machine that go through all the states in the machine. Like

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.840
the one I just draw or this one, this one and this one.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.900
So if we consider these four test cases, we can see that all the

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.470
states in my system or at least all the states that I have identified

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.450
are covered. I might want to go a little further, and decide that I

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.210
don't only want to cover all of the states, but I want to cover, all

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.930
of the transitions, because, it makes sense to visit a state, when coming from

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.380
different states. And, if I want to do that, and I look at the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.440
test cases that I generated so far, I can see that there is one

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.910
transition, the one here, that is not covered. And, the same can be said for

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.210
the two transitions here. So what I can decide to do is

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.370
to generate another test case, that covers those or extend an existing one.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.500
For instance, I could extend this test case by adding a visit to

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.760
the state, before going back to these two. Alternatively, I could also generate

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.390
new test cases, such as this one. To cover the missing transitions.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.350
And once I have these test cases, I can express them in a

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.860
clearer way by simply specifying what are the states that they cover. I'm

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.990
just going to give you a couple of examples. Say, if we look

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.280
at the last one that I added, which will be test case

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.190
number five, I just need to specify that it will go through state

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.090
zero, which is this one, five, which is this one, six, and

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.130
then back to zero. And I can do the same for the other

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.500
test cases. So this will be my complete set of test cases.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.060
So the bottom line here is that it is much harder to build

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.080
a set of test cases that will cover the behavior of an informal

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.970
description. But by going through a model, so by building in this case,

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.700
a finite state machine for that description, we can, in a much easier way, see

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.100
what the behaviors of interest of the system

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.960
are, and try to cover them. And there

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.400
is again in the spirit of breaking

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.950
down a complex problem into smaller steps that

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.620
we can better manage, which in the end,

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.450
results in a more efficient and effective testing.
