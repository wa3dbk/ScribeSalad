00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.425
So what we're going to try to do is expose a little bit of parallelism,

00:00:02.425 --> 00:00:06.082
and we're going to do that by first computing a + b

00:00:06.082 --> 00:00:08.954
and perhaps at the same time computing c + d

00:00:08.954 --> 00:00:11.089
and then add the results together.

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:14.627
Now what's that going to look like in terms of our tree structure?

00:00:14.627 --> 00:00:18.091
So now we've got serial reduce and parallel reduce side by side.

00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:22.760
Here's serial reduce and the equation. Here's parallel reduce and the equation.

00:00:23.236 --> 00:00:28.249
Now what we've done to do parallel reduce is regrouping these operations in a different order,

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:30.877
and this exposes more concurrency.

00:00:30.877 --> 00:00:35.093
We now have the ability to run multiple operations in parallel at the same time.

00:00:35.093 --> 00:00:39.677
Now you see why associativity was a necessary quality of the reduction operator.

00:00:39.677 --> 00:00:43.263
We can reassociate operations to expose more concurrency,

00:00:43.263 --> 00:00:47.599
then we can run concurrent operations in parallel to reduce the time to solution.

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:50.560
Let's see how this works with our 4 element reduction.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.236
Let's compare our serial reduction and our parallel reduction.

00:00:54.236 --> 00:01:00.240
Both of these have 3 additions. Both of them have 3 units of work.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.583
But whereas the serial reduction has 1, 2, 3 steps to complete,

00:01:05.583 --> 00:01:10.048
the parallel reduction only has 1, 2 steps to complete.

00:01:10.048 --> 00:01:14.711
So potentially, we can run this with parallel hardware and it will complete faster.

00:01:15.572 --> 00:01:19.756
If we extend this problem to reduce a set of elements of size n,

00:01:19.756 --> 00:01:24.858
we're very interested in the work and the step complexity as a function of n.

00:01:24.858 --> 00:01:29.308
So what's the complexity of these 4 metrics? So 3 of them are pretty straightforward.

00:01:29.308 --> 00:01:35.643
The serial implementation here has both O(n) linear work and linear steps.

00:01:35.643 --> 00:01:39.446
And the parallel reduction also has linear work, so it's also O(n).

00:01:39.446 --> 00:01:44.415
But this one's a little bit more complicated to compute. So let's dive in and take a look at this.
