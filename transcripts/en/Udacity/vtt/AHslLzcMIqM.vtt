00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.300
We'll now have a look at the domain name system or DNS. The purpose of

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.950
the domain name system is to map human readable names such

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.130
www.gatech.edu to

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.640
IP addresses such as 130.207.160.173.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.190
A name such as this is human readable and much easier to remember and type than

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.530
an IP address. But in fact, the IP address

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.070
is what's needed to send traffic to the intended destination.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.180
So, we need a look up mechanism that takes

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.660
a human readable name and maps it to an IP

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.210
address. The system that does this is a Domain

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.250
Name System, or the DNS. They system roughly works as

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.110
follows the client may want to look up a

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.450
domain name such as www dot [UNKNOWN] edu the network

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.590
application source code might do so by invoking

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.260
a function such as get host by name. Which

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.720
takes as an argument a domain name and

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.180
returns an IP address. The client typically has what's

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.110
called a stub resolver, and that stub resolver

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.790
takes that name and issues a query. The stub

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.660
resolver might have cached the answer or the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.760
IP address corresponding to this name but if not,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.620
the query is sent to what's called a

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.660
local DNS resolver. Your local DNS resolver, is typically

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.060
configured automatically when your host is assigned an IP

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.360
address using a protocol called the domain host control

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.700
protocol or DHCP. In your host configuration such as

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.900
this one, you can see that this local host

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.340
has two local DNS resolvers. Typically, a client will

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.060
try the first DNS resolver and if it doesn't

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.600
receive a response within a preconfigured timeout, it will

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.410
try sending the same query To the second local

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.430
DNS resolver as a backup. This query is typically

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.570
issued recursively, meaning the client does not want intermediate

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.900
referrals sent back to it. It only wants to

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.900
hear when it's received the final answer. The local

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.020
resolver on the other hand will perform iterative queries.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.330
It might have the answer, to this particular query,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.210
in the cache in which case it would

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.390
simply reply with the answer. But let's suppose for

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.250
the moment, that nothing is cached, each fully qualified

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.690
domain name is presumed to end with a dot,

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.520
indicating the root of the DNS hierarchy. Now

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.360
the IP addresses for the root servers, or those

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.820
that are authoritative for the root may already be

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.410
configured in the local DNS resolver. In this case,

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.800
the resolver may be able to query for

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.740
the authoritative server for .edu and say a.rootservers

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.550
Dot net. This would be an a record

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.840
query. The answer might return with what's called an

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.240
NS record which is a referral. In this case the answer might be a referral to

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.190
the edu servers. Now the local resolver issues

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.520
the same query to the edu servers and receives

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.695
a referral to the authoritative servers For

00:03:00.695 --> 00:03:07.390
gatech.edu. Finally the local resolver might query the authoritative name server

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.650
for gatech.edu and actually receive an A record indicating

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.970
the actual IP address that corresponds to that name.
