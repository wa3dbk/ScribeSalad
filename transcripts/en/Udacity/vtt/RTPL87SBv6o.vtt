00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
For this problem, we've taken a list p,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and we want to return each value in the list multiplied by each other.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The multiplicative identity is 1.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Let's start total as 1.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The reason we do this is because it works for any value of p[0] against which we multiply.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We're then going to go through the list and multiply our incrementing total by each value.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
At the end we're going to return total. That's it.
