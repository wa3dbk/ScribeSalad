00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
If you're wondering who "Ada" is in all of those strings,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Ada is Augusta Ada King, who is arguably the world's first computer programmer.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Back in the 1840's, in England, she started to think about how to program mechanical computers--

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Charles Babbage was proposing to build such machines--

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and Ada was the first person to really think about how to program them.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Grace Hopper wasn't the first person to think about

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
doing things other than arithmetic with computers.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Back in the 1840's, Ada was already thinking about that.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You can see this quote here from her:

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
"It might act upon other things, besides number,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
could be expressed by those of the [abstract] science of operations..."

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The "it" that she's talking about is the analytical engine that Babbage was proposing to build.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
He never succeeded in building it--

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
in the 1840's, the technology for building it

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
was not quite good enough to make a machine that precise.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
But he had a design for it,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and Ada was thinking about programming it to do more interesting things.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The quote goes on to talk about actually using it to compose music.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
["...and which should also be susceptible of adaptations

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine..."]

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
People do use computers to compose music today.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
It's debatable whether or not you actually want to listen to that music,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
but certainly it's something computers can do.
