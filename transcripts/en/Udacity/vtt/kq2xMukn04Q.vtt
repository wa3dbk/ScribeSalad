00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.210
I know you' are wondering when this is going to end. We're almost done,

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.200
we're almost done. Let's consider what happens when the first example comes.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.500
This is a negative example as indicated by the red outline.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.190
Because the negative example, we must specialize in most journal

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.660
characterization, in such a way that this negative example is dueled out,

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.390
and this specialization is consistent with. The most journal version,

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.690
starting from the most specialized concept characterization.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.170
The only specialization of this journal concept, that both excludes this and

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.620
is consistent with this node is, Sam's cheap. It excludes this,

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.530
because it is cheap here, it will rule out the fact that this is expensive here.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.180
Now the agent noticed that these two particular consequences positions

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.280
are the same and if a convergence has occurred. Now we have the answer we

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.800
wanted. I get allergies whenever I go to Sam's and have a cheap meal.
