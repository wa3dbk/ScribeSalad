00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.896
So this is the general formula for any ellipse. The center doesn't have to be

00:00:04.896 --> 00:00:10.156
at the origin and the values of h and k determine what our center is. Notice

00:00:10.156 --> 00:00:14.116
too, that if our center is the origin, then the value of h would be 0 and the

00:00:14.116 --> 00:00:20.974
value of k would be 0. If we subtract 0 from x, we'll still have x. So we'll

00:00:20.974 --> 00:00:26.590
just have x squared over a squared plus y squared over b squared equal to 1.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.130
This is the first general formula we saw for any ellipse centered at the

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.952
origin. I mean, this was the second general formula we saw for any ellipse

00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:40.205
centered at h comma k. Keep in mind that if these signs are negative then both

00:00:40.205 --> 00:00:45.394
the values of h and k will be positive. Whereas these signs are positive then

00:00:45.394 --> 00:00:48.410
that means the values of h and k are negative.
