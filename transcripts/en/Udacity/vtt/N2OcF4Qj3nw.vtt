00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The next important property is that it's actually secure,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and we're going to focus first on secure against a passive eavesdropper,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
so this is an adversary that can listen in on all the messages

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
but can't modify them.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
That means the adversary will be able to get the public values q and g.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We'll also be able to hear all the messages transmitted,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
so we'll be able to learn yA and yB,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and our goal is to be confident that the adversary

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
would not be able to learn k AB.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The question is which of these would be most convincing

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
in proving that the Diffie-Hellman protocol is secure?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The first is that showing that the number of possible xA values to guess is too high.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The second is showing that an attacker who could solve a known hard problem

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
would be able to compute the key.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And the third is showing that an attacker who can compute the key

00:00:50.000 --> 99:59:59.000
would be able to solve some known hard problem.
