00:00:00.257 --> 00:00:07.640
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.056
This course, software architecture and design, is divided into parts,

00:00:12.056 --> 00:00:16.450
each interleaving content lessons within class exercises.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.070
After a few introductory lessons we will begin by looking at

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.640
the process of analyzing a design problem and specifying it using UML and

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.830
OCL. Both the static and dynamic aspects of analysis will be presented.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.140
The next part of the course has to do with software architecture.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.951
This includes different ways of thinking about and representing architectures,

00:00:36.951 --> 00:00:41.210
the role of non functional requirements in determining architecture, and how

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.370
architectural designs can be refined into modules that can then be implemented.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.310
The final part of the course gets into the specifics of software design,

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.830
including object design, design patterns, design principles, and design reviews.
