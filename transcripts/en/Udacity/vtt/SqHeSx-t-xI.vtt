00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.976
Based on these two examples, maybe you can figure out a pattern. How did we get

00:00:04.976 --> 00:00:10.008
this answer from this term and this term? And how did we get this answer from

00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:14.662
this term and this term? Using what you see here, write a general rule for

00:00:14.662 --> 00:00:17.268
finding the quantity of a plus b squared.
