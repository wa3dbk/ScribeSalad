00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.980
To create this plot, we're going to have much of the

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.390
same code as before. We'll pass tenure to our x variable,

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.870
and then we'll pass friendships initiated divided by tenure to

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.810
our y variable, and we'll subset our data frame so that

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.050
we only consider users who have a tenure of at

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.010
least one day. We'll color our line by year_joined.bucket and then

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.790
we'll plot the mean of the y variable across tenure. Taking

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.970
a closer look, it appears that users with more tenure typically

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.720
initiate less friendships.
