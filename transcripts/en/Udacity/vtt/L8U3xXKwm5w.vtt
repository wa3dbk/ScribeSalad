00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.500
That ends the lesson.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.990
I was about to say that ends
the lesson on Luke's flow.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.610
That's pretty much true.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.790
It's only a little bit of a lie because
we're going to see a little bit more

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.440
of this derivative motion stuff in the,
in the next lesson.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.280
But basically what we did is we solved
for a different flow at every point

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.920
by assuming that a window over that
point had a particular flow everywhere.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.400
Then we move the window a little bit,
and now we pretend that

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.250
in this new window, the flow might be
something different, even though those

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.670
windows overlap, which is a little
strange but, but that's how you do it.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.470
So it's okay to have small
errors along the way like that.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.190
But the idea, so there's a little
bit of a contradiction here, right?

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.060
In fact that contradiction
is in what I just said.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.960
We assume that a window is all
moving the same way around a point,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.960
and we assign that value to that point,
then we move the window a little bit and

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.780
we throw away that last thing,
and we say we're

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.120
going to assign it to the next point
even though those windows overlap.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.980
You might say,

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.000
I want to carve the image up into
sort of coherently moving patches.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.440
And so, there's two parts of that.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.060
There's this notion of how
do I do the carving up.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.000
And what do you mean
by coherently moving?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.140
And what that means is you've
got a model for the motion

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.620
inside these regions, and the next
lesson will talk about motion models and

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.720
how we could find regions that behave
according to some motion model.
