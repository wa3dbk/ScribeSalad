We started looking at a pretty simple
feature, just replacing a few icons.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.780
After realizing getting those icons
from the network was more complicated

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.170
than at first glance, we were able
to integrate a library, Glide,

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.660
to get us back to being a pretty simple,
manageable extension to Sunshine,

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.230
that gives users the ability to really
make Sunshine feel like their own.
