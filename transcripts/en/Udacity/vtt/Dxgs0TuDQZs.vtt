Before using reductions to prove that
certain languages are undecidable.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.939
It sometimes helps to get some practice
with the idea of reduction itself,

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:08.650
as a kind of warm up.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.720
WIth this in mind, we've provided
a few programming exercises.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.220
Good luck.
