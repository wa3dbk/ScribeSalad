00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Welcome to the Homework 2 solutions.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In this first question we're going to go over how to reason about the state of a chart

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
when parsing a token in a given grammar.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Right here I have a grammar that identifies JavaScript function calls.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Let's say I have a function, pow, which computes the power of a number

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
to another number--doesn't really matter.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The idea is that this function computes 5 to the 6th.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But what we care about is the tokens right here.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And to show that this string is in this grammar, we're going to walk through it.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Here I've written our first starting rule, which goes to id, some parentheses,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and then optional arguments.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So the id in this case is pow, and then we have 2 parentheses,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and the optional arguments in the case of our example is 5 and 6.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We don't have to have anything here. As the title implies, it's optional.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It could go right to the empty string. But we do have arguments.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
In this case, we're going to have some kind of expression

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
or an expression followed by a comma with more arguments.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And in this case we have 2, so the optional arguments goes to arguments.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It's not empty, so it's going to go to this rule.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And then from arguments we're going to go to this rule

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
where expression is going to be 5.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We have the comma. That matches our comma.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The rest of the rule is going to be ARGS, which goes to--

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Since this is our last argument, it's just going to go straight to expression, which is 6.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And we were able to match this string to the grammar

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
using the set of replacement rules given.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So I just went through that to demonstrate how this grammar matches JavaScript function calls.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
But that's not really what the question is asking.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The question is asking about the chart.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We're going to see what happens when we parse a certain set of tokens.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Instead of writing the actual string, I just have the tokens that matter.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And for the sake of parsing, that's all we care about.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
This can be matched by what I had before.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
But all we care about is the tokens.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Now, when we parse this, what we want to ask is

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
what is in Chart 2, the third entry in our chart?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And so we're given a set of rules that may be in the chart.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I'm just going to go through them real quick. So here are your choices.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
We're trying to figure out--as a reminder--what's in the second entry in our chart

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
when we parse this list of tokens and this grammar.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And since we're asking a question, we should remember question marks.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
So there's really 2 ways to solve this.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
The first is you work out the chart by hand.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
That's what we're going to do because it's easier to kind of explain what's going on.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
An alternative which is equally valid is to take the code that we wrote in lecture

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and modify it to print the chart at every given state.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
This is probably what you would want to do if you were asked this question more than once.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
But, like I said, for the sake of going over the answer, we're going to work it out by hand.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Okay. Here's our input. Here is our grammar.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
We want to know what's in Chart 0.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
We haven't read anything in yet, so we're just going to be at the beginning

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
of the start substitution rule.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
We introduced this in Chart State 0.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So now we're on Chart 1 and we've read in 1 token, id.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
We're just going to shift on this rule because id is the first token in this rule.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And this comes from 0 as well.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So now the moment of truth, Chart 2.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Let's see what we can do.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
We're going to see the token--that's the left parenthesis--and we're going to shift.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So here there are 2 things that are possible.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
One is that optional arguments is empty.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
We don't know yet because we haven't seen the rest of the input token list.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
In that case, we're going to be past optional arguments.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
There's also the case where optional arguments isn't empty,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
which is actually what's going on with our input list.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
So let's write both those out.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Here we've moved past optional arguments,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
presumably because it's empty by this rule right here.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Then we have the other choice where optional arguments is not empty

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and we're going to be processing it.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
So regarding this first rule in our chart, we have the optional arguments being empty.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So we need to make sure to add that.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
We introduced this in Chart State 2.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
We have the other case where optional arguments is not empty,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and we're going to go through ARGS now.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So I have written out both ARGS rules,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and since we haven't read in this next token, we don't have anything

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
to go further on in either rule,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
so at the beginning of each rule.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And presumably, the next chart state we will shift over with the new expression.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So now we have everything we need to answer the question.

00:04:32.000 --> 09:59:59.000
We're just going to check off the choices that were in our Chart State 2.
