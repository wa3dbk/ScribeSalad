00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.455
Let's make sure we made the same observations.

00:00:02.455 --> 00:00:08.060
Now, not all observable elements are actually visible on the page.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.950
So, this first answer actually isn't correct.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.030
However, all highlighted elements are rectangular.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.030
And if you go deep enough into the structure,

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.910
you can read the same text as printed on the page.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.770
If we go back to our browser, you'll notice that every element in

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.080
the structure as we mouse over it is a rectangle.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.820
Also, if we go deep enough into the structure,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.420
we can find the same text that's printed on the page.
