Making a web app work offline or

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.340
have amazing performance on slow
networks used to be extremely hard.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.130
But service workers changed that.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.850
I've asked Jake Archibald to
explain service workers for us.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:14.950
Jake, take it away.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.650
&gt;&gt; Service workers is a JavaScript realm
execution context in an environment

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.020
settings object with its own event
loop and node document dependency.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.850
Unlike similar context,
which is shared workers, this context's

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.380
life cycle is dictated by life cycle and
functional extendable events and

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.130
their associated array of
extended life cycle promises.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.166
Although, the user agent may apply
a grace period to avoid startup shutdown

00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.268
overhead between events.

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:38.428
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:38.428 --> 00:00:40.560
&gt;&gt; Okay, that made no sense.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.430
Let's try this from a different angle.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.090
A service worker is a JavaScript
file that is run by your browser

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.140
in the background,
separate from your webpage.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.480
And handles events fired either
by the browser or your webpage.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.920
Since it's run in the background it
doesn't need the webpage to be open.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.380
And it doesn't show any markup.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.490
Where it really shines is
the events that it can listen for.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.700
One of the most exciting is
the ability to handle fetch events,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.850
intercepting and
responding to network requests.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.820
This puts the service worker virtually
between the network and the browser.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.820
Allowing the service worker to
provide content even when offline.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.870
Because the service worker can listen
for an event, even when the page isn't

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.480
open, they can respond to push messages
sent from the server to the browser.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.720
Imagine a chat web client that let's you
know you've got a new unread message.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.740
This simply was impossible before.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.160
In the future, service workers will
support other things like periodic sync,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.260
geofencing, and more.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.590
In the past, you could have
tried using app cache to try and

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.730
make an app work offline but
it was a pain.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.120
There were too many gotchas and
it didn't have the power or

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.260
flexibility that service workers brings.
