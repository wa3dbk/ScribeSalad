00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Once you've got the order on y and x right, the rest should be pretty straightforward.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We're going one step left, we're going one step right, we're going one step down,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
we're going one step up, and subject four times the original value.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And the result is that our initial square has turned into a soft blob.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
In case you're wondering, we're using 50 steps from the left to the right

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and from the bottom to the top.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
How could we get such a smooth picture with just 50  50 values. The trick is interpolation.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So let's switch off interpolation to see how our raw data really look like.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Now, you can see those 50 steps in x direction and y direction.

00:00:41.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Interpolation turns this pixelated image into one that looks really smooth.
