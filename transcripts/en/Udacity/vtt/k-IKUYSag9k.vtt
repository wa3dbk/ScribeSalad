00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.780
Similar to Alice, Bob has been asked to design an algorithm that would find these large group

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.490
of genes because as I'm sure you already have noticed in this quiz,

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.580
it's rather difficult to find these large groups.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.980
You start out by finding small groups but once you have tried to extend them,

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.270
often you'll find that one or two connections are missing and then you have to start all over again.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.720
This is a typical problem that you would like to use a computer to solve for you.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.190
How can Bob approach this problem.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.920
Well, actually, he could write an algorithm that is very similar to the one that Alice has used.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.570
We start out by setting the size of the largest group to zero because we haven't found any group yet,

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.950
and then again we can try all assignments of the value 0 and 1 to the genes.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.340
A 1 meaning that we're considering this gene to be part of this large cluster of genes

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.810
that are all connected to each other and an assignment of 0 and 1 to the  genes is valid

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.330
if all genes that have been assigned 1 are connected to each other.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.420
If that is the case, then the size of that group is again the sum of the number of genes

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.980
where we have assigned a 1 and the largest group is the maximum of the largest group

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.950
we have found so far and the size of the new group that we have just found.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.020
The main difference to Alice's algorithm are two things--

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.310
One is, it's a bit different which type of assignment we consider as valid and the other one

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.910
is that now we're not looking for a group of genes or communication centers that is

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.690
as small as possible, but now we are looking for a group of genes that is as large as possible.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.170
Since the algorithm is so similar to Alice's, I think it should be rather easy for you to figure out

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:46.290
our next quiz and of course, that quiz is going to be to determine the running time of Bob's algorithm

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.240
and of course, I would like to state that in big O-notation again.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.730
I'm going to reveal to you that the running time is going to be O of some number to the power of n

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.650
times n to the power of some other number or the same number where an n is the number of genes

00:02:00.650 --> 99:59:59.000
in case you were wondering.
