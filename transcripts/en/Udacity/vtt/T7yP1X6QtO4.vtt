Let's say this street was named 2nd Avenue, and this one could be named 4th

00:00:04.343 --> 00:00:08.590
Avenue, and this one 6th Ave. And what if this was named 2nd Street, and this

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.121
one named 4th Street? Now, I wonder, can you tell me which intersection on this

00:00:13.121 --> 00:00:17.528
map would be the intersection of 3rd Avenue and 5th Street? Keep in mind, I

00:00:17.528 --> 00:00:22.123
haven't told you these streets, but I bet you can make a good guess anyways.

00:00:22.123 --> 00:00:23.831
Choose the, the best answer.
