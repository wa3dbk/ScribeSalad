00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.406
If f was at negative 6, the distance to 0 would be 6, which is greater than 5,

00:00:04.505 --> 00:00:08.911
so this number line's out. If f were at positive 6, that distance would also be

00:00:08.923 --> 00:00:13.106
bigger than 5. It would be a distance of 6, so this number line's out. This

00:00:13.118 --> 00:00:17.437
number line was a combination of these two, so we know this can't be it either.

00:00:17.536 --> 00:00:22.128
Sure enough, it's this number line. Every number in here is within 5 units of 0.

00:00:22.232 --> 00:00:25.730
So let's compare this greater than and less than, and see what we have.
