00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.560
In this lesson we have learned
the difference between DRAM and

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.880
SRAM, how they work, and
where we want to use each of them.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.330
Next we will look at disk drives which
have even lower cost per bit but

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.340
are also much slower.
