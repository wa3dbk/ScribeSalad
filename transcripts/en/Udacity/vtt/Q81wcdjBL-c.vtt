00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.500
Every Gulp project
starts with a Gulp file.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.200
This file sits in the root
directory of your project and

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.610
defines all the task that you
should execute when running Gulp.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.460
Right here, is the most basic
Gulp file that you going to have.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.200
Since a Gulp file is
essentially a no js script,

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.320
we first require Gulp as a dependency.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.930
Then we setup a default task.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.600
Now this function right
here doesn't do anything,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.170
but of course you'd
have it do something.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.620
So now it's your turn.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.050
I want you to replace this
comment do something useful here

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.440
with your own console.log message.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.680
And when you're done, you can run it
by executing gulp at the command line.
