To kind of tie all this together,

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:06.485
Middleware is ultimately a collection of technologies for addressing

00:00:06.485 --> 00:00:10.950
non-functional constraints in these heterogeneous distributed applications.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.090
These technologies include application programmer interfaces, protocols tools,

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.130
and even design patterns. As the Internet grows, as our, our networking and

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.430
our number of users and the various applications, the need for

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.000
standard Middleware solutions is going to become all that more important
