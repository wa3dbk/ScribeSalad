00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.380
An operating system provides applications with access to

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.130
the underlying hardware.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.570
It does so by exporting a number of services.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.850
At the most basic level,

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.030
these services are directly linked to some of the components of the hardware.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.200
For instance, there is a scheduling component that's responsible for

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.750
controlling the access to the CPU, or maybe there are even multiple CPUs.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.370
The memory manager is responsible for allocating the underlying physical memory

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.460
to one or more co-running applications.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.850
And it also has to make sure that multiple applications don't overwrite each

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.780
other's accesses to memory.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.730
A block device driver is responsible for access to a block device like disk.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.310
In addition, the operating system also exports higher-level services that

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.220
are linked with higher-level abstractions, as opposed to

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.300
those that are linked with abstractions that really map to the hardware.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.220
For instance, the file is a useful abstraction that's supported by

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.610
virtually all operating systems.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.360
And in principle, operating systems integrate file system as a service.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.090
In summary, the operating system will have to incorporate a number of

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.590
services in order to provide applications and

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.430
application developers with a number of useful types of functionality.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.650
This includes process management,

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.500
file management, device management, and so forth.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.870
Operating systems make all of these services available via system calls.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.031
For example, here are some system calls in two popular operating systems,

00:01:32.031 --> 00:01:33.730
Windows and Unix.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.820
I will not read through this list, but notice although these are two

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.846
very different operating systems, the types of system calls and the abstractions

00:01:42.846 --> 00:01:47.510
around those systems calls these two OSes provide are very similar.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.447
But process control, creating a process, exiting a process,

00:01:52.447 --> 00:01:55.930
waiting for object, creating files, etc.
