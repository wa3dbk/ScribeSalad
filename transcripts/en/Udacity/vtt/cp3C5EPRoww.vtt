00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here's a little bit of code for computing the clustering coefficient--

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
at least one particular way of computing it.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here's our list of flights on our map.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Catching between Chicago and Seattle, etc.,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and I just have that as a list of pairs.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And to create the graph, I start off with an empty graph,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and then for each of the pairs that constitute the end points of a flight,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
we make a link between them like we were doing last time.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Then to compute the clustering coefficient for the graph at some node,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
we list out the neighbors.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
If there's only one neighbor, it turns out to be very hard

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
to compute the clustering coefficient.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So we have to give it some kind of value; I chose zero.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It actually kind of matters, but zero seems like a reasonable choice.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Then what we're going to do is we're going to count up

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
the number of links between these neighboring nodes.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So we start off at zero, we loop through all the neighbors,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and for each of those we loop through all the neighbors again

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and then we ask if this pair--

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
WU--is there a link between them?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And if so--in this case I'm counting it as a half

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
because I wrote this inefficiently.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It's going to do everything twice.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So it's going to notice that Seattle and Los Angeles are connected

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and that Los Angeles and Seattle are connected.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So I give it a half each time so that the total number works out.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And then I apply the formula.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Two times the number of links divided by length of neighbors

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
times length of neighbors minus one.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So now that we can compute the clustering coefficient for any node V

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
we can actually loop through all the nodes in the graph

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
computing the total of their clustering coefficients

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and then divide by the number of nodes to get the clustering coefficient

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
for the whole graph.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So in this case, it's a little bit of a quarter,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
which is pretty clumpy.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So there's a fair amount of interconnection

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
between a node's neighbors.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
&gt;From what I've read, social networks will often have clustering coefficients

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
that are in the 0.1, maybe even up to the 0.8 range

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
whereas the grid graphs, chain graphs, and ring graphs that we've looked at

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
actually have clustering coefficients of zero.
