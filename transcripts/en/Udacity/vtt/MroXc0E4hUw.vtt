00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.293
In general, a fractional exponent represents a power devided by a root. X is

00:00:05.293 --> 00:00:09.145
the radicand of what's underneath the radical symbol. A is going to be the

00:00:09.145 --> 00:00:12.954
power of the radicand. So if the numerator are here, we'll see that as a power

00:00:12.954 --> 00:00:17.776
inside of our radical sign. And then b, is the index of the radical or it tells

00:00:17.776 --> 00:00:24.700
us which type of root we're taking. A square, a cube or maybe something else.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.288
So if we see something like x to the 3 5ths, we really know that's the 5th root

00:00:29.288 --> 00:00:36.484
of x cubed. Here's our power and here's our index. Power divided by root.
