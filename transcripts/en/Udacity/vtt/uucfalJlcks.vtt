00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.010
An important question about this
model is, what are the goals?

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.710
That is with respect to these complexity
measures, what makes an algorithm good?

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.150
What you want is actually pretty simple.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.840
The first goal is work optimality.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.940
That is, your two level algorithm should
do the same asymptotic work as the best

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.600
ran algorithm.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.860
Here W-star is intended to mark
the work of the best RAM algorithm.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.220
That is, the one that doesn't
have a memory hierarchy.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.190
The statement is no different from what
you would say about parallel algorithms.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.003
Namely, don't blow up
the asymptotic work.

00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:35.362
Ka-boom!

00:00:35.362 --> 00:00:36.662
There's a second goal.

00:00:36.662 --> 00:00:40.723
You want an algorithm that achieves
high computational intensity.

00:00:40.723 --> 00:00:42.662
Here's a more formal statement.

00:00:42.662 --> 00:00:47.633
Computational intensity or just
intensity is just the ratio of work to

00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:50.845
words transferred,
denoted by a capital I.

00:00:50.845 --> 00:00:52.658
Intensity has units of
operations per word.

00:00:52.658 --> 00:00:56.049
Operations per word, put another way,

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:01.945
computational intensity measures
the data reuse of your algorithm.

00:01:01.945 --> 00:01:05.385
If this ratio is large, it means
you're doing more operations for

00:01:05.385 --> 00:01:07.726
every word that you
transfer to fast memory.

00:01:07.726 --> 00:01:12.294
That's a good thing, but, you don't want
an algorithm that maximizes this ratio

00:01:12.294 --> 00:01:14.920
at the expense of sub optimal work.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.780
In other words goals 1 and
2 go hand in hand, and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.190
I hope this fact reminds you of work and
span.
