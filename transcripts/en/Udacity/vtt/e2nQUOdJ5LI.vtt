00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now let's look at the solution to the first problem.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We know that we already used the forward Euler method

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
for both the populations of fish one and fish two.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We need to know how each population changes with time.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I've written out expressions for ḟ₁ and ḟ₂ showing the time derivatives of each population.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now on each equation, we can see that this first term is in the form of the logistic growth function

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that I showed you in the question introduction video.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We have a growth rate and then 1 minus the population over the carrying capacity

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
times the population again and the same thing up here.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
These first terms show the positive rate of change of the population.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
However, each equation also has a second part tacked onto it that shows a negative rate of change.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This expresses how each population is harvested by the fisherman.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
As I said earlier, p is the fraction of the fish that we catch that are fish type two or the green fish.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We know then that the rate of harvesting

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
of the green type of fish is going to be p times our total harvest rate.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We can maintain the same total harvest rate if we make the coefficient in front of the harvest rate

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
a new equation for the red fish 1-p.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Remember we're trying to prevent the green fish from going extinct.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This means that we need to create a situation in which the rate of change

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
of population two is greater than or equal to zero.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
If we rearrange the equation for ḟ2, which should adapt with this term,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
which is showing how the population can gain fish,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
should be greater than or equal to this term, which is showing how the population can lose fish.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The value of p that we're trying to calculate, however, is the exact threshold of extinction.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This is going to happen where growth exactly equals harvesting.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
In other words if there are anymore harvesting or any less growth,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
population two will become extinct eventually.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
This graph over here like you've seen before has a blue pair of fish that shows

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
how the growth rate changes in population, and it also has a red curve that represents harvesting rate.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
This first red line is just an example of a harvest rate, but the one that we're interested in

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
is this dotted red line up here, which just touches the maximum of the growth curve.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
You might remember that this point on the growth curve

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
is also known as the maximum sustainable yield.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
You can see that if we move the red line any higher, then the harvesting rate would always

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
succeed the growth rate and we would definitely end up with an extinct fish two population.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Similarly, if we move anywhere else on the blue line, the growth rate would again

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
be below this harvest rate and we will begin to deplete the population of fish two.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Right in the center, however, we have a point of semi-stable equilibrium

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
just like we're going to talk about in the Unit.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Any tiny bit that the population moves to the left side of the curve

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
will result in it eventually falling all the way down to zero,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
which clearly means that fish two has become extinct.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Instead, we have slightly larger population than 5x10⁵ tons,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
we will again start to see a decrease in population, and if by chance the population

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
has not stopped at exactly this maximum point--it will fall to the other side

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
of the curve and also become extinct.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Remember all this is assuming that the harvest rate is exactly at this dotted line.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Now we need to find what value of p would place the dotted line right at this position.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Again at this point we have growth rate exactly equal to harvesting rate.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I've taken the two parts of the equation for ḟ2 and written them as equal to each other right here.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
We plug in the proper value for f2, which we know is 5x10⁵ ton

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and we can solve using simple algebra for the threshold value of p, which equals to 0.375.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Finally looking at our code, we can see that first we've plugged in the value for p that we just calculated,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
0.375, and down here in the for loop, we have a very simple translation of the equations

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
that we created for the growth rates of both fish one and fish two

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
in this box for the rate of change of either population.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So for fish one we have this and for fish two we have this.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
As always, these rates of change are multiplied by h, the step size,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and added to the initial values for either fish population.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Now it's our new program and see what we get.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Here is our plots, the blue line plots the population fish that we are interested in harvesting

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
measured in tons and the green line plots the population of the second type of fish,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
which we're trying to prevent from going extinct.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
You could see that we have maintained a high level of population of the fish that we're interested in

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and we've also prevented the green line from going down to zero.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
You can see that as time increases, the slope of this line is approaching zero,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
which means that if we plotted time going even farther out, no matter how far out

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
in time we decided to to plot these curves, this green line would never approach zero.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Just for fun, let's see what happens if we set p=0.5.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Well this graph looks very different from the last one that we had.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
By just increasing p by the third of its former value,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
we've made fish population two go extinct in just over 20 years.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Since we're harvesting more of fish two and less of fish one,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
the fish one population has actually risen to a value that is higher than it was in the last part,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
but we've violated our first main objective, which was to prevent fish two from going extinct.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
I hope this problem has helped you submit your understanding of logistic growth,

00:04:56.000 --> 09:59:59.000
harvesting, and equilibria.
