00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
Welcome to our course on dealing with challenging problems.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.100
First off, I should probably start by telling you what a challenging problem actually is.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.330
Normally, the situation is as follows: When you want to solve a problem with a computer,

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.440
you write some program on your computer to tell it what you want to do with a certain input.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.620
Then you take your input, you feed it into the computer,

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.340
and the computer will work on your problem.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.140
So it'll probably tell you to wait if you've written your program like this,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.530
might make some noises, and after a certain time the computer will be done,

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.550
and it will produce your output.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.570
Now, you would think that computers today are powerful enough

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.870
to basically do this for any problem for which you can write a program.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.050
But you might already know that sometimes this is not the case.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.530
So sometimes problems are so challenging to solve, even for a computer,

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.750
even for a very, very fast computer, that you will not get the output.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.310
Instead, all that will happen is that the computer will tell you to wait.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.960
It might make noises again, and it will keep on telling you to wait.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.860
Might make more noise because it's working so hard.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.470
But no matter how long you wait, the computer is not able to produce an output

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.000
because the problem that you're giving it is just too hard, even for a computer.
