00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.850
Now we want to see how to insert an element, here is my partially filled array.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.978
And I want to insert an element before this position. So I need to move all of

00:00:09.978 --> 00:00:14.342
these elements out of the way, so that the green element can go into the slot.

00:00:14.342 --> 00:00:19.093
Now, you have to be a bit careful with the move out of the way part. If I were

00:00:19.093 --> 00:00:23.876
to move this element over here, and then this element over here and so on. That

00:00:23.876 --> 00:00:27.652
will be bad because then this element would override the next one before I had

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:32.478
a chance to move that one out of the way. So, in other words, this element

00:00:32.478 --> 00:00:36.658
would flood the entire tail of the array. The remedy is to do the movement

00:00:36.658 --> 00:00:41.094
starting at the end of the array. So, I first move this one, then it's

00:00:41.094 --> 00:00:46.134
predecessor, then it's predecessor. And I keep going until I've moved the one

00:00:46.134 --> 00:00:51.435
into who's slot that I want to put the new one. The other thing to remember is

00:00:51.435 --> 00:00:55.404
that insertion increases the size, so I have to make sure to add one to size of

00:00:55.404 --> 00:01:01.004
my partially filled array. Le'ts look at this in Java code. I increase the

00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:06.130
size. Here is the loop to make room for the new element. So when I increase my

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.791
size then I am starting at size minus 1, which is same as the old size. I now

00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:15.450
go backwards. And each of the moves goes the other direction than the one that

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.186
you've seen with removal. It goes from a lower index to a higher index. And the

00:01:21.186 --> 00:01:25.446
last movement is the one that moves pos to pos plus 1, so we want this one to

00:01:25.446 --> 00:01:32.380
be pos, which means we want I to be plus, plus one and that's where we stop.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.720
Finally, when we're all done, we can insert the new value after position pos.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.880
As you have seen inserting and removing array elements requires quite a bit of

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.703
movement. You need to move elements out of the way, in the case of insertion,

00:01:46.703 --> 00:01:51.945
or move them to close up the gap in the situation of removal. It was also easy

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:55.884
with the array list, where you just called add and removed. But the reason

00:01:55.884 --> 00:01:59.212
that, as explained to you, what actually goes on with arrays, is an array list

00:01:59.212 --> 00:02:02.540
has a partially filled array inside it, and it's sometimes important to know

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.849
which operations are cheap, and which ones are expensive. And sorting and

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:10.310
removing can be expensive for a long array.
