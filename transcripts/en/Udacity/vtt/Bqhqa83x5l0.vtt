00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.243
Many, many lessons ago we helped Grant choose between three different brands of

00:00:04.243 --> 00:00:09.586
glasses cleaning solution to sell along with his wiper sets. One brand that

00:00:09.586 --> 00:00:15.940
seemed like a pretty good option gave us this equation, y equals 10x plus 150.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.580
In this equation, x stands for the number of gallons of cleaning solution that

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.984
Grant orders, y is equal to the total cost of the order. The solution cost $10

00:00:24.984 --> 00:00:29.858
per gallon. And there is a flat delivery fee of $150 added on, regardless of

00:00:29.858 --> 00:00:35.094
how much solution was ordered. Before, Grant decided how much solution to

00:00:35.094 --> 00:00:39.165
order, so what x should be based pretty much just on how much he wanted or

00:00:39.165 --> 00:00:44.890
needed. When we plug that number in for x, the function would output how much

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.730
it would cost him. However, Greg's being a bit more strict with his budget

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.641
these days. And instead of doing things the old way, he wants to set aside a

00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:57.427
certain amount of money to spend on cleaning solution. That means that now, we

00:00:57.427 --> 00:01:01.106
probably need to switch up our equation a bit. He's going to want to calculate

00:01:01.106 --> 00:01:06.088
the amount of solution ordered based on the amount of money spent. Since now,

00:01:06.088 --> 00:01:10.986
amount ordered depends on money spent, let's switch up our variable names. If

00:01:10.986 --> 00:01:14.640
we want x to equal the total cost of the order and y to equal the amount of

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.578
cleaning solution ordered, what will our equation look like now? Remember that

00:01:20.578 --> 00:01:23.926
all of our quantities are still related to each other in the same way, we're

00:01:23.926 --> 00:01:26.279
just changing their names.
