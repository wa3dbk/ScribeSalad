00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.980
Here we're talking about
project based learning.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:02.830
And if you're in this class,

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.460
you're already familiar with
project-based learning,

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.020
because this entire class
is project-based learning.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.025
We built it on that foundation.

00:00:09.025 --> 00:00:12.620
Project-based learning is a pedagogical
technique where students learn through

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.998
big long-term projects.

00:00:13.998 --> 00:00:15.690
Sometimes somewhat open-ended,

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.024
as opposed to through small written
assignments or quizzes or tests.

00:00:19.024 --> 00:00:21.638
There are a lot of real benefits
to project-based learning and

00:00:21.638 --> 00:00:24.260
one of my favorites is
the idea of authenticity.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.720
Typically, when we go into the actual
fields that we're teaching about,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.580
what were our work is,
is actually pretty project-based.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.675
We do big long-term projects,
rather than small tasks each day.

00:00:33.675 --> 00:00:35.960
And so by teaching students
using project-based learning,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.680
we're not only teaching them
the content we want them to know.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.280
But we're also teaching them what
it's like to actually be a part of

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.470
that field.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.760
And similarly, personalization is
a really big benefit of this as well.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.190
Typically, when students do a project,

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.210
they actually feel some personal
connection to what they've produced.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.560
And some of the projects we've done are
other OMS classes we've seen students

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.780
really develop the projects and
pursue them after the semester is over.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.070
Some of them have gone so
far as to name their projects or

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.430
give them personalities.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.550
There's really a personal
connection between the student and

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.459
the project that they develop.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.350
The longer term and more open-ended
nature of the project also

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.360
means that we can do some things
to facilitate real learning.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.860
And the more important
learning strategies that we

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.250
want students to develop.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.700
Things like planning what they're going
to do, monitoring how it's going and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.835
adjusting it accordingly if
it's not going very well.

00:01:18.835 --> 00:01:20.910
Oftentimes in traditional education,

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.950
by the time a student recognizes that
what they're doing isn't working.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.930
It might be too late to fix it,
if it's a test or a quiz or something.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.170
But with projects, the longer term
nature of them gives students time to

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.550
recognize what I've been working
on isn't really working.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.710
How can I evaluate it?

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.180
How can I recover?

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.590
So there are a lot of benefits
of project-based learning.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.455
The difficulty is that they
aren't always easy to implement

00:01:40.455 --> 00:01:42.105
in a regular classroom.

00:01:42.105 --> 00:01:44.185
Projects are bigger and
they're open-ended and

00:01:44.185 --> 00:01:45.295
they're very personal to students.

00:01:45.295 --> 00:01:47.565
And that makes it very difficult
to give students feedback on them,

00:01:47.565 --> 00:01:49.355
it makes it difficult to grade projects.

00:01:49.355 --> 00:01:50.995
How do you grade two
students that did very,

00:01:50.995 --> 00:01:53.945
very different projects if it's
a very open-ended project?

00:01:53.945 --> 00:01:57.675
Presents a lot of difficulty, but that's
where technology can really play a role.

00:01:57.675 --> 00:02:00.445
Technology gives us
an environment in which we can

00:02:00.445 --> 00:02:03.390
allow students to produce
some open-ended projects.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.640
And have built in functionalities
to develop their ideas and

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.460
construct whatever
they want to construct.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.080
And through some
artificial intelligence,

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.870
we can actually start to build in
some of that feedback directly into

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:14.620
the environment.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.920
We can give them feedback right in the
context of what they're doing without

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.940
requiring a teacher to be consistently
monitoring what they're doing.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.690
So technology can really bring
project-based learning to life.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.560
And so we'll talk about the different
ways in which project-based learning can

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.250
be done and how technology can help.
