00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.469
We now know how to get from RGB to YUV,
so

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:06.370
you can actually do some cool
things with that, all right?

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.200
Let's plot the pixels that we're
looking at before instead of

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.180
RGB space into YUV space, okay?

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.630
Well here, you see a YUV distribution,
all right?

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.470
And looking at it just like this,
it's, it's not clear yet

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.250
that we've bought a lot of improvement.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.880
But supposed we ignored the y value,
right?

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.156
We just projected everything
down onto the UV plane.

00:00:29.156 --> 00:00:31.680
What would this distribution look like?

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.200
Well, it would look like this, okay?

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.730
And suddenly, it's a lot easier to see

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.040
how you would separate out the different
pixels of different colors.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.870
In fact, we can try filtering
on just this UV dimension
