00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:03.330
The first way let's us take a page that

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.650
was designed to be precisely one size. This is an

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.450
application I built that's using a fixed layout, and

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.410
it's a bit smaller than default. It's 916 pixels wide.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.430
Notice that it's not using all the space on

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.350
the screen because the browser by default is assuming the

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.170
layout wants to be 980 pixels wide. So let's

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.610
a viewport that tells the browser it was designed for

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.800
916 pixels across. What would you put in the viewport

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.880
to tell the browser that this should be 916 pixels?
