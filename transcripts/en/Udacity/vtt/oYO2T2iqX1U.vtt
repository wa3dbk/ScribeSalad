00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And the answers goes like this--the reason being that here we have a clear line.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In fact, r will probably be one and it's positive. Both variables grow at the same time.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
With this U shape, there might be a dependence but it's not linear.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We fit the best line, it's going to be flat, and in this flat line

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
there is really no dependence between the x and the y variable.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So definitely knowing x does not tell you about y and vice versa that tends to be r=0

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and in this last case, there is a negative line.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The best line fit will go something like this and r might be as small as -0.2, but it is negative,

00:00:35.000 --> 99:59:59.000
the reason being that the line down here goes down negatively.
