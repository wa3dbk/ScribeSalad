00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.176
Here's one way to code the answer. We still compute the diffuse component, but

00:00:03.176 --> 00:00:07.370
no longer take a maximum value, since we're going to compare it to uBorder. The

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.300
comparison here then changes the diffuse value so it gives a cartoony effect.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.462
Here's a more compact solution, using a conditional operator instead of a

00:00:14.462 --> 00:00:18.808
full-blown if, then, else statement. This critical angle rule is entirely

00:00:18.808 --> 00:00:22.955
arbitrary of course. You could even try more elaborate rules. For example, this

00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:26.586
code gives three levels of illumination. It gives an image with a different

00:00:26.586 --> 00:00:30.215
feel, a bit more depth and a little less cartoony. This type of effect was

00:00:30.215 --> 00:00:34.243
almost impossible with the old fixed function pipeline. With shaders it's easy

00:00:34.243 --> 00:00:36.699
to experiment with different illumination models.
