00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.469
You're going to write the code to make the create

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:06.210
conference method, Creat and Save Conference Entities. But first I

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.730
want to point out how Creating Conference Entities is different

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.010
in a way than creating profile entities. For profile entities

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.540
we specifically use the unique user ID as the ID

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.240
for the identity key. For conferences though, we really don't

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.300
care what the key is. So we're going to let

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.960
App Engine allocate it for us. So here's the code

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.890
to let apengent allocate the key. You used

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.180
the factory.allocateId method, and in the simplest case

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.127
you just provide the entity class. So that

00:00:36.127 --> 00:00:39.240
would be raspy conference profile whatever. So for

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.420
example, to allocate an ID to a conference

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.140
entity, you specify the key type and conference.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.590
And you specify conference.class. But this isn't quite

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.030
right actually, though. One more thing we need

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.840
to do, is to take account of the fact that

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.980
the conference has a parent. Which is a profile entity of

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.830
the user who created it. So when you want to allocate

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.400
an ID to an entity that has a parent when you

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.379
call the allocate ID method. You need to specify the

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.010
parentKey as the first argument. So here's the code you need

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.130
to write to allocate an ID to a conference entity. You

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.190
need to specify the profile key for the ancestor and specify

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.530
the conference class. Another thing to mention is

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.200
that you've already learned how to save an entity

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.370
by calling ofy.save. But in this case, when you

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.770
save your conferences, you also need to save the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.165
profile entity. You can just use the entities function,

00:01:31.165 --> 00:01:35.310
IES, the pluralized version, and specify the list of

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.810
comma separated entities to save. You should have already

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.000
copied the skeleton version of the create conference method

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.820
into the conference API class. But if you haven't, go ahead

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.440
and do it now. You see that it's full of to dos.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.970
You're going to go ahead and implement each of these to dos. First

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.850
of all, you need to get the user ID of the logged

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.410
in user. Then you're going to get the key of the user's profile.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.920
Then you're going to allocate a key for the conference. And don't forget

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.360
the conference has a parent so you need to take that into

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.087
consideration when allocating the ID for the key. You're going to get

00:02:07.087 --> 00:02:10.056
the ID for the conference entity. Then you actually

00:02:10.056 --> 00:02:12.829
need to see if the profile entity corresponding to the

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:16.404
profile, that's the parent of the conference actually exists. If

00:02:16.404 --> 00:02:18.378
it does get it out of the datastore, if it

00:02:18.378 --> 00:02:20.644
doesn't go ahead and create a new one using the

00:02:20.644 --> 00:02:24.670
default values for the profile properties. And then finally, you

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.720
actually create the conference. Then you need to save both

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.040
the conference and the profile entities, and return the profile.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.450
The reason you need to save both the conference and

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.750
the profile entities. Is even though if you've got the

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.010
existing profile out of the data store, you haven't made

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.400
any changes to it. If the profile didn't already exist, you

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.950
will have created a new one, so you will need

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.360
to save it. So, go ahead and fill in the ToDos

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.290
in createConference. You already copied over the skeleton version of

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.130
it, and now you can write the code in the ToDos.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.300
When you've implemented createConference. You can run your app

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.000
on local host. And then go ahead and create a

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.230
conference or two. And you can use API's explorer

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.885
or you can use the create conference page in the

00:03:10.885 --> 00:03:14.940
WebUI. Then check you conference entities in the data

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.650
store viewer in the admin console. To make sure that

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.410
they go created as you expected. Now at this

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.068
point you actually can use the create a conference page.

00:03:24.068 --> 00:03:27.150
In the WebUI for the app because when you submit

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.310
this form, it sends a call to the create conference function.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.950
And you've actually implemented that now. So using this form should

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.790
let you create conferences. And it's kind of a nice, easy

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.930
thing to do. What you need to do is specify the

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.770
name, and all the other values will default. However, at this

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.440
point you can't use the show conferences to check that the

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.500
conference got created. Because you haven't yet implemented the function that

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.120
provides the behavior of the show Conference page. So, no

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.850
matter whether you create a conference in the APIs Explorer,

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.550
or the create conference page in the WebUI. You'll need

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.830
to use the data store view in the Admin Console,

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.780
to check that the conference got created. After you've created

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.075
some conferences. Go ahead and look at them in the

00:04:06.075 --> 00:04:08.760
Datastore view of the Admin Console, and see if you

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.180
can figure out which properties are indexed. Check all that apply.
