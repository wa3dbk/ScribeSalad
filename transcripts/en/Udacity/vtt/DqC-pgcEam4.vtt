00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.942
Okay. Let's look at the data and compare the two distributions. The population

00:00:03.942 --> 00:00:08.856
mean, in other words the average number of blue M&amp;M's across all of our bags,

00:00:08.856 --> 00:00:13.445
was 11.25. The expected value, in other words the mean of all the means we took

00:00:13.445 --> 00:00:20.430
from our 50 random samples. Is 11.08. Notice those are pretty close. They're not

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.660
exactly the same, but they are not far off. The population standard deviation

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:32.993
for all 48 plates or bags was 3.49. &gt;&gt; Hi, it's me again. Let's recap Professor

00:00:32.993 --> 00:00:36.926
Rogers and Professor Laraways experiment, and then predict what happened before

00:00:36.926 --> 00:00:41.620
they tell us their result. So they took a bag of M&amp;Ms and they calculated the

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.664
number of blue M&amp;Ms in that bag. So this is the first bag and they put it on a

00:00:46.664 --> 00:00:52.124
plate labelled plate number 1 and n1 represents the number of blue M&amp;Ms in that

00:00:52.124 --> 00:00:57.332
bag or now on that plate and they did that with the second bag and counted the

00:00:57.332 --> 00:01:02.582
number of blue M&amp;Ms. And they did that up to number 48, and they have 48 bags,

00:01:02.582 --> 00:01:08.003
and they dumped each bag onto one plate. So here's our population, the number of

00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:13.845
blue M&amp;Ms on each plate. They found that the mean is 11.25 blue M&amp;M's, and the

00:01:13.845 --> 00:01:19.714
standard deviation is 3.49. From this population, professors Laraway, and

00:01:19.714 --> 00:01:24.972
Rodgers, randomly selected five plates. And then they counted the number of blue

00:01:24.972 --> 00:01:30.540
M&amp;M's divided by 5, and got the average number of blue M&amp;M's. And then they did

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.765
this 50 times. Can you believe it? So then they got 50 sample means. So now

00:01:36.765 --> 00:01:41.273
let's take a quick quiz. According to the Central Limit Theorem, approximately

00:01:41.273 --> 00:01:45.695
what should be the mean and standard deviations of this distribution of sample

00:01:45.695 --> 00:01:51.968
means? So write your answer here. When you calculate these, remember you're

00:01:51.968 --> 00:01:57.350
calculating the theoretical probability, which is based on using every possible

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.130
sample of size 5 from this population. But here they're using only 50 samples of

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.805
size 5. There are a lot more, but we can't expect professors Rogers and Laraway

00:02:07.805 --> 00:02:13.171
to do that. That would really take forever. So calculate the theoretical mean

00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:17.203
and standard error based on the central limit theorem.
