00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.300
So let's assume we want to make a movies website.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.180
Much like this one. Now, if you were to make

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.450
this based on what we have been doing this far.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.880
What we would do is start with an empty programming file,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.930
and we would like it something like movies.py. Now, since

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.400
a movie has a lot of data associated with it,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.250
like the movies title, its storyline, we would add that

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.720
to our program. Also, we would want to do things with

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.500
our movies, like show the movies trailer or

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.240
show or print all of the movies information. So

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.230
we would add those function to our code as

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.960
well. So far, so good. So, further imagine that

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.260
we want to run this program. And we want

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.860
to play a movie's trailer. Well, which movie's trailer?

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.860
To make that work, we would have to provide

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.480
the show_trailer function some information or arguments, like this.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.220
In this case we are saying hey,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.870
play Toy Story's, youtube_url. That seems manageable

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.090
enough. Now let's try to print out

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.370
a movies information. Well, which movies information?

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.335
Again we would have to supply some sort of information or arguments, to the

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:12.003
show_info function. Arguments like the movie's title,

00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:16.035
its storyline, the release_date, rating, youtube_url, director,

00:01:16.035 --> 00:01:19.950
box_office, et cetera. Now, I don't know about you,

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.730
but this function show_info is already getting too convoluted

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.140
for me. Imagine what happens if we have to

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.890
supply more information to it. Like the movie's cast

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.260
or the movie's reviews. What we really want to do

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.850
is define a template for our movie and record

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.420
all of the data that needs to go into

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.828
that template. Data like the move's title, it's storyline and

00:01:41.828 --> 00:01:46.170
functions like show_trailer and show information and then simply say,

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.820
hey, Toy Story is a movie and so is Avatar.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.882
And then have the ability to say, show me Toy

00:01:53.882 --> 00:01:59.780
Stories trailer or show me Avatar's information. No arguments necessary.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.390
Now, one way of doing this, just by using functions, is to take the template

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.940
we have defined and make multiple copies of it. So, we could make a copy

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.728
of this template and call it toy_story.py, and make another copy of this

00:02:15.728 --> 00:02:21.240
template, and call it avatar.py. Now we will be able to say things like

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.760
toy_story.show_trailer and avatar.show_info. Now,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.810
this doesn't seem like a very smart solution to me.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.340
Imagine what happens, if we have to add more pieces of

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.220
data to our template. Or if you have to rename one

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.150
of our functions. Say, from, show_trailer to play_trailer. If that happens,

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.500
we will have to make those changes in each and

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.490
every copy that we make. This doesn't seem like a very

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.750
smart thing to do. So what we really need is a

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.690
way of making copies of a template, without having multiple files.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.170
We need the ability to define a template for

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.660
something, like we did for movies, and then be

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.480
able to say, hey, Toy Story is a type

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.660
of that template, and so is Avatar. Avatar is also

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.940
a type of that template. We need something new,

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.670
and that new thing in programming is called a

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.370
class. So what are classes and how do you

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.850
use them? Let's find out in the next few lessons.
