00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.640
Here's a sketch of SAAM. Assuming that we have already gone through

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.560
an architectural design process and if we produce some artifacts like diagrams.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.420
So we generate that architecture. We also generate some scenarios.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.050
Now these are not primarily usage scenarios, or we could think of them as,

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.630
as elaborated usage scenarios. Where instead of looking at it from the outside,

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.770
external view, we're looking for it internally. So for example if,

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.740
if the external request is by the user to compute some result,

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.960
the generated scenario here that we,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.260
the team provides is which elements of the architecture are required. To,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.600
be involved in providing that functionality. And in what order. That is,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.780
we essentially are going to, walk through the diagram and

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.370
see how that particular usage of the system impacts the architecture.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.790
This is particularly important if what we're talking about is a new scenario.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.850
That is imagine the system that was architected one way and

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.410
we want to add a new a new, a new functionality to it.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.470
Imagine also that maybe there are thoughts on different ways of doing this. So

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.060
if we had alternative proposals. Each are provided

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.826
in the form of some kind of diagram, we could walk through the two diagrams and

00:01:28.826 --> 00:01:32.580
see which one, in which one, there's more impact of the change.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.700
We might want to go with the solution which has the, the lesser impact. And

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.850
so imagine this all happening in some kind of design review meeting,

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.070
in which we systematically go through that proposed changes.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.560
The proposed architectural responses to them. And use the gathered

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.470
information to come, to come to some kind of conclusion about the way forward.
