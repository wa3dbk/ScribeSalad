00:00:00.074 --> 00:00:06.088
All right, welcome to Unit 4. Today we're going to talk about fundamental GPU algorithms, part 2.

00:00:06.095 --> 00:00:11.129
We're going to start with scan, which we talked about last week, and look at specific applications of scan.

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.578
And then we're going to turn to looking at how to sort on a GPU.

00:00:14.578 --> 00:00:17.500
So in the last unit we learned about fundamental GPU algorithms.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.584
And the last one, and the most important one for this lecture, was scan.

00:00:21.584 --> 00:00:24.438
Scan is an efficient way to paralyze a certain class of

00:00:24.438 --> 00:00:27.220
parallel problems that otherwise seem difficult to paralyze.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.029
We usually refer to these as recurrence relationships.

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.830
One of the use cases for scan is for problems that keep

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.567
some sort of running total, such as a running sum.

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:40.569
We can also use other binary associative operators like Max, Min and Most Logical operations.

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:45.329
So, as a quiz, let's recall 2 of the important properties of scan.

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.514
So we're looking at a scan of n elements.

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:51.889
And so, in the best GPU scan implementations,

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:56.322
what is the amount of work to do the scan, and what is the number of steps to do the scan?

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:59.902
Your choices are proportional to log n, proportional to n,

00:00:59.902 --> 00:01:04.168
proportional to n log n, and proportional to n squared.

00:01:04.168 --> 00:01:09.437
So we'd like you to check the box that corresponds to what the work complexity of the algorithm is

00:01:09.437 --> 00:01:11.661
and what the step complexity of the algorithm is.
