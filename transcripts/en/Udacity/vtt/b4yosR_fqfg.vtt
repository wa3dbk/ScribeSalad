00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.447
So, we know if we square 3 we'll get 9, and if we square 4, we'll get 16, and

00:00:04.447 --> 00:00:10.896
if we square 5, we'll get 25. But what's even more amazing if we add these two

00:00:10.896 --> 00:00:15.784
together we get 25. It turns out that the area of the squares of the legs of

00:00:15.784 --> 00:00:20.944
the triangle sum to the the area of the square of the hypotenuse. Pretty

00:00:20.944 --> 00:00:25.840
amazing. It turns out that this relationship is true for any right triangle.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.670
So, let's take our triangle and give it unknown lengths. This side will be a,

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.220
this side will be b and this hypotenuse will be c. What equation could you

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.661
write to relate the variables a, b, and c? When you think you have that

00:00:40.661 --> 00:00:42.530
equation, type it in here.
