00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.798
Here the length is 12 feet and the width is 9 feet. Great work if you found

00:00:04.798 --> 00:00:09.498
those. As always, we want to start by writing the two equations for perimeter

00:00:09.498 --> 00:00:13.596
and area. We know we're going to surround or enclose our sunroom with 42 feet

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:19.408
of screening. This means that 42 must be the perimeter. The area of the room is

00:00:19.408 --> 00:00:25.190
108 square feet. So, with area, we'll put 108. We'll rearrange this perimeter

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:31.199
equation to get 21 minus w equals l. We get that by dividing each of the terms

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.300
by two first, and then subtracting w from both sides. Now we're ready to

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:44.336
substitute. We replace l with it's equivalent expression, 21 minus w here. Then

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:50.875
we distribute w to each of the terms to get 108 equals 21 w minus w squared.

00:00:50.875 --> 00:00:54.718
Next we want to set this equation equal to 0, so we'll move these two terms to

00:00:54.718 --> 00:01:00.650
the left side. So, our w squared term will end up being positive. So, adding w

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.126
squared to both sides, and subtracting 21 w from both sides we'll get this

00:01:04.126 --> 00:01:10.419
equation. Next we want to factor this quadratic by finding factors of 108 that

00:01:10.419 --> 00:01:17.212
sum to negative 21. Those factors are negative 12 and negative 9. Then we set

00:01:17.212 --> 00:01:23.571
this factor equal to 0, and this factor equal to 0. So, w can equal 12, or w

00:01:23.571 --> 00:01:28.578
can equal 9. We know the width should be the shorter side, so we'll have this

00:01:28.578 --> 00:01:33.708
width as 9 feet and this length as 12 feet. And as a quick check we can add up

00:01:33.708 --> 00:01:39.204
all the sides to make sure that the sum is 42 feet, that's our perimeter. And

00:01:39.204 --> 00:01:43.628
finally we check the area by multiplying the width times the length. Or 9 times

00:01:43.628 --> 00:01:48.640
12 which equals 108 feet squared, our original area.
