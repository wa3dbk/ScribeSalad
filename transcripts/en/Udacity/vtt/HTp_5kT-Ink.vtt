00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In debugging, simplicity eases our lives from the very beginning.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
As an example, consider bug reports.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If you ever maintain a big piece of software with dozens and dozens

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and maybe even thousands and thousands of users,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
you may have gotten feedback from users--that is, bug reports.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
In the early 2000s, I coauthored a debugger named GNU DDD.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It was pretty successful, so it had many users and I also got lots and lots of bug reports from the field.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
These bug reports--even in these early times--of course came electronic mail.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
But I'm drawing actual snail mail, because it's cuter.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Some of these bug reports would just contain the required information,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
such as the steps needed to reproduce the problem

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
as well as the observed behavior,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
but then there would also be people who would send in their entire programs

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that they were currently debugging.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Some would send in their entire home directory or even the contents of their entire hard disk

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
just in case this would be needed to reproduce the problem.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And others would send in just the one liner, "Your program crashed,"

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
which was less information than I would need.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
What you'd like to have in a bug report is information that is relevant.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Here relevant means if it's different then it changes the behavior.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Of course, when users are submitting bug reports

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
they don't necessarily know whether their information changes the behavior,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
so to stay on the safe side they supply more information than would actually be required,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
but in order to have a simple bug report or a simple test case,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
we want information in there to be relevant.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
This calls for a quiz.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
When we simplify a test case, just as we did before for the HTML input,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
then everything is what?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Simple, correct, relevant, or elegant? Over to you.
