00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.210
As I mentioned,

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.420
you will need to define the design
challenge before the design sprint.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.470
To help you decide on
the design challenge,

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.250
here's some things that you can do.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.260
First, you should
interview key stakeholders.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.710
Stakeholders can be investors,
designers, or engineers.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.030
They can also be someone like the user,
or anyone else related to the product.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.730
Second, you should identify or review
any of the use cases for the product.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.190
Next, you should review all
relevant user research.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.850
And finally,

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.830
you should review any current designs
that you have on the product.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.900
If you're planning your
first design sprint,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.850
it's likely that you will not
have any current designs.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.720
In that case, you should focus
on these first three tasks

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.730
when going about the design sprint.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.340
At Udacity,
we recently planned two design sprints.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.490
The first design challenge involved
redesigning the entire user journey

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.170
through a nanodegree from the time the
user hears about a nanodegree, the time

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.370
that that user graduates and advances
their career or lands a new job.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.730
A second design sprint focused on one
particular part of our user journey.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.730
We started to think about how to
redesign student support through forms,

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.980
code reviews, and other methods.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.410
You'll need to plan a specific
design challenge like these for

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.820
your own product, and
it's likely that it will be for

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.680
the main user journey, navigation,
and key tasks that users will perform.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.320
The design challenge statement is
what you need to actually write, and

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.460
it creates a single focus for
what is the output of the design sprint.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.660
A good challenge statement should
have a couple key qualities.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.230
First, it should be relevant to the
highest priority work of the team, and

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.120
it should be tied to a purpose or
key result.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.750
It should also be concise and to
the point, and hopefully inspiring for

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.090
yourself.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.800
The design challenge statement should
also include a target audience, or

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.179
segments of that audience.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.010
And finally, for
projects that are in progress,

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.330
you'll want to include a launch time
stated in terms of years or quarters.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.390
So, would you want to be
launching in Q1, Q2, Q3, or Q4?

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.310
Your design challenge statement
will identify the tangible

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.250
items that you want to have at
the end of the design sprint.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.720
And at the least,
it should answer one of two questions.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.720
What are you missing
that you need critically?

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.140
Or, what is the riskiest decision or

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.270
hypothesis that you want
to test with your users?

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.730
You can use a gap analysis like this one
to determine what the product is missing

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.850
or what's one of the riskier decisions
or hypotheses that you need to test.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.300
This checklist is linked
in the instructor notes.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.150
Here's one example of
a challenge statement.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.900
You might design a mobile app
that helps a visitor plan and

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.150
find the most relevant personalized and
exciting activities to do in a city,

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.655
keeping in mind that the visitor
only has one day for their visit.

00:02:44.655 --> 00:02:48.965
The deliverables in this case would
be to get wireframe sketches for

00:02:48.965 --> 00:02:52.302
ideas that would be
implemented in Q3 of 2015.

00:02:52.302 --> 00:02:56.383
Your design challenge statement should
be similar, and have components

00:02:56.383 --> 00:03:00.589
like the what of the deliverable, the
time frame for when you need it by, and

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:05.990
also a clear user with what they'll be
doing in the application or the product.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.180
Now, the goal for your first sprint
will likely to be to map out

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.470
the basics of your new website or
app, including some flows, pages, or

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.960
screens, and the basic navigation.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.200
Now that you know about a challenge
statement I'd like you to think about

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.490
one for your own design sprint.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.580
What would you create and
for what kind of users, and

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.610
by when would you create it and
in order to do what?

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.870
Take a minute to think about this and
then write your answer in the box below.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.420
Don't feel like you need to commit to
this one design sprint challenge for

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.400
your own design sprint.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.760
You could actually change this
later in your final project.
