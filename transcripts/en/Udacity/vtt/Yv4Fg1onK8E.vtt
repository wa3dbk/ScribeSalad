00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.400
If you collect more data you're going to
need more storage and processing power.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.170
Luckily, you can simply add more Nodes.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.200
It's super easy to do it on Ambari,
I'll show you how.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.840
Launch a new Node instance.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.480
Be sure to set the security rules
correctly with all the ports

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.109
open on the subnet.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.070
Copy the internal host name when it is
up and running because you'll need that.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.070
Go to the host page from the Ambari
dashboard, select Actions,

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.270
then Add New Hosts.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.920
So, add the internal host name
of the new instance here.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.290
And configure the rest
the same as before.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.889
Here install the instance as a new
Data Node with the Node manager.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.790
And all this the same and deploy it.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.870
There we go, three Data Nodes
