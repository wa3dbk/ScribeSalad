00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now let's go and proceed a bit systematically. The situation we are in is classical.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We do have a program and the program gets some input and out pops a failure

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that can be seen by the user.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What is a failure in here? A failure is an error.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
An error that's externally visible that is visible by the user.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
What is an error? An error is something that deviates from what's correct, right, or truth.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Errors are typically unwanted and unintended. Failures are error. A defect is also an error.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
A defect, however, is somewhere in the code.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The defect is what turns otherwise valid input in the end into a failure.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The term defect is an error in the code as in several synonyms.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Some people also called this a fault but then a fault can also be applied to data.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The by far most common word for defect, however, is of course, bug.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000
There is a bug in my code somewhere as if this had somehow crawled in into my code.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Here is this foreign but, this is my code, it doesn't belong here. That's okay.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
In the end, it's us programmers who are actually introducing these bugs in there

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and so are very much prefer the term defect.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The aim of debugging is to find the defect that causes the problem.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
For this, I want you to look a little bit deeper into how a program actually executes.
