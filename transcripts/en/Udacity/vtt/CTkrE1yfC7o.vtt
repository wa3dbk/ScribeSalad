00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.100
So when I was in high school,

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.020
I grew up in Canada in the Toronto
area specifically in the Milton area.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.750
And there really wasn't a lot of money
to be had when I was in high school.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.590
Poor kids running around farm country.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.120
And I had a friend who had a truck,
and one day he turned to me and

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.600
said, hey you're smart.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.300
Why don't you figure out a way
that we could make some money.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.561
And I was just like okay, so
as he would drive me to and

00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:30.157
from school I kept looking out the
window as you do when you're driving and

00:00:30.157 --> 00:00:32.695
I would see farm equipment everywhere.

00:00:32.695 --> 00:00:38.830
Old farm equipment rooting in
fields rusted, dilapidated etc.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.200
One day, we were in the town and we
passed by building that had a huge sign

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.440
over it that said,
we buy your scrap metal.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.140
Research revealed that this was
a recycling plant and then it struck me.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.550
Hey, my friend's got a truck.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.480
There's all this old farm
equipment rotting in fields that's

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.810
obviously not wanted.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.510
And here's a place that's
willing to buy metal.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.209
So I turned my friend and I said hey,
how would you feel about calling these

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:08.790
people up or just visiting them out of
the blue and saying why don't you pay us

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.390
to remove your old equipment
that's just dying in your yard.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.110
We'll take it away.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.410
And then we would take that
equipment to the recycle plant.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.760
He thought this was a brilliant idea.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.340
He was willing to
contribute his truck and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.640
both of us would use our physical
prowess to move this heavy equipment.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.950
And shortly after doing that, we had
quickly cleared out the territory that

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.990
we were in, farm equipment and had quite
a bit of money in our bank accounts.
