Now it's time to talk about getting input from

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.520
your users. Few of us like writing long letters on

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.910
our mobile device, although I have stronger thumbs than I

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.030
did even a few years, it's still relatively painful to

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.200
type lots of content on a mobile device. You need

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.590
to make it easy for users to input their data.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.350
Of course it's important to use relatively large text sizes.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.780
I can't read six point font with my magnifying glasses.
