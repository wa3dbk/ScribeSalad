00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.500
Let's take everything away except our picture of the prototype relationship

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.640
between these two objects and consider this relationship just on its own.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.390
If this behavior was useful to us for

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.280
making the rose object capable of resembling the gold object,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.920
are there other objects in JavaScript that might make use of this mechanism?

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.910
For example, does gold delegate its own field lookup somewhere?

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.140
In fact it does.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.370
There is a top level object that every JavaScript object

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.180
eventually delegates to.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.650
This is where all the basic methods are provided for all objects.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.140
We call it the object prototype because it provides the shared properties of

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.680
all objects in the entire system.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.470
That way, when you ask an object for its dot to string property,

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.400
you get access to a function that can do the appropriate work.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.880
Once you've accessd the function, you can immediately call it.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.810
And the object that you did the property look up on will appear to the left of

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.470
the dot at that functions call time.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.710
Thanks to the way that the parameter this works, the shared function will work

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.330
as expected, with the this keyword bound to the rose object, even though

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.720
the .toString method was technically stored way up on the object prototype
