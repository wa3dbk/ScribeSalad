Here's our data, and you'll see that the sample size is 25. It says 26 here

00:00:04.724 --> 00:00:11.535
because we have a header. So let's find the average of the QWERTY errors,

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:20.323
equals average A2 to A26, and we get 5.08. And then if we find the average of

00:00:20.323 --> 00:00:26.410
the errors made on that alphabetical keyboard, we get 7.8. We want to see if

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.560
there's a significant difference between the number of errors made on each

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.454
keyboard. Our null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference. The

00:00:35.454 --> 00:00:39.282
population of errors from this keyboard, if it were extended to everybody, not

00:00:39.282 --> 00:00:44.598
just the sample, equals the population of errors using this keyboard. And our

00:00:44.598 --> 00:00:49.718
alternative hypothesis, is that they're not equal. Notice that this is

00:00:49.718 --> 00:00:56.968
equivalent to saying that mu sub Q minus mu sub A equals 0. If we just subtract

00:00:56.968 --> 00:01:00.559
mu sub A on both sides of this equation, which basically says that the

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.976
difference is equivalent to about 0.
