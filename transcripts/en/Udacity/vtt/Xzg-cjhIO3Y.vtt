00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.824
Now, so far,
any time I talk about overflow,

00:00:03.824 --> 00:00:06.542
I indicated that we're writing.

00:00:06.542 --> 00:00:10.074
That we're storing data in
some part of memory, and

00:00:10.074 --> 00:00:13.622
we keep going beyond the limit
where we should stop.

00:00:13.622 --> 00:00:17.120
And so, the overflow is
the result of writing stuff.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.400
Overflows don't just have to be
associated with writing data.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.681
Overflows could also
happen because we read.

00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:29.541
The whole idea here is that overflow
is because we do too much of something.

00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:34.380
We keep writing beyond the limit, so we
write more than what we're supposed to.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.370
What if you read too much?

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.060
Let's say a variable has 12 bytes but
you asked to read 100 bytes.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.978
What the read is going to do is it's
going to keep going beyond the variable

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:48.373
and it's going to go on to the next
one and the one after that, and

00:00:48.373 --> 00:00:49.441
things like that.

00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:53.093
So wherever in memory you have
that variable that you're reading,

00:00:53.093 --> 00:00:56.561
if you go beyond that, you're
going to get into other variables.

00:00:56.561 --> 00:01:01.181
Now, there is a fairly well-known
vulnerability in the open SSL code

00:01:01.181 --> 00:01:05.253
which is used to secure all kinds
of online transactions, and

00:01:05.253 --> 00:01:07.701
secure communications, and so on.

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:10.761
It was called
the Heartbleed Vulnerability.

00:01:10.761 --> 00:01:14.101
Actually, it was an overflow
related vulnerability.

00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:19.040
But it wasn't writing into the stack
beyond the memory that we had allocated

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.340
for the variable into
which we are writing.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.050
It was actually a read
overflow vulnerability.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.870
Actually, this OpenSSL Heartbleed did,

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.350
is that it kept reading beyond the
variable that you're supposed to read.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.100
And there was some juicy stuff
beyond that to do with keys and

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.301
things like that.

00:01:38.301 --> 00:01:42.653
So if you read too much, you're going to
get additional data beyond what's really

00:01:42.653 --> 00:01:46.090
should be in this variable
that you're trying to read.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.180
And so, the additional data that
you got could be used to figure out

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.120
sensitive keys and things like that,
and that's what the vulnerability was.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.900
But the vulnerability comes from
the fact that we're reading beyond

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.711
the variable that the code
was supposed to access.

00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:04.151
As a result, the overflow
occurs while you are reading.

00:02:04.151 --> 00:02:07.492
You go beyond the boundary of
the variable and keep going.

00:02:07.492 --> 00:02:10.508
So that's called
a Read-only Buffer Overflow, and

00:02:10.508 --> 00:02:14.798
the example that we just discussed
the is the Heartbleed Vulnerability that

00:02:14.798 --> 00:02:17.070
occurred because of that.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.521
Buffer overflows don't
have to be on attack only.

00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:23.466
They can happen on the heap, and
buffer overflows don't have to be just

00:02:23.466 --> 00:02:26.381
when you write,
they can also happen when you read.

00:02:26.381 --> 00:02:30.501
It's just going beyond the boundary
where you should stop.

00:02:30.501 --> 00:02:32.521
You don't do that, that's the overflow.

00:02:32.521 --> 00:02:36.110
If you're reading some data,
then it's read-only buffer overflow.
