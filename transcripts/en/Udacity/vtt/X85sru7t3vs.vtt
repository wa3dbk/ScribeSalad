00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.291
Remember that the equation we had before.
If the amount of money that Grant would

00:00:05.303 --> 00:00:09.804
earn if all of his original orders had
gone through, was equal to 87w plus 72n.

00:00:09.914 --> 00:00:15.024
But this was before any orders had been
canceled. And in the last quiz, we just

00:00:15.036 --> 00:00:19.998
found out how much money Grant would have
earned from the orders that are now

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.511
canceled. And that was just equal to 3w
plus 12n dollars. A couple of quizzes ago,

00:00:24.602 --> 00:00:28.612
we also found an equation for Grant's
total future earnings, taking his canceled

00:00:28.624 --> 00:00:32.762
orders into account. Of course, it was a
pretty general equation, that didn't have

00:00:32.775 --> 00:00:36.781
any variables numbers in it yet. They said
that his total future earnings will be

00:00:36.793 --> 00:00:40.878
equal to the money from all the original
orders, minus the money he would have made

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.058
from the orders that are now canceled. So
let's combine all this information, using

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.401
substitutions, into a single equation, for
Grant's total future earnings. Earnings.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.091
So which of these expressions down here
would correctly replace the question mark

00:00:54.103 --> 00:00:58.645
to come up with an equation for Grant's
total future earnings, taking the cost of

00:00:58.657 --> 00:00:59.476
each wiper and nozzle into account.
