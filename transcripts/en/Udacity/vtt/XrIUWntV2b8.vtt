00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The answer is 0.4. The way to think about this is thinking about how to choose the votes.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We have a hundred votes to begin with.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:18.000
There are four that the mixer cheats on, and the auditor is sampling 20 votes in this space.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
As long as the auditor picks one of the votes that was cheated on

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
then the mixer would be detected.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We can compute this by dividing the number of ways to choose without picking

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
any of the cheated votes--that's choosing out of the 96 noncheating votes--

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
divided by the total number of ways of choosing the votes.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
To solve this, we just need to compute 96 choose 20 divided by 100 choose 20.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Since the orders were cancelled out, they're 20 elements each time

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:57.000
this the same as computing 96 times 95 down to 77 divided by 100 down to 81.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We had cancelled things out and compute this by hand. We could just compute it all in Python.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Here's a procedure to compute the product of the list remembering to multiply by 1 point

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
to turn this into a floating point, so we get accurate division.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
When we run that, we get the result 0.4 with some more.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We might like a higher probability of catching cheaters

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
if we think cheating on four votes is enough to change the election.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We'd like to audit more votes. We could do that.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
That will increase the probability of catching a cheating mixer but will also increase the probability

00:01:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that privacy is lost--that a vote can be traced through the mix net.
