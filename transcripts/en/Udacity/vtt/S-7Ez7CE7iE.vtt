00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.450
In our growing diagram, the indicator that is the frequency indicator,

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.939
is a single state which I have labeled here frequency. And there is

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:13.220
no transition, that is the user can't directly move that vertical bar around.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.120
It will be the job of the station knob when the user does undergo a particular

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.970
transition. By turning the knob to somehow affect the station machine,

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.280
concurrently executing machine. As I said,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.870
we will delay dealing with that until a little later.
