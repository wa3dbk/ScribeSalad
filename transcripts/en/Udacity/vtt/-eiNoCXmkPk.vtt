00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.970
Before we can identify the cars, and the connected car's data.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.680
Let's start with a question.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.270
What is the data collected by the connected car?

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.500
To answer this question, we will take a look at some aspects of the data.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.420
As in the previous examples, we will be using the iPython Notebook.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.672
&gt;From the instructor's notes, please find the download links to

00:00:26.672 --> 00:00:31.470
the iPython Notebook and the data set that we will use in this lesson and

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.620
make sure you have a file in it named connected cars.cvs.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.640
Launch the iPython Notebook, and click on Lesson 4 Handout.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.120
You should see something like this on your web browser screen.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.610
Let's look at the first block of code.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.470
Here, the first thing we do is import the pandas library.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:02.750
And then we use the Pandas library to read the CSV file, connected_cars.csv.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.590
For the entirety of this lesson, to run the piece of code in that block,

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.680
we will use the Play button here.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.680
You can also use the Enter and Shift button together to do the same.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.910
Let's run this piece of code.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.520
Now the data has already been loaded in a pandas data frame.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.260
The data frame is called events.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.910
We will use the describe method for the data frame to see what it loaded.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.950
Here, you will see a summary of the data in a table.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.490
This summary shows that we have 128,561 events or entries.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:50.560
You can take a look at the actual data by using the head method on the events.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.980
The head method shows you what is inside the data.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.740
In this case we have 5 columns.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.550
In the first column we have.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.980
A driver ID.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.020
The second column gives us some values of x.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.190
The third some values of y.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.100
The fourth are dates on which these values were taken.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.720
And the fifth, the time at which these values were taken.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.100
We only see here the top 5 events.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.890
Similarly, we can try to use the tail method on events.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.230
Let's see what happens.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.870
We see the same.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.400
Sort of data except now the driver IDs are G.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.150
You can see these are the last 5 rows of the data set.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.450
We will quickly summarize the data.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.820
We saw that the data has IDs A to G.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.650
It has some x and y location, or coordinates.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.700
It also has a date and time.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.200
Here, we have a scattered diagram to show you what the data actually contains.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.080
These are coordinates of people driving around in a connected car.
