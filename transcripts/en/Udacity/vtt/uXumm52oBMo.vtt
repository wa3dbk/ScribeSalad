00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.680
Let's now take a look at the

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.500
second important fundamental design goal on the internet,

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.430
interconnection, and how interconnection is achieved with the

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.120
design principle called the Narrow Waist. Let's keep

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.400
in mind that one of the main goals

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.410
was to interconnect many existing networks, and to

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.140
hide the underlying technology of interconnection from applications.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.410
This design goal was achieved, using a principle

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.270
called the narrow waist. The internet architecture,

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.990
has many protocols that are layered, on top

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.500
of one another. At the center, is an

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.290
interconnection protocol, called IP. Or the internet protocol.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.220
Now every internet device must speak IP or have an IP stack. Given that a device

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.980
implements the IP stack, it can connect to

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.440
the internet. This layer of the network is

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.170
sometimes called the network layer. Now this layer provides

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.990
guarantees to the layers above. On top of the

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.270
network layer sits the transport layer. The transport layer

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.840
includes protocols like TCP and UDP. The network layer

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.820
provides certain guarantees to the transport layer. One of

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.780
those guarantees is end to end connectivity. For example,

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.930
if a host has an IP address, then the

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.770
network layer, or IP, provides the guarantee that a

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.330
packet with that host destination IP address, should

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.130
reach the destination with the corresponding address. With

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.210
best effort. On top of the transport layer

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.470
sits the application layer. The application layer includes

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.990
many protocols that various internet applications use. For

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.240
example, the web uses a protocol called the

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.860
hypertext transfer protocol or HTTP. And mail uses

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.860
a protocol called SMTP or simple mail transfer protocol.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.020
Transport layer protocols provide various guarantees to the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.390
application layer. Including reliable transport or congestion control.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.350
Now below the network layer, we have other

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.120
protocols. The link layer provides point to point connectivity,

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.620
or connectivity on a local area network. In

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.500
common link layer protocol, is Ethernet. Below that,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.770
we have the physical layer, which include protocol

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.190
such as sonnet or optical networks and so forth.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.830
The physical layer is sometimes called layer 1. The link

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.560
layer is sometimes called layer 2 and the network layer

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.330
is sometimes called layer 3. We tend to not refer

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.140
to layers above the network layer by number. The most

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.230
critical aspect of this design is that the network layer

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.350
essentially only has one real protocol in use, and that's

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.840
IP. That means, that every device on the network must

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.690
speak IP, but as long as the device speaks IP

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.020
it can get on the internet. This is sometimes called

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.280
IP over anything, or anything over IP, now the advantage to

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.600
the narrow waist as I mentioned is that it is fairly

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.900
easy to get a device on the network if it runs

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.580
IP, but the drawback is that because every device is

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.320
running IP, it's very difficult to make any changes at this

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.510
layer. However, people are trying to do so, and later in

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.210
the course, when we discuss software defined networking, we will explore

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.250
how various changes are being made to both

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.680
the IP layer, and other layers that surround it.
