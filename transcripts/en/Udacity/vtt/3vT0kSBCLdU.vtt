00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.410
So, let me tell you about two technical terms.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.740
One called recall, one is called precision.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.560
These are the terms for what you just computed.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.530
For example, the recall rate on Hugo Chavez is the quotient of how many,

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.830
is the probability of our algorithm to correctly identify Hugo Chavez,

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.860
provided that the person actually is Hugo Chavez.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.740
So in our case, it was 10 over 16.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.170
Precision of the same concept would be the rate of which the rate of

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.870
which if our algorithm predicted would be the second rate that we studied,

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.200
which happened to be one.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.999
It's the quotient of, suppose our algorithm observes that there's Hugo Chavez,

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:39.459
what are the chances that it actually is Hugo Chavez and

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:40.974
it happened to be 10 over 10?
