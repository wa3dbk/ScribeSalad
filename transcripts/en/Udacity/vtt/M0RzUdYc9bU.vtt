[Norvig] So here's 1 approach. First we'll define the houses.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Say there's 5 houses. That was the number 1 thing stated in the problem.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Then we'll say orderings is some collection of possible orderings of the houses,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
so [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] would be 1 element of orderings,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
[2, 1, 3, 4, 5] would be another element and so on

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And then we just use a for statement to iterate the 5 variables in the property group

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
through all the possible orderings and then put in our code here.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The question is, what is this function F that gives us all the orderings?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Is it the permutation function, the combinations function, the factorial function,

00:00:39.000 --> 09:59:59.000
or something else?
