00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.957
You'll soon notice an issue with our setup. If we walk through our entities and

00:00:03.957 --> 00:00:07.402
render them in the list as they've been allocated, then we get into situations

00:00:07.402 --> 00:00:10.741
that some objects will render above or below other objects, which may cause

00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:17.135
visual issues. For instance, explosions should draw above everything else. But

00:00:17.135 --> 00:00:20.060
with our current setup, this won't happen, depending on how our entity list is

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.109
sorted. The classic solution to this problem is to introduce a z index property

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.970
to each entity, that describes in what order an object should be rendered. If

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.104
we assume the map is at z index equal to zero, then our engine will draw

00:00:32.104 --> 00:00:35.735
entities with lower z indexes first, such that they appear underneath objects

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:41.525
with higher z order values. Once we've added the z index value to each of our

00:00:41.525 --> 00:00:45.100
entities, we have to modify the game engine class's draw function to take this

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.838
into account. So, looking at the code here, first, our draw function will, of

00:00:49.838 --> 00:00:53.887
course, go through and draw the map. Then, as before, we walk through each of

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:58.210
our entities. And if it's within our viewRect, we render it to the screen. Now,

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.710
your job is to figure out how to modify this code Sort of we properly reder

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.411
zindex into account
