00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.910
Okay, the correct answers are this one, this one,

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.410
and this one. The first is not valid because there's

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.280
a space in the name. The name needs to be

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.000
one string of characters followed by colon followed by space

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.168
and then the value. The second is correct. The

00:00:16.168 --> 00:00:18.030
third is not correct because there's no colon. There needs

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.339
to be a colon between the name and the value.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.900
This one is correct, User-Agent: ignore me I'm a spammer.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.550
Now, the value, as we mentioned before, can have

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.570
anything you want in it. The final one is

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.400
also correct, i-made-this-up: whatever, is also correct. Obviously, very

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.750
few people use this header. You can make up all

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.090
the headers you want. And often, people do, you

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.460
know? If you, if you have machines talking to

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.740
other machines, they can respond differently to different headers.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.350
And that's a good way of adding extra meta information

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.010
to the request
