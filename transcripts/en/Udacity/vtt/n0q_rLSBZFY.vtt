00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.200
So we decided to do a single blind study for our caffeine and reaction time

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.775
experiment. So in a single blind study, the researcher knows what group the

00:00:09.775 --> 00:00:14.130
particpants are in. There's another way that we can reduce bias in a study. And

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.610
that's by doing double blind study. So in a double blind study, neither the

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.520
researcher nor the participants know what group they're in. This will further

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.360
reduce bias by controlling for experimenter expectancy effect. For example,

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.870
let's say instead looking at caffeine's effect or reaction time, we want to

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.540
look at the effects of kindness. Well, maybe I as a researcher believe that

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.070
caffeine does make people more friendly. Well, when I interact with the

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.900
subjects to rate their kindness, the belief I have may cause me to be more

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.310
friendly towards them. Which may in turn make the subjects more friendly to me,

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.930
so my inconsistent treatment between the two groups may result in an

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.860
unintentional bias. And that can affect the results of my study.
