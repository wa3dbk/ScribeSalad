Here in Spotify if I go into your
music I see a table of playlists.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.830
Then if I drill down into one of those
playlists, I see a table of songs.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.180
So I have a hierarchy of table views and

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.750
the back button let's
me retrace my steps.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.340
Here this custom right bar button
let's me edit my playlists.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.400
In the playlist table the right
bar button brings up a model of

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.050
actions that can be taken on a song.
