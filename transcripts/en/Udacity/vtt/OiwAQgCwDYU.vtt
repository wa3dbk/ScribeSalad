00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.020
What better way than ask you what you

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.460
think are the functionalities that should be provided by

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.850
an Operating System. So here are some choices

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.200
I'm giving you in this question, and what I

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.830
want you to mark off or select are

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.980
choices that you think describe the functionalities that should

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.180
be provided by an Operating System. And, more

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.930
than one of these choices may apply to the

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.010
functionality that you expect from an Operating

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.851
System. So go ahead and choose these

00:00:30.851 --> 00:00:35.010
correct choices. The first choice is, Operating

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.990
System is a resource manager. The second choice

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.580
says, the Operating System provides a consistent

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.810
interface for the hardware resources such as

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.830
CPU, memory and so on. The third

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.950
choice says, the Operating System schedules applications on

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.910
the CPU. The fourth choice says, the Operating System stores personal

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.430
information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, e-mail

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.810
addresses and so on. So, pick the things that you

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.980
think are functionalities that you expect an operating system to provide.
