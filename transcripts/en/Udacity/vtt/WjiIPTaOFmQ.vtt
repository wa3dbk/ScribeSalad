00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.770
Compuptational clusters are the work horses

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.650
of giant scale services, any modern data

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.600
centers employs on the order of

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.340
thousands and thousands of computational nodes connected

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.080
by high performance, high speed networks.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.460
It is such computational clusters, which are

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.420
serving as the work horses for giant scale services today. And this figure

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.820
reproduced from Eddie Gruer's paper circa 2,000 shows

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.750
the number of nodes in a data center, maybe

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.110
on the order of 1,000. But scale it up by ten or 100 in terms of today's

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.740
computation capacity that you might find in a

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.560
typical data center. And the kind of volume of

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.390
queries that are going to be handled. By

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.250
giant scale services today. Each node in the cluster

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.650
may itself be an SMP. There are serveral virtues for structuring the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.760
computational resources inside a data center as a cluster of machines connected

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.360
by high performance back planes. The

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.090
advantages include absolute scalability. You can

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.100
keep adding more resources. Without worrying

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.330
about re-architecting the internals of the

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.270
data center. Cost and performance is another

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.185
important issue and that is by having

00:01:22.185 --> 00:01:26.280
computational clusters at every node is identical

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.880
to others, is that as a system administrator

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.560
we can control both the cost, And the performance of running a data center like

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.170
that, and because of the independent components

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.100
you can easily mix and match generational changes

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.905
in the hardware, and the results are incremental

00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:48.220
scaleability you add more resources you get more.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.730
In terms of performance because, as I told

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.620
you earlier, most of the queries that come

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.270
into giant-scale services tend to be embarrassingly parallel.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.930
So the more resources you've got, the more

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.420
queries you can handle. There is incremental scalability

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.250
when you're using clusters because you can add more

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.970
nodes to the cluster, increasing the performance. Or, if the

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.320
volume, of request come down, you can scale back. That's

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.770
the advantage of using computational clusters as the work horses

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.770
for data centers that are serving giant scale services today.
