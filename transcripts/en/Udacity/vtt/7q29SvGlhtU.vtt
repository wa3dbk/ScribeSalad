00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.210
Since this equation is in the same form as the equations for which we could read

00:00:05.222 --> 00:00:10.075
the slope as the coefficient of the x to the first term, the slope for this

00:00:10.087 --> 00:00:15.261
equation is m. In fact, this is the letter that we usually use to represent the

00:00:15.273 --> 00:00:16.595
slope of any line, m.
