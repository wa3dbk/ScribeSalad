You're going to create what we call a frequency table. In other words, we count

00:00:06.334 --> 00:00:12.832
the frequency of occurrences from each country. One way that I would do this is

00:00:12.844 --> 00:00:18.903
to tally it. Starting from here, we have 1 US, 1 Canada, 1 China, US, India,

00:00:19.034 --> 00:00:24.279
England, etc. And then, convert each tally to the number. So, go ahead and fill

00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:26.132
in each of these frequencies.
