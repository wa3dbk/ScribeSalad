00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.000
A key construct at most exchanges
is something called the order book.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.230
Each exchange keeps an order book for
every stock that they buy or sell.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.240
And here's how it works.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.230
Let's suppose you've just issued
an order to buy 100 shares of IBM

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.682
with a limit price of 99.95.

00:00:21.682 --> 00:00:25.490
And let's suppose for
the moment that this arrives at

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.250
the New York Stock Exchange and so
far today nobody's put in any orders.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.630
So your order is the first one and

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.210
they'll use it as the basis to
start building their order book.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.080
So yours is the first
entry in the order book.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.920
And it simply shows somebody has
bid 99.95 for 100 shares of stock.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.920
And this is public knowledge.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.720
People can view this and see, okay,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.800
there's interest in buying
shares of this stock.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.060
Now, they don't know
who has made this bid.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.070
The exchange knows that it's
you that's made that bid.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.810
But they see that there's
interest in 100 shares.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.950
Now others may send
in orders like yours.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.650
And this number just keeps
getting larger depending on

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.490
how many orders come in.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.646
When this is displayed publicly,
people just see that okay,

00:01:17.646 --> 00:01:20.570
there's interest maybe
from various people.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.273
And 1,000 shares of IBM at 99.95.

00:01:25.273 --> 00:01:28.302
So far nothing's been bought or sold yet

00:01:28.302 --> 00:01:33.410
though because we don't have
anybody willing to sell.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.398
Well, let's suppose
a sell order comes in.

00:01:35.398 --> 00:01:40.484
Sell IBM 1,000 shares, limit of $100.

00:01:40.484 --> 00:01:46.920
Well, there's nobody willing
to buy 1000 shares at $100.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.830
So, the exchange again, is going to have
to add this order to it's order book.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.670
And this will be our first ask.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.600
We've got now our first ask
as part of our order book.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.650
Now let's say more and
more orders come in.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.050
And it fleshes out our order book a bit.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.700
Here's our order book as it's fleshed
out a bit, as orders have come in.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.260
We've got a number of asks,
which are requests to sell stocks, and

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.300
a number of bids,
which are requests to buy.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.570
Suppose now we get a market order
to buy 100 shares of stock.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.470
Here's our new order,
and here's what happens.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.880
The Exchange looks at
it's order book and

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.860
it sees, yes,
we have lots of shares for sale here.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.860
We have to give the client the lowest
price so we'll give that client

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.870
100 shares of these that
are priced at $100.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.650
So, that means now we've
only got 900 left here,

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.920
we take that 100, give that to
the client who put in the order and

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.190
this is the state now of our order
book after that transaction.
