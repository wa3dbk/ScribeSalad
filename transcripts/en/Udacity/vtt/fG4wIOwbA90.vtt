Okay, sad story time. So, in the early days of

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.170
Reddit, I stored passwords in cleartext, because when I was

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.300
writing Reddit, I didn't think anybody would actually use it,

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.980
let alone a lot of people. So, as we grew, I

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.280
had this little bird in my ear telling me, you

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.340
know, this is bad, you should fix this, you should hash

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.020
these passwords. I knew better, but I didn't because we

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.950
actually got some benefit out of clear text passwords. When spammers

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.120
would come to Reddit, they would create thousands of accounts, but they

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.436
would use the same password for every account. So I was able to

00:00:30.436 --> 00:00:35.280
catch these huge webs of spammers. Now the downside of this, is

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.930
if somebody had stolen my laptop. I'd be in trouble. And sure enough,

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.530
somebody stole my laptop, and I had all of Reddit's usernames and

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.150
clear text passwords on it, and I got in a lot of trouble

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.570
over that. Now, this would've been an easy fix and it turns

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.950
out, you know, after that it was an easy fix. We just went

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.080
through and hashed all the passwords like we should have,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.120
but it's very important that you, as a developer, take care

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.660
of the user's data, because. They use the same password on

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.110
lots of sites, they probably don't really know better and, you

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.720
know, it's easier for them to be lazy than for you

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.140
to be lazy because you can solve it for everybody. So,

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.690
always hash your passwords take care of your user's stuff and

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.550
you won't regret it like I did once upon a time.
