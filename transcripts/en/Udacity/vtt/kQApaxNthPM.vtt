00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.430
Enums and switch statements
work really well together.

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.770
Here's a statement that switches on
the value of the variable destination.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.850
destination is an enum
of type CaliforniaPark,

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.080
which you can see has four members.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.660
This statement prints out
different warnings based on which

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.600
enum member matches
the value of destination.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.800
Notice that if I leave out one of the
parks, the compiler gives me a warning.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.860
This can be especially helpful
if I add a value to an enum

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.480
after I've already used
it in a switch statement.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.510
The compiler helps me make sure all
my switch statements are exhaustive.
