00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.780
As we mentioned, not only our immune system is compromised in regards to

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.604
stress, but we can also have problems with cardiovascular health. There are two

00:00:08.604 --> 00:00:12.800
psychological risk factors that predict heart health. 1 of those is type A

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.448
personality and the other is anger. Those with type A personality or type A

00:00:18.448 --> 00:00:22.288
behavior patterns respond to stressful situations or challenges with

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:28.250
impatience, hostility or anger. In addition, hostility and anger, which are our

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.030
emotional responses to stress, can cause an increase in blood pressure and

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.646
heart rate. Over an extended period of time, that can lead to coronary artery

00:00:36.646 --> 00:00:42.176
disease. And then, that can actually lead to heart disease. The take-home

00:00:42.176 --> 00:00:45.515
message here is how we respond to the stressful situation, by being angry or

00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:50.668
hostile, may lead to heart disease. However, if we can reduce our stressful

00:00:50.668 --> 00:00:54.196
response to the stressful situation, we actually may be able to avoid heart

00:00:54.196 --> 00:00:58.566
disease. Now we're going to go back to Lauren and learn a little bit more about

00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.090
heart disease and stress.
