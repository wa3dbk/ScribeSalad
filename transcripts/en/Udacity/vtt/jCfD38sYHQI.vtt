00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.000
So you've probably heard
of this cloud thing before.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.900
Network diagrams such as this one
are actually where the term, the cloud,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.230
to mean Internet services, comes from.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.400
The idea is that we don't need to know
what's going on inside this cloud.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.210
It's hidden from us.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.510
All we need to know is what service
we're talking to at the other end and

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.960
that the network will get our
message all the way from us to them.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.850
If this is us over here with
a Chrome web browser, and

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.830
they're over there with an Apache web
server, we can do an HTTP request and

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.850
get a web page back,
even though the network in the middle

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.650
doesn't even need to know
that web pages are a thing.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.670
The ping program, on the other hand, is
a little unusual for a network program.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.390
The message that it sends,
called an Echo request,

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.480
is received by the destination
system's operating system.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.770
In an application protocol like HTP or

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.910
SSH, there's a server program that
composes a response and sends it back.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.910
But with ping, there's no ping server.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.700
The Echo request just goes to the
operating system on the receiving end,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.620
which sends a response back.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.010
Every operating system that supports
Internet access supports ping as well.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.720
So regardless of what
system we're using,

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.555
we could ping a system
running any operating system.

00:01:15.555 --> 00:01:20.870
Could be Linux, or Windows, or
Mac OS, or BSD, or something else.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.690
There is something to keep in mind is
that although ping is simpler than HTTP,

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.820
HTTP is not based on ping.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.510
So let's see what HTTP is built on.
