00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.740
The question is,
what do we do in situations like this

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.050
where we don't have data
between two separate dates?

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.060
Now, you might think,
Gee, let's interpolate.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.360
And so we would estimate what a line
is between those two dates and

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.160
then fill in at each point
an interpolated value.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.700
Why not do that?

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.040
Well, the truth of the matter is,

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.930
between these two dates,
there was no trading.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.600
There really was no price for that data.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.760
But if we're going to do something like,
for instance, compute a rolling average.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.110
Or a mean over that data,

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.540
and there's nans there,
that'll wipe out our entire calculation.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.820
So we can't leave it empty, but
we shouldn't interpolate it either.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.600
So here's what we might do.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.840
One thing that we can do,
is we fill forward,

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.360
going from, we go over all the data,
and when there's some missing data,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.050
we fill forward from the last,
previous known value.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.629
So for instance,
if we were to do that here,

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.490
we would get these values up until
that date, where it takes over there.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.390
We would fill forward here,
and fill forward here.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.810
Now notice there's a big gap between
there, and there's a big gap here, but

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.150
that realistically reflects what
was going on with the data.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:29.500
Now the reason we do this instead of
the interpolation is the following.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.890
Let's suppose we were looking for
patterns in the data and

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.730
we had rolled back time and
we were simulating history.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.620
And let's suppose for
a moment we had this interpolation.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.130
And let's suppose we're
right here in time and

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.700
we're trying to figure out
what's going to happen next.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.000
We're looking for patterns and so on.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.380
We're actually giving ourselves
information about the future.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.820
We're observing that
the price is going up.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.350
So if we were to make
a calculation here,

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.240
we would actually be
peeking into the future.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.410
And that is not allowed.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.210
We do not want to do that.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.540
So we need to stick with only
filling forward a last known price.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.020
If we do that then we're not
picking into the future.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.160
So let's get rid of that ugly,
nasty picking into the future.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.550
Okay, so now we've actually
filled in all our gaps and

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.410
we have continuous data from this
start point all the way to the end.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.130
However, there still is missing
data here at the beginning.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:39.540
And because we need some value here in
order to calculate rolling averages or

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.940
whatever sort of statistics we want to
do, it's better to have some value here.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.180
Instead of not a number.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.990
And in this case, we fill backwards.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.310
So remember, if you are going to fill
your data to resolve problems with gaps,

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.790
fill forward first and
fill backward second.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.290
That way you will avoid,
to the max extent possible,

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.030
picking into the future.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.800
Now we'll hand it over to Dave.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.210
And she's going to show you
how to do this in code.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.960
Here's to you, Dave!
