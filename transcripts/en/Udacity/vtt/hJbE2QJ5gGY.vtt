00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's the answer to our programming exercise.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We set up an index, I, which we let run over all lines.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In the coverage array, now I is running from 0 to the number of lines minus 1.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
However, in coverage, lines are started with 1 and not with 0.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So we check whether I + 1 is in the set of lines covered

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
for that specific file name.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
If the line is in the set, then we print out a star followed by the line.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Since the line already includes new line characters,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
we omit this by adding another comma at the end.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If the line is not covered, then we output a blank in front of the line.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Let's see whether we get a nice listing together with the covered lines.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Unfortunately, our web page IDE strips away all leading blanks.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
But what we see still is the executed lines prefixed by stars

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and the nonexecuted lines which have no such prefix.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Again we can see that we do have a number of lines

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
that are not executed at all.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
That is, for this particular input, foo, without HTML markup.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
A coverage tool such as this one can be very helpful in debugging,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
as it is in testing.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
In testing, you'd like to come up with tests that cover as many execution features as possible.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So if you see, for instance, that what we have executed so far

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
does not cover these lines,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
you may wish to come up with additional test cases.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Better coverage tools would also count the number of times a line has been executed

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
or save coverage that has been achieved so far in a file

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and thus allow for accumulating coverage over multiple runs with different inputs.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
For now, however, we're going to use the computed coverage for debugging purposes.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Namely, to find lines whose execution correlate with failure.
