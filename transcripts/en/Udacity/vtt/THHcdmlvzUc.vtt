00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.237
Whenever we start to factor an expression like this, we should always take out

00:00:04.237 --> 00:00:08.353
the greatest common factor first. Factoring out a one in this case, will not

00:00:08.353 --> 00:00:12.629
change our equation. So, we need to learn something else in order to solve this

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:13.190
problem.
