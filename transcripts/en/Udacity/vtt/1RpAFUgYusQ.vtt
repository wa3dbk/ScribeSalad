00:00:04.761 --> 00:00:09.439
are parallel to one another, what do you think that the term parallel refers to?

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:14.088
Are two things that are parallel of equal length? Do they have the same slope?

00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:18.482
Is the way that they relate change in y to change in x the same? Or do they

00:00:18.494 --> 00:00:20.166
intersect the same segments?
