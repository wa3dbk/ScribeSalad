00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.538
The correct answer is 5 times root 5 plus 10. Nice thinking if you got it. This

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:09.140
would be an alternate form of the correct answer as well. You could have

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.548
factored a 5 from each of these terms to have 5 times the square root of 5 plus

00:00:12.548 --> 00:00:16.960
2. Keep in mind that you need parenthesis around this entire quantity since

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.154
you're distributing the 5 to each of hte terms. We start rationalizing this

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:25.343
denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate.

00:00:25.343 --> 00:00:31.858
The conjugate of root 5 minus 2 is root 5 plus 2. We distribute the 5 to each

00:00:31.858 --> 00:00:36.414
of these terms to get 5 root 5 plus 10 in our numerator. For the denominator

00:00:36.414 --> 00:00:41.160
we'll use the difference of squares pattern to do a squared minus b squared.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.836
The A is route 5 and the B is positive 2. This leaves us with 5 minus 4 in our

00:00:45.836 --> 00:00:52.710
denominator. 5 minus 4 equals 1 and anything divided by 1 is itself. So we're

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.193
left with our final answer.
