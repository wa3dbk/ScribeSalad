00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.960
Until now we've only been building and
running pre-made images.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.130
In this case, nginx.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.115
It's time to learn how
to build our own images.

00:00:08.115 --> 00:00:12.110
As a best practice, we're not
building our application with Docker.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.510
No, instead, we're taking a binary that
could have come from our continuous

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.130
integration pipeline.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.324
Then we use Docker to package our
application as a container image, and

00:00:20.324 --> 00:00:22.140
to do that, we use a Dockerfile.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.850
Dockerfiles are text documents that
contain all of the necessary steps for

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.030
building an image from the command line.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.730
A Dockerfile,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.710
when used with the Docker build command,
automates that process by executing

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.550
these command line instructions
to build the resulting image.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.090
Let's look at one of ours.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.570
Really quick aside,
Dockerfiles are always named Dockerfile.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.310
That's because when the Docker
build command kicks off,

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.280
the command that uses our Docker file
to create an image, it also creates

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.383
a context of all the files in our
directory and its subdirectories.

00:00:52.383 --> 00:00:56.520
The build daemon will then search for
a file called Dockerfile, although,

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.980
in practice it's best to just start
with an empty directory as context and

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.580
keep your Dockerfile there.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.300
In that directory,

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.340
you only need to add the files necessary
for building your Docker image.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.590
Okay, so let's pull up our Dockerfile.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.410
After running the cat command you
can see the entire Dockerfile

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.740
for Hello image.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.230
Each line in a Dockerfile
starts with a command.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.478
This Dockerfile just uses four,
the FROM, MAINTINER, ADD, and

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:19.640
ENTRYPOINT commands.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.270
By the way,
Dockerfiles can have comments, and

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.000
they start with a pound sign,
just like bash comments.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.110
You can use comments to make your
life as the maintainer easier, and

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.460
to make it easier for the people
trying to decipher your Dockerfiles.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.050
Quick question.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.810
Do you think Kelsey didn't use comments
in writing this Dockerfile because

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.540
this is a really,
really simple Dockerfile?

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.720
Or because his comments are so

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.342
profound that many programmers
decide to retire after reading one?

00:01:45.342 --> 00:01:47.842
You decide.

00:01:47.842 --> 00:01:49.140
Moving on.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.280
The first command in a Dockerfile
is the FROM command.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.250
This tells Docker which base image
to build our new image on top of.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.250
These days it's always best to
use Alpine Linux as your base.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.630
Because it's small,
has a package manager,

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.860
and it allows you to debug
your containers in production.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.800
Alpine is also used by default for
all the official Docker images.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.290
We could optimize and

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.830
use the scratch space image, which
amounts to a no op, but then you lose

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.580
the ability to do basic debugging like
pinging from inside of your container.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.800
Besides, if you're using
the same base image,

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.640
Docker only has to pull that once.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.110
So we're only pulling that 5
megabyte cost once per machine.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.300
Next we have the MAINTAINER command.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.368
That just tells us that Kelsey is
the author and maintainer of this image.

00:02:33.368 --> 00:02:36.710
Following that you'll see the ADD
command, which takes a file or

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.662
directory is from our host machine and

00:02:38.662 --> 00:02:42.370
adds them to the file system of
the container at the specified location.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.505
In this case, we're copying over
the hello bin from our continuous

00:02:45.505 --> 00:02:48.432
integration or our go build
earlier into our container image.

00:02:48.432 --> 00:02:50.974
Finally, ENTRYPOINT.

00:02:50.974 --> 00:02:53.440
This let's our container
run as an executable.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.048
So when our container starts,
it's going to run the hello app.

00:02:56.048 --> 00:02:58.398
There are more commands you
can put into a Dockerfile and

00:02:58.398 --> 00:03:00.882
you'll probably see some
of them in the wild.

00:03:00.882 --> 00:03:03.040
Before our course,
this is everything you need to know.
