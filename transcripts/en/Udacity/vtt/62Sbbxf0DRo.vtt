00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.650
There are a number of commercial
technologies for centralized HIE.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.390
In addition, the federal government
sponsored the development of CONNECT,

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.130
an open-source solution for
centralized or

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.740
other models of health
information exchange.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.780
CONNECT is a very robust, complex system

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.920
that uses web services to facilitate
connectivity with other systems.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.270
Its architecture is modular with some
elements, as indicated by these colors,

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.760
being required, others being optional or

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.750
replaceable, and
still others being customizeable.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.220
It's also a gateway to the proposed
National Health Information Exchange,

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.610
as shown here.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.495
Why would some CONNECT modules
be replaceable or customizeable?
