00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
To recap a little bit, we have our software under test,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and it provides some APIs.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Each API's collection of functions and most of the work that we have during testing

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
is going to be calling these functions with various values and looking at the results.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Additionally, the software under test is going to use APIs provided by, for example,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
the operating system or the programming language runtime,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and a separate kind of testing is looking at how the software under test 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
responds to return codes and similar given to it by the APIs that it uses.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
That would be great if both of these kinds of testing 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
represented a complete picture of everything that we need to test,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but in fact, that's not the case, and there are some added complications

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that we're going to talk about now.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The issue is that the overt explicit interfaces that we see here

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
don't represent all the possible inputs and outputs that we might care about.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
For example, on the input side it's completely possible that our software under test

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
cares about the time at which inputs arrive.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So it might be the case that our software responds differently

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
if 2 inputs arrive very close together 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
than it does if 2 inputs arrive separated by a large amount of time.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And if this seems silly, just consider, for example, 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
the software that processes mouse clicks.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Two clicks very close together represent a double click,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and that's interpreted very differently from 2 mouse clicks that occur farther apart in time

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
which count as 2 single mouse clicks.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Another example is something like a web browser

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
where if the data corresponding to a web page is returned in a short window of time,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
this data will get rendered as a web page.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
But if the data that comes from the network is scattered across too much time,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
this is going to result in some sort of a time-out--

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
that is to say, the software under test, which is our web browser,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
will render some sort of an error page

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
instead of actually rendering the data if it comes too slowly.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Both of these examples that we just looked at are fairly easy to test

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
because in each case, we have this sort of binary distinction

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
between, in one case, the data arriving quickly--

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
that is to say, a double click or a complete web page arriving before the time-out--

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and in the other case, we have data arriving too slowly--

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
that is to say, 2 single clicks or a web page that takes so long to arrive that we time out.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
In other cases, the timing-dependent input can make our lives significantly more complicated.
