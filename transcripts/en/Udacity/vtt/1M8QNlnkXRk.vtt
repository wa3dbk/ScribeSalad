00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.540
But who's going to do these two things?

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.490
Should it be the operating system?

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.050
So when we have a TLB miss,
we go back into the operating system and

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.400
let it figure out what the page tables
have, using some sort of software?

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.190
Or, should the processor automatically
read the page table, or page tables, and

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.900
then update the TLB, without any
operating system intervention?

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.170
Which one of these two
do you think is correct?
