00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.717
This problem probably looks familiar,
we've just added a new category of

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:10.182
rational numbers. In this case, all of the
numbers are rational, with the exception

00:00:10.194 --> 00:00:16.732
of pi and the square root of 12. Neither
can be expressed as a ratio of integers.

00:00:16.732 --> 00:00:19.200
We'll discuss these more in a few minutes.
