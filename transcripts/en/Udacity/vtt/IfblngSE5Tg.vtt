00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.640
In this diagram there are two external states. There's an idle state and

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.550
a maintenance state. And there's transitions between the two indicating

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:13.350
the lines at the top of the screen. The maintenance state itself has sub-state

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.630
machines separated by the horizontal dash line. These two machines,

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.070
one called testing and one called commanding, are running concurrently. Each of

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.050
them as a simple machine starting at, at its left in the initial state and

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.320
moving towards right. And the commanding machine has a back loop from

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.700
its command state to its rating state indicating that, that particular machine

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.980
can execute several times before finally getting to its final state.
