00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.500
There are a couple possibilities here. We're working with a partially

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.230
filled array. So, do we want to use an enhanced for loop or

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.420
a regular for loop? If we use the enhanced for loop, it'll

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.610
add up every single item, even the ones in the part of

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.970
the array that we've said is empty. We know that the

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.390
current size is four but the enhanced for loop. Just notice how

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.580
much space there is in the whole array. In this case, the

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.430
enhanced for loop will work, but only because the array was initialized

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.430
full of zeros. So, when we take the sum and we add

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.760
all of these zeros, it won't actually give us the wrong answer.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.130
But if I were dealing with an array that might have extra

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.620
junk left over in the empty space, I would probably want to use a

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.090
regular for loop. And only go up to the currentsize of four.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.020
I'll show you both of those. Either way, I'll need my sum that

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.780
starts at 0, and I'll return that sum at the end. If

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.450
I used the enhanced for loop, I just increment the sum by score,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.110
each time, and that should work. But if I'm nervous that there

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.150
might be other junk left over, in the end of my array,

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.410
then I would declare a loop counter variable. And stop before it

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.120
gets up to current size, and look at each item one at

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.769
a time. And here I would have to get item out of

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.510
scores, because I'm not using an enhanced for loop anymore, and I

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.410
should actually give my, [LAUGH], loop counter variable an initial value. Now

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.970
we can see this in action, if I run the demo and

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.960
enter my scores, I get their total.
