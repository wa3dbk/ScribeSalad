00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.730
So to use your new found knowledge of the
distributive property let's have a quiz.

00:00:04.832 --> 00:00:08.026
What is 3 times all this stuff in

00:00:08.026 --> 00:00:12.690
Try not to look in this upper right hand
corner of the screen if you don't need to.

00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:17.340
The distributive property is still written
out there, but see if you can do it

00:00:17.352 --> 00:00:17.820
without.
