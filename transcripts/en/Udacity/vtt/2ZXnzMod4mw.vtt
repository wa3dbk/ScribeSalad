00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.244
So, we want to find the places where this lovely purple vertical line intersects

00:00:04.256 --> 00:00:08.495
each of these 3 other lines. But why? What is the point where 2 lines intersect

00:00:08.507 --> 00:00:12.603
actually represent? Is it a point that lines on both of those lines? Does it

00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:16.711
tell us values for x and y that satisfy the equations of both of the lines? Is

00:00:16.723 --> 00:00:22.610
it a point where one of the lines turns into the other line? Or is it a solution

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:25.220
to both equations?
