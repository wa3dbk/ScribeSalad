00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And the answer is 0.074. The first one would give us a probability of 1/3 · 2/3 · 1/3.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And the model that heads come is a probability of 1/3.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
These are the individual probabilities. You multiply them together.

00:00:15.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And when you do this, you get 0.074, which is the same as 2/27.
