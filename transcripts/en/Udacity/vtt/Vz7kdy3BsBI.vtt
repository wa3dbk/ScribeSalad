00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.019
Scientists have used EEG machines to record our brain waves while we sleep, and

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:08.907
while we're awake. When we're awake, our electrical brain activity is called

00:00:08.907 --> 00:00:14.170
beta waves. However, when we're relaxed, our brain activity slows to alpha

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.205
waves. As you can see here, this is when we become drowsy, and when we first

00:00:18.205 --> 00:00:21.491
fall asleep we don't go into rapid eye movement sleep but we go down to stage

00:00:21.491 --> 00:00:26.810
one. And during stage one our brain waves are theta waves. So if you were

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.910
looking at a brainwave activity, you would know that somebody fell asleep

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.349
because they moved from alpha waves to theta waves. In stage one we can be

00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:37.997
easily aroused by outside stimuli such as a phone ringing or someone walking

00:00:37.997 --> 00:00:42.886
around or so on. After about seven minutes or so. We're going to move from

00:00:42.886 --> 00:00:46.110
stage one to stage two. Now during stage two, which is also a type of theta

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.110
wave, we're going to see two interesting things in our electrical brain

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.246
activity. First, as you see here this is a sleep spindle. It's a sudden burst

00:00:55.246 --> 00:00:59.826
of electrical activity in the brain waves. And here, we see a K complex which

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:05.294
is a single but large, high voltage spike in brain activity. Both of these

00:01:05.294 --> 00:01:08.834
things last about a second or two. It has been proposed by some researchers

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:13.352
that these help us to disconnect from the outside world. After about 15 minutes

00:01:13.352 --> 00:01:17.353
in stage two, we move on to stage three sleep. Which consists of theta waves

00:01:17.353 --> 00:01:21.070
again, but also delta waves which are the slowest and strongest waves in our

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.970
sleep cycle. So stage three consists of some theta waves and some delta waves.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.322
And in stage four we experience all delta waves, and this again is our deepest

00:01:31.322 --> 00:01:36.593
stage of sleep. Now, remember, once we hit stage four, we go back up in reverse

00:01:36.593 --> 00:01:42.216
order. So we go from stage four to three to two to one and then REM sleep. Now,

00:01:42.216 --> 00:01:46.080
it's interesting to note that during REM sleep, we actually lose muscle tone.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.582
This may actually help to prevent us from acting out some of our dreams. Now,

00:01:50.582 --> 00:01:53.898
perhaps you've had a dream where you were running from someone. It would be

00:01:53.898 --> 00:01:58.309
hazardous if our brain actually allowed us to engage in these activities.
