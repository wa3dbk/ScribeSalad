00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.937
So, the next thing we'll look at as
far as the constructing the diagram is

00:00:03.937 --> 00:00:04.714
the operations.

00:00:04.714 --> 00:00:08.777
In the analysis model, operations
comprise those actions that the users

00:00:08.777 --> 00:00:11.537
can undertake to interact
with the text browser.

00:00:11.537 --> 00:00:16.344
The call that we're concerned
here with an analysis model and

00:00:16.344 --> 00:00:18.320
not a design, okay?

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.320
So, we are not trying to fill in

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.210
the implementation methods
that are involved.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.140
But rather,
we're using the class model diagram to

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.320
describe at a high level
what the user can do.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.750
You can use the identified use
cases to answer the questions,

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.450
what internally visible operations
does the text browser respond to?

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.270
And, you recall what those were?

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.760
&gt;&gt; So
the first was just viewing the text.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.500
That doesn't seem to really elicit
any kind of behavior though.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.750
&gt;&gt; So you're right, there's no event
that the application has to respond to,

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.340
to do that.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.620
Assuming that we started it up okay.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.310
&gt;&gt; Okay, and then moving the handle.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.560
&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's certainly going
to be an operation the system

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.620
has to respond to.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.280
&gt;&gt; And lastly, re-sizing the view port.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.243
&gt;&gt; And, we could also specify parameters
for those particular operations like,

00:01:10.243 --> 00:01:15.050
what's the size of the view port
that the user would like to see?

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.318
Or, what's the position of
the handle in the tray,

00:01:18.318 --> 00:01:20.710
when the user is using the scroll bar?
