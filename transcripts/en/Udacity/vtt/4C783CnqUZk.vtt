00:00:00.294 --> 00:00:02.440
Sebastian and Katie just gave
me something similar to what I

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.590
tried to give you at the start of
this nano degree program, a feel for

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.900
why you should care about machine
learning and what you can do with it.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.010
So let's dive in.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.200
Let's hear from Charles, Isabelle and

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.520
Michael Lettman about what
machine learning actually is and

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.050
how it can be used from their
masters level class in Georgia Tech.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.785
By the time this nano degree
group program is over,

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:20.860
we'll have used every
part of this course.
