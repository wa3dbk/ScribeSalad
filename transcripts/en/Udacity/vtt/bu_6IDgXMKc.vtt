00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.959
&gt;From the last problem, we found out there is an infinite number of solutions to

00:00:03.971 --> 00:00:07.993
this inequality. We know a way to write those answers. And, I don't want to list

00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:12.058
them out because that could be tedious. So, let's use a solution set. A solution

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.568
set is all the answers to this inequality. To find them, we solve this

00:00:15.581 --> 00:00:19.609
inequality just like we solve an equation. We subtract 2 from both sides to get

00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:23.993
3 x is greater than 6. Then, we divide both sides by the coefficient in front of

00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:28.210
the variable, we divide by 3. And the answer is x is greater than 2. So, any

00:00:28.222 --> 00:00:32.743
number larger than 2 will make this inequality true. Let's use the solution set

00:00:32.755 --> 00:00:36.998
to write our answer. We can show the solution in two ways. We can use a number

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.485
line or interval notation. We use an open parentheses at x equals 2 because x

00:00:41.497 --> 00:00:45.903
can't actually equal 2, its got to be bigger than 2. And then, we draw an arrow

00:00:45.915 --> 00:00:50.360
in the direction of the numbers that are all bigger than 2. 2 is considered to

00:00:50.372 --> 00:00:55.168
be the lower bound of our solution set. We use an open parentheses for 2 so that

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.099
we don't include it. We can remember, because is we plug in 2 here, we'll get 8

00:00:59.111 --> 00:01:03.350
greater than 8, which isn't true. So, we don't include 2 in the solution. We use

00:01:03.362 --> 00:01:07.342
an open parenthesis for positive infinity because we can't actually reach

00:01:07.354 --> 00:01:11.425
infinity. Any number bigger than 2 will work. You might be used to seeing an

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:15.424
open circle at 2, which is correct. For this class, though, we'll only use the

00:01:15.436 --> 00:01:18.220
parenthesis when showing answers on the number line.
