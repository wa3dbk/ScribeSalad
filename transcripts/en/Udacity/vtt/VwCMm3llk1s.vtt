00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.680
Alright. Well we'd like to try to get an

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.430
understanding of how powerful one of these perceptron units are.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.070
So, what is it that they actually do? So

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.660
they, they return, in this case either 0 or 1

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.870
as a function of a bunch of inputs. So

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.900
let's just for simplicity of visualization, let's just imagine that

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.840
we've got 2 inputs, X1 and X2. So Charles,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.760
how could we represent the region in this input space

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.700
that is going to get an output of 0

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.690
versus the region that's going to get an output of 1.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:30.580
&gt;&gt; Order the weights.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.460
&gt;&gt; Right. So indeed, the weights matter. So

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.670
let's, let's give some concrete values to these weights.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.130
And let's just say, just making these up that weight 1 is a half, weight 2 is a

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.910
half, and our threshold data is three quarters. So

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.750
now what we want to do is again, break

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.770
up this, this space into where's it going to

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.920
return 1 and where's it going to return 0.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.640
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I think I know how to figure this out. So, there's kind of

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.790
an, there's 2 sort of extreme examples, so let's take a case where X1 is 0.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.351
&gt;&gt; X1 is 0. Okay, good. So that's this Y axis, uh-huh.

00:01:05.351 --> 00:01:09.240
&gt;&gt; Alright. So if X1 is 0, what value would X2 have to be in

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.550
order to break a threshold of three quarters? Well, the weight on X2 is a half.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.130
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.220
&gt;&gt; So then,

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.090
the value of X2 would have to be twice as much

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.780
as the threshold which in this case is one and a half.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.220
&gt;&gt; Right. So we're trying to figure out where is it, if X1 is 0, where

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.730
does X2 need to be so that we're

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.880
exactly at the threshold. So that's going to be.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.750
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.028
&gt;&gt; The X2 times the weight, which is half has to exactly equal the threshold

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:41.885
which is three quarters. So, if we just solve that out, you get X2 equals

00:01:41.885 --> 00:01:45.580
3 halves. So okay that's this point here. That's going to be

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.360
a dividing line. So anywhere above here, what's it going to return?

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.310
&gt;&gt; It will return, it will break the threshold, and so it will return a 1.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.030
&gt;&gt; These are all going to be 1s and

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.225
then below this these are all going to be 0s.

00:01:58.225 --> 00:01:58.780
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.280
&gt;&gt; Alright. Well now we have a very, very skinny

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.140
version of the picture. [LAUGH] Well what else can we do?

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.180
&gt;&gt; Well we can do the same thing that we just did except we can swap

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.787
X2 and X1 because, they have the same weight. So, we could say X2

00:02:10.787 --> 00:02:14.910
equal to 0 and figure out what the value of X1 has to be.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.670
&gt;&gt; Good, and that seems like it would be exactly the same algebra, and so

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.130
we get X1 is 3 halves, gives us at the one and a half point

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.100
above here are going to be 1s and below here are going to be 0s. Okay, so now

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.410
we've got 2 very narrow windows, but what we notice is that the relationships

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.330
are all linear here. So solving this linear inequality gets us a picture like

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.190
this. So this perceptron computes a kind of half plane right? So, so the half of

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.510
the, the plane that's above this line, the half plane thatt's above this line is

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.530
getting us the 1 answers and below that line is giving us a zero answers.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.420
&gt;&gt; So Michael can we generalize from this, so

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.560
you're telling me then that because of the linear relationship

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.490
drawn out by a perceptron that perceptrons are always going to compute lines.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Always going to compute, yeah

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.500
these half planes right. So there's a dividing

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.270
line where you're equal to the threshold and

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.520
that's always going to be a linear function

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.390
and then it's going to be you know, to the right of it or to

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.620
the left of it, above it or below it but its always halves at that point.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.172
&gt;&gt; Okay, so perception is a linear function, and it computes hyperplanes.

00:03:22.172 --> 00:03:23.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah, which maybe in

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.500
some sense it doesn't seem that interesting, but it turns out we're

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.490
already in a position to compute something fascinating. So let's do a quiz.
