00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.792
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now that we've rewritten this as a compound inequality, we know how to solve

00:00:03.792 --> 00:00:07.489
for x. So please isolate x by doing the same thing to all three sections at

00:00:07.489 --> 00:00:11.387
once. Then write your answer in these three boxes. I have been really nice, and

00:00:11.387 --> 00:00:15.155
I've already filled in your inequality signs for you. So you just have to fill

00:00:15.155 --> 00:00:17.294
in the quantities that go in between them.
