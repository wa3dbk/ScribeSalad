00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And the answer, of course, is:

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Fetching documents are good with GET requests,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and requests that can be cached.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
GET requests are often cached--

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
not always--you can control that with headers but, generally, yes.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
For updating data on the Server, a POST request is more appropriate.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Likewise, sending a lot of data to the Server--

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
a POST request is also more appropriate

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
because, of course, the amount of data

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
you can send in a GET request is limited.
