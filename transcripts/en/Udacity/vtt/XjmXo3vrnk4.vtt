00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.160
The connection between common-sense reasoning and human cognition is both very

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.880
strong and not yet fully understood. Let us suppose that I were to

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.800
ask you to go find the weather outside. You would not jump out of the window.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.450
Why not? You would use common sense reasoning to know that jumping out of

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.610
the window to find the weather is not a good idea. But what is it

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.620
that tells you not to jump out of the window? You use the notion of goals.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.170
The notion of context to decide what not to do and what to do.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.800
We use similar notion of context in order to do natural language understanding.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.749
We could use context to disambiguate between various meanings of take.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.370
Can we context also to decide on what would be a good source of plan. So

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.310
far we have been talking about common sense inferences about physical actions,

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.010
what about the social world? You and I also make common sense inferences about

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.700
the social world around us. One possibility is that you and

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.340
I have a flurry of mind, this is actually called the flurry of mind theory.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.450
You and I as cognitive agents, ascribe goals, beliefs, desires to each other.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.010
And it's the theory of mind that allows us to make inferences about each other,

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.540
including common sensical inferences.
