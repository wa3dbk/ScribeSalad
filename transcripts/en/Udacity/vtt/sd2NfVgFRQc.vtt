00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360
Alice is facing the issue that her simple algorithm while it's correct

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.940
does not show an acceptable running time so we should probably say a little bit more as to

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.100
what we would consider an acceptable running time, like here

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.960
and what we would consider an unacceptable running time.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.630
And in theoretical computer science or at least for the first units of this course,

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.820
we're just making a distinction between two cases basically.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.040
The first case here is polynomial running time.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.980
And polynomial running time means that the algorithm has a running time that can be stated as

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.090
some polynomial of the size of the input.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.850
So, polynomial time would be an algorithm that has a running time of O(n), O(n²),

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:48.849
but even with an algorithm with a running time such as O(n¹⁰) or worse

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:51.810
would be considered a polynomial time algorithm

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.930
and we would say that the running time of this algorithm is more less acceptable.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.820
Now, exponential running time, those are algorithms that have n in the exponent of their running time.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.780
So, O(2ⁿ) would be an algorithm that's exponential running time.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.000
O(1.1ⁿ) would be an algorithm with exponential running time

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.710
and also something really bad such as O(10ⁿ) that would also be an exponential running time.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:28.800
What about an algorithm such as O(3ⁿ&lt;i&gt;n²), that would also be called exponential running time&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.590
because as you saw in previous quizzes, the 3ⁿ is the fastest growing term here.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.930
So, the dominant term here is an exponential term.

00:01:37.930 --> 99:59:59.000
So, running times like this would also fall under exponential running time.
