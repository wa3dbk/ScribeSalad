00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.950
The key claim in the analysis of the
scaling algorithm is that the maximum

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.840
number of iterations for a scaling phase
is at most twice the number of edges.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.090
By scaling phase, I mean
an iteration of the outer loop here

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.250
where we have a fixed value of delta.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.550
We start with the following lemma.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.860
If the residual graph,
with threshold delta, has no s-t paths,

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.410
then there exists an s-t cut, A, B,
such that the capacity of the cut

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.619
is at most the value of the flow, plus
the number of edges times delta minus 1.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.490
The proof will fill up like
the max flow min cut proof.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:42.440
We let A be the center of vertices
reachable from s in our residual graph.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.720
And we let B be the complement
of those set of vertices.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.950
Edges from A to B in this graph
must have residual capacity

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.330
at most delta minus 1,
otherwise the vertex in

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.580
B would be reachable from
the source s and hence a part of A.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.030
And edges from B to A can't have
flow more than delta minus 1,

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.720
or their reverse edge would
appear in the residual graph.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.310
The value of the flow then is the flow
out of A minus the flow back into A.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.760
And using these bounds here we can
bound this by the capacity minus

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.530
delta minus 1.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.900
And similarly for

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.520
these back edges, we can do that
with the delta minus 1 bound.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.790
This then is just the capacity of
the cut, and combining the delta minus 1

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.150
terms, well that can only appear
in E number of terms here.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.062
So that gives us the remaining
part of the bound.

00:01:41.062 --> 00:01:44.850
With this lemma complete, we now return
to the main claim that we want to prove.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.970
The base case where delta
is equal to C is trivial.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.000
Since each augmenting flow
here saturates one of the edge

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.740
out of the source.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.460
For subsequent iterations we let f be
the flow after the scaling phase delta,

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.820
and we'll let g be the flow before.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.875
That is, the flow after the previous
scaling, which would be either 2 delta,

00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:11.662
or 2 delta + 1, depending on how
the integer division rounding worked.

00:02:11.662 --> 00:02:15.800
The value of the flow f is at
most the maximum flow, but

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.500
this is at most the capacity of
the s-t cut induced by the flow g,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.232
in the previous iteration, or
the threshold was two delta.

00:02:25.232 --> 00:02:27.330
Our lemma then says,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.850
that this is at most, the flow of g,
plus the number of edges, times 2 delta.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.000
Now we let k be
the number of iterations,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.868
that we use to go between the flow g,
and the flow f.

00:02:37.868 --> 00:02:41.850
Well then k times delta is a lower bound

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.320
on the difference between the value of
the flow f and the value of the flow g.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.310
Each iteration increased
the flow by at least delta.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.310
But from this bound here we have that

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.180
this is at most twice the number
of edges times delta.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.180
And so from this then we conclude
that the number of iterations

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.570
is at most twice the number of edges.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.770
This then completes the analysis
of the scaling algorithm.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.160
We have at most log C iterations at
the outer loop, order E iterations

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.880
of the inner loop, and each one of
these iterations takes order E time.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.450
For a total of E squared log C
as we state in this theorem.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.740
The scaling algorithm returns a maximum
flow in time order e squared log c,

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.350
where c is the maximum capacity of
an edge coming out of the source.
