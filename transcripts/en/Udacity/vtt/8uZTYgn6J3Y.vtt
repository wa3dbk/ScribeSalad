00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.910
This completes our lesson on memory systems and if

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.550
you followed along, you now have an advanced understanding

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.029
of how memory systems work. This should make you

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.840
a better programmer and put you in a good

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.390
position to think about some of the complex trade-offs

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.870
involved in CPU scheduling and maintaining cache coherence, especailly

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.370
in the context of shared memory machines where there

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.120
are multiple CPU's. There is always plenty more to learn.
