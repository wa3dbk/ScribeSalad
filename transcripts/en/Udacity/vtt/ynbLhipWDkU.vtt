00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.270
Well, fortunately, there is,

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.560
at least a partial solution to the problem of dealing with complexity in these,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.870
in these systems. I say partial because no matter how nature notation is,

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.160
you'll always going to be confronted with systems that are more complex than it

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.950
can deal with. However, state charts, as developed by David Harel. Okay.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.450
Our way of coping with this in, in a fa, in a fashion that allows you to

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.530
do the modeling of the system in a way that help you get an understanding of it.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:37.609
He calls these his improvements to state transition diagrams, state charts.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:45.735
And they provide, several mechanisms for, dealing with the, with the complexity.

00:00:45.735 --> 00:00:51.810
'Kay, and we'll be looking at those. State charts are a part of UML. Okay.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:58.250
Tools support them, and, we will be, looking into them in a subsequent.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.710
Lesson and giving you a chance to use them yourself.
