00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.517
We should multiply both sides by 10. I know I should multiply by 10 because I

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.952
have 5 and 8 10ths and 2 and 1 10th. Tenth is the smallest place value I have.

00:00:09.055 --> 00:00:13.626
And I know multiplying by 10 moves the decimal one place to the right. So that

00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:15.178
will clear those decimals.
