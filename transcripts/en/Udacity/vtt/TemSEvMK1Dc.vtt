00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.200
Okay, so it's now time to
build your first prototype.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.900
Choose one of the methods we talked
about in the last video, and

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.300
build out the prototype for
our to do list app.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.620
You can find the mocks for that app in
the instruction notes below the video.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.470
Remember that this prototype
doesn't need to look good.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.940
You want to be giving a general sense
of what's going on with the app, but

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.710
you don't need a final or
beautiful design yet.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.450
You'll want to end with each screen on
paper somehow, as well as a list on

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.900
a separate piece of paper of which
button leads to which screen.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.255
Check this box [SOUND] when you're done.
