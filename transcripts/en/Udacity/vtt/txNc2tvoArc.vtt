00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You wrote 1. Tadah! All right! So, I hope that worked.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
If that worked, let's see if we can figure out how. So what we're really looking at here is a graph.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Even though I had you write your initials, it's just some arbitrary graph that's written in the plane

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and we know that it's written in the plane because whenever 2 edges cross each other

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
we've marked that as a node so that technically the edges don't cross each other any more.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And then we use Euler's formula, which says that the number of nodes minus the number of edges

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
plus the number of regions equals 2.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
But you'll notice that I kind of defined region differently in this trick.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
In Euler's formula, the number of region includes the giant region outside.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
But here I was just capturing the close regions and so that's why it's 1 instead of 2.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So this should always work.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
One of the things that could go wrong is if your initial somehow just have a loop by itself.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So I'm not exactly sure what happens in that case,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
but I think that we'd end up getting one additional segment and one additional region.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So as long as you count this as one segment, I think it's okay.
