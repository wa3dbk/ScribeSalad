00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.800
For our animation we could use the Javascript native function setTimeout,

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.410
which simply runs a function after a specified number of milliseconds.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.430
Even better for our use case we will use the function setInterval,

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:21.150
which can be thought of setTimeout's sister, which function in the same way and

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.750
runs a function after a specified number of milliseconds.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.800
But in setInterval's case, it repeatedly runs that function.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.978
For our case, this is exactly what we want to do to run our update function,

00:00:32.978 --> 00:00:36.820
repeatedly, once for every year of the World Cup.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.750
And to know what years to loop over, we're going to use an array,

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.050
that stores all the years of the World Cup, and to populate this array,

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.889
I'm just going to loop through the years, between 1930 and 2015.
