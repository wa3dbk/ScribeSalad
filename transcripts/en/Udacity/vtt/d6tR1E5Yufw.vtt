00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.225
Each of the three solutions here that we're looking for is the x-coordinate of

00:00:05.237 --> 00:00:10.350
the proper line at the point where the y-coordinate is equal to 400. So, we're

00:00:10.362 --> 00:00:15.807
looking for where each of these lines intersects the line y equals 400. For line

00:00:15.818 --> 00:00:21.369
number one, this happens right here, at 30 gallons. Brand 2 and brand 3 actually

00:00:21.381 --> 00:00:26.171
both intersect our lovely green line at the same point. So, all three of these

00:00:26.183 --> 00:00:31.261
lines the orange, light blue, and the green, meet at whatever this point is. We

00:00:31.273 --> 00:00:36.378
know that the y-coordinate is 400 and the x-coordinate is, if you look down at

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.411
the x-axis, 25. Taking into account how many gallons of solution each of these

00:00:41.423 --> 00:00:46.156
brands can give us for $400, it looks like now, brand 1 is actually the best

00:00:46.168 --> 00:00:51.045
deal. So, turns out that it's a bit trickier to choose which brand is the best

00:00:51.057 --> 00:00:56.078
to go with then Grant might have thought earlier. As you can see from our graph,

00:00:56.102 --> 00:01:00.390
the brand that's going to help him use his money most efficiently is going to be

00:01:00.402 --> 00:01:04.485
different depending on how much money he wants to spend. No matter how much

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:09.035
money that Grant decided to spend on cleaning solution, this graph is definitely

00:01:09.047 --> 00:01:11.975
going to come in handy to help him make the best choice.
