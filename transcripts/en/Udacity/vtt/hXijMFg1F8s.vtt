00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
So you've been watching the game for awhile and then suddenly the person who is playing that game

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.990
announces, "Last round!"

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.710
So this is the last chance for you to play the game.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.420
And the odds already looked pretty good and also the last 40 times that you checked

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.079
actually nobody lost.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.590
What would be the factors you would have to take into account to determine

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.010
if and how much to bet in this last round?

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.400
Now of course this is a rather subjective quiz, but I think we should agree more or less.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.850
So I will give you four opinions that you could have,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.570
and I also think that more than one of them are valid.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.440
So the first opinion could be certainly because the odds are fantastic.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:47.270
You get 30% back if you throw a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. So that will give you 30% profit.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:55.620
And in the last 40 throws, no 6 was thrown and the probability for that is smaller than 0.1%.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.930
Or maybe your opinion is, well, you can play a little.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.250
You know your chances of winning 30%. That's fine.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.680
But you should be ready to lose what you're betting here.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.540
The third option could be that it kind of depends on your risk affinity.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.090
So if you're ready to play a riskier game, you might want to bet a little bit more

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.000
or stay out of the game altogether.

00:01:15.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And finally, one opinion could be well better not because it does seem a little bit suspicious.
