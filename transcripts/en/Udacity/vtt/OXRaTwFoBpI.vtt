00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.270
Smoking cigarettes is one way in which some people reduce stress. And it may be

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.735
the case because the active ingredient in cigarettes, nicotine, actually

00:00:08.735 --> 00:00:14.176
relaxes skelatal muscles. This is why people say smoking relaxes them. However,

00:00:14.176 --> 00:00:19.152
we also know that nicotine activates the sympathetic nervous system. This

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:23.272
causes increase in heart rate and blood pressure. And, you recall, that this is

00:00:23.272 --> 00:00:27.678
not good for extended period of time. As you recall from our lesson on

00:00:27.678 --> 00:00:31.390
consciousness and drugs, many people use alcohol as a way to self medicate or

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.374
to reduce their stress. Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant and it

00:00:37.374 --> 00:00:42.548
actually causes relaxation in the short run. However, long term use of alcohol

00:00:42.548 --> 00:00:46.076
can result in a variety of negative effects, including damage to the heart,

00:00:46.076 --> 00:00:49.324
cirrhosis of the liver, negative effects on the brain, in addition to

00:00:49.324 --> 00:00:54.110
physiological, as well as psychological dependence.
