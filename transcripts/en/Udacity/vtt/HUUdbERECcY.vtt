00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Only the second one is true.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's go through each one to see why it's true or false.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
OFB doesn't provide any stronger tamper protection than CFB does,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and both of them don't provide very much tamper protection at all.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
To see this, it's quite easy for an attacker

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to mess with a byte of C1, and that will directly effect

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
bytes in the message.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This is similar to a way an attacker could tamper with a message in a one-time pad.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
With output feedback mode, it is possible to recover most of an encrypted file

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
if one cipher block is lost.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We can see this because in the decrypt process,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
we need to calculate this input into the XOR,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and that can be calculated without knowledge of C1, C2, C3,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
or any of the other cipher messages.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Even if we're missing a cipher text block,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
the rest of the MIs can be XORed with the remaining cipher text blocks.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Ends are calculated inputs to find our message block.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Likewise, this shows that output feedback mode

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
won't make a good cryptographic hash function.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
A cryptographic hash function must have the property

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
that the final output depends on all the blocks in the message.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
In output feedback mode, the cipher block text does not

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
depend on previous parts of the message.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
For example, C2 does not depend on message 1.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And this shows that we can easily change a block

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and calculate to the same final output.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
For the 4th option, no, it is not safe to use 0 vector as the initialization vector.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
As with cipher feedback mode and cipher block chaining,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
the initialization vector is important to prevent an attacker

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
from deriving repetition in the messages.

00:01:32.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Always using the 0 initialization vector leaves output feedback mode vulnerable to this attack.
