00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For this quiz, I'm going to list some properties, and you should check the box

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
for the ones that are true for the given operation mode.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So which modes require that E--the encrypt function that we've been using in the black box--

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
is invertible?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Check this box if Cipher Block Chaining mode requires this,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and check this box if Cipher Feedback Mode requires this.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Which of them require the Initialization Vector to be kept secret?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Can use small message blocks?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Which can provide strong protection against tampering,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
so Alice would be able to know if someone had changed values of parts of her file?

00:00:37.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And the final one--that the final cipher text depends on all of the blocks in the message.
