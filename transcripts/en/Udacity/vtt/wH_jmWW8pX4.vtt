00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.110
Let's begin with network communications.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.920
Obviously, if you have a distributed application the pieces of

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.080
the application have to be connected together over some kind of network.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.430
Some of the issues that arise in dealing with applications that

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.110
are split across a network are how are errors handled.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.390
And there a variety of different kinds of errors that might arise.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.720
There are synchronous errors.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.950
That is, when a particular request is made, and

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.070
part of a system awaits a response.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.250
Or asynchronous errors.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.090
That is spontaneous issuing of some kind of

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.260
notification that the rest of the system has to respond to.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.750
Primary concern here is reliable delivery of these messages,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.700
particularly the error messages.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.160
If the network itself is unreliable, various strategies such as delivering more

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.950
than once can be employed, but then again, you don't want to have more than one

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.290
actual copy of a message received and, and acted upon.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.720
And communicating across the network,

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.140
another issue relates to how the data is represented.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.370
It may well be the case,

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.510
because we're in a heterogeneous situation, that the different machine and

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.940
the different machines represent data in different ways.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.079
And then third is the whole question of transaction.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.020
If there's a database involved, it may well be the case

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.381
that of the multiple users which might be using the application, one user

00:01:33.381 --> 00:01:38.270
is updating the database at the same time another user is reading the database.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.720
And there's the potential for the receipt of information that is not up

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.870
to date with respect to the, the database.
