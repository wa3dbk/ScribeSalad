00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
One of the really interesting developments about this class

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is this whole customer development process.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It says you start with your business model canvas hypotheses,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and in fact, what you really do is you blow up the canvas,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and you actually post it to the wall, and you use yellow stickies,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
no pens or pencils allowed, because you are going to get most of them wrong.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
But you're going to make it visible, and you will actually begin

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
to construct your hypotheses, and the next thing you'll do

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
is look at them and go "Hey, there aren't any facts in this room."

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
"Let's get out of the building and talk to customers and partners, inventors,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and we'll learn how to do this with some rigor, with a process."

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Not just randomly getting out, but actually design experiments,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
run tests, get data, and more importantly, get some insight,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and the customer development process is kind of interesting.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The customer development process is actually

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
a 4-step process.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The first step is customer discovery.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
This is where you construct your hypotheses,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and you get out of the building and start testing your assumption

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
about whether other people have the same problem or need you think they have.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And then you're going to do customer validation and actually see

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
if your proposed solution actually matches

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
what you think the customer problem was.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
This test between problem and solution and your features and customers

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
is actually sometimes called product market fit.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
That's what you're out testing, and this is what we call

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
the search for the business model.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
But now instead of randomly doing this by hiring and firing sales execs

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and trying to make numbers that really are just random guesses

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
we're actually going to have you get out as early as possible

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and test some of these primary assumptions.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
One of the interesting things on the bottom of this diagram

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
that we'll talk about is something called a pivot,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and the pivot is what will save your job.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Once you find this repeatable and scalable business model

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
then you go into the execution phase of customer development,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and that's about creating end user demand and scale

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
called customer creation and then building the organizations

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
to actually build your company for scale

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
by transitioning from customer development into a functional organization

00:02:14.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that's oriented for constant and rapid execution.
