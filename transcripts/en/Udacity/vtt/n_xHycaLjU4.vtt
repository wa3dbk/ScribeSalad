00:00:00.084 --> 00:00:01.776
So this kind of suggests that

00:00:01.943 --> 00:00:04.501
as the temperature gets warmer,

00:00:05.346 --> 00:00:07.318
the chances of failure go up,

00:00:07.625 --> 00:00:09.486
because b is a positive slope.

00:00:09.524 --> 00:00:11.635
So you had all reasons to believe that a cold

00:00:11.635 --> 00:00:13.903
temperature is actually good for the space shuttle

00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.131
and we should launch.

00:00:15.316 --> 00:00:16.499
Let’s just for kicks,

00:00:16.721 --> 00:00:19.325
compute the actual expected number

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:20.954
of O-ring failures

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.033
or the Yis for the temperature of 36 degrees.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.525
And here’s the formula,

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:27.911
it’s 36 times b plus a

00:00:28.573 --> 00:00:31.000
What is that?
