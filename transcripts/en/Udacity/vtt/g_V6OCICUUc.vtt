00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.274
Let's go through each of these options. Let's say you had just three data

00:00:04.274 --> 00:00:08.798
values. We'd find the distance between this and this. And then, we'd find the

00:00:08.798 --> 00:00:13.347
distance between this and this. And then, we'd find the distance between this

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:17.638
and this, and the distance between this one and this one. And finally, the

00:00:17.638 --> 00:00:23.030
distance between this one and this one. The distance between this one and this

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.630
one. So we've calculated 6 distances. Now, imagine if we were to add another

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.429
data set. Then, we would calculate 6 more distances. The distance between this

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:40.084
and this, this and this, and those two, and then the distance from this point to

00:00:40.084 --> 00:00:45.226
all the others. Now imagine if we had 1,000 data values, which is very typical

00:00:45.226 --> 00:00:49.934
for a data set. This one just isn't feasible. There are way too many things to

00:00:49.934 --> 00:00:54.525
calculate. Okay, so what if we found the average distance between each data

00:00:54.525 --> 00:00:59.102
value and neither of them max or the min? If we add four data values and we

00:00:59.102 --> 00:01:04.208
chose the min, we would only have to find three distances. Well, I guess four

00:01:04.208 --> 00:01:09.288
actually including the min itself. But, what if we had an outlier? What if we

00:01:09.288 --> 00:01:14.148
had a value all the way out here or even further? Then, the distance of each

00:01:14.148 --> 00:01:19.383
from the outlier would be really far. And it wouldn't matter how closely grouped

00:01:19.383 --> 00:01:24.007
these were. One outlier would cause a huge variability. So, this one doesn't

00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:28.696
work either. However, the mean is a really good reference point because it's in

00:01:28.696 --> 00:01:33.163
the middle of the data. And the mean takes every data value into account. So

00:01:33.163 --> 00:01:34.432
this is our best bet.
