00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Evans] We can compute these using the Python interpreter.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You didn't need to submit your code for this. You needed to compute the answers.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And the answers that you should have gotten is that a light bulb,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the latency distance is approximately 300,000 kilometers;

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
for a CPU register, where the latency is less than 0.4 nanoseconds,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the equivalent latency distance is 0.12 meters, about 120 centimeters;

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
for the DRAM, DRAM is much cheaper.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The latency is much higher than a CPU register.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
That corresponds to 3.6 meters of latency distance.
