00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.354
Now, let's discuss the solution for the active

00:00:03.354 --> 00:00:07.050
power quiz. What we had was that to achieve

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.840
some frequency we needed to increase voltage beyond

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.666
some point. And we knew that at 1 volt

00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:15.600
and 2 gigahertz, the power was 30 watts.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.760
So, the question is, what is the power for

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.200
the most power-efficient setting? And, what is the

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.870
power for the highest-performance setting? The most power-efficient setting

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.690
will be the one with lowest frequency and

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.189
the lowest voltage. Why? Because the power, if

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.600
you remember, is equal to something times voltage

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.690
squared times frequency. So, we need to have,

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.300
to reduce power, we need to both lower

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.570
the frequency and reduce voltage. So, most power-efficient

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.938
setting is this one. Relative to this setting,

00:00:47.938 --> 00:00:51.034
the power for the most efficient setting is

00:00:51.034 --> 00:00:56.194
going to be equal to, so this stand for our efficient power, is going to

00:00:56.194 --> 00:01:01.252
be 30 watts times the voltage is now 0.9 of what it was. So,

00:01:01.252 --> 00:01:06.082
it's 0.9 squared times the frequency

00:01:06.082 --> 00:01:11.166
now is 1.8 over 2. So this is, again, 0.9

00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:16.206
of what it was and when we multiply this out we get 21.9

00:01:16.206 --> 00:01:20.545
watts or 22 watts. So, the answer here

00:01:20.545 --> 00:01:24.260
is that the power is 21.9 watts. Now let's

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.470
do the same, but this time for the highest

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.120
performance setting. The highest performance setting is the one

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.860
that gives us the highest frequency. What we have

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.227
now is the power for the performance is going

00:01:35.227 --> 00:01:41.506
to be equal to 30 watts times the voltage is now 1.5 times what it was, so it's

00:01:41.506 --> 00:01:45.419
1.5 squared times, the frequency is 3 instead

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:48.968
of 2 gigahertz, so that has also increased by

00:01:48.968 --> 00:01:55.520
a factor of 1.5 and if you multiply this out we get 101.3 watts. So, as you can

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.555
see, there is a huge difference between the

00:01:57.555 --> 00:02:01.350
most power efficient and the highest performance setting. Although,

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.018
in fact, the difference between these two settings is

00:02:04.018 --> 00:02:07.070
not even a factor of two in performance. Why?

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.149
Well, because power is not only

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.691
proportional to frequency, it's also proportional

00:02:12.691 --> 00:02:17.900
to voltage squared and reusing the frequency allows us to reduce the voltage.
