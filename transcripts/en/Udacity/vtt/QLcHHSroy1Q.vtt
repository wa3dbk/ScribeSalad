00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.545
In problem number one, 3x equals 12. x is not by itself yet because it's being

00:00:04.557 --> 00:00:09.210
multiplied by 3. The thing that undoes multiplication is division. So you need

00:00:09.222 --> 00:00:13.615
to divide by the number we're presently multiplying. So, I'm going to say we

00:00:13.627 --> 00:00:18.055
need to divide this entire side by 3. Now, whatever we do over here, we also

00:00:18.067 --> 00:00:22.975
need to do on the right side. Divide 12 by 3 as well. We know that 3x over 3

00:00:22.987 --> 00:00:28.288
gives us just x, which is why we wanted to divide by 3 in the first place. So

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.701
now, we need to carry it out on the right hand side. 12 over 3 is 4. So we get x

00:00:33.713 --> 00:00:39.071
equals 4. Checking our answer, we have 3 times 4 equals 12, and 3 times 4 does

00:00:39.083 --> 00:00:44.431
in fact equal 12. So we're in good shape. And number two, x is being divided by

00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:49.493
3. In the last problem we undid multiplication with division. So here, we can

00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:54.752
undo division with multiplication. To undo division by 3, we need to multiply by

00:00:54.764 --> 00:00:59.930
that same number 3. You do this to both sides and 12 times 3 is 36. Checking, 36

00:00:59.942 --> 00:01:02.382
over 3 is in fact equal to 12. Awesome.

00:01:02.387 --> 00:01:07.025
Another one done. Last but not least, x minus 3 equals 12. This problem is

00:01:07.037 --> 00:01:11.790
telling us that we're looking for a number so that if we took 3 away from that

00:01:11.802 --> 00:01:16.510
number, we would get 12. That means that number is 3 greater than 12 then. So,

00:01:16.522 --> 00:01:22.323
to undo this subtraction on the left hand side, we need to add 3. And over here,

00:01:22.335 --> 00:01:27.268
we get x equals 15. We will also confirm that 15 minus 3 equals 12. Great.
