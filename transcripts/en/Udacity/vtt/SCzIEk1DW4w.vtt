00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.819
Now that you've seen some of the quirks of

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:04.240
math and Java, and why they happen, it's time to

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.780
practice writing your own Java expressions for math calculations.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.850
We started a class for you that has a method

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.410
for each of these expressions. Can you fill in

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.780
the Java code for each of the methods? There's a

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.480
test program you can run to test your work

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.470
as you go, because these are a little bit tricky.
