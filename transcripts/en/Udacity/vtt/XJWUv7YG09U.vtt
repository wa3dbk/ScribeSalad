Ember is an advanced
framework built by Yehuda Katz and

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.920
others who are pushing the boundaries
of the JavaScript language.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.830
So Ember makes use of JavaScript
language features that sometimes haven't

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.460
been standardized yet.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.665
When building Ember apps it's important
to know how to use JavaScript promises

00:00:14.665 --> 00:00:18.130
which makes it easy to write and
manage asynchronous code.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.595
ES6 modules, some files in an Ember app
are included into other files using

00:00:22.595 --> 00:00:24.735
modules and imports.

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:25.893
And ES6 Syntax.

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:29.870
Features like arrow functions,
destructuring, and template strings.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:30.800
But don't worry,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.560
this isn't too important because we can
write everything using standard ES5.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.150
We have a course on promises, so check
that out if you have any questions.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.820
Links to these topics are in
the instructor notes.
