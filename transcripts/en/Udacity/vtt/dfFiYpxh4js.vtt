00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.630
Okay, we're going to go back to our editor and add an

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:06.570
extra little feature here. Okay, so we're got our first input, type

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.910
equals text. I'm going to add a new input that we may not

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.490
have dealt with before called type equals hidden. And this is a

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.130
sneaky way of including values when you submit your form that

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.830
the user can't actually see. Sometimes when you submit a form you

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.530
actually want to have more information then what the user's just given

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.880
you. That's what type hidden is for. I'm going to give it name,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.310
food and I'm going to give it value X. Okay,

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.490
back to the browser. I've refreshed our browser and

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.260
reloaded that new page. Now, I'm going to enter in

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.720
steak here again. And time for another quick quiz. What

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.430
happens when I click add here? What happens when

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.470
I submit the form, that has a hidden input

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.800
in it already? Do we see one value in

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.880
the URL with what we just submitted? Do we see

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.520
two values in the URL? The one we just submitted and the

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.340
hard coded value. In this case, the hard coded value, what I

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.440
mean by that is. The word eggs that we put in that

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.269
hidden input that was in our code. Or does the browser error?
