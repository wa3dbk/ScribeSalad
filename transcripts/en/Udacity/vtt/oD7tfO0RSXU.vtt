00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.190
There's many red flags that can come
up during the interview process but

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.180
I think there isn't a magic formula.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.980
I think it really comes with
experience of the founders.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.980
The one thing I will say is that
it's okay to take risks and hire

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.760
individuals that you are uncertain of
but make sure to fire quickly, as well.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.640
Because if it doesn't work,
it's not just bad for the business,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.450
it's actually bad for
the employee that you hired, as well.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.940
If there are red flags, clearly,
you don't want to hire.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.790
But if you are unsure and there's
sparks that you see in the employee,

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.920
you might consider giving them a chance.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.910
Especially, if you feel like they can
really push your startup forward.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.690
One thing that I have seen entrepreneurs
do well is have the employee

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.960
tell the story of the startup
that they're applying to.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.390
What is it about
the startup that they like?

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.000
What are the things they look for in
the next opportunity that they're doing?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.890
Usually red flags come up when they
don't really understand the business or

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.040
don't really identify or have different
motivations to join the startup

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.330
then what the founders
expect them to have.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.260
For example, they're looking for
a job that's close to their home.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.713
Perhaps but
usually that leads to misalignments

00:01:22.713 --> 00:01:27.070
later on and of expectations later on.
