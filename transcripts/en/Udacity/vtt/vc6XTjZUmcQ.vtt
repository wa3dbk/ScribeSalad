00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.430
We're going to be going back and
forth between the Objective C and

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.390
the Swift versions of GIF maker.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.680
So go ahead and
open up both projects in Xcode.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.960
Here we are in the Objective C project.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.960
And we want to see how
the video camera is presented.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.140
So let's say I didn't know
anything about this project.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.320
But I do know that the UI
image picker controller

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.280
is what presents the video camera.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.900
I could go over here on the left and
search image picker controller, and

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.120
I could find out where the code
to present the camera is.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.040
And here you can see it's in this file
called UI view controller plus record.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.860
It turns out,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.750
we need to present the video camera
from two different UI view controllers.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.380
So the code to present the image picker
controller is in this UI view controller

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.779
record category.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.980
Okay.
So present video options.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.610
That seems promising.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.000
Let's check out this method.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.370
Action sheet record video.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.680
That looks like what we're looking for.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.720
Now this record video
action calls launch camera.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.010
Let's take a look at
the launch camera method.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.390
Okay, here's where the image picker
controller is being created.
