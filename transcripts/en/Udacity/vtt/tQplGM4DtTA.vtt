00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
These are the first six triangular number,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and they're formed by taking the position and summing all the numbers from 1 up to the position.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
For the first number we have 1. For the second number we have 2.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Note that unlike Python we're indexing from 1.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000
N equals 3. The third number is formed by summing 1 + 2 + 3, which is 6.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The fourth number is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4, which is 10.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Now, how are we going to get these numbers--1 to 4--here to sum?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Well, Python has a nice way of doing that, and that's using range.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Now, we want the numbers to start at 1, and we want them to finish at 4.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Now, the way range works is I take the first input and starts there,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and it finishes at 1 less than the last input.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
In order to get 4, we're going to have to take the range from 1 to 5.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
When we come to write our procedure, we're going to use and instead of for.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
That means that our range will have to be from 1 up to n + 1.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Now we're ready to write the procedure.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The procedure name is "triangular," and it takes an input, which is a positive integer n.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
We want to output or return a number--the nth triangular number.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I'm just going to call it "number."

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
We want to loop through all the numbers 1 up to n in the range.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Don't forget the +1 there to make sure we go up to n.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
We're just going to add each of the values i as we come to it in the loop.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Then when we're done we're going to return the number.
