00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now, Python being Python actually gives lots of different ways of writing something this simple,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and some of them are very very distinct so here's a more distinct way of writing the same thing.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We can do is in one command sum up all the elements and divided by the length,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and we've now computed the same thing twice.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What do you suppose the running time is of the second statement here?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It's just one little arithmetic statement. It seems like it should be Θ(1), but it's not.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You have to keep in mind that this some command here is actually just shorthand for a loop like this.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It really is running overall the elements in the list internally.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Even though it looks like Θ(1), there's still a Θ(1) of the length of this list, your Θ(n).

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This is one of the things that is different between the language like Python and say a language like C.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
C basically doesn't allow you to hide running time in the individual statements.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
All the C statements run pretty much constant time.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Whereas in Python, so that you can write more complicated programs in a nice distinct way,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
they do give you the shortcuts, but you have to be really careful

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that you know what the running time is with all the little primitive functions

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
before you try to actually measure the performance and predict how fast your algorithm is going to run.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
This can really bite so you have to be careful.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The extremals of a list are the extreme values, the max and the mean,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
which is a kind of cooler way to say it, the extremals, the X Games,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
but it's actually an awful lot like mean.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
What I would like you to do is actually modify the mean algorithm that we had

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
to actually compute the max of a list.
