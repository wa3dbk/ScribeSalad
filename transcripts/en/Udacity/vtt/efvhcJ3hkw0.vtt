00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.890
So now we'll have a couple quizzes to see that you

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.110
understand how to index subsequences from strings. So your goal for

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.020
this quiz is to write Python code that will print out

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.040
Udacity with an upper case U, given that we've already defined

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.930
the variable S to have the value, the string audacity. And

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.110
we want you to do this in a way that uses

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.630
the string indexing operators up. It wouldn't be a good way

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.270
to solve this by just printing out Udacity with an upper case

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.670
U as a string. But see if you can find a way to write Python code that uses

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.690
s and has as little extra code as possible

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.780
but prints out the string Udacity starting from s.
