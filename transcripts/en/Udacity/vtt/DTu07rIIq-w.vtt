Hi kids. Welcome back. Here's what we're going to do. Step one, we're actually

00:00:03.648 --> 00:00:07.070
going to analyze the file name itself and determine what file type it is by

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.939
looking at the extension of the file name. This function is going to return an

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:15.730
integer, which represents what type of file it is. For our purposes, we've

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.122
defined that 0 should be an image, and type 1 should be a JavaScript file. Now,

00:00:20.122 --> 00:00:23.840
as you can see, loading a JavaScript file is very similar to loading an image.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.848
We actually create the object, we set a callback, and then we actually set its

00:00:26.848 --> 00:00:30.136
source. Now, there's a couple other things we have to do because we're

00:00:30.136 --> 00:00:32.716
injecting script into the DOM, like setting its attribute type and then

00:00:32.716 --> 00:00:36.824
actually appending it to the DOM. But other than those two things, it's pretty

00:00:36.824 --> 00:00:40.614
similar. The real magic comes down here at the bottom, when we actually analyze

00:00:40.614 --> 00:00:45.220
the file name to determine what type it is. So, for example, if it has a .jpg,

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.170
we assume it's an image, versus a .js, which we assume is then JavaScript.
