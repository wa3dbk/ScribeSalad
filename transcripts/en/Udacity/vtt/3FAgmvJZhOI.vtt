00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.800
There are two memory technologies,
SRAM and DRAM.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.790
SRAM stands for
Static Random Access Memory.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.560
DRAM stands for
Dynamic Random Access Memory.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.450
The random access part in both names

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.060
simply refers to the fact that we
can access any memory location

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.370
by address without needing to go
through all the memory locations.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.370
So random access is as opposed to
sequential access like a tape,

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.730
where you have to actually scan through
the whole tape to get somewhere.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.240
With memory, we can arbitrarily
access any part of the memory

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.050
without really needing to get to it.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.630
So the only difference between SRAM and
DRAM is this static or dynamic behavior.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.480
Static, in this realm,
refers to the fact that SRAM

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.310
retains its data while the power is
supplied, so as long as you connect it

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.320
to a power source, it's going to
retain the data that you wrote to it.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.488
It's not going to lose it.

00:00:59.488 --> 00:01:04.640
Dynamic, in DRAM,
means that it will lose data,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.280
even while connected to a power source,
unless we refresh the data.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.720
So, pretty much, we need to read out
the data and write it back in, and

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.090
keep doing that on a regular basis,
otherwise,

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.770
DRAM will simply lose our data.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.880
Note that both of these types
of memory will lose data

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.210
when the power is not supplied,
such as when we turn them off.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.420
So it seems like SRAM is better.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.440
We like it, because we don't
have to do anything in order for

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.330
it to keep the data, whereas with DRAM,
we actually have to access the data and

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.200
write it back in in order for
it to not lose it.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.820
So why do we want to have DRAM?

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.950
The answer is that for SRAM,
several transistors are needed for

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.540
each bit of SRAM, whereas for DRAM,
we only need one transistor per bit.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.110
So obviously we can get a lot more
DRAM per unit area, than we can SRAM.

00:01:58.228 --> 00:02:03.520
So SRAM is good because it retains data,
but bad because it's more expensive.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.350
Here we have to refresh
the data to keep it alive, but

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.880
we can cram a lot of
these bits on a chip.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.630
It turns out there is
another difference,

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.820
which is SRAM is typically faster and
DRAM is typically slower.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.980
So we get speed, and
simplicity, at more cost.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.450
Or, we can go slower and
need to work at it, but have more bits.
