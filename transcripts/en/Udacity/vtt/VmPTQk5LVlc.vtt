00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now the last interesting thing that's a holdover from thinking about startups

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
as smaller versions of large companies is kind of the hardest to get your height around.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And that's large companies, they got VP of sales, what we need of VP of sales on day 1.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Large companies, they have had some marketing. I need to have a market.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In large companies, they have bus dev and all those external organizations. We need those too.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Without ever thinking about what's the point?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Why is it that we want to duplicate these same organizations?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Cause if you're a founder like I was, boy, you really want someday to see

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
you on top and look at all these nice silos working for me.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Isn't this great and look, they're all doing their jobs, etc.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I have to tell you if this is your vision on day 1, you're already out of business.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Cause we now know that functional organizations actually are the wrong way

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
to set up sales marketing and bus dev on day 1.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
What we now know is that the founders need to run what's called the customer development team.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And a customer development team says,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
"Listen, we're not going to have sales marketing and bus dev on day 1.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We're not going to hire a VP of sales on day 1.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We're actually going to have the founder get out of the building."

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And later in this lecture, we'll explain why.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
It's a really big idea to understand for organization, you need the founders spending at least

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
20% of their time outside the building, understanding customer's problems and needs,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and figuring out how that matches with the features at your building

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
before you start organizing in functional organizations and silos.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Well, the thing I mention which I'll expand on later in this course

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
is that one of the mistakes that we've also made for decades is confusing the titles,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
sales marketing and bus dev with the job specifications.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It turns out that the title "VP of Sales" has a very different job spec in a large company

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
that it does on a startup of VP and marketing does very different things

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
in a large company than they do on a startup and for years,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
we could never explain why is it that incredibly competent executives

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
who have been executing business models in large corporations collapse

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
in startups when they're company is smaller than their administrative staff in their large corporation.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000
It turns out that job specification, what we do day to day has nothing similar.
