00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.770
Wome of you might be saying for any real computer, the halting problem is decidable

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.190
using the following argument.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.030
So you're given a program and you're given an input and you put it into the following algorithm.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.820
You start out by stimulating step one of the program.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.880
So again use the stimulation here just as in previous units. So you simulate step one.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.220
If the program terminates at that step then we output "Yes."

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.040
And else, we record a snapshot of the machine-of the simulated machine, of course.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.090
And what I mean by snapshot is something you might remember

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.240
from the NP completeness proof of SAT.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.880
A snapshot is a complete picture of the memory of the machine

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.330
as well as the line where the program is currently at.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.420
And the reason why this algorithm is doing it is it's using one property of an infinite loop

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.290
and that is if a machine goes into an infinite loop then snapshots at some point in time must repeat.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.850
So the third step of the algorithm is it takes that snapshot that had just recorded

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.160
and compares it against all previous snapshots of the machine.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.770
And if it finds just one duplicate, it knows the machine has been exactly at that place before,

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.970
which means it would also return to that place an infinite number of times.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.990
In that case, the halting algorithm or at least this algorithm here,

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.790
which is supposed to solve the halting problem with output "No."

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.990
And then the algorithm would simulate the next step of the program and go to step number two.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.750
This algorithm would be guaranteed to terminate at a certain point in time

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.970
either if the program itself terminates or the simulation of the program indicates that it terminates

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.240
or if the program goes into an infinite loop.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.480
Here is important that we have a real computer because if we have a real computer,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.180
we do not have infinite memory.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.880
So if we do not have infinite memory and the program goes into an infinite loop

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.450
then at a certain point in time we must have a repeating snapshot.

00:01:43.450 --> 99:59:59.000
Now, if we had infinite memory that would not be the case.
