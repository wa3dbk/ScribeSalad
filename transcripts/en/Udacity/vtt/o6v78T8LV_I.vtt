00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.360
Now let us look at examples that are even more interesting than previously.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.390
Recall that earlier we were talking about background knowledge.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.240
Let's see what role background knowledge plays more explicitly. So

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.400
imagine this is the fourth example that the teacher gives to the AI program, and

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.820
this is a positive example. So the AI program may have this as the input

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.830
representation. There are two bricks, this brick is left of the other brick,

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.810
there's a wedge on top, the two bricks are supporting the wedge. So now the AI

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.400
program has this as the current definition, recall the not touches links here,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.470
and this is the new example. And this is the positive example. How may the AI

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.590
program revise its current concept definition to include this positive example?

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.050
Well the simplest in the AI program I do is to replace this brick here,

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.420
in the current concept definition by brick or wedge. So

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.380
that makes sure that a new example is included in the definition of the concept.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.560
We'll call this the enlarge-set heuristic. This particular set here, which had

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.700
only brick here as an element, now has two elements in it; brick or wedge.
