00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.510
If you look at the structure of

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:05.500
distributed systems today, what you'll see is there

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.030
are applications in the applications that users use.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.230
And there are system services and there is

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.690
a micro kernel that's sitting at the

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.570
bottom. And the system services include things like

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.460
file server, web server, Window manager, database manager,

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.910
and the network stack for applications to do

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.220
network communication with servers that may be

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.940
on remote machines. And the micro kernel itself

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.430
may be responsible for process management and managing

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.581
the hardware resources and providing inter-process communication, both

00:00:40.581 --> 00:00:43.705
intra-machine among these services. As well as

00:00:43.705 --> 00:00:46.770
inter-machine through the network stack, the remote machines

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.010
on the local area network. We've seen that this is a structure we like to see

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.670
in the operating system. And in fact, from many of the previous

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.625
lessons that we have looked at in operating system design and implementation,

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:05.630
both for a single processor, for a multi-processor, and a networked operating

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.450
system, this kind of structure lends

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.720
itself to extensibility and yet high performance.
