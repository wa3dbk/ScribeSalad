00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.249
However, the standard error changes because it's based on two sample sizes and

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:09.974
two standard deviations. What is this new standard error? In problem set 10

00:00:09.974 --> 00:00:13.817
number 10, we saw that if you subtract normally distributed data from other

00:00:13.817 --> 00:00:19.588
normally distributed data, we get a new data set. So, here I'm symbolizing

00:00:19.588 --> 00:00:24.426
normally distributed data with a mean of mhu sub one. And a standard deviation

00:00:24.426 --> 00:00:29.751
of sigma sub one. And we're subtracting normally distributed data with mhu mu

00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:34.076
sub two, sigma sub two. We get a new data set that has mean of just the

00:00:34.076 --> 00:00:39.259
difference between these two means. But then the standard deviation, is the sum

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:45.250
of the variances, and then the square root. For samples it's roughly the same.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.026
The standard deviation of this new data set, is even bigger than that for each

00:00:49.026 --> 00:00:55.044
individual data set. So, we know that this standard deviation of the combined

00:00:55.044 --> 00:01:01.238
data sets is greater than the standard deviation of just one of the samples.

00:01:01.238 --> 00:01:05.654
because if we square both sides, we get this. And we know that this is true,

00:01:05.654 --> 00:01:10.479
because these are the same. And so, therefore if we add the variants of the

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.430
second sample on this side, then this side will be bigger than just this.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.383
Similarly, the standard deviation of the combined data sets is bigger than that

00:01:20.383 --> 00:01:25.090
for the second sample. You can think about it intuitively, because if we have

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.670
two different distributions and then we subtract this data from the other.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.033
There's going to be even more error than what exists in each individual

00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:39.416
distribution. Like we might subtract this data value out here, from this one

00:01:39.416 --> 00:01:46.070
here. Or we could subtract a data value down here, from a data value here. And

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.790
then when we combine them we have a much wider distribution, and this is the

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.134
standard deviation. Now again with independent samples, for analyzing the

00:01:55.134 --> 00:01:59.550
difference between those means, remember how before with the one standard T

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.584
test, our standard error was S divided by root N? Well now we're using this for

00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:10.008
S, because it's based on two samples instead of one. So, we can replace this S

00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:14.932
with our new one. Then we can re-write this, since both the numerator and

00:02:14.932 --> 00:02:19.809
denominator are under the radical sign. We can say it's the same as this, and

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:24.933
finally we can re-write it like this. Now what happens if our tow sample sizes

00:02:24.933 --> 00:02:30.182
are different? Then we simply have sample size one for the first treatment, and

00:02:30.182 --> 00:02:35.698
the sample size two for the second sample. This is our new standard error for

00:02:35.698 --> 00:02:41.139
independence samples. Before, with paired data or dependent samples, we could

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:47.276
simply calculate the difference between each value for each subject. And then

00:02:47.276 --> 00:02:52.940
we could calculate the standard deviation. Therefore, before we just had that

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.210
one S, but now we have two different samples and they can each be different

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:04.196
sizes. This also changes our degrees of freedom, but it's easy to understand

00:03:04.196 --> 00:03:08.876
before we just subtracted 1 from the sample size, well now we subtract one from

00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:15.766
each sample size and then add them. Subtract 1 from n1 subtract 1 from n2 and

00:03:15.766 --> 00:03:21.673
them, and that's the same as adding the sample sizes. And then subtracting n2

00:03:21.673 --> 00:03:26.209
and here's the degrees of freedom we'll use for the rest of this lesson A more

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.961
conservative approach when we're not using software is to use the smaller of n1

00:03:30.961 --> 00:03:37.120
minus 1 and n2 minus 1. In other words, the smaller of the two degrees of

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.454
freedom from the two samples. But for now we'll just use n1 plus n2 minus 2,

00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:44.580
because that's what you'll use later.
