[Evans] I hope you're starting to feel fairly confident that you understand lists,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
you understand the operations we can do on lists,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and you understand how to use for and while to loop through elements of a list.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
For this quiz we're going to try something a fair bit tougher than what you've seen so far.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Your goal is to define a procedure, named find_element, that takes 2 inputs.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The first input is a list.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It can be a list of any type of element,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and the second input is a value which can be of any type,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and it outputs the index of the first element in the input list

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that matches the value that's passed in as the second input.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
One of the things you should think about when you define a procedure

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
is whether there are any special cases that it's not clear what you should do.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
In this case the question as I've stated it so far

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
doesn't explain what to do if the input list doesn't contain any element

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
that matches the value that's passed in as the second input.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We'll change it to make that more clear,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and we'll make it behave like the find method that we saw in strings.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So if the element doesn't exist, we'll return -1.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Here's a few examples.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
If you call find_element, passing in as the list the list 1, 2, 3

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and passing in as the value to match the number 3,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
we find the match here, which is position 2,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
so the output should be 2.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
If we pass in as the list the list containing the strings alpha and beta

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and we pass in as the element to find the string gamma,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
there's no such element in the list, so the output should be -1.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
There are many different ways you could define find_element

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
using the things that we've seen so far.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
See if you can find a way to define it that has this behavior.
