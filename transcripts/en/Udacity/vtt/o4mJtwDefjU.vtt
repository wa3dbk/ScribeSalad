00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.406
Finally, we can check our answer by multiplying x plus 2 times the divisor x

00:00:05.406 --> 00:00:10.800
plus 5. X times x is x squared and x times positive is positive 5 x. 2 times x

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.400
is positive x and 2 times 5 is positive 10. And finally, if we combine our like

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.159
terms, we get x squared plus 7 x plus 10, our original polynomial.
