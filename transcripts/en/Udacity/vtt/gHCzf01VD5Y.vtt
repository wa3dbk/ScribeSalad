00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So we've learned about two of the three Ms:

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
the mean, the median, but not the third,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
so let's focus on the third, the mode.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I will use as an example a children's birthday party.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If you've ever been to one of those,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
there's usually kids and some of their parents.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This one happens to have 5 kids and 4 parents,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
or 9 people in total.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Let me write down the ages of the kids and their parents:

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
4, 3, 32, 33, 4 again, 32 again, 3, 38, and 4.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So one of the things we can compute for this is the mean age

00:00:38.000 --> 99:59:59.000
of all the people at the party.
