Hello, and
welcome to intro to the Linux shell.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.040
I'm Phillip, and in this course you'll
learn the basic of how to use the Linux

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.109
shell or a command line environment.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:08.920
&gt;&gt; And I'm Carl.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.850
The goal of this course is to give
you the basic command line tools

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.470
you'll need to start
working with Linux servers.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.800
Now, you might have used
other command lines before.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.300
If you've used JavaScript,

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.150
you've probably seen the JavaScript
console in your browser.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.540
Or maybe you've used an interpreter
in Python or another language.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.290
Or perhaps you've used the command
line on your own computer.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.840
&gt;&gt; These are all examples
of command line interfaces.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.400
Command line interfaces all
work in about the same way.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.489
You type in a command then they
system runs those commands and

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.772
displays the output then you can
type another command and so on.

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:41.965
&gt;&gt; And the idea of a command line
interface goes back to the mid 20th

00:00:41.965 --> 00:00:44.636
century and one of the earliest
ways that people had for

00:00:44.636 --> 00:00:48.050
communicating with a computer,
the computer terminal.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.240
Now today, terminal usually
means a piece of software.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.630
But it originally meant
a physical piece of hardware for

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.370
interacting with a computer.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.640
Before terminals,
people put programs and

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.860
data through computers
using punch cards.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.730
Loading a batch of data into
the computer all at once.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.020
The terminal, by letting a user directly
send commands to a computer program and

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.759
immediately see responses was a huge
step forward in user interface.

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.020
&gt;&gt; And it's an interface that we're
still using today for a lot of reasons.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.940
A command line interface
is programmable.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.120
It's efficient in terms
of network bandwidth and

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.960
you can use the terminal edit files in
the distant system without having to

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.110
first copy them to your local machine.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.330
In general, you can be much more
expressive with a text based interface

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.730
than you can by just pointing and
clicking.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.260
One of the uses of the shells
is to administer servers.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.180
Machines that might be far
away on the network and

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.500
that probably don't have
a graphical environment.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.710
For the rest of this course,

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.320
you're going to be working on
a system very much like that.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.960
&gt;&gt; So first, you'll need to set up your
own virtual Linux server to work on.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.550
Fortunately, that's a lot
easier than it sounds like.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.940
So let's get started.
