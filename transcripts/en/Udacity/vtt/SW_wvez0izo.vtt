00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So 0.12 divided by 0.36 is the same as 12 divided by 36 is the same as 1/3 or 0.333.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And 0.04 divided by 0.36 is the same as 4 divided by 36,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that is 1/9.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If you look at that numbers, 1/3, there's 1/3 plus 3/9 is another 1/3 gives exactly 1.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So this is a probability distribution, which is often written in the following way.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The probability of each cell, i where i could range from 1-5,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
after we've seen our measurement Z.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The probabilist would also call it posterior distribution of place xi given measurement Z.

00:00:48.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Let's implement all this.
