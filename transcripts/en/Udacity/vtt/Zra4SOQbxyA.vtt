Okay. Let's get back to our original problem on cellular division. I wanted to

00:00:03.857 --> 00:00:07.689
know how many cells would there be after seven rounds of division. Remember, I

00:00:07.702 --> 00:00:11.532
started with one cell, and that split into two cells. You can draw a diagram to

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:15.371
model this out, or you can just use an exponent. So, if I started with one cell

00:00:15.461 --> 00:00:19.347
and had seven rounds of division, each cell doubled, how many cells would there

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.240
be? You can put your answer in this box.
