00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.872
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Did you get y equals negative 4 for the first answer, and x equals 3 for the

00:00:04.872 --> 00:00:10.133
second answer? If so, way to go! Let's see how we got those answers. Similar to

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:15.031
the last practice problems that we did, for the first problem we know that a

00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:20.140
slope of 0 means a horizontal line, and a horizontal line looks like this. And

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.585
we know the equation is going to be y equals sum constant. If I put a point on

00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:29.188
the line, 3 negative 4. I know that, no matter what x equals, y is always going

00:00:29.188 --> 00:00:34.077
to equal negative 4. Which is why we get the equation, y equals negative 4. For

00:00:34.077 --> 00:00:38.967
the second problem, the key here is the undefined slope. We know that undefined

00:00:38.967 --> 00:00:44.286
slope means its a vertical line. And we know a vertical line looks like that,

00:00:44.286 --> 00:00:49.906
and I also know the equation of a vertical line is x equals a constant. When I

00:00:49.906 --> 00:00:55.639
plot the point on my vertical line, 3 negative 4, I can see that no matter what

00:00:55.639 --> 00:01:01.194
the value of y is, the x value always stays at 3. So, the equation is x equals

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:02.101
negative 3.
