&gt;&gt; All right Michael, so we're back. We have

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.370
learned a bunch of stuff about SVMs and you forced

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.120
me to live up to my promise to connect

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.390
margins. Which is kind of the big cool thing about

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.830
SVMs, the sort of fundamental theoretical construct that's underlying

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.340
SVMs. You forced me to connect that back to boosting.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.730
So I think we've learned everything we need to learn

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.700
about support vector machines for now. What do you think?

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.790
&gt;&gt; If you say so, sounds good.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:25.790
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.340
Well, I will talk to you next time, Michael.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.540
&gt;&gt; Thanks. Bye.
