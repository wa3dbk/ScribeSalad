This question is really just asking us to use our common sense. Does is make

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:09.563
sense that Grant will make money if he doesn't sell any products? I would argue

00:00:09.575 --> 00:00:14.247
no. If no one buys his products, he won't get any money back. And since he put

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.994
money into making them, he'll be at a loss. And fortunately we have a positive

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.990
y-intercept, not a negative one. So, this means this is positive profit. So, the

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:28.876
information from our equation is not really in line with what we would think

00:00:28.888 --> 00:00:33.909
logically would happen. So, I would say that the two points that Grant gave us

00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:39.064
to start out, which you may remember were 60, 1000. And 100, 1200 were probably

00:00:39.076 --> 00:00:43.784
off. We based our entire equations just off the info we got from these two

00:00:43.796 --> 00:00:48.265
points to help us figure out our slope, and our y-intercept. So, this just goes

00:00:48.277 --> 00:00:51.934
to show you that if your initial data is wrong, your final conclusion will

00:00:51.946 --> 00:00:55.495
probably not make very much sense. I think this is also testament to the

00:00:55.507 --> 00:00:59.434
importance of being able to connect math with real world situations. And why we

00:00:59.446 --> 00:01:03.240
have to keep ourselves grounded in what our variables mean when we're solving

00:01:03.252 --> 00:01:03.697
problems.
