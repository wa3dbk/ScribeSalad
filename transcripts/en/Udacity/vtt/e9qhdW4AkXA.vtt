00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now let's return to fishing but look at it from a different perspective--

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
the perspective of optimization.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We could run our simulation with different but constant harvest rates

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and check what the total amount of harvest in 10 years would be.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
If we are using to a high a harvest rate, we are over fishing

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and hence lose from the total amount that would be possible.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
If we harvest too little, we are under fishing which is also not optimal.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Optimization aims at finding the right value for the harvest rate--

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
the value that would maximize a total amount of harvest.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
In technical terms, the function that we are optimizing is called the objective function,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and the harvest rate is a parameter it depends on.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The optimization should find the best value of that harvest rate,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
meaning the value for which the objective function is maximum.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The same would have to happen for instance if we look at the numbers of units sold in some simulation

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
or the money earned in some simulation.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Most probably, we want to maximize that value, but there's also a large number of optimization problems

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
in which we want to minimize the objective function.

00:01:16.000 --> 09:59:59.000
For instance, we particularly want to minimize the duration of a trip or the money spent.
