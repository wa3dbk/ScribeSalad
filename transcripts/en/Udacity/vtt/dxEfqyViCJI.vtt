00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
Now, so far, we've only worked with the decision variant of vertex cover.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.420
So, what about the optimization problem? Actually, that's not that difficult.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.510
We just run through all values of K. So we will first start off assuming K=1.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:24.500
Then our algorithm requires O(2.4¹&lt;i&gt;n³), then we'll increase K=2, algorithm requires o(2.4²&lt;i&gt;n³).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.620
So each time we're solving the decision problem here,

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.500
and we increase K even further to K=3 and so on and so on and so on.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.060
Until we hit some value k’ which is the size of the smallest vertex cover of the input graph.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.010
Of course, we don't know what that size will be in advanced?

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.720
But once we have increased K enough, solving the decision variant will give us the answer, yes.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.740
Now, how much running time is this in total?

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.250
Well, you need to know a bit of discrete mathematics for this,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:01:01.250
but running time O(2.4¹+2.4²+)...(2.4^k')&lt;i&gt;n²).&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.040
Now if you have a discrete math course and remember what you learned there,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.400
you will recognize this part here as a geometric series

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:20.440
and this evaluates to (2.4^k'⁻¹-1/2.4-1) which is the same as 0(2.4^k'),

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.490
and k' is the size of the smallest vertex cover &lt;i&gt;n³. We forgot the n³  here which is right here.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.240
And this is amazing because now it means that not only the decision variant of vertex cover

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.570
can be solved in (2.4^k' n³) time, but it means that the optimization variant of vertex cover

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.590
can also be solved in O(2.4^k'n³ )time,

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.330
where k is the minimum size of a vertex cover for the input graph.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.990
And this again emphasizes the fact, small vertex covers are easy to find

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.950
even if we don't know that a graph has a small vertex cover as long as it is small,

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.180
it will be easy to find and for any fixed k, so either in the decision variant, we fixed k

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.180
or we say we look at all graphs that say have a vertex cover of size 10 or 20 or 30,

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.000
we can solve this NP complete problem in polynomial time.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.510
And this is a concept known as Fixed Parameter Tractability.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.360
Well, that means is that as long as the parameter that measures the hardness

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.920
and in this case, it's the size of a vertex cover for your graph,

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.190
as long as that parameter is small or fixed, then you can solve that problem in polynomial time

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.750
and that is what this here says, so as long as the parameter is fixed,

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.000
the problem is tractable, if the parameter is not fixed, so for example,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.750
there's a function of n, then the problem is not tractable.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.990
And this of course is a super neat technique for solving vertex cover

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.360
and actually 2.4^k is actually a very bad exponent here.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.850
We only did that because of what's easier to explain the problem that way.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.980
The currently best algorithms have an exponential factor of about 1.3^k.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.880
Actually, a current state of the art is that you can solve vertex cover in

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.880
1.3^k times some polynomial time.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.770
Now, the polynomial here that depends on certain analysis factors and so on

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.130
but the important thing here is to see, first of all, vertex cover is fixed parameter tractable

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.240
and second of all, the base of the exponent is actually really good.

00:03:12.240 --> 99:59:59.000
It's only 1.3^k.
