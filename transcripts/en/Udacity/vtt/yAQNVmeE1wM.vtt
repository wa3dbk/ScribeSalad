00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.770
Now that we have a database that's not
empty, let's start reading from it.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.030
In the last video, you saw me call
session.query(Restaurant).all.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.914
If I create a variable called
firstResult and set it equal to

00:00:10.914 --> 00:00:14.810
session.query(Restaurant) and
use .first this time,

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.660
I now have a variable that corresponds
to a single row in my database.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.870
These single row references allow me to
extract column entries as method names.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.930
So if I were to write firstResult.name,

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.500
I'm given the name of my restaurant
object as it is stored in the database.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.740
Currently, I only have one restaurant
and one menu item stored in my database.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.030
Well that's kind of boring, but with
the help from some fellow Udations I've

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.040
created a Python script that will
populate my database with several

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.216
different restaurants and menu items
popular amongst the Udasity team.

00:00:43.216 --> 00:00:47.180
Download the lotsofmenus.py script
into your working directory and

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.680
execute it from the command line as so.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.589
Now when we perform executions like
session.query(Restaurant).all,

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.110
we get back a whole list of results.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.370
So what happens when I have a query
that returns a collection of results and

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.180
we want to display column
information for each item?

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.230
For this, we can use a python for loop
to return the data that we want to see.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.980
Here, let's do an example.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.900
I will make a variable called items and

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.270
set it equal to a query that
retrieves all of my menu items.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.710
Now, I can say for
item in items, print item.name.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.522
Now I get back a printed line of
each item name in our database.

00:01:21.522 --> 00:01:24.710
SQL Alchemy has an extensive
collection of queries we can perform on

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.720
our database.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.570
Take some time to explore
the query documentation here and

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.280
play around with the database for
a while.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.240
When you're ready,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.340
move on to some of the challenge
problems in the next section.
