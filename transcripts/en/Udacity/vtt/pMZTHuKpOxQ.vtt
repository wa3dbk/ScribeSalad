00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.110
A second method to adapt cases is to
use case based reasoning recursively.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.250
So last time we considered problem
which I had to go from my office

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.790
to a restaurant, and
I found a way of doing that.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.310
Now suppose that I have to go from
my home to the same restaurant.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.940
So I don't yet know how to go from
my home to the restaurant, but

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.420
I know how to go from
my home to my office.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.850
And this last time, I figured out a way
of going from office to the restaurant.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.960
So there we have it.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.915
Now I have a case retrieved for
going from home to office, another case

00:00:28.915 --> 00:00:33.154
retrieved for going from office to
the restaurant, and I have a solution.

00:00:33.154 --> 00:00:35.980
We're going from home all
the way to the restaurant.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.120
This is an example of
case based reasoning.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.180
Your first time you retrieve a case for

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.680
solving a problem,
the case provides a partial solution.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.870
So I take the remaining part which was
not solved, make it a new problem,

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.930
and send it back into the case memory.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.660
Now the case memory finds me a new case.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.060
And I take this new case and

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.440
I compose it with the previous
case to get a full solution.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.210
&gt;&gt; So to return again to our programming
example, when I'm designing a program,

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.210
my file input is usually
part of a broader problem of

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.980
persisting data between
instances of the program.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.460
And thus, the real problem I'm solving
is solving this problem of how to save

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.900
data when the program isn't running.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.180
I can then solve that problem
recursively by breaking it down

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.370
into the first problem of file input and
the second problem of file output.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.020
I might draw a case for solving file
input from one program I've done in

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.570
the past and a case for solving file
output from another program in the past.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.920
So I've solved it recursively by
breaking it down into sub problems.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.630
&gt;&gt; David,
to build on what you just said,

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.700
the same kind of thing
occurs in design in general.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.800
Often when we do design, we get
partial solutions for multiple cases.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.070
For example, consider the problem
of designing a microbot

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.030
that can swim underwater
in a very stealthy manner.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.150
This might remind me
of a case of a copepod

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.560
which has large number of appendages and

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.150
swims in the water at very slow velocity
making minimum wake in the water.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.490
That's good,
I've now solved part of the problem,

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.370
the part which had to do with moving
stealthily underwater under slow speeds.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.122
But that now sets up a new goal,

00:02:09.122 --> 00:02:12.579
how do I achieve stealthy motion
underwater at high speeds?

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.930
And I may come up with a solution
from a different case.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.690
So a squid, for example, also swims
stealthily underwater, but it does so

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.790
by creating a wake that matches
the natural wake of water around it.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.590
So here I first used the goal
of designing a microbot that can

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.400
swim underwater stealthily to
retrieve a case of the copepod.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.430
That provide me with a partial solution.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.238
So I set up a new sub-goal
to complete the solution.

00:02:41.238 --> 00:02:44.385
The new sub-goal found a new case,
that of the squid,

00:02:44.385 --> 00:02:47.460
which gave me the rest of the solution.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.290
And if I compose the two partial
solutions, I get the complete solution.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.680
&gt;&gt; So what Ashok just described is
something that we call compound analogy,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.390
which is a specific type of
adaptation by recursive reasoning.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.936
If you're interested in that example,

00:02:59.936 --> 00:03:02.628
we've provided a paper on it in
the course materials for this lesson.

00:03:02.628 --> 00:03:06.872
So you can read more about the process
of adapting those cases to solve that

00:03:06.872 --> 00:03:09.280
very unique and complex design problem.
