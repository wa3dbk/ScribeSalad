00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.910
Now, once you've setup the layout of the
app, it's time to take a moment to talk

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.300
about what's actually
happening in the final app.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.430
If you remember,
we have the map on the screen,

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.710
which is somehow modified by
pressing the buttons at the top.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.250
Now, thus far, we've learned
how to make a map fragment and

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.430
change that through user activity.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.840
But we haven't learned how to create
a Google Map object, which is the thing

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.000
that within code will be able to change
the contents of the map fragment.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.110
So to do this there's
a few things that we need.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.120
First of all, we'll need to
implement the onMapReadyCallback.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.260
Now we'll do that by modifying the class
declaration for our main activity to

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.444
have this, so here I have my onMapReady
which is just setting mapReady,

00:00:38.444 --> 00:00:42.870
a boolean ,to true, and then this
local variable called m_map to map.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.729
And you notice here it passes back
a Google Map, so my m_map, of course,

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:48.617
is a local instance of a Google Map.

00:00:48.617 --> 00:00:51.938
And you can see I've defined it
at the top of my activity here.

00:00:51.938 --> 00:00:55.580
And of course the activity itself has
to implement the onMapReady callback.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.180
So, within our onMapReady,
I'm just saying the mapReady is true.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.290
I'm loading my local instance of a map
with the one that was sent back to me.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.970
I create a new lat-long, which I'm
calling New York, with the latitude and

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.520
longitude coordinates
we used earlier on.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.410
Then I'm setting the camera position
using a camera position builder.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.990
I'm targeting at New York, and
I'm setting the zoom to 14,

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.380
so it'll be a little bit further
out than the one we saw earlier.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.190
And then on m map itself,
now the map object,

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.880
I can call the move camera on that to
set its position to be this target.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.040
As you can see,
it's pretty straight forward.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.020
And you can do other things like angling
and zooming to different levels and

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.310
different types of views that you want
on the camera position itself, but

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.720
here I've created a very
basic camera position.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.970
So that's all that you really need
to do to get your map set up for

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.110
working within an application and

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.920
having a handle on a map object
that you can then program.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.190
And I'll show you in the next
step how we then program that

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.470
to allow to have satellite or
height reviews.
