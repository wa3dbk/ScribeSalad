We've been talking about equations for functions that are inverses of one

00:00:03.342 --> 00:00:07.439
another, and also points that lie on them. And we have seen one graph of two

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:10.652
inverse functions, but I think that it would be great if we could focus on the

00:00:10.652 --> 00:00:15.348
graphical part a little bit more. So, here I've drawn for you two functions

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:20.171
that we were working with earlier. We started off with f of x equals 3x minus

00:00:20.171 --> 00:00:24.945
1, and we found it's inverse, which is f inverse of x equals 1 3rd times x plus

00:00:24.945 --> 00:00:30.510
1. Of course, now from the last quiz, we also know that f is the inverse of f

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.262
inverse. But, I'll keep with this notation for now. This is pretty tricky, but

00:00:35.262 --> 00:00:39.404
how are these lines related to one another? I'll give you some choices to make

00:00:39.404 --> 00:00:44.000
things a bit simpler. Which of these choices properly completes this sentence?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.466
The graph of f inverse is the reflection in the what of the graph of f? Your

00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:56.088
choices are x-axis, y-axis, or the line y equals x. Think about what it would

00:00:56.088 --> 00:00:59.510
look like to reflect f in each of these lines, and then see if one of those

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.159
pictures matches the graph of f inverse.
