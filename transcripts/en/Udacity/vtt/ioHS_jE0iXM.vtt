00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.059
So now imagine that you've added instance variables for x and y. You'll know

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:08.130
where to draw the circle when you're adding a friend. And that circle marks one

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.120
endpoint under the line. But what about the other endpoint? How are you

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.150
going to get that? Use the instance variables x and y. Use the friend

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.700
parameter. Use xCoord and yCoord. Get the x and y values from the friend

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.920
parameter. Or add parameters to the addFriend method to take in the second

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.533
endpoint of the line.
