00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.070
Here's your next challenge app.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.120
At the beginning of the lesson we
created a make your own adventure app

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.780
using static segues.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.660
Now we're going to expand on that
app using data driven stories.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.790
Here's the completed version of data
driven make your own adventure.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.110
Here's the tiger story from
the beginning of the lesson.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.660
Just like before we navigate through the
different nodes by clicking on different

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.290
prompts.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.990
Most of the story nodes
have two prompts.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.490
But of course the nodes that
ends the story have none.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.610
In a second will look at the code for

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.540
the data model that
drives these stories.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.650
Each node in the story has a struct.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.770
That describes the nodes message.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.850
And the prompts to move
on to other story nodes.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.780
Right now, you're looking at
a completed version of the app.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.910
But in the branch for step 5.5.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.830
The table view delegate and
data source methods for

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.770
the story node view controller
have been left blank.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.160
When we run this incomplete version,
notice that there are no prompts.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.460
Your task is to modify the story no View
Controller so this table is working.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.160
Let's take a closer look
at the data structure.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.070
The app has four stories stored as
serialized versions of arrays in

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.200
dictionaries here in
the supporting files group.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.880
You'll learn more about
how to store arrays and

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.670
dictionaries in the iOS
persistence course.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.150
So for
now let's focus on how stored data

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.240
is parsed into these model
objects that represent stories.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.670
Here you can see that there's
a class to represent each adventure.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.170
It has a credit's property for
the author's name and

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.710
the start node property which
contains the first line of the story.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.700
Initially, these adventures get shown
by the route table view controller.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.100
Here's the table view it governs and
when the user selects a story,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.910
the story node View Controller gets
pushed on to the navigation stack.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.740
Let's take a look at that code.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.490
So here we are in the route
table view controller and

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.010
we want to scroll down to
the method didSelectRowAtIndexPath.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.440
So here's what happens when
a user chooses a story.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.060
First you get the adventure object.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.720
Then you grab the first
node in that adventure.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.060
You instantiate the story node View
Controller from the storyboard object.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.990
Then you set the story node that's
going to start that adventure, and

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.788
get loaded into the story
node view controller.

00:02:10.788 --> 00:02:14.440
And you push the story node view
controller on to the navigation stack.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.170
The story node view controller
shows one story note at a time.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.920
Let's take a look at the struct for
that story node.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.560
Here you can see the message property
that provides the text for the story.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.740
And then there are three different
methods related to the story prompts.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.510
The prompt count which tells you how
many rows that prompt table should have.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.740
The prompt text for a given index and

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.920
then the story node objects to
that a given prompt leads to.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.380
You can see that now that we
have an underlying data model,

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.180
we don't need all those view controllers
like we had before, we just need this

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.920
one story node view controller and
we populate it with different data.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.750
Your challenge is to write the code
that will populate the table of Prompts.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.400
And then perform a push segueway
to the next story node when

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.030
a prompt is selected.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.450
If you open up the story
node View Controller, and

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.010
you scroll down to the table view
delegate and data source methods,

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.880
you'll notice that they're either empty,
or they just have placeholder data.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.900
Your challenge is to fill these
methods in and get the app working.
