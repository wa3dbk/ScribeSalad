00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I want to add one last thing here--the initial robot location.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
If we define x0 to be 0, which is the origin of the map,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
then what this means is we add 1 over here and 0 over here.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The reason why is this constraint is that x0 is 0.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Let's take a robot moving around and let's say it sees a landmark

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
from the first pose x0 and from the third pose x2 but not from the second pose.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I want you, in this matrix over here,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
to check mark all the fields that are being modified by Graph SLAM--

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
it's a binary check--and the same for the vector without putting actual numbers in.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So go into this matrix and ask yourself which fields will be 0, the ones untouched,

00:00:46.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and which ones will not be 0 that are the ones we modified.
