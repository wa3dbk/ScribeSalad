00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.360
The DOM is a data structure.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.800
It can best be described as a tree, much like a family tree.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.000
So, I've got a sample family tree here.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.215
This family tree has parents, it has children, and it even has siblings.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.639
Elements that are nested inside each other in the DOM are children, like, for

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:30.280
instance, this unordered list, which is a child of div.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.660
Elements at the same level are siblings, like these two list elements or

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.270
this unordered list and this form.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.690
And of course, we can go up the DOM as well.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.980
For instance, this div is the parent to that div.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.620
When writing HTML, you create a collection of nested elements that, in the end,

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.990
resembles a structure much like this family tree.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.930
This HTML would map to the DOM tree you see over here.

00:00:55.998 --> 00:01:00.240
Here, the body's at the top level and it has some divs nested underneath it.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.960
For this quiz, I want you to examine this DOM tree.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.120
Which of the following DOM elements is the immediate parent of

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.920
the two list elements?

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.220
You can see them in the HTML here and in the DOM tree over here.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:19.710
Is it the body, this div, this ul, or is it none of these?
