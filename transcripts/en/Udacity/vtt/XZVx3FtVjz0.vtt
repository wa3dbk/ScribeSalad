00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.580
When we divided x plus 5 into 2x plus 10, we want to look at these first two

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.320
terms. We want to ask ourselves, what number times x equals 2x? Well, that must

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.936
be positive 2. 2 times x is 2x and 2 times 5 is 10. You can also get this number

00:00:16.936 --> 00:00:23.018
by dividing 2x, this first term, by the first term that we're dividing by, x. 2x

00:00:23.018 --> 00:00:28.497
divided by x, is positive 2. Now we need to subtract this expression. We know

00:00:28.497 --> 00:00:33.938
subtracting an expression changes both of the signs. We have negative 2x and

00:00:33.938 --> 00:00:39.521
negative 10. 2x minus 2x equals 0, and positive 10 minus 10 is also equal to 0.

00:00:39.521 --> 00:00:44.735
So when we divide this polynomial by x plus 5, we get an answer of x plus 2.
