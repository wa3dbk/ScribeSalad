00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The RSA comes from the initials of its three inventors--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
One thing you'll notice in cryptography is many of the most important ideas

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
are named after groups of people.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We have Diffie-Hellman. We have RSA. We have Needham-Schroeder.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We'll see lots of other examples.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This is different from what we tend to see in mathematics

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
where most of the big ideas have just one name.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Cryptography is a very collaborative process.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The way Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman worked together--

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Rivest and Shamir came up with lots of ideas, trying to come up with

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
ways to provide this public-key property,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and Adleman would find the flaws in them.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
They kept trying this and eventually came up with the one idea that Adleman

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
couldn't find any flaws in, and that's the one that we know of today as RSA.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
RSA was the first successful public-key encryption system.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It's also one of the most widely used crypto systems

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and continues to be the most widely used public-key system today.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The way it works is actually quite simple.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We have the public key as a pair of two numbers, e and n,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
where n is the product of two primes.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The secret key is a pair of two numbers.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The n is the modulus, which is the same in both the public and the private keys.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The difference is in the public key we have e.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
In the secret key we have a secret number d.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
To perform encryption of some message m,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
we raise m to the e power mod n.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
To perform decryption using the secret key, we have some ciphertext,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
which we raise to the d power mod n.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
That means encryption and decryption are the same functions,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
just with different powers that we're using, depending on whether we're using

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
the public key or the secret key.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
RSA is a very important cryptosystem, but it's simple enough

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
that we can fit the whole thing on one screen

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
or even on a license plate.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Unfortunately, in the state of Virginia,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
the license plates don't allow you to have exponents in them.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
If you live somewhere where you're DMV allows you to have exponents in license plates,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
that's great. You can get a much better version of this than I have.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Actually understanding why it works and the argument that it's secure,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
require understanding some more things,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and in particular, the we choose the values of e, d, n.

00:02:31.000 --> 99:59:59.000
In fact, we have to be careful how we choose the message as well.
