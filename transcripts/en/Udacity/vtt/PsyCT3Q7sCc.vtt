00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.180
Our next lemma states the key property

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.040
of a phase of
the Hopcroft–Karp algorithm.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.550
Each phase increases the length of
the shortest path by at least two.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.040
For the proof, we'll let Q be
a shortest augmenting path

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.720
after a phase that augmented
with paths of length k.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.090
It's impossible for Q to be less than k,

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.140
by a previous lemma which showed that
augmenting by a shortest augmenting path

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.710
never decreased the minimum
augmenting path length.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.340
On the other hand, Q being equal to
k implies that Q is vertex disjoint

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.690
from all paths found in the previous
phase, by the lemma we just showed.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.160
But then it would have
been part of the phase,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.190
so that doesn't make any sense either.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.980
Thus, Q is greater than k and
it also has to be odd, so

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.980
the size of Q must be equal to k plus 2.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.450
k itself was, of course, odd as well.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.470
And that completes the lemma.
