00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is the correct way to write this condition.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In Python and most other programming languages, or has a little precedence than and.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And if you write this without parenthesis, the effect of this is that, this will be implicitly prioritize as this,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
meaning that the condition that tag must be said applies only for single quotes

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
but not for double quotes which would always be stripped.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And this is the reason why double quotes are stripped whereas single quotes are not stripped.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Well, they are stripped but only when we are in tag mode

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and when we are in tag mode, then the characters wont appear anyway.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We can apply this very same fix in our program simply by putting parenthesis

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
around this junction in here such as this junction takes precedence over the conjunction.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Let's see whether our example with the double quotes now works. Yes it does.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Now, we actually get the quotes properly in here. Let's try it a few more.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So let's see whether the single quotes still work too and while we read it

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
we can even add a few more to that--let's see what the output will be.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
First example, with double quotes are still there, not stripped.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Second example, single quotes, not stripped.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Third example, just the HTML markup, HTML markup is stripped.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Next one, quotes around HTML markup, quotes remained, HTML markup stripped.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So HTML markup is removed in all cases.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
How about our almost complex example, we have the reference with quotes within the tag.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Are they still properly stripped? We try this out. Yes, everything is properly stripped.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Quotes and greater than signs are handled just as they should be.
