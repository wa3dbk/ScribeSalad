00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.600
Now that we have seen flush stall and forwarding

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.000
as a solution for hazards in a pipeline let's do

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.805
a quiz to see if you know when each should

00:00:09.805 --> 00:00:12.700
be used. Let us say that we have a five-stage

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.456
pipeline where the first stage fetches the instruction, the

00:00:15.456 --> 00:00:18.910
second stage calls the instruction and reads the registers. The

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.100
third stage, the instruction does the ALU operation and a

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.460
branch is the result so we know where its going.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.371
In the mem stage loads and stores access memory,

00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:30.501
so at the end of this stage a load will

00:00:30.501 --> 00:00:34.050
finally have a value. And finally the fifth stage writes

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.770
the result to the register. Here, we have some hazards.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.158
First, there is a control hazard. After the branch

00:00:41.158 --> 00:00:44.382
we fetch two wrong instructions; before we fetch the correct

00:00:44.382 --> 00:00:47.510
multiply instruction in this case. So the red ones are

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.090
the ones that are fetched incorrectly. The question for you

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.722
is should we flush, stall or forward here? Put a check mark in each of these

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:58.933
three boxes depending on which one we do

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:03.730
here. Next, we have a data dependence where the

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.760
multiply is producing the R1 result and the

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.620
load needs to use that as the memory address.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.168
Put a check mark in each of these

00:01:12.168 --> 00:01:16.382
three boxes depending on whether we need to flush,

00:01:16.382 --> 00:01:23.327
stall, or forward the value in this case. And finally, the load is producing the

00:01:23.327 --> 00:01:29.023
value of R1, that this add needs to use, so the question for you is should we

00:01:29.023 --> 00:01:35.438
flush, stall, or forward in this case? Note that in some cases, more than one of

00:01:35.438 --> 00:01:39.180
these needs to be used for optimal performance.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.680
To help you get started I'm going to tell

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.940
you that for data dependencies, as we said, we never want to

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.130
use flushing, so the real question is just should you stall or forward?
