00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Norvig] And here's the answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
For the straight flush the values of the card_ranks is 10, 9, 8, 7, 6.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Here was the straight flush, and notice what we've done

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
is we put the order with the highest cards first

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
because we're going to use these ranks for tiebreakers,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and in tiebreakers it's the highest first that counts.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So we always want the result from card_ranks to be sorted highest first.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
For 4 of a kind, four 9s and a 7. That looks right. The 9s come before the 7.

00:00:29.000 --> 09:59:59.000
For full house, three 10s and two 7s. 10s come before the 7 and again, that looks right.
