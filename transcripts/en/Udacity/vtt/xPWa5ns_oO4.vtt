00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:07.379
0.6 is six tenths, or 6/10. So you
could've had this as your answer. 6/10

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:14.048
reduces to 3/5, so this is an acceptable
answer as well. We can write many

00:00:14.048 --> 00:00:18.564
different decimals in fractional form, and
thinking back to our definition of

00:00:18.611 --> 00:00:24.030
rational numbers, any decimal that we can
write as a fraction is rational.
