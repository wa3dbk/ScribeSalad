00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.260
Referring back to our formula, A equals P times 1 plus r over n to the nt,

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.670
we've seen n, the number of times the interest is compounded in a year, equal

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:17.933
to several different values in our different situations. We've had n equals 1,

00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:23.566
2, 3, 4, and 12. And presumably, we could have interest compounded even more

00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:27.706
frequently than this. As you've experienced, Grant likes to push limits in

00:00:27.706 --> 00:00:31.108
order the maximize the amount of money he makes, and now he wants to know what

00:00:31.108 --> 00:00:34.456
would happen if his interest is compounded so frequently That is actually

00:00:34.456 --> 00:00:41.162
compounded over and over again all the time. Lucky for him, this sort of

00:00:41.162 --> 00:00:47.408
interest setup actually already exists. It's called continuously compounded

00:00:47.408 --> 00:00:52.231
interest. If we want to use our good old formula here and keep increasing and

00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:58.610
increasing n Do I reach a particular function? Let's see what happens if we

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.090
substitute in the values p equals 1, r equals 1 and t equals 1 and then

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.288
increase the value of n. Well they just said that p equal to 1, r equal to 1

00:01:09.288 --> 00:01:15.647
and t equal to 1. Here's what we have. A equals 1 plus 1 over n all to the nth

00:01:15.647 --> 00:01:21.693
power. Now I'd like us to see what happens if we let n increase. Let's plug in

00:01:21.693 --> 00:01:25.470
some values to find out. So here's a little table for you to help me fill out.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.128
For each value of n here, please plug it into this equation to find the value

00:01:29.128 --> 00:01:33.662
of a that goes with it. Now, you're probably going to get some pretty long

00:01:33.662 --> 00:01:36.824
decimals, so I'd like you to type in as many numbers As your calculator will

00:01:36.824 --> 00:01:41.304
give you, maybe around ten or so. Remeber you can always use the google

00:01:41.304 --> 00:01:44.070
calculator online if you need a different device.
