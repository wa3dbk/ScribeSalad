00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.170
So as I said earlier, what we're dealing with here is two equations this one and

00:00:05.182 --> 00:00:10.121
this one that have one common term which is money spent. We just said that we

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:14.972
can substitute money spent with money spent each month times the number of

00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:20.010
months whenever we want to. So that means that this quantity down here On the

00:00:20.022 --> 00:00:24.719
right side of the second equation, can be moved up into this slot in the first

00:00:24.731 --> 00:00:29.675
equation. Having done that substitution now, we can see that the amount of money

00:00:29.687 --> 00:00:34.291
that Grant has left is equal to the money from the founders - the money spent

00:00:34.303 --> 00:00:39.025
each month * the number of months. If we look down at our answer choices, that

00:00:39.037 --> 00:00:42.945
is The third choice, so great job on this quiz whether you got it right or you

00:00:42.957 --> 00:00:46.855
didn't. Like I said earlier, I know that this is a lot of writing to look at on

00:00:46.867 --> 00:00:50.640
the screen at one time, we're actually going to address that problem in just a

00:00:50.652 --> 00:00:50.995
second.
