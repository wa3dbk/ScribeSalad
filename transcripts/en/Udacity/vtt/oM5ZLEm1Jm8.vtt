00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.555
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let's say we have the polynomial x squared plus 8x plus 15, and we want to

00:00:04.555 --> 00:00:09.403
factor it. For the moment, I'm going to say that the factors are x plus a and x

00:00:09.403 --> 00:00:13.958
plus b. So their product is just this polynomial. Now thinking about how

00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:18.768
multiplication of binomials works, what number do a and b need to add to equal,

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:23.393
and what number do they need to multiply to equal? Think about the quadratic

00:00:23.393 --> 00:00:24.736
expression on the left.
