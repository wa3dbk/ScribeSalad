00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.019
Now, copy and paste the sample means from the instructor notes to the link

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:10.381
that's also in instructor notes. This is Wolfram Alpha, and it's a really cool

00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:15.029
site. Enter those values here and click this icon. This will analyze all the

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:20.997
data that you put in here. In our case, that's the mean of all possible samples

00:00:20.997 --> 00:00:25.650
of size 2. Look at the histogram that visualizes the frequency of means. This

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.614
visualizes the distribution of the sample means, and this is called the sampling

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:37.400
distribution. What's the shape of this sampling distribution? Uniform, bimodal,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.114
normal, or skewed?
