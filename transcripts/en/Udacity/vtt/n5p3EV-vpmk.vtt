Now that we are done with our demo, I just want

00:00:02.212 --> 00:00:05.910
to go through a quick GIT recap to remind you of the

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.720
main commands that we saw, and what they do. And you can

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.290
also use these as sort of a reference when you work with

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.940
GIT. And by the way, if you look around and you do

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.960
a search, you can see that there's tons of examples on the

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.170
web of GitHub tutorials, videos, examples, manuals. So feel free to

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.910
explore. And I'm actually going to put some references to tutorials and

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.100
videos that I found particularly useful in the notes for the class.
