Okay guys, we are going to discuss HTML or

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.290
Hypertext Markup Language. HTML documents are the, the heart

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.170
of the Web. The Web is basically made up

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.180
of these documents that can do a number of

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.710
things. So HTML is made up of text content,

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.585
which is what you see. It's made up of

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:22.930
markup3 which is what that content looks like or

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.230
how it's arranged. It's made up of references to

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.954
other documents, like images and videos. You may have something that looks

00:00:28.954 --> 00:00:31.306
like this and you've got some text and you'll have a, you

00:00:31.306 --> 00:00:33.884
know, an image on your page. Or like the page you're looking

00:00:33.884 --> 00:00:36.325
at now, which has got a video in the middle of it. You

00:00:36.325 --> 00:00:38.855
know, the page you're looking at now is made up of HTML

00:00:38.855 --> 00:00:42.430
and it's got references to a big fat video. And it can

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.210
be made up of links to other pages. And, I'm sure you're

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.240
very familiar with what links are and how they're used. Let's let's play

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.850
around with HTML a little bit. This is a

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.530
simple HTML editor we have so we can play

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.990
with things and test them out. You can follow

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.170
along by either, I think there should be a

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:07.842
link in the course notes, or you can also go to www.udacity.com/html.playground.

00:01:07.842 --> 00:01:11.510
And that should get you this this little

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.280
page where you can kind of experiment a little bit. This is kind of a, a fake

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.940
little test browser. So, the first thing I'd like

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.990
to show you is that if we have just some

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.940
blank text. If we were to render this as HTML,

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.310
it would look the same. Plain text is plain text

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.922
in HTML, for the most part. But if we want

00:01:31.922 --> 00:01:33.950
to make the text look different, we need to use

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.498
something called markup, which is one of the other facets

00:01:36.498 --> 00:01:39.040
of HTML. And let's learn a little bit about markup.
