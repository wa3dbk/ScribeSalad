00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.350
A screen reader actually largely
creates the user interface for

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.320
the user based on the programatically
expressed semantics.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.030
Instead of a visual UI, the screen
reader provides an auditory interface.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.970
You probably noticed in
the previous exercise

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.570
that the screen reader told you some
information about each element.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.541
Roughly speaking,

00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:24.035
we can expect some subset of the
following information to be expressed.

00:00:24.035 --> 00:00:26.099
What type of element it is?

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.940
We call this an elements role.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.210
Sometimes a screen reader might
simply state the element's role.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.430
Other times it might play
an easily recognizable sound

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.450
to avoid constant repetition.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.100
Sometimes it might do both.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.830
The screen reader will announce
an elements name, if it has one.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.460
It will announce what its value is,
if it has one.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.040
And it will also announce
any information it

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.610
has about an element's state.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.860
So broadly speaking, if we've done
things right, we can expect to hear

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.410
information about an element's role,
name, state, and value.
