00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.330
Viewer driven narratives, on the other hand, take a very different approach.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.520
Rather than dictating a specific narrative,

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.220
it allows our user to freely interact with the data, and tell their own story.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.149
This is the excellent crime-spotting visualization, created by Statement Design.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.220
Here, there's no specific ordering a particular narrative.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.650
Instead, the data's presented to the viewer with various filters for

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.720
zoom level, time of day, time of week, and various crimes.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.530
Let's say I live in the Mission, and

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.440
I want to look at crime during my walk home from the Bart station everyday.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.420
Let's go ahead and zoom in there.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.700
I use the 16th Street in Mission Bart.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.670
So, we'll zoom it no this particular area.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.830
I'm only re, really worried about days of the week where I work, so

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.800
I'll select Monday through Friday.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.660
I typically get home between 6 PM and midnight, so let's go ahead and

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.290
select that there.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.390
We can see here that there are two thefts,

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.150
a narcotics, and simple assault violations in this area.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.980
I can click into each one of these and

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.700
get more information about the particular crime.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.790
With a few simple interactions, this visualization allowed me to ask a question

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.337
that was important to me, and tell my own story with this particular data set.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.430
Another example of a viewer-driven visualization is Paths to the White House,

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.510
also by the New York Times.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.680
Here we're presented with a decision tree that highlights the outcome of

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.140
the presidential election,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.090
given how each candidate fares in key swing states like Florida.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.536
The overarching narrative is presented in the beginning.

00:01:34.536 --> 00:01:40.300
That Obama has 84% of the paths to win, while Romney only has 15%.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.100
But the viewer is invited to explore various outcomes by mousing over

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.859
the different paths.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.340
If I'm interested in a particular swing state, such as Ohio,

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.700
I could see that if Romney wins Florida and Obama wins Ohio, Obama wins.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.250
This is a great example of a hybrid between an overarching narrative and

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.240
a viewer-driven visualization.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.270
This allows the viewer to mouse through and

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.729
look at each aspect of the data, and tell their own particular story.
