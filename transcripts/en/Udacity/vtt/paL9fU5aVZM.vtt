00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.522
Now we just finished talking about drug therapy as a biological treatment. So

00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:07.582
let's move on to the second major area of biological treatment and that is

00:00:07.582 --> 00:00:12.004
psychosurgery. Psychosurgeries involve medical procedures on the brain in an

00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:17.227
attempt to alleviate the symptoms of psychological disorders. Now the first

00:00:17.227 --> 00:00:21.046
psycho-surgery going to discuss was actually widely over-used, and had tragic

00:00:21.046 --> 00:00:27.214
consequences including sometimes death. This is the pre-frontal lobotomy. The

00:00:27.214 --> 00:00:30.802
lobotomy involved cutting the connection between the pre-frontal cortex and the

00:00:30.802 --> 00:00:36.175
lower area of the brain. Now this technique is no longer used today. But if you

00:00:36.175 --> 00:00:39.640
think back to the material on lesson three in the brain and behavior, you'll

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.477
see why this procedure dramatically changed the individual. We know that the

00:00:45.477 --> 00:00:48.662
prefrontal cortex is important in thinking, and it's imperative for working

00:00:48.662 --> 00:00:51.749
memory and planned action, and the lower area of the brain is more concerned

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:57.560
with emotion. Therefore, some believe the surgery will have the affect of

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.454
modifying behavior and perhaps disengaging the disruptive thought patterns

00:01:01.454 --> 00:01:07.118
associated with hallucinations and confused thinking. In reality the procedure

00:01:07.118 --> 00:01:11.012
produced profound personality changes, often leaving the person listless or

00:01:11.012 --> 00:01:16.615
appearing absent. In addition there was a likelihood of experiencing seizures.

00:01:16.615 --> 00:01:20.874
In many cases, people were left in a vegetative state. Now the lobotomy was

00:01:20.874 --> 00:01:24.254
performed by taking a sharp instrument and placing it near the corner the eye,

00:01:24.254 --> 00:01:27.530
hammering that in, and then moving the instrument back and forth, thereby,

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.330
modifying or destroying parts of the brain.
