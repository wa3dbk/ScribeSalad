00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.719
Let's take a look at beta first just because it has smaller numbers,

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:05.010
so maybe that's a bit easier to reason about.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.760
Now, as we grow the input size, notice that we're going the input size the linear way.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.750
And as we grow linearly, the time it takes beta also grows relatively linearly.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.610
So we double from 100 to 200, we roughly double as we triple from 100 to 300,

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.340
and we get roughly triple of the initial input size.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.760
16 is pretty close to 18, so I'm going to go ahead and say that beta is linear.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:38.220
Now, alpha just explodes--at 100, it doesn't take a whole lot of timing,

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.460
that takes quite a bit less time in gamma but at N=200,

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.780
alpha is already in the hundreds of thousands and then

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.950
it gets even bigger and bigger very very quickly.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.110
So I think it's reasonable to say that alpha has an exponential running time.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.350
Now, gamma might be a little trickier to see, by I think,

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.560
if you look at the input sizes relative to the running times in gamma,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.080
we can see that it looks to be polynomial.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.460
To see this, let's take a look at N² for this input sizes.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:24.590
N² for 100 is 10⁴ which is quite a bit bigger than gamma's running time.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.270
N² for 200 is similarly much bigger than gamma's running time and on and on.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:39.720
N² is really the lowest polynomial running time you are probably going to get that it is linear?

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.090
And it definitely dominates gamma at least for the instances that we are looking at.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.090
So, I will definitely say that gamma is polynomial in running time.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.790
For more visual representation of this, let's draw a few graphs.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.680
Let's take a look at alpha first.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.550
Now alpha is still very tiny at N=100 and relative to this graph it is still very tiny here.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.720
Here it's quite a bit bigger but still compared to the 10¹³,

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:13.790
10⁹ is actually pretty small and then it's way up here for any of this, 400.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.600
Let's just kind of draw an approximation to that.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.300
This is not a scale but it'll give you an idea for the shape of the graph

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.300
which is really what we're going for.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.800
But in gamma, we really just can't see them on this graph.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.430
They are so close to the x axis here that they might as well just be right on top of it.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.510
So that doesn't really help us.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.550
So clearly alpha is growing just unbelievably faster than both beta and gamma.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.240
So let's zoom in a bit and look at this again.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.670
All right, so now I'm only going up to 10⁴, so that makes gamma fairly easier to draw

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.260
and if this on 100 still, pretty small. At 200, it's closer.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:05.750
At 300, it is about half way there and then it gets about here. So let's go ahead and draw it up.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:14.880
If we try to draw beta, it's still right about here, so it still grows much much slower than gamma does.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.750
As we can see that they're really in different classes because they're both just growing so much slower

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.740
than alpha is, but beta similarly is growing just so much slower than gamma is.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.850
So they're definitely in different classes and this is kind of a visual intuitive representation

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:39.810
of why alpha is exponential, gamma is polynomial, and beta is linear.
