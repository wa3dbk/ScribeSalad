00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.260
The right answer is exokernel. Now so long as SPIN's logical

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.040
protection remains, are entirely following modular

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.900
three language enforced, compile time checking, and run time

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.330
verification, there is no violation of protection In SPIN. But

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.510
we cannot say the same about Exokernel because it is arbitrary code

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.890
that is being downloaded into the kernel

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.990
by a library operating system and that's

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.440
the reason that Exokernel may end up

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.860
compromising protection more than the SPIN mechanism.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.450
But having said that, I should mention that it's not always possible to live

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.010
within modular three enforced protection domains, even

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.700
in SPIN. Because we've seen that even

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.010
in SPIN, in order to do certain things in the hardware, SPIN

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.000
may have to step outside the protection boundaries of

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.440
modular three. In other words, a reality that exists with

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.610
real hardware is that it's not always possible to do this within the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.990
confines of language-enforced protection domains.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.850
But if you just think in terms of the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.620
logical protection domains as defined by SPIN as modular

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.390
three objects. Those have strong guarantees of protection compared

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.140
to arbitrary code that we can download into Exokernel.
