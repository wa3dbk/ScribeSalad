00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.402
As I suggested in the question video, we
can use the distributive property to solve

00:00:04.414 --> 00:00:08.696
this problem. The difference between this
and problems we've done before is that

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:12.360
the factor outside of the second
parentheses, that we want to multiply

00:00:12.372 --> 00:00:16.364
everything in here by, is itself a
polynomial. However, that doesn't change

00:00:16.376 --> 00:00:20.368
how we use the distributive property.
We're still going to take this entire

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.559
quantity and multiply it by each of the
terms in the second parentheses. So the

00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:29.041
first thing we're going to have is
x+2 times x, and then we'll add to that

00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:32.152
x+2 times 3.
Great, so this looks a little bit more

00:00:32.152 --> 00:00:36.511
manageable, or like each piece will be. At
this point, we're going to use a trick

00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:39.827
that we've talked about before. We're
going to use the commutative property of

00:00:39.827 --> 00:00:43.827
multiplication. You might wonder, where
will we use that here, but notice that if

00:00:43.827 --> 00:00:49.697
we rearrange the order of these two terms.
So instead we'll write x times x+2, and you may

00:00:49.697 --> 00:00:54.980
be wondering why is that useful, but as
you can see, if we rearrange the factors

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.818
within each term like this, then we have
what looks like just a standard

00:00:57.818 --> 00:01:01.875
distributive property problem, like you've
done so many times before. Great. We know

00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:05.967
how to handle that, and we can simplify
within each term, rearrange, and combine

00:01:05.967 --> 00:01:10.688
like terms. So our answer is x^2+5x+6.
