00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's look at the answer to our quiz.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.210
We would ask which of these are true.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.480
L1 capacity is less than L2 capacity.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.400
This should be true because
the L2 cache needs to

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.060
have hits for
things that were L1 misses.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.640
So if L2 has the same or
lower capacity than L1.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.240
The not many things that miss in
L1 will actually be hit in L2, and

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.229
we want the L2 to still
have a lot of hits so

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:37.070
that things don't go to even
slower caches or even to memory.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.320
The L1 latency,
should it be less than L2 latency?

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.140
And the answer is yes.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.870
We look first in L1 cache not
because it has a better chance of

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.360
finding the data than the L2 cache, but
because it has a lower hit latency.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.510
The number of accesses in L1 cache,

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.840
is it lower than the number
of accesses in L2 cache?

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.650
This is not true.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.050
All of the accesses, load and
stores, go to L1 cache but

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.880
only those that miss in
L1 cache go to L2 cache.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.050
So, the L2 cache usually has
a lot fewer accesses than L1 and

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.000
finally, L1 associativity needs
to be equal to L2 associativity.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.480
This is potentially true,
but usually it isn't.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.640
Why?
Well because the L1 cache needs to have

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.530
a low hit latency and need not
have the capacity of the L2 cache.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.160
Similarly for associativity the L1
cache because it needs to be fast

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.320
can have a lower associativity where
as the L2 cache can be slower so

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.480
we can maybe afford
a higher associativities.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.450
So typically that's what happens,
L1 has a lower associativity than L2.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.900
So this is also not true.
