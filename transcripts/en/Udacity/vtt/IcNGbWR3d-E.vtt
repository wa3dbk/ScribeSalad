00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.254
Let me show you what I did. I simply followed the pseudo-code that we developed

00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:08.188
before. The first line already matches. Now I have to know whether there are

00:00:08.188 --> 00:00:11.776
more values. Well, the value'=s already in this doubles. And there's a queue at

00:00:11.776 --> 00:00:16.160
the end. So I'll simply call the has next double method. Next I need to read

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.560
another input. I do that here. Then if the input is larger than the largest

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.174
value seen so far, I need to update the largest value. That's here and here.

00:00:24.174 --> 00:00:28.607
Let's give it a try. Here's my prompt. I'll just enter the values that we had

00:00:28.607 --> 00:00:32.982
with the cards. Here are the inputs and the Q to terminate, and I'm told the

00:00:32.982 --> 00:00:35.199
largest value is eight.
