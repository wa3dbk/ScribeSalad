00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.600
Here's a diagram that involves a group of classes and we're going to assume,

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.470
that our contacts class is the customer class in the upper left hand corner.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.610
Now let's say that you would like to write a constraint that involved,

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.300
the date in which an order was made. Remember you're in the cu,

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.180
you're in the customer class. To do that, you can use this

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:27.680
series of steps each separated by a period. You can say self.order.date.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.240
Self is your class, order is the next class along the chain, and

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.020
date is the attribute, of that particular class.
