00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.040
These are the correct factors for each part of the fractions. I know factoring

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.592
can be tough, so if you're getting at least half of these right, great work. If

00:00:07.592 --> 00:00:11.313
you got stuck on one of these, try to look back at your work and see where you

00:00:11.313 --> 00:00:15.305
went wrong to get these factors. If you can't find an error in your work then

00:00:15.305 --> 00:00:19.500
stay with me for this solution. For our first numerator we can pull out a 2x

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.190
from each term. So we'll have 2x times x squared minus 6x plus 9. Then we notice

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.626
that this is a special factoring pattern. It's a perfect square trinomial. So we

00:00:29.626 --> 00:00:35.557
have 2x times x minus 3, times x minus 3. This gives us our first numerator. For

00:00:35.557 --> 00:00:40.117
this denominator, we want to find the factors of negative 12, that sum to

00:00:40.117 --> 00:00:44.063
negative 4. This allows us to rewrite our middle term. And then we'll use

00:00:44.063 --> 00:00:48.581
factoring by grouping to get 3x plus 2 times x minus 2. This is our factored

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:53.356
form for our first denominator. For this numerator we want to find the factors

00:00:53.356 --> 00:00:58.442
of 12 that sum to negative 8. These two factors are negative 6, 6 and negative

00:00:58.442 --> 00:01:03.928
2. We'll use factoring by grouping to get 3x minus 2 time x minus 2 for this

00:01:03.928 --> 00:01:09.403
numerator. And finally for this last denominator we pull out a 6x from both

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:14.363
terms leaving us with 6x times x squared minus 9. Then we can factor this

00:01:14.363 --> 00:01:18.771
difference of squares using x plus 3 times x minus 3. This difference of squares

00:01:18.771 --> 00:01:22.754
pattern appears in all sorts of math. So it's great that we can recognize it

00:01:22.754 --> 00:01:23.360
quickly.
