00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.600
There's some other terms related to architecture that I"d like to mention for

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.910
a minute just so that if we come across them later, you'll know what I was

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.713
intending. The first one is conceptual architecture. Obviously, the word

00:00:13.713 --> 00:00:19.026
conceptual connotes that it's vague or high level. The reason is fake or

00:00:19.026 --> 00:00:23.785
high level is that it's often produced very early in the development process,

00:00:23.785 --> 00:00:28.600
in fact before you may even have a complete idea of what the requirements are.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.485
Conceptual architectures are often produces a way to begin the planning process.

00:00:33.485 --> 00:00:37.650
Okay, by having an idea of what at a very high level the components and

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.730
connectors are going to be, you can begin to block out what the teams might look

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.120
like and how long it's going to take to produce the ultimate program. A pair of

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.087
other terms to be aware of is the As-Intended versus the As-Built architecture.

00:00:52.087 --> 00:00:55.793
During the planning process, the architectural planning process in

00:00:55.793 --> 00:01:00.248
which the architectural team decides on what the architecture is going to be and

00:01:00.248 --> 00:01:02.007
produces some documentation for

00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:06.900
that, the result is the As-Intended architecture. However, during the course of

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.620
actual construction of the program, something else may be built, and

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.940
we'll call that the As-Built architecture. There are several reasons why

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.250
the As-Built may not match ideally with the As-Intended. It may be the case, for

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.860
example, that during the course of refinement, the development team

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.120
comes across a available component, whether it's open source or

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.800
from another group, that can short cut the development process by

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.660
providing some needed functionality. But that additional piece may not match

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.640
identically with what was intended in the architectural plan.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.040
This process by which the As-Intended becomes the As-Built is sometimes called

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.010
architectural drift. And if it happens during software maintenance, that is,

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.310
after the program is released and the maintenance team then is dealing with bugs

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.690
and enhancement suggestions, the term is sometimes called architectural erosion.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.970
This may arise because the maintenance team, under time pressure to

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.990
get the fixes out to the customers, may not make the ideal fix that

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.130
would be done if, if the original development were done in a way that was aware

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.110
of this particular problem or enhancement. and, perhaps also didn't go back and

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.860
make the appropriate changes to the architectural documentation.
