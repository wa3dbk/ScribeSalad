00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.480
So the answer, the first one is a valid string; it

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.970
has a double quote followed by another double quote, and a sequence

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.670
of characters between the double quotes. The second one is not

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.540
a valid string, and the reason it's not is because it starts

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.900
with a single quote, but ends with a double quote. A

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.660
valid string must start with the same kind of quote it ends

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.130
with. The third one is also not a valid string, and

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.550
the reason for that is it starts with a double quote but

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.810
there's no double quote that closes the string. The fourth

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.540
one is a name, this is a variable, it's possible it

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.720
could be defined to be a valid string, but without defining

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.619
Ada as some string, it's not a valid string by itself.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.130
The surprising one, might be the last one. This

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.070
is a valid string, it starts with a single

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.410
quote, it ends with a single quote and it's

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.860
perfectly okay to have a double quote in the middle.
