00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.184
So Henry and his family were so desperate to have these epileptic seizures stop

00:00:05.184 --> 00:00:10.686
that he agreed to brain surgery. And so the doctors, in fact, took out the

00:00:10.686 --> 00:00:16.938
hippocampi, both sides bilaterally. And it worked, the seizures stopped in both

00:00:16.938 --> 00:00:24.765
severity and frequency. But at a horrible cost. Henry could no longer form new

00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:28.136
long term memories. So, for instance, he would forget what he had for breakfast

00:00:28.136 --> 00:00:32.313
that day. He could work for hours and hours with a psychologist. But if she

00:00:32.313 --> 00:00:35.661
went away for 15 or 20 minutes and came back, he would forget completely who

00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:42.687
she was. He would also be able to watch TV. Follow along with the program, but

00:00:42.687 --> 00:00:45.353
as soon as a commercial came along, he would forget what the program was and

00:00:45.353 --> 00:00:51.169
what it was about. He also, with difficulty, with concentration, could solve a

00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:55.655
crossword puzzle. But if he was interrupted at all, he would forget what he was

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:57.989
doing. And not be able to solve it.
