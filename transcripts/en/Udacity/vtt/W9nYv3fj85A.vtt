00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.920
Let's think some more about the size and
the shape of the view point.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.650
Think about the way you use devices.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.650
Phones and tablet's are often used in
portrait orientation whereas a full

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.906
screen browser window on
a laptop is landscape.

00:00:16.906 --> 00:00:21.720
Now, even though you can't change
the window size on a phone or tablet,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.230
these devices.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.260
Have another rather tricky feature
when it comes to responsive resizing.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.310
Orientation can change, and
when it comes to landscape and portrait,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.620
you need to think about
content as well as size.

00:00:35.645 --> 00:00:39.075
Tola square images can work well
in portrait mode on a phone but

00:00:39.075 --> 00:00:42.425
wide images can be a real problem.

00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:45.605
Again for responsive design
the golden rule is don't

00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:48.376
assume the viewport size
will always stay the same.

00:00:49.707 --> 00:00:53.507
You'll learn the impact of image choice
and art direction later in the course

00:00:53.507 --> 00:00:55.737
when you find out how to
use the picture element.

00:00:55.737 --> 00:00:56.777
And later in this lesson,

00:00:56.777 --> 00:01:00.217
we'll look at ways to work with
orientation using media queries.
