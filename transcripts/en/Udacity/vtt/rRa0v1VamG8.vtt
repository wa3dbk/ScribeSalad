Here is how I did this. I added a string parameter picture name an 'int'

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.862
parameter 'x' coordinate and an 'int' parameter 'y' coordinate. Now as well as

00:00:09.862 --> 00:00:14.470
setting name and friends, I create a picture using the picture name and then I

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:22.082
translate it to the 'x' and 'y' coordinates and draw it. Good work if you got

00:00:22.082 --> 00:00:23.467
that.
