00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.385
Here's the answer. 3 has type int. 3, once, we have the dot. Now, it's not an

00:00:05.385 --> 00:00:09.922
integer, it's a float. And we've seen things behave differently, like division

00:00:09.922 --> 00:00:13.520
when our values have the dot after them. The reason for that was division

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.640
defined on floats means something different than division defined on integers.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.097
True it has type bool, it's a Boolean. None, the name of the type of None is

00:00:22.097 --> 00:00:26.715
NoneType. So, None is actually a value. When a function doesn't return anything,

00:00:26.715 --> 00:00:30.621
the value that we get back is actually a value of None, which is an object and

00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:36.730
has the type NoneType. The string udacious is a string, its actual type is an

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.404
str. You can see that by doing type of udacious or any other string. We call it

00:00:41.404 --> 00:00:45.499
a string and it makes sense, that's easier to pronounce, but the actual name of

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:49.430
the type is str. This squiggles here, well, this creates an empty dictionary.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.850
And dictionary has type dict. And finally the brackets, create an empty list,

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.193
which has typed list.
