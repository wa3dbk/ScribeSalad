00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.790
So, this is what I've come up with.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.640
I have the modal's HTML, inside the body of our page.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.630
It has its own unique id, which in this case is project1.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.000
It's got its own label, which is Favorite App Page.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.020
And then inside modal-body, we have some custom content, including an image and

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.870
a big block of text.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.630
At the very bottom, we've got a button here that will close our modal.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.560
Scrolling up.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.010
We see that for the image, for the same Favorite App project,

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.000
we've got a new attribute called data-toggle and it's equal to modal.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.980
And the target is of course project1.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.420
Put it all together and we get to come to our page.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.650
