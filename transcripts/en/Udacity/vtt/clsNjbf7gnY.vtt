00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.790
So in this lesson we've learned about two of the most commonly used methods in

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.975
psychological science, cor-relational and experimental designs. In

00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:10.820
correlational studies, two variables are studied such as the amount of

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.660
housework and the number of sexual encounters. As it turns out these two things

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.570
were related but remember that correlations tell us only about the strength and

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.080
direction of the relationship. Not whether one causes the other. And

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.300
experimental studies, if done correctly, can shed light on whether one variable

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.340
causes another. But true experiments have to have two conditions met, first,

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.830
random assignment of participants to either a control or an experimental

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.640
condition. And if these two conditions are treated exactly the same. Except the

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.730
experimental group gets the treatment, or the predicted cause, whereas the

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.460
control group, does not, and serves as a baseline comparison. By giving two

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.770
groups different amounts of something, we're manipulating a variable. And this

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.400
leads to the second condition of an experiment. So the second condition of an

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.220
experiment is manipulation of an independent variable. And an independent

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.050
variable, we'll remember, is something that the investigator manipulates. So

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.950
for instance, the amount of caffeine given. The experiment also has a dependent

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.230
variable, or an outcome variable, in this case, it could be reaction time. So

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.700
if the amount of caffeine really does have an effect, we can say that our

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.220
independent variable, or caffeine, is the cause. And the dependent variable, or

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.220
reaction time, is the effect. And it depends upon the independent variable. So,

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.980
psychological scientists use these and many other kinds of research methods.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.950
But the key is that psychology makes use of the scientific method to answer

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.720
questions about human nature, human thought, and human behavior. So,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.270
psychological scientists can't do whatever they want in their research. They

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.530
have to do what's ethical and their proposals always have to be approved By an

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.946
ethics board or an IRB.
