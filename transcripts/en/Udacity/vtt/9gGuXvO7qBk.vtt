00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.830
The least common multiple of X plus 2 and 2x minus 4 is just their product, X

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.211
plus 2 times X minus 4. In order to make our first fraction have that

00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:14.202
denominator, we need to multiply it by 2x minus over 2x minus 4. And we need to

00:00:14.202 --> 00:00:19.100
multiply by the second fraction to have achieve the same end goal by X plus 2

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.780
over X plus 2. Once I've written out what each of these fractions is With the

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.786
same denominator, I can think about how to combine the numerators. We'll be able

00:00:28.786 --> 00:00:33.445
to just add the numerators together since they have the same denominator. So,

00:00:33.445 --> 00:00:37.991
when we do that, the numerators going to be 2X minus 4 minus 3 times X plus 2.

00:00:37.991 --> 00:00:42.377
So, I'll simplify that and then put it in the fraction, this is just going to

00:00:42.377 --> 00:00:47.332
save me some space. This simplifies to negative X minus 10. Or if I want to pull

00:00:47.332 --> 00:00:52.733
out a factor of negative 1, negative in parentheses x plus 10. Then I can write

00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:57.630
the negative sign outside of the entire fraction and put x plus 10 as the

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.481
numerator.
