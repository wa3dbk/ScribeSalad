00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.407
If we try to fold any of the curves on this graph across the y-axis,

00:00:06.407 --> 00:00:09.764
none of them are going to map over to themselves. 
So, they must not have symmetry across the y-axis.

00:00:09.764 --> 00:00:14.680
The same is true of the x-axis when we try it there.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.160
Folding them in half along this line is not going to make points up here match points down here,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.432
because they're on opposite sides of the y-axis.

00:00:23.432 --> 00:00:28.115
So, it looks like neither of these 2 symmetries applies in the case of odd functions.

00:00:28.115 --> 00:00:32.631
However, let's look at these last 2 choices.
Maybe one of them works.

00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:36.909
We know that this is a property of even functions, that points equidistant from the y-axis have the same y value.

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:41.974
But it doesn't look like this is true of odd functions.

00:00:41.974 --> 00:00:46.990
If I pick some x coordinate like 5,
and I find the given y coordinate,

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.650
then finding the opposite x coordinate,
negative 5 does not give me the same y coordinate.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.352
It's all the way down here, instead of up here.
However, these y coordinates are related.

00:00:56.352 --> 00:01:01.379
This one is the negative version of this one.
So that means this last rule is true.
