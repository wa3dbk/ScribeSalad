00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now we'll have some questions about modes of operation.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This question is to see if you understand the modes of operation of symmetric ciphers.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Which of the modes of operation can perform most of the work

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to do decryption in parallel?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And by most, I mean the expensive operations,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
which are the encryption operations, not the XOR, which is very inexpensive.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
They can be performed at the same time using different processors.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
In the lecture unit, we talked about this for encryption.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Here I'm asking about it for decryption.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
These are the 4 modes to consider.

00:00:31.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check all of the modes that can do decryption in parallel.
