00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.566
To get 0 on the right-hand side, we just subtract the fraction we originally had

00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:08.962
there from both sides. So we end up with 1 over x plus 2, minus 3 over 2x minus

00:00:08.962 --> 00:00:13.453
4, and that's greater than 0. We don't have to flip the sign here or anything,

00:00:13.453 --> 00:00:18.262
because we're just subtracting, we're not multiplying or dividing by a negative.
