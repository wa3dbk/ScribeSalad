00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.906
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now we're going to want to solve our new equation, which you'll notice I

00:00:03.906 --> 00:00:07.866
switched the order of the sides, because I just like looking at it better this

00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:12.285
way. We now have the quantity x minus 4 times the quantity x plus 3 equaling 0.

00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:16.567
Now the question is, which values of x satisfy this equation? I'm not going to

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:20.767
tell you how many values there are, but I'd like you to write as many as you

00:00:20.767 --> 00:00:24.967
find all in this box. And if you get more then one answer, I'd like you to

00:00:24.967 --> 00:00:27.478
separate each of your answers by commas.
