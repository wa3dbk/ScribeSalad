00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.709
With joint variation, though, the variations do not both need to be direct. One

00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:08.615
quantity might have direct variation, while the other might have inverse

00:00:08.615 --> 00:00:13.210
variation. For example, if x and y had direct variation, they would both

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.929
increase, or they would both decrease. And if z varied inversely with x, then if

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:24.435
x increased, z would have to decrease. When setting up the proportion, this

00:00:24.435 --> 00:00:28.725
means that since x varies directly with y, they will be directly across from one

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:33.443
another. But since x varies inversely with z, we'll see this z quantity in the

00:00:33.443 --> 00:00:38.266
denominator. We flip this fraction. So let's assume this is still true. X is

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:42.926
varying directly with y, and inversely with z. If the value of x is 10 when y

00:00:42.926 --> 00:00:48.923
equals 5 and z equals 6. I want you to find the value of x when y is 7 and z is

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:55.524
1. As a hint, this is one case, this x could be 10, this y is 5, and this z is

00:00:55.524 --> 00:01:00.727
6. So you try and fill in the other values and then solve for x. And keep in

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:05.325
mind in the setup, we had direct variation with y, so this is directly across

00:01:05.325 --> 00:01:09.615
from each other Whereas we had inverse variation with c. This c is a

00:01:09.615 --> 00:01:15.893
denominator. Write your answer for x here. You can also think about we're really

00:01:15.893 --> 00:01:18.865
finding x too, this value. Good luck.
