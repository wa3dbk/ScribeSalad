00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.488
First we look for a greatest common factor. The only factor shared between the

00:00:04.488 --> 00:00:08.206
three terms is 1, so we don't need to worry about that. We want to find the

00:00:08.206 --> 00:00:14.462
factor pair of 42 that sums to 17. That must be positive 3 and positive 14. We

00:00:14.462 --> 00:00:20.128
can rewrite 17x with 3x and 14x. Then we use factoring by grouping to get our

00:00:20.128 --> 00:00:25.241
final answer. Great work if you got all or even part of it correct. I know this

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:27.463
factor pair was probably hard to find.
