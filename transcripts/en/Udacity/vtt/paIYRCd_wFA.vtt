00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.473
Let's look at the code again. This is our tile per element kernel. And this syncthreads is the problem.

00:00:07.473 --> 00:00:15.397
Remember we have a thread block of K by K threads, and at the moment, K is set to 32.

00:00:15.397 --> 00:00:18.659
So, we have a thread block of 1024 threads,

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:22.352
and if you think about it, each thread is doing very little work.

00:00:22.352 --> 00:00:27.997
It's reading a single word into shared memory, and then it's waiting around at the barrier

00:00:27.997 --> 00:00:32.390
until all the other threads get done with their job, and then it's writing a single word to memory.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.772
So most of the threads in this block are spending most

00:00:36.772 --> 00:00:41.606
of their time waiting on the syncthreads call, waiting on this barrier for everybody else to get there.

00:00:41.606 --> 00:00:45.227
And the more threads in the block, the more time on average they spend waiting.

00:00:45.227 --> 00:00:49.334
So for a simple kernel like this, most threads spend a large chunk of their lifetime

00:00:49.334 --> 00:00:53.672
simply waiting at this barrier until the last few threads complete their read operations.

00:00:53.672 --> 00:00:56.776
So, what can we do to reduce the average wait time per thread?

00:00:56.776 --> 00:00:59.196
Should we eliminate the syncthreads call?

00:00:59.196 --> 00:01:02.639
Should we reduce the number of threads per thread block?

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:05.425
Or should we increase the number of threads per thread block,

00:01:05.425 --> 00:01:08.819
or perhaps increase the number of thread blocks per SM?
