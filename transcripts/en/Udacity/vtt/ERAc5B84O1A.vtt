00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.392
It is being a while since we were with Athena. So let us get back to talking

00:00:03.392 --> 00:00:08.952
about her life. Now Athena lives in California, in the Bay area to be exact. To

00:00:08.952 --> 00:00:11.706
tell a more about you, here is the Pacific Ocean and here is West of

00:00:11.706 --> 00:00:16.149
California. Here is San Francisco Bay. It is a pretty beautiful area to live

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:20.979
in. And she goes to school in Saint Jose Bay right down here. And all of these

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:24.761
little cities lie right along the bay now, sometimes Athena likes to take a

00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:28.543
non-stop train from San Jose, all the way up to San Francisco, which is this

00:00:28.543 --> 00:00:34.533
northern city right here. Along the train line, which I have drawn in red right

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:39.466
here, are a bunch of other stations. Including Sunnyvale, Mount View, Palo

00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:45.378
Alto, Redwood City, San Mateo and Millbrae. So, let me ask you a question. If

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:48.834
Athena wants to take that nonstop train starting in San Jose and going all the

00:00:48.834 --> 00:00:52.290
way up to San Francisco, which stations must the train pass through along the

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.154
way? Remember the red path here is the train track. It doesn't branch off

00:00:58.154 --> 00:01:01.163
anywhere. it just follows this path exactly.
