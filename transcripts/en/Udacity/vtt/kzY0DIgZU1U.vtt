00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.272
We want to find factors of 10 that sum to negative 7. Well, the two factors must

00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:10.040
be negative 2 and negative 5. We can rewrite the middle term using minus 2x and

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.052
minus 5x, from these factors. Then, we do our factoring by grouping and our

00:00:15.052 --> 00:00:19.123
final answer is x minus 5 times x minus 2. This stuff right here is the

00:00:19.123 --> 00:00:23.185
trickiest part. We need to factor out a negative 5 from both of these terms. If

00:00:23.185 --> 00:00:28.450
I factor out a negative 5 from positive 10, I'm left with negative 2. Remember

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.360
that you can check your work by distributing. This allows us to be sure that

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.850
we've done factoring by grouping correctly. Moving this way would be factoring,

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.966
so if we distribute, we would be undoing that process. Nice work with your

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:44.613
negative numbers and your factoring if you got that one correct.
