00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Norvig] I know there can be matters of opinion here,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
but from my point of view they're all reasonable.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So they would all work. They'd all be fine.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
But for the moment, this one looks just a little bit simpler, so I'm going to go with that

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
until I have some proof that the simple won't work

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and that we'll have to go to something more complicated.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
In this approach we named the properties.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We talked about the possibility of whether you have to do that or not.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Here we aren't naming them, and so it will be up to me as the programmer

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
to manage the groups of properties.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Here's 1 way I could do it.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I could simultaneously assign the 5 properties that are in the same group of color

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
to the 5 houses.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Of course this would only be 1 of the possible assignments.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
After I tried this one, I'd have to try another assignment--

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
maybe [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]--

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and I'd have to go through all the possibilities.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Can you think of a good way to do that?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
What statement or other implementation can you come up with

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
to have the 5 properties go through all the combinations of possible houses?

00:01:05.000 --> 09:59:59.000
And if you want, pause the video now and try to think of that on your own.
