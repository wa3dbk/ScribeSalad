00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.550
Second problem area is sometimes called object schizophrenia. And this is,

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.225
an example of this was the visitor pattern, where we split off

00:00:08.225 --> 00:00:13.140
the functionality having to do with the elements into a separate place where all

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.550
the operations were contained. In a sense, this beaks delegation.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.890
It has also been called the self problem. When you delegate responsibility to

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.430
perform part of a computation to methods in your attributes, as opposed to

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.640
handling them yourself. This can lead to additional complexity, particularly

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.230
when you're trying to debug and find out where something went wrong.
