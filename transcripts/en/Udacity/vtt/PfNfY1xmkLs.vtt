00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.029
That's the case in general.

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:08.940
If you have N inputs, and K outputs,
you have (N+1)K parameters to use.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.010
Not one more.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.050
The thing is, you might want to use
many, many more parameters in practice.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.770
Also, it's linear.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.310
This means that the kind of interactions
that you're capable of representing with

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.500
that model is somewhat limited.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.100
For example, if two inputs
interact in an additive way,

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.950
your model can represent them
well as a matrix multiply.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.090
But if two inputs interact in the way
that the outcome depends on the product

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.720
of the two for

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.260
example, you won't be able to model
that efficiently with a linear model.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.790
Linear operations
are really nice though.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.920
Big matrix multiplies are exactly
what GPUs were designed for.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.260
They're relatively cheap and
very, very fast.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.060
Numerically linear
operations are very stable.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.100
We can show mathematically that
small changes in the input

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.560
can never yield big
changes in the output.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.630
The derivates are very nice too.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.680
The derivative of a linear
function is constant.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.070
You can't get more stable
numerically than a constant.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.040
So, we would like to keep our parameters
inside big linear functions, but

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.510
we would also want the entire
model to be nonlinear.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.510
We can't just keep multiplying
our inputs by linear functions,

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.060
because that's just equivalent
to one big linear function.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.395
So, we're going to have to
introduce non-linearities.
