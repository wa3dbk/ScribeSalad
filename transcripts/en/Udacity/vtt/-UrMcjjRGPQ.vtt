Now that you have you have your SHA1
fingerprint, let's take a moment to go

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.380
over the four steps that you'll
need to take to set up maps.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.840
In order, the first thing that you'll do
is to set up billing for your account.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.610
Then you're going to create a project,
then you're going to enable maps on that

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.890
project, and finally,
you're going to set up the credentials.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.560
Once you've gone through
this process once,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.250
you wont have to set up billing again.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.040
You only do it once for all
the applications under a single project.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.190
But for future apps you may have to
do some of the last three steps.
