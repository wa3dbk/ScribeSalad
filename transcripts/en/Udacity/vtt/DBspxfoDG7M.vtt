00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.770
HIEs can vary substantially in scope.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.480
An HIE can serve a single health
enterprise that may consist of

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.990
more than one hospital,
many physician practices, and

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.490
other entities such as nursing homes or
rehabilitation facilities.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.020
These entities may have electronic
medical records from different vendors

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.590
so interoperability can be an issue
even within a single health system or

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.200
enterprise.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.610
Some health systems extend their HIE to
practices that refer patients to them

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.920
in an effort to make that easier and
thereby attract more referrals.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.750
This is often called a Service Area HIE.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.360
In an effort to better position
the health system to contract under

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.440
arrangements like an ACO,
it is increasingly common for

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.020
them to actually acquire these
outlying medical practices,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.660
in which case they would definitely want
them included in the enterprise HIE.
