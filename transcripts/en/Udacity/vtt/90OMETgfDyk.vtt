00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.810
So, we are going to spend a little more time with population parameters and

00:00:04.822 --> 00:00:09.690
samples statistics. Let's say that we have these memory scores. And, what if I

00:00:09.702 --> 00:00:14.685
pick the sample from this population that consisted of these scores. Now, just a

00:00:14.697 --> 00:00:19.630
point of clarification, populations are generally much bigger than this. But

00:00:19.642 --> 00:00:24.250
we're just going to pretend that this is the population, and we are choosing

00:00:24.262 --> 00:00:29.169
these three scores for a sample. Will the average of the sample be greater than,

00:00:29.274 --> 00:00:33.216
equal to, or less than the population average? What do you think?
