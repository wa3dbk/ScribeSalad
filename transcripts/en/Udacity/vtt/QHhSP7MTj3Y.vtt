00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The second problem--the decision about what ciphers

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and hash functions to use--is based on these clear text messages.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
An attacker who tampers with these can make the client and server

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
use some very weak cipher and then be able to break messages encrypted without cipher.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This was really a problem because US Export Control Law is meant

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
that some of these ciphers were very weak.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It was necessary to support ciphers that use only a 40-bit key to satisfy US laws.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
That meant the encryption was weak enough that it could easily be broken by brute force.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The solution to this is to make sure that these messages are also authenticated.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
That canâ€™t be done at the beginning because there is no key established yet,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but that can be done at later steps.
