00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.847
So you see that when we compare samples, we're simply extending the idea of the

00:00:03.847 --> 00:00:08.537
t test. We can compare samples to each other by seeing how far each sample mean

00:00:08.537 --> 00:00:11.843
is from the mean of means, or the grand mean, and this is between group

00:00:11.843 --> 00:00:17.389
variability. But we also want to look at the variability of each sample, and

00:00:17.389 --> 00:00:22.518
that's within group variability. Because this impacts whether or not the

00:00:22.518 --> 00:00:28.320
samples are significantly different. Since we're analyzing variabilities, this

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.068
process is called analysis of variance, shortened to ANOVA. ANOVA can compare

00:00:34.068 --> 00:00:39.282
as many means as we want with just one test. We say one way ANOVA when we have

00:00:39.282 --> 00:00:44.952
one independent variable sometimes called a factor. In this course we'll only

00:00:44.952 --> 00:00:46.964
work with one way ANOVA.
