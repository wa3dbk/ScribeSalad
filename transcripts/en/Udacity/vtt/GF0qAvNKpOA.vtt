00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.593
You may have figured out we first need to convert 240 to the z score. In other

00:00:05.593 --> 00:00:11.313
words we want to find out how many standard deviations away from the mean, 190,

00:00:11.313 --> 00:00:16.778
240 is. So it's going to be one point something. So first we take the distance

00:00:16.778 --> 00:00:22.410
between 190 and 240, and then we divide by the standard deviation, to find out

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.254
how many standard deviations fit into that distance. So we get about 1.39. We

00:00:28.254 --> 00:00:34.398
have to round to the hundredths place, because the z table we have doesn't get

00:00:34.398 --> 00:00:40.523
more precise than that. So our z score is 1.39, so let's bring up the table.

00:00:40.523 --> 00:00:46.919
First, we find 1.3. And we find 0.09, which is the last column. And we find that

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:53.718
the area, less than a standard deviation of 1.39 is 0.9177. So this means that

00:00:53.718 --> 00:01:00.668
approximately 91.77% of people will have less than 240 Facebook friends. And

00:01:00.668 --> 00:01:07.730
remember, this is all assuming that this is a normal distribution with mean 190

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.192
and standard deviation 36.
