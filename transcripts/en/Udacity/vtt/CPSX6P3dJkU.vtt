00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This brings us to a slightly more interesting problem called the Top K Problem.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Here's the idea. Imagine we've got our list of values L, and there's n values in the list.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We can compute the max or the second max, the second largest, just like we've been doing,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but in some sense, it doesn't really give you a very representative sample of what the list is about.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Sometimes, it's nice to have a bit more.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Let's imagine that this list is sorted though it turns out at one half to actually be sorted.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And imagine, they're going to focus on just the ones that would be at the k best out of the n.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It could be the k small as to the k largest depending on the particular application that you're considering.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
But knowing a bunch of the ones near the top

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
instead of just the very tippe top can very instructive.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
One natural strategy is to iterate the max procedure so go through the list, find the max,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
pull it out of the list, so the list is now in -1 long and then repeat this.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Each time we compute the max, it will be actually the second, the third, the fourth largest

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
from original list, but it's always the max of the current list.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The simply pretty reasonable thing to do especially if k is small.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
You just need one or two or three at the top values.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Another natural thing to do is just sort the whole list.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Once we sorted the whole list, the first k elements of that sorted list are exactly the ones that we want.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This is actually a very simple way of doing it.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
In Python, it can just be essentially one or two statements. Insertion is another strategy.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This is the generalization of the solution that I gave for the find the second best example before.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
In that example, I kept track of both of the best and the second best,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and then it was running through the list.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
In each new element of a list that was encountered, figure out where it would fit into that top two lists.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
If it was smaller than both of those, ignore it.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
If it's bigger than both of those, put it at the top of the list and bump the list down and so forth.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
As always, we're trying to find the best algorithm that we can use to run on our data.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Which of these algorithms has the best Θ?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And I'm going to give a hint. We're looking for the top k out of the list of n elements,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
but we're going to look at this question for different values of k.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000
In particular, if k is half of the list, we want the largest half of the list.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
The question is are we better of using selection or insertion?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Both of these are going to have the same Θ for all these examples so I just grouped them together

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:41.000
or is it better to sort the whole list keeping in mind that sorting is a Θ of a log n operation.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Let's say you want to find the best root and items. Is it better to use selection or sorting?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:57.000
If you want the top log n items, which one is better? This function is the logarithm of the logarithm of n.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
As slow growing as logarithm turns out to be, this is even slower or growing,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
the logarithm of the logarithm of n, so which one would you choose?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
In that case, n finally, let's say you want the top 100.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
This is a common thing that you see on the internet a lot, the top 100 movies,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
the top 100 Beatles songs, the top 100 times I've used the phrase top 100.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
There's a lot of different contexts in which this appears.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And if you're going to do that, are you better of using a selection

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
or insertion algorithm or to sort the whole list?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
What I would like you to do is for each of these columns,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
check this box or that box or if they are Θ of each other.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
In other words, from an asymptotic standpoint, in this algorithm,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:54.000
we'll run the same worse case asymptotically then check both of the boxes.
