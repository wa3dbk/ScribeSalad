00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.902
Whenever we start factoring, we want to first look for a GCF, a Greatest Common

00:00:04.902 --> 00:00:09.820
Factor. There is a Greatest Common Factor for these two terms, it's 3. So I can

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.150
see that I have a GCF times the quantity a squared minus b squared. The a is

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.921
really 3x and the b is really 2. So to factor this pattern, we use a plus b

00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:26.462
times a minus b. We want to make sure we include our GCF in the front, and then

00:00:26.462 --> 00:00:31.003
we have 3x plus 2, times 3x minus 2, our a plus b, and a minus b.
