00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In a project as big as a JavaScript interpreter in a web browser,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
we will make mistakes.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And in fact, even a single word flip can be deadly.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Consider this hypothetical utterance from Joan of Arc:

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I would rather have a sandwich then be burned alive.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Up here we've got the sandwich, here we've got the fire.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The meaning of this single word really, really matters in this sentence.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Then actually means "and subsequently."

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
For most of us, I would rather have a sandwich and subsequently be burned alive

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
is not actually what we would go for.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So the difference between then and than--a single word in a natural language--

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
changes the meaning almost entirely.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Joan of Arc was a French national heroine and martyr,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and although it's easy to imagine these sorts of single word flips in natural languages,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
we're going to see the same problem in constructed languages like JavaScript or HTML.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We're going to have to get every word right in order for the meaning to be correct,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and this is a big project.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
That means we will need to focus some of our efforts on removing or finding mistakes,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and that process is called debugging in computer science.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
For example, suppose when we were writing out the if-then-else part

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
of our JavaScript interpreter we made a single mistake.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
We pull the conditional expression from the oneth element of the tree,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
we pull the then branch from the second element of the tree,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and we pull the else branch from the third element of the tree.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Then we evaluate the conditional expression in the environment,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and if it's true, we execute the else statements,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and if it's false, we execute the then branch statements.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Did you catch the mistake?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
We've swapped these 2 lines.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
If the conditional comes out true, we will mistakenly go to the else branch.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
If the conditional comes out false, we'll mistakenly go to the then branch.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
We'll get almost every program incorrect.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
But not actually every program, and this is a skill in debugging.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
What we want to do is make a test case, a sample JavaScript programmer web page,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
that will show off this mistake, where the answer won't be what we expected.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So here I've written down 4 candidate JavaScript programs that we might use

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
as test cases to notice this mistake.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
In this multiple multiple choice quiz, what I would like you to do

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
is select each test case that will actually show off the mistake.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
That is, imagine our interpreter has this bug in it and we feed it this input.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Will we get the same answer we expect from reasoning in our minds,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
or will we get something different?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
If we get something different than what we expect, then we know there's a bug,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and we can get started on fixing it.

00:02:39.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Which of these inputs will highlight this bug?
