00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.240
Here's the plan for this lesson.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.680
We'll start by outlining this general
design technique of dynamic programming.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.480
Then we'll see three examples
in the sequence alignment or

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.170
edit distance problem.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.930
This is also a very minor
generalization of the longest

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.860
common subsequence problem.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.930
Also in the chain matrix
multiplication problem.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.180
Where we're given a sequence
of matrices to multiply and

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.358
we want to place the parentheses in
the right order to do it efficiently.

00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:30.640
And the all-pairs shortest
paths problems for the graph.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.870
Good references for these topics
are Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.270
Vazirani, their book on Algorithms.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.210
And the classic Cormen,
Leiserson, Rivest,

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.990
Stein, Introduction to Algorithms.
