00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.460
To get started,
let's create a disc folder

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.670
that holds all generated files
separate form the source files.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.810
This wasn't a problem with sass as we
generated the CSS into a separate high

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:12.699
level CSS folder.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.100
But it would be with JavaScript
because we don't want our source and

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.630
distribution files to co-mingle.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.680
The process is pretty simple.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.333
We first copy our index.html
into the dist folder,

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:29.928
then generate our css into dist css, and

00:00:29.928 --> 00:00:35.444
finally generate our combined
JavaScript file into dist JS.

00:00:35.444 --> 00:00:37.724
Since we've already got our CSS set up,

00:00:37.724 --> 00:00:41.340
let's change what's needed
in our styles task.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.890
Here's our styles task
in the grunt file.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.000
And we can see our destination is
set to just the CSS directory.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.210
To make it show up under
this dist directory here,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.860
we just changed
the destination to dist/css.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.800
And, when we run gulp styles, we can see
that the files have been generated and

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.990
dropped in the correct folder.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.630
Next, let's copy the index.html
in images to the dist folder.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.270
We simply set up two new tasks and

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.056
call them something like copy-html and
copy-images.

00:01:15.056 --> 00:01:19.923
In the copy-html task,
we grab the index.html file

00:01:19.923 --> 00:01:24.606
with gulp.src and just pipe it to
the destination in the dist folder.

00:01:24.606 --> 00:01:29.600
For the copy-images task, we do
the same thing, but instead of copying

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.530
a file or grabbing a locator to a file,
we're grabbing all the files

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.360
in a specific directory in piping
them to our new destination location.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.890
You'll want to set up a new gulp.watch

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.560
next to the others that watches
the original index file.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.470
You could do the same with the images,
but they don't change that often.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.900
And don't forget to add the two
new tasks to the array that's

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.550
passed as part of the default task,

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.500
otherwise the files don't get copied
over the first time we run gulp.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.360
Just a final fix before we can see our
page run again minus the Java Script

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.000
which will come in a bit.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.770
You'll need to modify
the browserSync.init function call and

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.550
make it point to the dist directory,
now I've already done this for you.
