00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.050
So far in this lesson, we've discussed sensory memory and working memory.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.944
Remember that our sensory memory is very short lasting, and our working memory

00:00:07.944 --> 00:00:12.798
is our day-to-day fluidity of our actions. But what about those questions we

00:00:12.798 --> 00:00:15.857
asked in the beginning of the lesson? For example, what was the name of your

00:00:15.857 --> 00:00:19.664
first grade teacher? Well, the ability for you to remember the name of your

00:00:19.664 --> 00:00:24.184
first grade teacher, in my case was Ms. Peacock, is because of our long-term

00:00:24.184 --> 00:00:28.140
memory. So let's go to Susan and discuss some particular types of long term

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.160
memory.
