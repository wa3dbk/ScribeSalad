00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.740
Now the next thing we have to do, is to put these two steps within a loop, so

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.750
our program can prompt the user to take a

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.980
break multiple times during the day. So your challenge

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.950
is to add a loop to this code, so it prompts the user to take 3 breaks. Now

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.900
if you are confused about this task, there are

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.880
some helpful links on loops in the instructor notes.
