00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.210
We may define the task of
diagnosis as determining

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.720
what is wrong with
a malfunctioning device.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.990
Or more generally, what is
the fault that is responsible for

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.780
a malfunctioning system.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.860
Given a system,
we expect some behavior from it.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.149
We expect it to do something.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:20.400
However, we may observe that the system
is doing something different.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.960
So there is the expected behavior and
there is the observed behavior, and

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.890
there is a discrepancy between them.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.380
When there is a discrepancy, we know
that the system is malfunctioning.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.950
The question then becomes
what is the fault or

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.730
the set of faults responsible for
the malfunctioning system.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.130
When we think of diagnosis we
typically think of medical diagnosis.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.620
But, of course diagnosis can occur
in a very large number of domains.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.150
Here are three diagnostic domains
with which all of us are familiar.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.110
The first figure shows
the engine of a car.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.440
When I insert the key into the ignition
system, I expect the engine to turn on.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.660
That is the expected behavior.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.030
But suppose that I insert the key,
and the engine doesn't turn on.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.850
That's the observed behavior.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.337
There is a discrepancy between
the expected behavior and

00:01:04.337 --> 00:01:05.434
the observed behavior.

00:01:05.434 --> 00:01:08.930
When I insert the key into the ignition,
I expect the engine to turn on.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.100
That's the expected behavior.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.350
But then suppose that I put the key in,
and the engine doesn't turn on.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.015
That's the observed behavior.

00:01:16.015 --> 00:01:20.430
The discrepancy between the expected
behavior, turn the engine on, and

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.170
the observed behavior,

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.780
the engine doesn't turn on, so
I know there is a malfunction.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.196
Given this malfunction,
the question becomes what is at fault,

00:01:28.196 --> 00:01:32.330
the force responsible for it and
that's the diagnostic task.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.365
To address this diagnostic task, I may
use a rule which says that if the engine

00:01:36.365 --> 00:01:39.740
doesn't turn on when the key is
inserted, check the carburetor.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.640
Suppose I go and
check the carburetor and

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.410
everything is okay with the carburetor.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.700
Then I [INAUDIBLE] get activated.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.090
And let me say,
if the engine doesn't turn on and

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.810
everything is okay with the carburetor,
go check the spark plugs.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.610
And this way, I am going to use
a production system to isolate the fault

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.380
of faults responsible for
the malfunction.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.793
&gt;&gt; Something similar happens
with computer hardware repair.

00:02:00.793 --> 00:02:03.728
When we turn on a computer, there
are few behaviors that we expect of it.

00:02:03.728 --> 00:02:06.289
We expect it to boot up quickly,
we expect it to run fast, and

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:07.840
we expect it to stay cool.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.538
Now, imagine we turn a computer and
notice it started to run at a much

00:02:10.538 --> 00:02:12.380
higher temperature than
we're accustomed to.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.661
We might remember that the last
time we encountered this problem,

00:02:14.661 --> 00:02:15.770
there were problems with the fan.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.095
So we might use that to then diagnose
this a problem with the fan and

00:02:19.095 --> 00:02:20.370
replace the fan.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.260
This happens at the software level too.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.100
If I'm writing a program and the output
differs from what I was expecting,

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.740
I set about debugging the program and
finding the fault.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.650
One way of doing that is called
a rubber duck debugging, which involves

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.790
explaining my model of how my program
works to the rubber duck so that I might

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.542
uncover the error by forcing myself
through an explanation process.

00:02:38.542 --> 00:02:41.300
&gt;&gt; Note that we discussed
the same diagnostic task

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.990
in three different domains.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.842
In each domain there was a discrepancy
between the expected and the observed

00:02:46.842 --> 00:02:50.950
behaviors and we tried to identify
the fault, or faults responsible for it.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.920
Note also that we alluded to three
different methods for doing diagnosis.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.990
The matter of rule based reasoning,
the matter of case based reasoning,

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.490
and the matter of model based reasoning.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.710
We haven't talked a lot about the matter
of model based reasoning so far.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.020
We will do so when we come to
systems thinking later in the class.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.390
Of course we can use the matter of
rule based reasoning, not only for

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.080
diagnosing car engines but also for
repairing computer hardware or for

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.508
diagnosing computer software.

00:03:14.508 --> 00:03:18.220
In this particular lesson our focus
will be on the diagnostic task.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.810
By now all of us are already
familiar with many reasoning methods

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.440
that are potentially
applicable to class.
