00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.760
In the last lesson we looked at
the evolution of standards and

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.750
examined data standards in particular.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.350
To be maximally useful in care
coordination, the standardized data,

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.580
typically along with other
non-standardized data such as free-text

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.800
notes, must be packaged into
standard clinical documents and

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.700
sent using standard message formats.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.640
We'll look at both of
these in this lesson.
