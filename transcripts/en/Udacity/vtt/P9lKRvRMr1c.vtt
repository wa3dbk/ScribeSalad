00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.140
In this lesson we learned about
memory consistency which defines

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.530
what is allowed to happen when processor
cores are reordering memory accesses.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.550
We have seen that sequential consistency
gives us the behavior we expect but

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.630
that it can limit performance.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.160
And we have seen that more relaxed
memory consistency models can improve

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.920
performance but make program behavior
more difficult to reason about.
