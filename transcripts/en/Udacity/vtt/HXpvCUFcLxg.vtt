00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
One way to think about this is, imagine this last level is filled in all the way to the end.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Then what's happening here is we have, how many nodes we have at that level?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We have half as many at the level above because each of the nodes

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
shares a parent with one of the other nodes and again half and again half and again half.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
How many times can you half (n) before you get down to 1 which is the root?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And that's what we've been talking about if that's (log n). So the height of the heap is Î˜(log n).
