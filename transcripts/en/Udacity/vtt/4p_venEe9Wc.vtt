00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.066
To find the product, we add up the areas of the rectangles. I've listed out all

00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:09.980
my areas, or my terms here, and I've listed the x squares together and the x's

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.484
together. These are my like-terms, 3x squared plus 2x squared, makes 5x squared,

00:00:15.484 --> 00:00:20.299
and 6x plus 3x equals 9x, so here's my total sum. If you haven't made the

00:00:20.299 --> 00:00:25.943
connection before between this diagram and this diagram, we've simply replaced

00:00:25.943 --> 00:00:31.177
the 10 with an x. And in fact if we plugged in a 10 for x into this expression,

00:00:31.177 --> 00:00:34.028
we would get 1599, the same number here.
