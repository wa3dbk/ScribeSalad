00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.100
In our initial definition of requirements engineering, we talked about

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.130
software systems. But what do we really mean when we

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.980
use the term software? Software is an abstract description of

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.920
a set of computations that becomes concrete, and therefore useful, only

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.600
when we run the software on some hardware, and that,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.310
in the context of some human activity that it can

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.530
support. So what does that mean exactly? What that means

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.235
is that when we say software, what we really mean is

00:00:25.235 --> 00:00:28.790
a software intensive system. That is, the combination

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.930
of 3 things, the software, the hardware on which

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.610
the software runs, and the context in which the

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.470
software is used. Just to illustrate, let me show

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.010
you this through a picture. What I'm showing here

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.830
is a customer, a user, that is using, is

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.000
accessing, an ATM machine. And this action involves several

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.650
things. There is the software that drives the logic

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.410
of the ATM machine. There is the hardware on

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.280
which the software runs. And there is the context

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.850
In which the software is used. And in this

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.660
case, the context is the bank. And only by

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.105
considering these 3 things together can we really understand

00:01:06.105 --> 00:01:09.510
the functionality that is represented here. So the bottom

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.690
line here is that we usually take hardware and

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.750
context for granted in this equation. But they actually

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.210
need to be explicitly considered when building a

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.770
system. Otherwise, we might forget this is all

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.850
the functionality, and ultimately of the requirements. And

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.640
we might end up with the wrong system.
