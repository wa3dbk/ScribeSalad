00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This quiz is going to require a little bit of guess work,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
for how a multiple assignment works.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I think you'll be able to bet the right answer.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You can also try experiments in the Python interpreter.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The question is for any variable--so let's assume s and t are names,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and they've been assigned some value,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and now we execute the statement s, t assign t, s.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What does that do?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The choices are nothing--after the assignment

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
s and t both have the same value as they did before.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
That it makes both s and t refer to what the original value of t was before this statement.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
That it swaps the values of s and t so after the statement,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
s now has the previous value of t and t has the previous value of s.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Or it's an error.
