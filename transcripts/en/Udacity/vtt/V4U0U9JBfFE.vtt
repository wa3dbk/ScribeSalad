To summarize contracts, when purchasing a third-party component.

00:00:03.972 --> 00:00:06.919
The customer needs to know what he or she is getting.

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.495
One way to do this is to see a specification of the component that covers all

00:00:10.495 --> 00:00:12.510
four levels of guarantees.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.830
The alternative is to learn about restrictive limitations later when it

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.520
may be quite expensive to overcome them
