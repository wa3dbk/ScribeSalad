00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.520
So, one of the most interesting projects I've worked on was actually a project

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.245
that arose out of personal interests. This was around the time that the Euro

00:00:09.245 --> 00:00:13.900
2012, which is an international soccer competition was happening. And, so what

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.680
I did is I went on to the Euro website and I took a whole bunch of statistics

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.190
about the teams and the games. And I just took that information and I put it

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.080
into this piece of software. And it was instantaneously able to make these

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.360
predictions for me about who was going to win, what players were going to

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.020
perform the best. And that's not something you or I can do with the naked eye

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.090
very quickly or accurately. But, it's something that this computer could do

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.080
very well, very fast. And with only a year and a half of programming

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.460
background, it was information that I was able to extract.
