In this course, we're using WebGL and developers library I chose for this course called the

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.341
Three.js. WebGL is an Application Program Interface, API for short, that

00:00:10.341 --> 00:00:15.716
controls the GPU. It is based on OpenGL ES, an API used in mobile devices which

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:20.840
in turn is based on OpenGL, an API for desktop computers that dates back to

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.332
1992. The other major competing API is called DirectX or Direct3D, which is

00:00:25.332 --> 00:00:29.921
commonly used for games on the Xbox console and Windows PCs. This is almost the

00:00:29.921 --> 00:00:34.605
last time I'll mention DirectX. It's not all that different from WebGL. In fact,

00:00:34.605 --> 00:00:39.077
Google Chrome on the PC turns WebGL commands into DirectX calls. See additional

00:00:39.077 --> 00:00:43.242
course materials for more information. WebGL itself is a state based API. You

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:47.512
set up exactly how you want the GPU to do something, then send a geometry to

00:00:47.512 --> 00:00:51.765
render under these conditions. This gives a pretty fine grained control over the

00:00:51.765 --> 00:00:55.175
GPU that can result in hundreds of lines of code that draw even the simplest

00:00:55.175 --> 00:00:59.379
scenes. This is why we'll be using Three.js, a free development library with

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.335
many useful features. Just a few lines of code in Three.js can create objects

00:01:03.335 --> 00:01:07.043
with materials, set up lighting and a camera, and even perform animation.
