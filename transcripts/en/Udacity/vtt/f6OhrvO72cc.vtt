00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.830
So how can Alice approach her problem

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.160
if there are lots of these communication centers?

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.990
Certainly, she can't just do a random approach and trust that she's somehow

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.030
going to find the best possible solution.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.560
So she needs some sort of algorithm to solve her problem.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.090
And one algorithm that would be guaranteed to find the best possible

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.950
solution, or the minimum number of devices that you need,

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.950
would be to just try all possibilities.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.340
So, for example, if you have a very simple network, such as this one here--

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.220
Well, first of all, let's have a look at the best possible solution,

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.110
and we're going to do this as a little quiz.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.890
So I want you to tell me where to install the monitors

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.030
so that each cable in this network is monitored.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.660
And I want you to do this by checking off the communication centers

00:00:49.660 --> 99:59:59.000
where we need to install monitoring devices.
