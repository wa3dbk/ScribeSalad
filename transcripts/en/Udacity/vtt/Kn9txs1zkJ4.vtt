00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So here's our invariant checker for the class Red-Black tree.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You want to make sure that the root node is black: you can make a mistake,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
say, move the subtree up here and all of the sudden the root becomes red.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This assertion will take care of this.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And as you can see here, we're setting up helper functions in order to break down

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the invariant into manageable small pieces.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We want to make sure that there are no cycles in the tree.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We want to make sure that pointers to parents are consistent,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that is, if some node points to its parent then it should also be a child of this array parent.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We want to make sure that in both subtrees the number of black nodes is equal.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
That's a niiice looong function name, which says it all.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And finally, you want to make sure that red nodes have only black children

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and at the same time black nodes only have red children.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Not sure whether we need to make this a separate method.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Some of these checkers are rather trivial, that is one-liners,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
others require a traversal of the anti-tree and would typically call themselves recursively.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And now for every single method that change the state, you can now invoke the invariant checker.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
You do so at the beginning, you do so at the end,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and when all of your assertions pass, then you can be sure that your Red-Black tree

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
never ever becomes corrupted.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
However, if something goes wrong, it would get the error message at the very moment

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
you make the Red-Black tree inconsistent.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
You will get the precise assertion that failed and you won't implant any time bombs

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
'cause if the precondition is satisfied and if the postcondition is violated

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
you know that it is precisely this method--the insert method in this case--

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that caused the data invariant to be violated.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
This thing about Red-Black trees actually is a sort of a personal thing for me:

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
ten years ago, when I was a teaching assistant, my professor had the cool idea

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
to have the students implement Red-Black trees as a programming exercise.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And we as teaching assistants, had the cool idea to come up with a real hard

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
automated testing for the student assignments, which turned out a disastrous combination

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
because writing a Red-Black tree is one thing

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and writing a Red-Black tree that works is another.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
At this time, I did not really know how to debug and neither did my students

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and neither did my professor so we as teaching assistants would be sitting with our students

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
for hours and hours and hours in the night stepping and stepping and stepping

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
through the program and try to figure out where on earth on the umpteenth insert operation

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
this particular pointer would finally be moved to this other location, which was a total pain to figure out.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
In particular with regular debuggers, we typically step over the whole thing

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and then finally lose the moment so you'd have to restart again and restart again.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And if I think about how many hours probably days and weeks

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I have lost digging through these data structures whereas with a single invariant checker

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I could've found them in minutes I'm still somewhat sorry.
