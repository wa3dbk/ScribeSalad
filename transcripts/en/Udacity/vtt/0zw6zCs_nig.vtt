00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.548
This system of equation has exactly one solution and it is a point of

00:00:04.548 --> 00:00:09.539
intersection. This point satisfies both of the equations. If I plug in an x

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:14.739
value of 4 and a y value of 45, both equations should be true. Let's see if that

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:19.517
works. Sure enough, in the end, we get true statements. If we can understand

00:00:19.517 --> 00:00:23.612
that the solution to a system is a point of intersection, then we can use this

00:00:23.612 --> 00:00:27.761
to solve all sorts of other problems. But before we get into solving other

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:31.909
problems we're going to see if a point is a intersection to a system, and look

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:36.342
at other types of systems. The x and y values make both equations true. This is

00:00:36.342 --> 00:00:40.626
how we can check whether or not the point is actually a solution to our system

00:00:40.626 --> 00:00:41.469
of equations.
