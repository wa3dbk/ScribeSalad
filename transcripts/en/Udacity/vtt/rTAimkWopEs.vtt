00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.090
An important part of Android Wear
application design is that while

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.560
the watch is acting as a display
to push notifications to the user,

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.580
much of the work is
actually done on the phone.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.752
Interware devices do not connect
to the internet directly and

00:00:11.752 --> 00:00:15.778
instead, they typically communicate
with the outside world via the paired up

00:00:15.778 --> 00:00:17.455
phone using Bluetooth or WiFi.

00:00:17.455 --> 00:00:21.240
Another important thing to note is that
Android Wear applications are embedded

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.570
inside the regular phone
APK from Google Play.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.728
The user will download the phone APK and
it will be installed to the phone.

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:31.790
The Android Wear companion app
that runs on the phone will then

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.280
detect an embedded wearable APK and copy
it over to the Android Wear device and

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.570
install it there, too.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.650
Whenever the phone APK is
updated on the play store,

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.640
this process is repeated
to the Android-ware device.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.410
The nice part about this is that
if someone is using your app, and

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.930
they're at an Android Wear device,

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.530
it will automatically
support it if it's available.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.790
What this does mean is that you must
create an application that runs on

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.930
the phone because a wearable
app cannot exist without it.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.120
Even if the phone app does nothing,
you still need to provide one

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.600
otherwise Google Play cannot process and
distribute your APK file.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.060
Here are some other things that
are also important to know.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.350
The phone APK and embedded wearable APK
must have the same package name and

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.590
version numbers.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.200
The permissions requested
by the wearable APK

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.720
must also be requested by the phone APK,
as well.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.802
The phone APKs and

00:01:19.802 --> 00:01:23.870
wearable APKs both need to be
signed by the same developer keys.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.470
If you get any of these things wrong,
the wearable app will fail to install,

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.270
so be careful here.
