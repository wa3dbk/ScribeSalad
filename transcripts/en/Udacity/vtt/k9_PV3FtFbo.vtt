00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.630
Your goal is to make a simple model to manipulate in future units. You'll

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.700
create a basic drinking bird model, very basic. At this point he won't even

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.460
have a beak. We'll get to that in a later unit. The drinking bird is a little

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.341
toy that drinks from a cup. Google it. The objects you'll make are the legs,

00:00:16.341 --> 00:00:23.210
body, head and jaunty hat. Here's the blueprint showing front and side views.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.520
Well, it's more of a back-of-the-napkin drawing, but sometimes that's all you

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.280
get from a client. Me, my favorite client comment I heard that one designer

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.590
received was, could you make that sphere rounder? The three objects you'll use

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.490
are the cube, well, box, sphere, and cylinder. Here are the typical calls for

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.200
creating these three objects. For the cube, the numbers passed ten are the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.110
width, height, depth of the box. The sphere needs just a radius to describe

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.180
it's geometry. The additional two numbers specify how much tessellation happens

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.740
along the equator and from pole to pole, respectively. You might try changing

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.130
these tessellation numbers to see the effect on the body, but please use these

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.640
numbers, 32 and 16, when you submit your answer. The cylinder gives an upper

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.450
and lower radius, followed by a height, and by the amount of tessellation along

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.880
its equator. Again, please use the number 32. See the additional course

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.460
materials for documentation for these various methods. There are three

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.900
functions you'll be working on. The function, CreateSupport, will make the

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.510
drinking bird's support frame, base, legs and feet. To get you started, I've

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.850
laid down a base that the legs connect to, along with the left leg. You'll have

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.920
to add the right leg and feet. The function, CreateBody, will create the bird's

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.550
body and spine. The function, CreateHead, will make the head and hat. You have

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.350
to create the objects in the correct location and add them to the scene. When

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.540
you've done that, you'll see the model of the drinking bird, just like it's

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.339
shown here.
