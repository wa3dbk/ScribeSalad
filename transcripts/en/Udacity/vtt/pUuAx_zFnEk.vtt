00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.291
Let me introduce another whole concept, and

00:00:03.291 --> 00:00:06.174
that is the field of view of the camera itself.

00:00:06.174 --> 00:00:10.422
So in this case, we're trying to, of course, capture this tree with this lens,

00:00:10.422 --> 00:00:13.950
focal length 3, and this is what the image has generated.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.260
So, in this case, the field of view is this angle.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.940
Let me introduce a new term to help us understand how we

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.100
can actually compute the field of view and refer to this as, that, and

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.050
I will refer to that as h which in essence is the sensor size.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.620
So in this case, the sensor size is the entire region here, and

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.550
of course therefore I can reconstruct the entire tree.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.220
But now based on this, we can start coming up

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.930
with a formula that will let us figure out exactly what this angle would be.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.050
So given this H, we are interested in computing this angle,

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.810
which we refer to as the field of view, and for

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.050
simplicity's sake, let's say, call this angle theta for now.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.450
So we are interested in computing theta.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.120
Okay?

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.930
To help us do this, first we can actually look at that there is a triangle here,

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.910
and this angle theta is exactly the same angle theta here.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.810
Let's just take this half triangle.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.300
h goes over there, so this would be h over 2.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.980
This would be f.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.980
This is theta over 2.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.528
So theta over 2 is basically

00:01:19.528 --> 00:01:24.618
inverse tangent of h 2f.

00:01:24.618 --> 00:01:25.970
Correct?

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.596
So in essence, theta would be 2 tangent inverse

00:01:32.596 --> 00:01:37.240
h over 2f, which is primarily what this equation is.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.000
To help us look at this now, let's take the same equation, but

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.720
now, actually, we can create a focal length which is twice that one.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.140
Of course, now I have this much larger tree.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.120
Except, let's say, our sensor is exactly the same size h.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.920
So if I was to use this sensor size,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.880
basically everything of that image would be cut off here,

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.130
there, and therefore also means my field of view should also be smaller.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.960
This is my field of view.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.090
Which is the same, I guess, for this one.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.050
And of course, I can't see the entire tree.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.233
Let's look at this a little bit more carefully again.

00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:18.206
Basically, the sensor size can be small, then the field of view is also small.

00:02:18.206 --> 00:02:22.309
And smaller sensors, of course, can capture fewer number of pixels and

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:25.810
may also have other issues, like noisier pixels and stuff.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.480
So let's take the same example, except now I have h here.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.210
This was the equation we looked at, and this was my field of view.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.255
What happens if I make h smaller?

00:02:34.255 --> 00:02:37.670
Well, my field of view would get smaller and smaller.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.920
So in this case, let's say I go for a smaller h,

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.440
which is this, my field of view is only now just this much.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.390
So that basically is of course because field view is

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.140
directly related to both focal length and the size of the sensor.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.470
I will actually showcase this using real pictures next.
