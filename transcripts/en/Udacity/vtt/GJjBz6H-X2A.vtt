00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.643
Here's a new curve that we might use to estimate population at different dates.

00:00:04.643 --> 00:00:08.423
You can see from the graph that it actually looks like it fits a fair number of

00:00:08.423 --> 00:00:13.547
our points really closely. Remember, these green points are the coordinates of

00:00:13.547 --> 00:00:17.138
what appeared on our chart before, showing the actual population for these

00:00:17.138 --> 00:00:22.840
years. Once again, using the link to Desmos in the instructor comments, what

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.815
does this blue curve predict the population will be in 2013? Thinking about

00:00:28.815 --> 00:00:32.225
that, and comparing that to the last number that we saw from our red curve in

00:00:32.225 --> 00:00:36.770
the last question, does this curve give us a better prediction?
