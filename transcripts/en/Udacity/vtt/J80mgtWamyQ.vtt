00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.030
Now, you see we have a parseJSON function that takes a string of JSON in, and

00:00:06.042 --> 00:00:12.345
then we're going to parse it using the JSON.parse method that is included in and

00:00:12.357 --> 00:00:18.405
accessible in just about any modern browser. JSON.parse takes this string,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.938
Weapon.JSON in and will return a JavaScript object representing the JSON that it's

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.846
parsed. Now, once we've done that what I want you to do is grab a specific piece

00:00:29.892 --> 00:00:36.351
of data, from that JSON. Let's say you want to grab data from the JavaScript

00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:40.084
object returned from JSON.parse and let's say you put that JavaScript object

00:00:40.084 --> 00:00:46.117
into the variable "parsed". Now in order to grab the chaingun sub object then

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:52.286
you'd simply say parsed frames chaingun.png like so and then put it in the

00:00:52.286 --> 00:00:56.559
variable chaingun let's say. Now let's take a look up above at this structure.

00:00:56.675 --> 00:01:01.961
What I would do, it'd walk down first on frames and then in the chaingun

00:01:01.973 --> 00:01:07.773
and what would be stored in the chaingun variable, would then be this entire

00:01:07.785 --> 00:01:13.345
structure, so everything inside of chaingun.png. Now what I would like you to

00:01:13.345 --> 00:01:21.371
do, is grab the x data field inside spriteSourceSize of chaingun_impact.png

00:01:21.372 --> 00:01:26.223
and go ahead and print that out to the console. chaingun_impact.png isn't up in

00:01:26.235 --> 00:01:30.899
our example JSON, but the JSON that we'll be running through this function

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:32.007
does have it.
