00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.144
Before we move on from one-sample t tests, we're going to take two little

00:00:03.144 --> 00:00:08.150
quizzes dealing with the margin of error. Remember that the margin of error is

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.172
one-half the width of the confidence interval. So we had our sample mean, and

00:00:13.172 --> 00:00:17.936
we added the margin of error to get our upper bound. And subtracted the margin

00:00:17.936 --> 00:00:22.300
of error to get our lower bound. Now which of the following is the margin of

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.793
error, where t is the t critical value?
