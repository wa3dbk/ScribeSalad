00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.280
Now let's see if we can figure out what the unlock needs to do.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:09.360
So the unlock function here does what? Option one, use a normal store to write

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.820
zero to lockvar. Option two, load link, see if we loaded one and then store

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.688
conditional. And option three, we need additional

00:00:19.688 --> 00:00:22.750
atomic instructions in our ISA to do this.
