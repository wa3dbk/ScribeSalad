We've been doing a lot of multiplication in this course, especially multiplying

00:00:03.493 --> 00:00:07.564
polynomials together. We've seen that we can take linear factors, multiply them

00:00:07.564 --> 00:00:11.698
together and produce more complicated polynomials. With Athena's situation

00:00:11.698 --> 00:00:16.100
though, we're starting off with a complicated polynomial. In order to make it

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.258
simple and find all of its factors, we need to figure out how to divide a

00:00:19.258 --> 00:00:21.134
polynomials.
