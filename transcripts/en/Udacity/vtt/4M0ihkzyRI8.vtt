This square has an area of 9 units squared. This one has an area of 16 units

00:00:03.935 --> 00:00:08.903
squared. And this one has an area of 25 units squared. Great work for finding

00:00:08.903 --> 00:00:14.606
these numbers. To find the area of any square, we simply square its side. So we

00:00:14.606 --> 00:00:20.174
know 3 squared equals 9. For this square, we'll have 4 times 4, which equals

00:00:20.174 --> 00:00:26.058
16. And finally, for our last square, well have 5 times 5, or 5 squared which

00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:27.791
is 25.
