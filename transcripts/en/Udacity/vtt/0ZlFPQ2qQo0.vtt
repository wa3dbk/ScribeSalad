00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.800
And answer is the second choice. It is also

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.240
true that there's a small town in Virginia named

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.910
Alta Vista. But the relevant answer is the second

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.660
choice. Back in 1998, the most popular search engine was

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.650
probably the search engine called AltaVista. They certainly had

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.070
the biggest web index at the time. And they also

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.300
had great technology for responding to queries quickly. 1998

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.440
is the year that Google was founded, and most people

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.410
probably have not heard of AltaVista today, and, might

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.990
have had a hard time answering this quiz. And

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.950
the reason for that is Google figured out a

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.200
better way to do page ranking. And because of this,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.490
search engines that didn't have good ways of ranking

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.740
pages, like AltaVista, quickly become irrelevant. And the algorithm

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.120
that I've described, is the algorithm that launched Google.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.560
It's called PageRank. And you may think the Page stands

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.730
for webpage. The Page actually stands for Larry Page, who was

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.980
the co-founder with Sergey Brin, of Google. So, that's the algorithm

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.940
that we've described. And that's what allowed Google to produce so

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.810
much better search results, than other search engines at the time.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.530
&gt;&gt; I hope you remember Anna Patterson from Unit Three, and are still following

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.570
her advice to be polite on the web. One of the reasons AltaVista started to

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.320
work so badly, was because websites were not polite. They

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.760
tried to find ways to gain the rankings. Certainly this

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.250
is still something websites still do today. And the way

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.900
AltaVista ranks pages, it was very easy to gain them, so

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.630
the site that would be ranked was not the best

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.000
site about something, but a site that was best at gaining

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.250
the rankings. So I asked Anna to explain why Google's

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.640
page ranking algorithm was so important to the success of Google.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.719
&gt;&gt; So a page rank on the web, was a huge step forward.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.760
I'm old enough to actually remember the time

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.590
that Google launched and you know, it's advance over

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.790
AltaVista. Was AltaVista was very, very prone to keyword

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.620
stuffing spam. So if you said restaurant 32 times,

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.760
well you were better than a page that

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.200
said restaurant twice. So, PageRank came out and actually

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.750
gave a measure of popularity or traffic, and therefore,

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.590
the things that said restaurant twice, but were awesome.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.085
They wound up going to the top.

00:02:09.085 --> 00:02:11.560
&gt;&gt; Certainly things have got more complicated since then, and there's

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.810
more things that go into the ranking algorithm, than just what we've

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.490
shown you. But that's the basic idea, and the next thing

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.310
we're going to do, is change our search engine to implement this algorithm.
