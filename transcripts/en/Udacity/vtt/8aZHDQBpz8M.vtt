00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.882
We've seen how to simplify radicals, so now let's try adding and subtracting

00:00:03.882 --> 00:00:07.466
them. We can use our knowledge of what we learned before to help us add

00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:11.600
radicals together. For example, to add polynomials together, we just added the

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.715
like terms of x squared and x squared. We have three of these things called x

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:19.829
squared, and two of these things called x squared. So if we add them all

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:24.462
together, we'll have 5 of these things that we call x squared. In a similar

00:00:24.462 --> 00:00:29.965
way, we added 3 7ths and 2 7ths to equal 5 7ths. And most recently, we learned

00:00:29.965 --> 00:00:34.102
how to add rational expressions. If our denominators were alike, then we could

00:00:34.102 --> 00:00:38.620
add the numerators to get 5 divided by x plus 1. So based on what you know

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.000
before, what do you think would be the sum of these two expressions?
