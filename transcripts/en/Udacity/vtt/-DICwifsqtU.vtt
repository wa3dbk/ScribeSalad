00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.950
And to show you exactly what's going
on here, I have a little scene.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:05.580
I've taken the images,
tried to animate them so

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.000
you can see what's happening, okay?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.780
So here's a very sort of ugly scene.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.890
It's sort of color coded
by certain regions.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.390
That doesn't really matter.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.680
What matters is the camera now
is going to move to the right.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.250
All right, it's a posterized co,
color scene so you, so

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.330
you can see these things
stand up a little better.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.680
Right, so that's image one,
that's image two, that's image three,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.290
that's image four.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.600
So going backwards, so
the camera's moving to the right and

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.560
of course, the, it's not a Rubik's cube,
whatever kind of horrible evil,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.550
diabolical puzzle that is moving to
the left faster cause it's closer.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.300
So if I were to take all those
images and build a cube of them,

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.850
this is that same cube, okay?

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.040
So here we have X and Y, and
we stack them in time this way.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.410
And here's just the top of them.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.380
And I'm just going to take a slice,
one of the slices through there, and

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.300
that looks like that.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.100
So now it's at a fixed y value.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.320
This is X, and this is time,
and here are my streaks again.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.120
Okay.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.940
And notice that some of these streaks,
okay,

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.791
move at different slopes.

00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:16.956
Those slopes correspond to
the depth of the scene.

00:01:16.956 --> 00:01:21.610
And what's kind of cool about this
is it's really easy to find these

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.281
kinds of lines, okay?

00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:27.751
And you can find lines that intersect
that, that aren't parallel to the other

00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:31.490
lines, and so you can use that to
pull out the object, all right.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.670
This is called EPI, EPI, image analysis.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.535
And you can use that in some other ways
also, so I think one of the coolest ones

00:01:39.535 --> 00:01:45.580
I ever saw was done by in the same
some we spoke about before.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.190
Again, now almost 20 years ago,

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.540
they had a scene where you had
people just walking past you.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.170
Okay.
And imagine you've now got

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.860
a volume of video.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.870
Okay, and you stack that up.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.610
And now I'm just going to show you
some chunks taken from, sort of,

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.040
the top, the, the head area,
and then by, down by the feet.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:11.120
At the area that is really at the very
top here, nothing changes in the camera.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.387
So, as time goes this way,
the pixels stay constant, okay?

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:21.653
But at the slice where their heads are,
okay.

00:02:21.653 --> 00:02:24.280
You see these lines there,
the, these regions here?

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.150
That's the movement of their
heads through spacetime.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.020
That's what this volume is,
it's spacetime, right.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.760
And so each one of these diagonal
lines is the movement of their heads.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.560
And these straight lines here,
what are those?

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.422
Those are just the background
just like up here.

00:02:47.422 --> 00:02:50.406
Those, when things don't move, right?

00:02:50.406 --> 00:02:55.148
And the camera's moving, these, the, the
pixel value in time stays the same so

00:02:55.148 --> 00:02:57.770
it's just a straight, ray and spacetime.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.810
But if they're moving then you
see them moving across in time.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.050
Now the really cool thing is what
happens if you look at their feet.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.588
Right?
So if I look down at this level, okay?

00:03:09.588 --> 00:03:12.258
Here's what the spacetime
image looks like.

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:13.980
And you see this braided pattern?

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.380
That braided pattern is
the movement of their feet in time.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.270
In fact, they even published a paper,

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.130
here's just some images taken
of it showing the same thing,

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.000
the slice through the head and
the slice through the, the feet.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.550
And what they were able to show, and
here it's just sort of lined up,

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.670
is that you could actually recognize who
the person was with a small sample set

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.070
by just tracking that braid, all right.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.990
So look, if not how you would do
gate recognition in a really good

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.300
discriminative way and things like that.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.280
But it's an example of showing
you the data structures

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.320
that you can get from processing video.
