00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
There's one last form element I'd like to expose you to

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
before we move on to something else,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and this is for doing a Dropdown.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm going to get rid of this text here.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And a Dropdown has a form that looks like this.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It has a element, with a name--

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
we've been calling everything "q", so why stop--

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and then it has a couple of elements.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So here I've put in a complete Select element.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We've got an opening and closing .

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And the opening has the Name attibute equal to "q"--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
which is what we've been using--

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and then I've added 3 elements.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Each has the text inside it: one, two, and three.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Let's see how this looks in our browser.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Okay. So here we are in our browser--and now we see we have a Dropdown,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and it has a couple of Options.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And you can choose one of these Options--you know--

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
one, two, or three--and what I'd like you to tell me is what happens--

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
when I select "two" from the Dropdown and click Submit,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
what appears in the URL?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Okay--so when we select "two" from the Dropdown,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
what will the value of the "q" parameter in the URL be?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.492
Go ahead and give this a try yourself.
