00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.270
For this you needed the t table. And you would've found that the t critical

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.220
value, when there are seven degrees of freedom, because remember the degrees of

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.785
freedom is n minus 2. And with 0.025 in either tail since it's a

00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:21.290
non-directional test, the t critical value is 2.365. The t statistic that we

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.240
calculated, or that the computer calculated Is greater therefore there is

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.240
evidence to reject the null, and there does appear to be a significant

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.030
relationship between x and y in the population, based on our sample data.
