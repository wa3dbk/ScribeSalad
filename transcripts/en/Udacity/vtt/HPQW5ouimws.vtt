There are three exams in the course, two midterms and one final. You will take

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:09.923
the exam online, not in person. There will be a proctoring service that

00:00:09.923 --> 00:00:14.850
requires that you have a webcam and an internet access to take the exams.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.546
You'll get more information about this as the exams get closer. We'll send you

00:00:18.546 --> 00:00:23.265
an email. Problem sets will also count as part of your grade. You will need to

00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:27.714
complete 80% of the in person exercises to pass the class. Here's a table that

00:00:27.714 --> 00:00:29.903
gives you all the necessary information.
