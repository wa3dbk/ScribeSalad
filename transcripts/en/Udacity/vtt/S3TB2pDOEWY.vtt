00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.490
We've seen the basic first sub
command for frame called variable.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.300
But LODB's frame command
can do much more than this.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.586
To demonstrate on back
in the semi bug zap,

00:00:10.586 --> 00:00:14.475
and were paused at the handle single
tap method that we've seen before.

00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:17.620
And this is in the break
point bug view controller.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.500
&gt;From the console,
we can look up information about LLDB

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.590
commands including frame,
by typing Help.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.090
So I'll delete this and
type Help and I'll just go ahead and

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.300
scroll through all this, so
you can see the entire output.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.120
We have all the commands and
then there are command abbreviations.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.960
Like the FR and
the V that we saw earlier.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.650
That you can see for
the different commands.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.770
And I'll stop here for a frame.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.030
And here's the information we have.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.200
It says that frame provides
a set of commands for

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.510
operating on the current
thread's frames.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.930
And by frames, it means stack frames.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.700
So to get more specific help
information about frame,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.260
I can type the command
frame followed by help.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.280
This delete button clears
out the console, by the way.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.706
So that's what I clicked to do that.

00:01:00.706 --> 00:01:04.120
We'll go frame help.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.110
And now we can see that frame
supports the following subcommands.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.590
So there's the variable command
that we used earlier, but

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.230
it also supports info and select.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.665
And at the bottom, it says, for help on
any particular subcommand we can type

00:01:15.665 --> 00:01:18.650
help command and then the subcommand.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.040
So for example, help frame variable,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.000
should give us the help information
about the variable subcommand.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.970
Well we've already seen
the variable subcommand, so

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.730
I want to try the two others.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.150
So I've stopped the application, and

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.220
I've kind of reset up our
debugging environment here.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.090
I've set a breakpoint at
the add bug to view method.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.940
And there are no other breakpoints
in the particular app.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.780
And this is for
the BreakpointBugViewController.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.540
And I've triggered this breakpoint
again by just tapping on the screen.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.860
So let's type, frame info.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.670
And we could see that the output shows
that the current frame is frame zero,

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.600
and this is for the addBugToView method.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.520
And this mirrors what we have in the
debug navigator, which is frame zero,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.800
and frame zero is for
the add bug to view method.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.560
And to switch the current stack frame,
we can use the frame select

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.250
subcommand followed by a frame number,
so I'll select frame one.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.710
And just like that, Xcode jumps us
to stack frame one, which is for

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.000
handleSingleTap, here.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.110
And you can see that it's jumped
us here in the code area as well.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.900
And this is pretty neat.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.830
It's not really that much different than
what we can achieve by just clicking

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.730
around in the debug navigator,
which you can do the same thing

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.430
here in the console,
by just selecting different frames.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.860
So now it's really unleashed
the power of the command line,

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.660
to do something that you can't
already do in the graphical interface.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.470
And we'll do this with
the expression command.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.810
The expression command,

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.880
let's us run swift expressions in
the current debugging context.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.710
So this is actually really cool.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.730
This means,
we can do things like run methods.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.800
Or even change the values of variables
while our program is paused.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.070
So I'll start typing the command expr,
which is an abbreviation for

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.790
expression, followed by println.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:05.870
And bugs, so

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.950
this is just like the println statement
that we could put in our code.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.290
You can see that
currently bugs is empty.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.200
So I'll go ahead and
just continue a couple times, so

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.160
that bugs contains some things.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.030
And actually, I'll turn this off,
this breakpoint off, hit play so

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.740
it runs all the way through.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.580
We should have way to many bugs now.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.490
Turn the breakpoint back on.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:28.850
I'll reach again.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.600
Let's run the same expression.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.960
And see the our bugs array is very full,

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.690
now that we have all those extra bugs,
that have been created.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.540
So that first expression for
just printing, that's pretty cool.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.940
But let's try something
a little bit more fun.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.400
We can actually empty the bugs array.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.675
So to do this, we'll use
expression self.bugs.removeAll.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.700
And this takes a argument, keepCapacity.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.660
And we'll specify this is true and
we'll hit enter.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.780
And now when I run this expression,
it appears that it's completed, but

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.930
we don't see any updates visually,

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.780
if we go back to the simulator
there's nothing here.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.400
This makes sense because we're
paused at the breakpoint, after all.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.120
Because we're paused, none of these
changes have taken effect, but

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.940
if the expression did run
we could quickly check

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.079
while we're paused by printing
the bug's array again.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.190
And we can see that it's now empty.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.790
And if we were to step over,
we'll see that we drop right into the if

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.740
statement, which also further validates
that the bugs count is now zero,

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.350
or the bugs array is empty.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.230
And that is less than the maximum bugs,

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.560
so now we're dropping right
back into that if statement.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.070
So we were able to change
things on the fly to

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.070
alter the execution of our program.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.240
That's pretty cool.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.580
And I'll hit play and
continue back and there you go.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.620
More bugs are created.
