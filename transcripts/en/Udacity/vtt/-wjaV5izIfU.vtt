00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.739
The answer is this language.

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:06.201
{0,1}*1 {0,1}.

00:00:06.201 --> 00:00:09.447
Remember, that in order for
the machine to accept the string,

00:00:09.447 --> 00:00:12.520
it just has to accept it in any
branch of it's computation.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.545
This self loop, on the initial state,
corresponds to the initial {0,1}*.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.250
This transition can happen for
the whole length of the string, or

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.210
it can happen none at all.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.610
In any excepting computation however,

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.650
it has to stop exactly two
symbols before the end.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.400
So that a 1, and then either a 0 or a 1,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.680
can be read just before the end
of the input is reached.
