00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.985
Here's another one. What proportion of students have gotten more than 20 points

00:00:04.985 --> 00:00:10.019
per post on average? This question's a little trickier than the last one. Here's

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.818
a hint, just remember that when you use the Z table it gives you the proportion

00:00:14.818 --> 00:00:19.514
less than a certain value, not the proportion greater. If you get this, I'm

00:00:19.514 --> 00:00:20.907
going to be super happy.
