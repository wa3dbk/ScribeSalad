00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.470
Here's a real example of a poly
alphabetic substitution cipher.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.110
It is called the Vigenere cipher.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.400
Vigenere cipher has a clever way
of representing possible mappings

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.800
from one letter to another as a matrix.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.500
Here we encrypt the plaintext by
processing one letter at a time

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.360
across the columns.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.600
We use the letters in a key to tell
us which row to look at the mapping.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.210
Now suppose we have a plain text, and

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.390
the first three letters are A-T-T,
and we have a key.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.350
In effect, the key stream should
be as long as the plaintext.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.040
So this will be lemon,
lemon, lemon, and go on.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.250
Here, the first three letters
of the key stream are L-E-M.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.060
Now let's see how we can encrypt
the plaintext according to the key.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.430
We encrypt the plaintext by
processing the letters one at a time

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.970
across the columns.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.220
The first letter is A,
so we look at column A.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.470
We use the letter in the key, L to look
at the row to decide the mapping of A.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.500
Here the mapping says L, which means
in server text, A has been mapped to L.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.400
The next plaintext letter is T.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.510
So we look at column T and

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.500
we use the letter in the key to look
at the row to decide the mapping.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.220
The letter is E in the key.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.800
And so we look at column T and row E.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.340
And the mapping is X.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.940
This means that the cipher
text of T is X.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.700
The next plaintext letter is T again.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.200
So look at column T again, but
here the letter in the key is M,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.940
so we look at column M, and
the mapping of column T, row M, is F.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.810
This means that the cipher text of
plain text T is F, therefore for

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.315
plain text A-T-T and key L-E-M,
the corresponding cipher text is L-X-F.
