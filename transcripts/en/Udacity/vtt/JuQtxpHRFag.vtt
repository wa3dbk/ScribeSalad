00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.510
Let me introduce to you
a concept of a bundle of rays.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.320
Okay, basically, again, remember,
what we are interested in is

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.580
rays of light that we want
to capture in a camera.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.840
Bundle of rays basically implies is
that, at any point in a scene, basically

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.570
it's a concentric set of rays of light
hitting that scene or this point.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.020
So in essence all rays of light as
converging to this specific point.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.380
In my world of course
what I have is a camera.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.210
At this point I can now
do a variety of things.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.839
I can actually rotate this
camera just at one point.

00:00:41.868 --> 00:00:45.870
So we can generalize this motion
by this curved arrow here.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.270
So what I mean by a bundle of rays
basically now is nothing else, but

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.980
at this point, we are going to get
a concentric set of arrays of light.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.630
And here I've just put them equidistant.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.750
We just kind of show that all light
is converging at this point here.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.280
And what I did by rotating
the camera at this point was try to

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.930
capture all of them.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.500
Of course, you know, these rays of light
could be coming in all directions.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.070
Let's now look at a specific type of
views to help us understand this.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.150
For example, this is my first view.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.720
I have a subject here and
I basically use the camera here.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.260
And basically now I get these bundle
of rays coming into my camera.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.580
Of course,
I could also have another view.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.660
Right?
The camera was pointing this way.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.670
This is my view.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.280
This is my normal from both sides here.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.170
And I now have two views.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.440
So now question comes up is,
if I have these two views can I create

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.640
a synthetic wheel that basically
is in between both of them,

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.150
which exactly does have the same
points that I have here?

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.785
So this point here is also
visible in this image here.

00:01:50.785 --> 00:01:52.695
And these points are also visible here.

00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:57.955
So by just combining these two can I now
generate a new view, a synthetic view?

00:01:57.955 --> 00:02:03.135
So the belief is that it's possible
to generate any synthetic view

00:02:03.135 --> 00:02:07.395
of a camera as long as it has
some center of projection.

00:02:07.395 --> 00:02:08.455
This one.

00:02:08.455 --> 00:02:12.870
So as long as I keep my camera
at this center of projection and

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.760
if I do get this view and that view,
I can synthesize this one.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.480
And this is something that's
important to note and

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.590
that's one of the reasons when we
talk about panoramas we want to

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.930
actually rotate them
around one single point.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.350
Either actually have them
have a path like this or

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.020
just at this point rotate
our camera like this.
