00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.920
Okay, so what's a bag?

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.370
A bag is a container having
the following properties, and

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.860
these properties will
make it just perfect for

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.740
holding the frontier
in our parallel BFS.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.210
First, a bag will be unordered and
will allow repetition.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.012
Remember that a BFS has to
maintain a frontier, so

00:00:17.012 --> 00:00:19.460
it enables as much
parallelism as possible,

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.420
we should allow redundant insertions
of the same vertex if need be.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.360
So here, for example,
you can see that this bag has

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.590
three copies of the element c,
and that's okay, why?

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.650
Because even if we process
c at the same time, by say,

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.540
different threads They should
all get assigned the same level.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.140
Now the second thing a bag will allow
is fast denumeration of its elements.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.630
Remember, the BFS has to traverse
all the vertices in the frontier, so

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.080
being able to do so
quickly will be extremely helpful.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.480
Now, also remember that our best
parallelization technique so

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.880
far has been divide and conquer.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.900
So one really special operation on a bag
is the idea of splitting it into two

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.870
roughly equal pieces.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.620
And, of course, the inverse operation
should also be fast, and that's union.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.900
Now union will also be special in that
it will be logically associative.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.440
So what does that mean?

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.270
Suppose I call this A and I call this B.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.940
Logical associativity means that A union
B is exactly the same as B union A,

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.130
at least logically even if that's
not physically how we store things.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.380
Now logical associativity will
also give us the property or

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.190
the ability to apply
reducer hyperobjects.
