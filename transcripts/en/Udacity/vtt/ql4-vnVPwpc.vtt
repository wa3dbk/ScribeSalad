00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.880
When solving this problem, x equals positive 7. Now, that's great work if you

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.718
got this one correct. Now, there were two ways to do this problem, we could

00:00:09.718 --> 00:00:13.078
write these two bases with a base of four or we could write these two bases

00:00:13.078 --> 00:00:18.570
with a base of two. I'll show you both methods, but first let's do the one with

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.468
a base of four. I know 16 is the same thing as 4 squared. And I also know 64 is

00:00:25.468 --> 00:00:30.940
the same thing as 4 cubed. So we write each of these bases with a base of 4,

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.210
raised to a certain power. These other exponents stay on the outside of the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.300
parenthesis. Now, we have a power raised to another power. Which means we can

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.645
multiply these two powers together. The same is true on the right hand side. We

00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:53.500
have 4 to the 3rd raised to x plus 3. So, I'll multiply this power by this

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.208
power here, and I'll multiply this power of 3 by the power x plus 3. Notice too

00:01:00.208 --> 00:01:04.390
that I'm putting the power in parenthesis. It's because I need to distribute

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.740
this 2 to both of these terms. The same is true for the 3. We multiply the 3 by

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.047
x, and the 3 by 3. Distributing the 2 here and here, and distributing the 3

00:01:15.047 --> 00:01:20.640
here and here, we get these powers. Now we have bases of 4, and we can set

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.132
these two exponents equal to one another. So, we'll have 4x plus 2, set equal

00:01:28.132 --> 00:01:34.765
to 3x plus 9. Next, we'll subtract 3x from both sides of the equation to get 1x

00:01:34.765 --> 00:01:39.960
plus 2 equals 9. Then, we'll subtract 2 from both sides of the equation to get

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.120
our answer of X equal to 7. Now the other way to do this problem is to rewrite

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.094
the base of 16 and the base of 64 with powers of 2. 16 is equal to 2 to the 4th

00:01:51.094 --> 00:01:57.109
and 64 is equal to 2 to the 6th. Next, we have powers raised to powers on both

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:02.130
sides of the equation. So we can multiply these two exponents together, here,

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.992
and we can multiply these two exponents together here. Now we have 2 raised to

00:02:07.992 --> 00:02:13.660
the 8x plus 4, distributing this 4. And we have 2 raised to the 6x plus 18,

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.692
distributing this 6. Now that both bases are identical, we set these exponents

00:02:18.692 --> 00:02:25.264
equal to one another. So we'll have 8x plus 4 equal to 6x plus 18. We'll

00:02:25.264 --> 00:02:32.480
subtract 6x from both sides of the equation to get 2x plus 4 equals 18. Next,

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.210
we'll subtract 4 from both sides to isolate the 2x. So, 2x will equal 14.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.350
Finally, we divide both sides by two to get 1x equals seven, our solution.
