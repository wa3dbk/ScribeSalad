00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.890
The right answers are the first two boxes here. And

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:07.905
let's talk through this. Now clearly, if we want to

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:10.350
do anything in the router, we need buy in from

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.130
the router vendors. So this is a big challenge and

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.410
convincing the router makers that, yes please open up the

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.330
network so that I can dump some code in it

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.500
and execute. The code, so that is a big challenge.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.190
The second is also a big challenge and that is,

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.160
if you look at the traffic on the internet

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.360
today it's just humongous. There's so much traffic on

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.370
the internet, and this is the reason why routers

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.620
are dumb animals. All that the do is when a

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.270
packet comes in, it's all happening in hardware, they

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.470
do a table look up to figure out. Given the

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.790
destination, what is the next stop that I send

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.425
this package to? So the internet core, the routing fabric

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:53.418
is operating at huge speeds, because even at the

00:00:53.418 --> 00:00:56.922
edge of the network today, we are already seeing gigabit

00:00:56.922 --> 00:01:00.281
speeds. Which means that the core of the network, you

00:01:00.281 --> 00:01:04.271
have several hundreds of gigabytes of packet processing that needs

00:01:04.271 --> 00:01:06.861
to be done and therefore it is important that

00:01:06.861 --> 00:01:10.680
the core of the network be blazingly fast. And software

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.330
routing is not going to be able to match the speed

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.440
that is needed in the core of the network for

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.690
packet processing. So these two choices are good

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.420
choices. Now, does active network's make the Internet

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.410
more vulnerable? Not really because the internet is

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.310
already vulnerable. Perhaps, it adds to it but not

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.160
particularly making it more vulnerable than what it

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.920
is already. And the last choice regarding code spoofing,

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.710
so long as we make sure that the

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.230
fingerprint that we generate to associate with the code,

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.850
that is going to be used for processing the capsule when it

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.760
arrives at a node. Is, cryptographically strong, then we can make

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.550
sure that this code spoofing does not happen, so I would

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.250
say, these are the two choices that apply for this question.
