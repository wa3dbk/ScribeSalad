00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.260
The first step in your project should
be to think about the database schema.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.570
Remember to write your
create table statements in

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.580
a file called tournament.sql.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.100
You'll be submitting this along with
your code as part of your final project.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.270
Remember that after you've created your
database, if you decide you've made

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.930
a mistake, you can always drop a table,
or the whole database and recreate it.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.140
And if you need to clear out the data
in a table, you can use delete.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.950
Remember that drop table will
remove the table completely, and

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.170
you will have to recreate it
using the recreate table command.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.010
Whereas delete from that table
will just remove the rows leaving

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.340
the column definitions,
constraints, and so forth.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.840
Intact.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.230
A few more things to keep in mind.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.420
When players are added to a tournament
the database should assign each

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.460
player a unique ID.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.460
You've seen how to do that
using the serial type.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.740
There's an extra credit option,

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.620
where you can extend the project
to support multiple tournaments.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.060
If you do that you'll want
unique IDs for those too.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.020
Second, remember that you
can use SQL aggregations,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.360
when you want to count things or
add them up.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.410
If you find yourself pulling lots of
rows from the database into your code,

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.740
and then using len to count them,
or using a loop to add them up,

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.600
trying doing that in
the database query instead.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.760
Last, if you notice your queries
start to get really complicated,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.060
don't forget about views.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.820
Views work nicely with aggregations,

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.350
when you want to present
summary data quickly.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.310
If you use views,
make sure to put your create view

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.350
statements into tournament.sql,
along with your create tables.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.180
With that, it's time to get into
designing your database and

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.270
writing your code.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.910
On the next page, you'll find a full
description of the project, and

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.460
an outline of the functions
you'll be writing.
