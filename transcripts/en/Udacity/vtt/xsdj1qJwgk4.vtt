00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.350
And in terms of narratives and

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.460
stories, do you have any examples of a visualization where you think this was

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.780
a great story, this told a really amazing story?

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.327
&gt;&gt; Yeah, one that struck me relatively recently is

00:00:12.327 --> 00:00:16.180
the slope graph that's on the cover of Alberto Cairo's book.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.290
So here what we've got plotted is,

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:26.490
on the left hand side, the percent of higher educated population by state.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.180
And then on the right hand side, the percent obese again by state.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.010
And then a given state's connected by the line.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.690
Which allows you to see relatively quickly the sort of inverse relationship here

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.790
across the blue states you know, positive relationship here in the red states.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.180
And can allow you to really in a straightforward manner without really having to

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.710
explain too much about it get an understanding and

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.810
pick out interesting things, and again, start to form that story or narrative.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.890
This was the, actually, the first time I encountered a slope graph, or

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.760
at least the first time that one stuck with me.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.500
And I found it inspiring because there are actually a lot of

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.000
different use cases for graphs like this.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.230
Which I hadn't really anticipated.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.360
because you're really only plotting two data points, right?

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.020
&gt;&gt; Really. Yeah.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.110
&gt;&gt; One way is you know, to look at things over time, and again,

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.230
with only two data points you think that's not that interesting.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.190
But depending on your data it can be.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.380
Or also the comparison of groups.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.830
so, for example here in this little graph,

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.460
I'm plotting feedback from employees' survey.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.850
Where on the left hand side, we have the percent favorable you know,

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.190
a summary metric for the survey for the overall company.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.340
And on the right hand side, for a given team.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.210
This can be your engineering organization, for example.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.191
And you can see really quickly a whole lot of things, right?

00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:50.540
&gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So, on the left hand side you get the absolute values,

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.760
you get the relative rank ordering of the different dimensions.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.390
You get those things on the right hand side as well.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.720
And then via the slope of the lines here, you get the percent difference between

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.228
the groups without ever having to explain what a percent difference is.

00:02:04.228 --> 00:02:08.483
So it's just a really efficient form of communication for

00:02:08.483 --> 00:02:10.440
the right circumstance.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's great.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.619
When I look at this graph, one of my key takeaways is this.
