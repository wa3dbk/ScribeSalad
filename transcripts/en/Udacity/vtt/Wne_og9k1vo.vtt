00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.488
Could we have done the same thing with a loop over here? Not really because in

00:00:04.488 --> 00:00:10.610
this loop we didn't traverse all of the pictures, we skipped the zeroth one.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.516
You can only use the enhanced for loop when you look at all of the elements of

00:00:14.516 --> 00:00:19.161
an array list. And there's another reason when you use the enhanced for loop

00:00:19.161 --> 00:00:24.556
you don't actually know the index value. Of any of the elements. And, over

00:00:24.556 --> 00:00:27.884
here, we needed the index value because we had the i-th element, and then the i

00:00:27.884 --> 00:00:33.108
minus first element. But, I'll give you a challenge question, and that is, to

00:00:33.108 --> 00:00:37.392
rethink the logic of this loop, and rewrite it, as an enhanced for loop, like

00:00:37.392 --> 00:00:43.300
this. And to make that a little bit easier, you get to position the first

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.717
image, at offset ten. So put ten pixels before the first image, before the

00:00:48.717 --> 00:00:51.479
second, before the third, and so on.
