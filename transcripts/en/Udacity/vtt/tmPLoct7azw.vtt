00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.460
Now that we understand the when of
adaptive design, namely the points at

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.690
which our UI breaks, let's talk
about the what of adaptive design,

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.860
specifically the techniques for
what to fix.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.160
Let's think back to what we wanted to
optimize our UIs for and what we can do.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.440
Filling the width of the screen can
become problematic on wider devices.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.910
This might not optimize for
balance and line length.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.150
There a couple of approaches
we can take to address this.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.320
Firstly, you can show additional
content on the screen.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.720
Instead of just filling the extra space,
we can instead show more content there.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.750
One way to do this is to reveal
previously hidden UI elements.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.615
For example, you might use an off-screen
navigation draw on small devices,

00:00:43.615 --> 00:00:47.180
but then pin it on-screen
on larger devices.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.150
We might also divide the available
space to show additional content.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.440
For example, showing a details
page on the same screen as a list

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.870
rather than on a completely new screen.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.090
We also might reflow content
on different size screens to

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.580
better arrange it.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.330
It this example, we're reflowing
a few things on the larger screen.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.130
Firstly, we switch from
a single column of content

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.230
to multiple columns to make better
use of the available space.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.770
Secondly, we're not just
rearranging these content cards,

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.450
we're also adjusting their layouts to
better fit with this new arrangement.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.190
Lastly, we tweak the app bar height
when the space is available for

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.900
a more balanced, branded appearance.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.800
We can also use this reflow technique
in different orientations on the same

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.020
device.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.240
In this example,

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.160
a portrait layout places an image with
a set aspect ratio above some text.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.400
Now using the same layout
in landscape would likely

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.360
fill the entire screen with an image and
push the text down below the fold.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.030
A better approach would be
to reflow the content so

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.400
that it's horizontally stacked
instead of vertically,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.090
allowing you to see both the image and
the text together.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.350
Notice that we're also reflowing
the FAP to a more appropriate position

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.920
for this layout.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.620
If you don't have more
content to show on-screen,

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.729
then you can expand
the content up to a point, and

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.040
then introduce margins to constrain
it from growing too wide.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.775
This works extremely well
with a paper metaphor, where

00:02:16.775 --> 00:02:21.725
you can use a paper surface which has a
maximum width to constrain the content.

00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:24.935
This technique can also work
great if you have rich imagery,

00:02:24.935 --> 00:02:28.645
such as a full bleed background,
which you can put behind the content and

00:02:28.645 --> 00:02:30.595
layer a service on top of it.

00:02:30.595 --> 00:02:33.065
This can create an extremely
immersive experience.
