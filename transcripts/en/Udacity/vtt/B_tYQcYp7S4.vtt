00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.297
The equation for our circle is x squared plus y squared equals 2500. Now that's

00:00:07.297 --> 00:00:12.560
amazing if you got this equation right. This one wasn't easy. Now, we know this

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.002
horizontal distance is x units. That's the distance between these two points,

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:23.398
at least just the horizontal distance. And we know that this vertical distance

00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:29.438
is a distance of y units. We started at 0 and we went down y. So, notice that

00:00:29.438 --> 00:00:35.410
we've created a right triangle. So we can relate these distances with this side

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.641
length. The string is 50 centimeters in length, so we know that x squared plus

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:48.646
y squared equals 50 squared, or 2500. So, no matter where the position of the

00:00:48.646 --> 00:00:54.143
string is, this distance relationship will always be true. X squared plus y

00:00:54.143 --> 00:00:59.738
squared will always equal 2,500. And it turns out that this distance from the

00:00:59.738 --> 00:01:05.692
center to any point on the circle is called the radius. In this case 50

00:01:05.692 --> 00:01:06.840
centimeters.
