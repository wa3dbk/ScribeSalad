00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.410
Remember, these
are homogeneous coordinates,

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.372
so here I wrote it instead of w but
with s's.

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:08.119
So it's full homogeneous
coordinate system,

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:12.570
which will go from
the homogeneous through a linear

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.530
operation to a scaled version
of the new x prime, y prime.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.880
So, the full transformation

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.970
is referred to as a general projective
transformation, or a homography.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.900
And a homography still
maps lines to lines,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.800
because remember we talked about
prospective transforms always maintain

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.620
lines, and things that are inside of
each other stay inside of each other.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.640
But this is what's typically sometimes
referred to as perspective transform.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.070
So the idea is if I had a plane and

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.530
I was very close to you and
I tilted it this way.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.040
And we'll do more of this later.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.460
The edge that's near you will
seem longer than the edge that's

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.800
farther away from you.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.539
And we'll prove later that
the transformation of a plane

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.013
can be represented this way.

00:00:56.013 --> 00:01:00.136
Now of course,
because this is a homogeneous transform,

00:01:00.136 --> 00:01:04.101
I can scale everything by constant and
it has no impact.

00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:06.898
So I can make this last
degree of freedom be a 1, and

00:01:06.898 --> 00:01:10.152
I'll get a slightly different w,
but it doesn't matter,

00:01:10.152 --> 00:01:13.888
because I'm going to divide
everything through by w anyway.

00:01:13.888 --> 00:01:16.760
So that 8 degrees of freedom,
that's the full,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.230
it's referred to as the homography.
