So just to summarize for a Google search, each had its own value proposition,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
but most importantly each had its own revenue stream,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and one segment cannot exist without the other--that is, if you had users

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but you had no revenue, you'd be out of business over time.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
But if you had a revenue model but no users, there would be no reason for those

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
advertisers to show up. Now this was an example of a 2-sited market.

00:00:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's see what happens when we have multiple sites.
