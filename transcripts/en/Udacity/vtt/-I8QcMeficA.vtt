Now, InGrids, we allow any entity definition to have a physics object, that is

00:00:03.776 --> 00:00:09.200
an entity doesn't inherit from physics object and isn't required to have one e.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.990
Now from those daring digital souls who want one, they'll need to actually

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.735
create a handle to the physics body and keep it around over time so they can

00:00:14.735 --> 00:00:19.670
manipulate it. Before they can do that, of course they have to first fill out

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.904
the entity definition object and pass that out to the gPhysicsEngine.addBody

00:00:22.904 --> 00:00:27.597
which we've coded up previously. Now for grids, every object in the world is in

00:00:27.597 --> 00:00:31.760
a box. So our description is pretty easy to generate. First off, we passed the

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.928
x and y position values to the class, alongside the halfWidth and halfHeight of

00:00:34.928 --> 00:00:39.060
the box representing its size. In addition to that, box 2d expects some

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.360
specific surface properties such as dampening, friction, things along those

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.080
lines. So we go ahead and set them here as well if we want them.
