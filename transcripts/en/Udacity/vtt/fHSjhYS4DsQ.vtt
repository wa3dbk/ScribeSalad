00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.781
So now we know that we can pull out an x squared from the first two terms. And

00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:07.626
when we do that, we need to multiply it by two more terms in here. So that when

00:00:07.626 --> 00:00:11.795
we redistribute the multiplication, we end up with what we started with. So what

00:00:11.795 --> 00:00:15.856
I'd like you to do now, is fill in what belongs in each set of parenthesis here.

00:00:15.856 --> 00:00:19.954
Now that we've pulled out our greatest common factors of x squared for the first

00:00:19.954 --> 00:00:22.044
pair, and 3 for the second pair of terms.
