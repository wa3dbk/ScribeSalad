00:00:01.378 --> 00:00:05.188
[MUSIC]

00:00:05.188 --> 00:00:08.521
So I just want to talk about the role
that measuring plays inside of

00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:11.440
a DevOps organization or
for a DevOps engineer.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.980
We have an objective, we have a goal to

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.910
create some efficiency, to make some
improvement in the organization.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.410
&gt;From its own side that aspiration,

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.310
the aspiration to create
the change is not enough.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.010
So even if we have the technical
capability to create something better,

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.770
we need to be able to test and verify
that we've got the result we wanted.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.810
It's very easy to to make a claim, but

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.350
if we're going to be pragmatic in our
approach we need to test that claim and

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.226
this is where measurement
this becomes key.

00:00:42.226 --> 00:00:45.490
We articulate the objective,
we articulate if

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.095
whatever the steps are we're going to
take to achieve that objective.

00:00:49.095 --> 00:00:53.700
So underneath the objectives we need to
articulate the implementation steps that

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.010
we're going to take.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.560
And then we have to ask that question,
how do I measure as measured by.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.580
So that we can reflect at the end of
this period whether the steps that we

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.300
took actually achieve the outcome that
we wanted, and this is really critical.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.790
When we're talking about tens of
thousands of servers in an environment,

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.150
the change propositions
that we have can have

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.380
a broad impact on our customer base.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.010
So we need to be able to clearly measure
whether thing we're doing is actually

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.690
helping in the way that
we thought it would.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.210
The way that I like to think about this
is we we make the value proposition or

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.010
we talk about the outcome
that we want to achieve.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.990
We talk about the implementation
steps we're going to take and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.660
then we ask the question how we measure
whether those steps got us to this goal.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.070
And then when we reflect
on that we ask one or

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.730
three questions was the goal effective
or the implementation steps effective or

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.540
is it the measurements
that need to be changed.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.520
And in this way we create a kind
of a blame free environment

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.410
which is really really critical to
fostering a strong DevOps culture.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.840
Measurements help us to move
the conversation away from people and

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.040
onto the outcomes that we
were trying to achieve.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.930
It's very, very easy to personalize
result especially in an environment

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.820
which we think that we carry
the cause like we're carrying

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.860
the banner for the thing.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.680
So if you come into an organization and

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.040
you advocate strongly to take
a particular technical stance.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:28.000
You could feel maybe rightfully so
that your success is tied to the success

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.370
of the power of that thing but this
can be a very dangerous place to be.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.110
Because it colors our perception
about the work that we're doing.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.630
It's better if we start from the
position that we have strong technical

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.630
skills.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.942
We evaluate the situation,
we make a proposal.

00:02:44.942 --> 00:02:47.782
I want to create a change here for
the better.

00:02:47.782 --> 00:02:50.440
I want to increase test
coverage because I believe

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.560
that this is going to lower
defects in production.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.740
And then I'm going to measure so
these are the steps I'm going to take

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.940
to do it, and this is how I'm going to
measure whether it's successful.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.790
And that's going to drive
the conversation around one of

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:03.580
those three areas.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.170
As opposed to a conversation
about whether I was right or

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.070
wrong about whether the thing I
did was going to have the impact

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.550
I said it was going to have.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:12.650
First of all, we don't know.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.250
I mean let's be honest,
there's a lot of variation in software.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.270
The best software in the world
got some problems and

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.670
it's not always appropriate
in every context.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.490
So something that worked at your
last job or something that your

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.080
friend did at another place may
work perfectly in that context but

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.010
it may not work well in
the context at your end.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.600
And so you need to be open to taking
that feedback, to measuring the results

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.620
of what you're doing, so
that you can find the right fit.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.120
And your advocacy is not where
your value is going to lie,

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.230
it's in your ability to assess.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.380
The results of the thing
that you proposed or

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.810
the thing that you did that's where your
value is really going to come through.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.458
And your values a DevOp engineer comes
from your ability to evaluate whether

00:03:57.458 --> 00:03:59.650
the thing that you did was successful.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.730
It is a much less to do with your
ability to identify a tool in your

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.040
environment and much more to do with
your ability to make a proposal,

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.020
execute on it, and then reflect on
how successful was that effort.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.580
Did it hit the mark or didn't it?

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.650
That's the thing that people
are going to want from you.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.420
You may have all sorts of
interesting opinions and

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.150
you should definitely share them
about software and about methodology.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.980
But when it comes to execution,

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.400
you want to take a critical
data-driven approach.
