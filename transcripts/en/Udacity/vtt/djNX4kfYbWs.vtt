00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.590
The first thing we need to do is just substitute each side of the equation into

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.270
our log operators or our natural log operators rather. Taking the natural log

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:15.610
of each side gives us natural log of e to the negative 0.5t equals natural log

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.310
of 5 over 1000. We can simplify the left hand side by remembering that natural

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.810
log and e taken to an exponent are inverse operations. Or inverse functions.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.520
That means that all that's left on the left hand side is negative 0.5t. For

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.999
now, let's just keep the right hand side the same.
