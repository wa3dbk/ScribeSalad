00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.140
In the last few lessons, you've learned a lot of new information about

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.292
exponential and logarithmic functions. You've seen their graphs. You've learned

00:00:08.292 --> 00:00:11.108
about properties that apply to them, and you've also learned how to evaluate

00:00:11.108 --> 00:00:15.340
and manipulate them. In the coming videos, we're going to explore various

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.430
strategies to solve a variety of exponential and logarithmic equations. A few

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.840
lessons ago, we touched on an application problem where we considered the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.760
amount of bacteria which remained alive after a patient was medicated. This

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.460
lesson is going to give you the tools you need to solve other application

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.320
problems as well. Maybe you're earning interest on a certain amount of money

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.695
that you've put in a savings account. Then we'd have an equation like this.

00:00:39.695 --> 00:00:47.110
12,500 equals 10,000 times 1.03 to the t. Or perhaps you've just bought a loaf

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.958
of bread, but you're about to go on vacation. We could use an equation like

00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:54.606
this to figure out how much mold would grow on the bread after a certain amount

00:00:54.606 --> 00:00:58.905
of time. Or, what if you've just been through an earthquake, and you want to

00:00:58.905 --> 00:01:03.570
figure out how intense the quake was? Well, you could use equations like these

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.232
two to talk about that. This one characterizes the earthquake that happened in

00:01:08.232 --> 00:01:13.253
Japan in 2011. And this one talks about the worst earthquake that ever happened

00:01:13.253 --> 00:01:17.618
to California, which was in 1857. These scenarios are all going to be super

00:01:17.618 --> 00:01:21.810
interesting to look at, but I think we should wait a bit before we get to them.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.148
For now though, let's stick with something pretty simple. You've been learning

00:01:25.148 --> 00:01:29.800
with exponents a lot lately, so I think this equation is a good choice. We have

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.002
4 to the x equals 64. What does x equal then? Now, some of you might be able to

00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:39.278
do this in your head or if that seems tricky you can try guessing and checking

00:01:39.278 --> 00:01:41.529
using a calculator.
