00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.874
We can perform this because we were dealing with factors here. We were

00:00:03.874 --> 00:00:08.232
multiplying between these two numbers. So we removed a common factor of x plus

00:00:08.232 --> 00:00:12.215
y. And notice we still have multiplication here. Again if I think about

00:00:12.215 --> 00:00:15.955
distributing this a to x plus y, I would get this first term, and if I

00:00:15.955 --> 00:00:20.546
distributed this positive 2 to this x plus y, I would get my second term. This

00:00:20.546 --> 00:00:25.033
factoring is the opposite, or the inverse, of the distributive property. So you

00:00:25.033 --> 00:00:29.276
try one out. What would be the factored form for this expression? Write your

00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:33.017
answer here. Be sure you use parentheses, and there's no need to put a

00:00:33.017 --> 00:00:35.162
multiplication sign in between them.
