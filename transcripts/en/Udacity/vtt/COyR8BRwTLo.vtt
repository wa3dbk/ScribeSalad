00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Our last question was basically our next steps.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I mean we've learned a lot of service side technology, introduction of programming-type things,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Where do our students go from here and what would you recommend they learn next?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Sure. So I would start getting good at two main technologies.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
One is JavaScript, which is a completely separate programing language

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
from anything we've talked about in this class

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
in that it runs in the browser, and so you can make your web page do fancier things.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The other is CSS--I've had some CSS in the homeworks and in the lectures

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but I've never quizzed you guys on it because we don't know how to even grade the CSS yet.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And this is how you described what your pages look like--

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
colors and font sizes and boxes and layouts and all that sort of stuff.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Basically everything you've learned in the class, you can make

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
a pretty substantial website with everything you've learned in this class up until this point.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And JavaScript and CSS, you can make your website look more professional,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
look more like a website, but functionally, you can do all the major things.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
JavaScript and CSS--if you learned those, you'll have a lot of tools in your toolbox.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Okay. Great! I think that's all the questions we had.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Unit 6 and homework 6 has just been posted--anything you want to say

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
about that or about week 7 and the final?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Unit 6 is caching, basically 101 ways to use memcache.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
That should be a fun one--the homework should be pretty straightforward I think..

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And in Unit 7, no more quizzes in Unit 7.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It's basically we're just going to talk about a lot of the real world stuff we did with growing Reddit,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and we'll talk to some of the Udacity engineers about how they app engine in production.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Then the final is basically going to be building another

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
website similar to your blog but this time all at once and we''ll talk all about that in Unit 7.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
One last question I just remembered was how to prep for the final, and I would recommend

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
personally that you just make sure you have all the homework done and you understand it.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
If you have those things done, I would say the final really shouldn't be bad.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Yeah! If you've done the homeworks, the final shouldn't be any problem.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
In fact, after I wrote the final code, about two-thirds of that code is from homeworks.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The user a registration stuff, the caching stuff-it's all--you'll find yourself when you're writing

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
any web application a lot about that--a lot of that code will get reused over and over again.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
That why we taught it.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
If you can do the homework, you shouldn't have any problem with the finals.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Okay. Great! Well, see you in class. &gt;&gt;Right. Bye guys!
