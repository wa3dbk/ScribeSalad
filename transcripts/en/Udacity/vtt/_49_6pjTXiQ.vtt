00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.270
So, you've seen some examples of how
API's can work within the same machine.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.210
But what this course is
really going to focus on,

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.950
is how API's can enable communication
between several machines.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.630
This is where Web API's
come into the picture.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.580
Simply put, Web API's make it possible
to invoke the execution of code

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.670
on another machine via the Internet.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.810
A machine can use multiple web
APIs to create a new application,

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.610
sometimes called a Mashup,

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.550
providing users with a new experience
that leverages existing applications.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.100
Soon, you'll be making
a Mashup of your own.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.930
But why is all this important?

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.035
And what do companies gain by allowing
their content to be accessible via

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:36.220
API's?

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.010
By opening up code over the Internet,

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.890
API providers are not only helping other
developers who want to use their code,

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.355
but are also promoting
their own business.

00:00:44.355 --> 00:00:48.870
API's for social media applications, for
example, allow users to share content,

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.410
logins, and personalized data
between web applications.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.110
Gaining popularity, and giving users
more functionality with their accounts.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.210
This means more traffic,
and more users for

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.710
social media applications
with publicly available APIs.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.650
So, implementing accessible web API's,

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.150
isn't only just a nice thing to do,
it's also a lucrative investment for

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.320
many companies, and in some cases
a companies proprietary money stream.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.090
An example of a company that depends
heavily on it's API, is Twilio.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.760
A cloud communications company that
allows developers to make, and

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.910
receive phone calls, and text
messages using its web server's API.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.570
Twilio has free, and
paid access versions of their API,

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.800
forming a key revenue stream for
the company.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.780
Check out Twilio's developer's sight,
and see all the features of their API.
