00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.292
We've worked really hard to come up with this brand new equation, so let's use

00:00:04.292 --> 00:00:09.260
it. Grant has actually made more than $10,000, since cleaning glasses has been

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:16.562
so profitable. He wants to invest more money, $20,000 in another account at a

00:00:16.562 --> 00:00:22.900
4% annual interest rate for 5 years. Should he have the money compounded

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.329
quarterly which is four times a year or monthly? Well, let's help him figure

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:34.394
that out. How much money will he end up with after 5 years in either case? This

00:00:34.394 --> 00:00:39.927
is the perfect chance to use our new equation. Please round to two decimal

00:00:39.927 --> 00:00:41.060
places.
