00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.830
Can you think of a friend who works really long

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:08.000
hours on a computer, programming, writing, researching for hours. By

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.240
the way, that person could be you. This seems to

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.210
be a problem, especially as the number of hours we spend

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.840
on a computer keeps going up. If you could only

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.730
remember to walk away from the computer for a little bit.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.230
Let's write a program that schedules breaks throughout the day

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.350
reminding that friend who works really long hours on the computer,

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.830
to listen to music, get up and dance to their favorite song,

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.460
or just walk away from the computer every once in a while.
