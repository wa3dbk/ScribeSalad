00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:05.838
In your pseudocode, you may want to write a computation. Such as the total cost

00:00:05.838 --> 00:00:10.625
equals purchase price, plus the cost of gas. You might want to have a decision.

00:00:10.625 --> 00:00:15.895
If the total cost 1 is less than the total cost 2 to one thing, else to another

00:00:15.895 --> 00:00:22.285
thing. You might want to repeat certain steps. While the bank balance is less

00:00:22.285 --> 00:00:28.272
than your target, or repeat some actions say, ten times. Those are the three

00:00:28.272 --> 00:00:32.040
essential elements of pseudocode. Computations or other actions without any

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.860
regard of the syntax of a particular programming language. When you're doing

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.188
programming there are two things that you need to learn, that's syntax of the

00:00:41.188 --> 00:00:47.222
programming language and how to solve problems. And we'll do this in parallel

00:00:47.222 --> 00:00:51.680
on two tracks. In the next lesson, you'll learn quite a bit more about how to

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.408
work with the programming language. But right now let's learn a little bit more

00:00:55.408 --> 00:00:59.220
about algorithms, pseudocode, and problem solving. You've just seen an

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.814
algorithms that manipulated numbers to give you a useful answer. But I thought

00:01:02.814 --> 00:01:05.424
it would be more fun to show here a few example that don't have to do with

00:01:05.424 --> 00:01:11.170
numbers. So here is Robbie our home robot. A robot is a computer too, it

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.132
carries out tasks and one has to program it to do the right thing. Right now

00:01:16.132 --> 00:01:21.080
Robbie's task is. To clean up a bunch of legos, Robbie needs to put all the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.795
blue legos before all the yellow legos. Here's our first attempt at an

00:01:25.795 --> 00:01:30.426
algorithm. It's a sequence of steps. Robbie will wave his magic wand and he

00:01:30.426 --> 00:01:36.246
will say, make it so. Well, that's not really going to work. An algorithm has

00:01:36.246 --> 00:01:41.440
to be executable. And not involve magic steps. Our pseudocode, here, asks

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.750
Robbie to repeatedly execute these statements. Namely, why all the blocks are

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.010
not yet in order. Each time, Robbie is supposed to scan the sequence of blocks.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.055
Find the first one that's yellow before blue one, and swap. So Robbie would go

00:01:58.055 --> 00:02:02.558
along starting at the left, until it finds the yellow one before blue one. Swap

00:02:02.558 --> 00:02:06.513
the two. And then it would do it again. In the next step, it would scan from

00:02:06.513 --> 00:02:09.876
the left until it finds the yellow one before blue one and swap them, and

00:02:09.876 --> 00:02:15.240
again. Now I'd like you to try this. If I write a b for blue and a y for

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.580
yellow, tell me the sequence of the blocks after the next slot, and the next

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.499
one after that.
