00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.170
Try simplifying this complex fraction. Write your numerator here, and your

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.190
denominator here. Good luck. I'll also give you a caution. Here, we have m plus

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.410
5, and here we have m plus 2. Notice that this is not multiplication. So m plus

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.623
5 is 1 factor, and m plus 2 is another.
