00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.460
Before concluding this lesson, let's look at a few more patterns. And

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.880
although it will take too long to cover them in detail, I

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.986
would like to at least mention and quickly discuss a few more

00:00:08.986 --> 00:00:12.080
of these more commonly-used patterns. In fact, some of the patterns that

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.400
I will discuss, you might have used yourself. Maybe without knowing their

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.300
name or the fact that they were design patterns. So let's start

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.660
with a Visitor pattern, which is a way of separating an algorithm

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.150
from an object structure on which it operates. And a practical result

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.010
of this separation is the ability to add the new operation

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.680
to exist in object structures, without modifying the structures. So, basically

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.540
what this pattern does, is to allow for defining and easily

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.870
modifying set of operations to perform on the objects of the collection.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.570
And the typical usage of this is, for example, when you're

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.140
visiting a graph, or a set of objects, and you want

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.090
to perform some operations on these objects. By using a visitor

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.410
pattern, you can decouple the operation

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.830
from the objects. Although not straightforward,

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.360
this pattern is very, very useful. So, I really encourage you

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.060
to look at it in more detail and get familiar with it.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.040
The second pattern I want to mention is the decorator pattern.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.820
The decorator pattern is basically a wrapper that adds functionality to a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.030
class. So the way in which it works, is that you

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.230
will take a class, you will build a class that basically wraps

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.250
this class. So it reproduces the functionality of the original class, but

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.900
it also adds some functionality. And for all the functionality that was

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.750
already in the original class, it will simply invoke this

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.080
functionality and for the new one, you will implement it

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.510
using the services of the class. And a nice property

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.760
of the decorator pattern is that it's stackable. So you can

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.210
add decorators on decorators on decorators, and further increase the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.052
functionality provided by your class. The iterator is another very

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:37.810
commonly-used pattern. And, you probably use this one yourself because,

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.090
it's also part of many standard libraries. What the iterator allows

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.220
you to do, is basically to access elements of a collection

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.490
without knowing the underlying representation. So the iterator will allow you

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.630
to just go through a set of objects without worrying about

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.200
how the objects are stored. So you basically just ask the

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.810
iterator to give you the first object, the next object and

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.130
so on. Another very commonly-used pattern is the observer pattern. And

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.650
this pattern is very useful when you have an object of

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.190
interest and a set of other objects that are interested in

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.240
the changes that might occur in this first object. So

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.690
what the observer pattern allows you to do is to register

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.460
these objects, so that they let the system know that

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.690
they're interested in changes in this first object. And then, every

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.840
time that there is a change, these other objects will

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.030
be automatically notified. So basically,

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.290
the observer pattern allows for notifying

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.310
dependents when an object of interest changes. If you want

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.020
an example of this, just think about the file system and

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.870
imagine having a folder. All the views of this folder will

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.970
want to be notified every time that there's a change in

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.720
the folder because they need to refresh. So instead of continuously

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.390
checking the state of the folder, they will just register and basically

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.430
say, hey, we're interested in knowing when something changes in this

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.320
folder. And when something changes in the folder, they will be automatically

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.300
notified. So it will be some sort of a push notification

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.590
instead of a pull notification, if you are familiar with that terminology.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.020
Finally the proxy pattern is a pattern in which a surrogate

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.370
controls access to an object. In other words, we have our object,

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.220
and we have our proxy here. So all the requests to the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.950
object will go through the proxy that will then forward them. And

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.020
all the responses from the object will also go through the

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.580
proxy. They will then forward them to the original requester. So what

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.710
the proxy allows you to do is to control how this object,

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.180
that is behind the proxy, is actually accessed, for example, by filtering

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.500
some calls. So in a sense, the proxy allows use

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.470
for masking some of the functionality of the object that

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.070
is behind the proxy. And there's many, many, many more

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.424
useful patterns. That can help you when designing and implementing

00:03:34.424 --> 00:03:37.220
the system. So once more, I really encourage you to

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.740
have a look at the book, to look at the

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.570
resources online, and to really get more familiar with these

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.890
patterns, and to try to use them in your everyday work.
