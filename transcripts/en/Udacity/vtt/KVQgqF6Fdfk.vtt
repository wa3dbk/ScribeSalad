00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.210
We call this meme generating app MeMe.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.720
MeMe let's you choose
an image from your phone.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.080
Here I've got some funny
ones of my teammates,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.598
like this one of Jared in the library.

00:00:10.598 --> 00:00:15.460
So I'm going to make a meme
that makes fun of napping and

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.439
API's because he's working
on a networking course.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.080
And then once you've added text to an
image, you can share it with a friend.

00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:28.570
MeMe stores the memes you've made in
a collection of meme model objects.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.860
And you can browse your
memes in a table or a grid.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.650
Like most apps it's built
from standard UI components,

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.600
right off the shelf,
which makes it intuitive to use.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.710
At first glance,
this may seem like a daunting task.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.790
There are probably a lot of
pieces you're not familiar with.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:44.910
But don't worry.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.070
By the end of this class,
you'll have the confidence and

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.800
skill to create this app on your own.
