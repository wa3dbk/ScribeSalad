00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
For the final quiz for this unit, your goal is to change the look up procedure

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.370
to now work with dictionaries.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.780
Before we had look up working where index was a list of entries,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.080
and we did the look up by looping through the index, that required a lot of work

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.050
we had to go through each entry, check if the keyword matched,

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.050
and then return the one that matched, if we got to the end without finding it,

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.690
we returned none.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.890
Your goal for the quiz, is to modify this code

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.860
to now work where the index is going to be the dictionary,

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.230
and we should be able to find the entry much more quickly.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.430
We don't need to loop through anything.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.200
we can use the property of the dictionary to look up the entry right away.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.870
If you understand the add to index code that we just did,

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.180
I think you can define look up on your own.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.980
The one thing to be careful about,

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.950
is that you need make sure that when the index does not contain the keyword,

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.520
when it's not in the dictionary,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.520
instead of producing an error, that it returns the value none.
