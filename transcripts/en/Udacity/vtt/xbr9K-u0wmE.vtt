00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.900
Now the proofs for showing undecidability are somewhat easier than showing NP completeness,

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.850
because basically, what we are doing is the following.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.760
We start out with saying that for any computer program, we can decide a certain property

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.149
and then derive from that but then you could solve the halting problem.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.670
And you have seen that this works with a lot of properties.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.370
So deciding if the program will stop doesn't work,

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.350
deciding if the program is equivalent to another program doesn't work,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.980
deciding if the program even does what it's supposed to do doesn't work.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.130
Even though you might still feel somewhat cheated by the original halting problem proof,

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.370
you might be inclined to think that once you accept that

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.210
then there's actually not much you can decide about the properties of a program at least in general,

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.640
and it turns out that that is exactly true.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.590
In 1953, Henry Rice after whom Rice's Theorem is named proofed that

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.000
basically you cannot use an algorithm to decide anything about the properties of a given program.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.070
So we must be a little bit more formal about this property x thing here.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.040
And Henry Rice used the notion of a functional property here.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.280
Now, what is a functional property? Sounds very complicated. Actually, it's a very simple definition.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.060
Any functional property has these two properties.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.600
First, it describes how the output relates to the input.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.800
So this is what we mean by behavior and that is important to how they relate to each other

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.900
not for example how much time we need or something like that.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.970
And the second property is that there must be some programs that have this property,

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.210
and other programs that don't have this property.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.180
So that when you look at all possible computer programs, some of them will have this property

00:01:38.180 --> 99:59:59.000
others won't so that it can basically distinguish between the two.
