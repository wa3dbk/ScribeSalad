So when it comes to putting
ads in a native app,

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.480
there's actually a lot of different
things we have to consider.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.980
Especially because the screen
size on a phone or

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.810
a tablet is a lot smaller than it
might be on a desktop application.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.190
So what do we have to keep in mind?

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.149
&gt;&gt; There are several things.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.190
Every app offer a different type
of experience to its users.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.110
So it's important that your ad
format match that experience.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.270
While a banner ad may work well for

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.020
a flashlight app, a gaming app could
benefit much more from a full video app.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.720
In other words,
you need to take into consideration

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.520
the placement within your app and
the different ad formats.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.489
You could try the two leading platforms.

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.390
Adsense or double-click.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.930
However, there are other platforms
out there for you to check out.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.890
&gt;&gt; And we've linked them in
the instructor notes below.
