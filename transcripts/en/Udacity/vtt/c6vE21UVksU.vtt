00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.000
Just like with the z-test, when the t-statistic is far from 0 in either

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.290
direction, in other words, if the sample mean is far from this population mean,

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:14.300
we reject the null. The first thing we're going to do is compare the sample

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.629
mean with the population mean. So in this case, t is the sample mean minus the

00:00:19.629 --> 00:00:26.640
population mean, mu naught, divided by the standard error. And instead of being

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.709
stigma divided by root n, we use the sample standard deviation. Since the

00:00:30.709 --> 00:00:34.674
t-statistic depends on so many factors, let's takes some quizzes to make sure

00:00:34.674 --> 00:00:38.578
we understand how these factors affect the t-statistic, and therefore, our

00:00:38.578 --> 00:00:45.920
statistical decision. The larger or smaller the value of x bar, the stronger

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.376
the evidence that the population mean that the sample comes from is greater

00:00:49.376 --> 00:00:55.821
than this population mean we're comparing it to. Similarly, the larger or

00:00:55.821 --> 00:01:00.436
smaller the value of x bar, the stronger the evidence that the population mean

00:01:00.436 --> 00:01:07.361
that x bar comes from is less than this certain value we are comparing it to.

00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:11.716
And finally, the further the value of x bar from mu naught in either direction,

00:01:11.716 --> 00:01:17.513
the stronger or weaker the evidence that mu is not equal to mu naught.
