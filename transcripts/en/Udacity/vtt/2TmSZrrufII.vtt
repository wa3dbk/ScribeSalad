00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.510
One final note on computational performance. If you're using

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.810
third party libraries you should check and see if there

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.950
is a smaller, faster mobile-optimized version. For example, if you're

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.560
using Jquery you might consider switching to Zepto. For any

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.660
library you use though, be sure to use the

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.250
most up to date version. Many libraries are in the

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.140
process of optimizing for lower memory and CPU consumption, and

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.990
this can be a great way to save some cycles.
