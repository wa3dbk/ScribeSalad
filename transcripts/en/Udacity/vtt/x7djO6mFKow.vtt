00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Consider this grammar. It's time for you to test your knowledge

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
by thinking about which of these five utterances are in the language of the grammar.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Check all the apply.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Which of these give strings could be derived from P in this grammar.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Here are the two rules in this grammar, P goes to open parenthesis,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
P closed parenthesis, or P goes to nothing and can be erased.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Here I have various combinations of open and closed parentheses.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Stare at it for a while and tell me which of these five sequences of strings

00:00:34.000 --> 09:59:59.000
could be derived from P in this grammar. Check all that apply.
