Let's take our 2 equations and plot them on the same coordinate grid. Now that

00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:07.870
we have 2 lines, we have a system of equations. We can represent the system

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.023
using 2 equations or graphically using 2 lines. This first line indicates that

00:00:12.023 --> 00:00:16.142
you can spend $45 on the car rental, that's the most you're willing to pay. This

00:00:16.142 --> 00:00:20.110
second line represents the cost of the car, notice that the line continues to

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.634
increase up into the right. This makes sense because the cost will continue to

00:00:24.634 --> 00:00:28.898
increase if we rented the car for more hours. You pay 10 more dollars for each

00:00:28.898 --> 00:00:33.043
hour you rent the car and that also is reflected on our graph. Knowing this

00:00:33.043 --> 00:00:37.459
information, what's the longest amount of time you can rent the car. Write your

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:38.198
answer here.
