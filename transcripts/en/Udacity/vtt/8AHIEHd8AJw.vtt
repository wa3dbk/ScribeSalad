00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's go through the possibilities.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's imagine for now that halts (tsif) is true--

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that tsif terminates.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This means that after a finite number of steps, tsif must return a value.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Well, let's go through and see what that value is.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We go in here, and if halts (tsif),

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
well actually, we were just assuming that was true,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
so we'll definitely take this then branch.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Uh-oh, we loop forever.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So we assumed that tsif halted,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but now we seem to be looping forever.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
That is a contradiction, and it makes me super unhappy.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
By the way, cutely, sometimes people in mathematics--

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
rarely, but sometimes--draw crossed swords

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to show a contradiction.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
That's of course near and dear to my heart, so we'll use that.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So when we thought the procedure halted,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
its source code made it loop forever.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So if it's not one, it must be the other.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Let's try the other approach.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Let's say that we think that tsif does not halt,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
so it should loop forever.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So let's run it and see it looping forever.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
We get in here, is halts (tsif) true?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
No, we just assumed it was false.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Okay, so we go down to the else branch and we--oh--immediately return.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
That's kind of annoying because we were assuming

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
that it doesn't halt--that it loops forever.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Neither of those options are possible.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
This is also tricky.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
There is no possible value for halts that works out.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
No matter what you do, it ends up being wrong.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And this is why we could never

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
have a procedure like halts that worked in the real world.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Even if you thought it worked on some cases,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
there's one evil case, at least, where it doesn't.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
tsif--This Sentence is False.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
It's a paradox,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and the essence of a paradox like this is self reference.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
This sentence talks about itself.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
This sentence asserts its own falsehood.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Similarly, the source code for tsif

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
talks about whether or not tsif halts.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
This is the computer programming equivalent

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
of a natural language paradox

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
like this sentence is false.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
If I ask you, is this sentence true?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Well, that can't be right because then it would truthfully be asserting that it's false,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
so that's a contradiction.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
If I ask you, is this sentence false?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Well, then we'd invert it and have it be

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
asserting that it was true.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Oh, another contradiction--none of these work.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
It's the same problem in natural language

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
or in computer science.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
You may have heard a similar version of this called the Barber Paradox,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
which is typically phrased as something like

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
the barber cuts the hair of each person in this village

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
who does not cuts its own hair.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
The question is does the barber do a self haircut or not?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
It's a lot like this sentence is false,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
but one level removed.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
You may also have heard Epimenides Paradox--

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
"All Cretans are liars. I'm a Cretan."

00:02:55.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Just like this sentence is false, but one step removed.
