00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.052
Now I've got five different curves over here for you, and I'd like you tell me

00:00:05.052 --> 00:00:10.172
which one of these represents the graph of y minus 3 equals the quatity x minus

00:00:10.172 --> 00:00:20.354
2 squared. So think about what replacing y with y-3 did to a curve before and

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:23.887
what we said replacing x with x-2 would do to a curve
