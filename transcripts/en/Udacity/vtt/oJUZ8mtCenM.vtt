00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.852
This is the last system of equation we'll work on together. I want you to

00:00:03.852 --> 00:00:08.279
perform substitution and the second equation. What expression should go in this

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:12.357
box? Then, I want you to solve the equation. What expression would you get in

00:00:12.357 --> 00:00:16.204
this box after distributing the negative 2? And then, what does this all

00:00:16.204 --> 00:00:20.936
simplify to you? Put that in this box. Try solving the problem on your own and

00:00:20.936 --> 00:00:24.301
then see what should go in these boxes. Good luck.
