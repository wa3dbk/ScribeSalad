00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.035
We're going to use daily
returns as a basis for

00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:06.990
the analysis in this lesson and we build
daily returns, like we've seen before,

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.970
by starting with a price time series.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.720
And each point in this
daily return chart

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.350
is related to how much price has
changed on that corresponding day.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.600
So, for instance,
this represents how much the price

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.150
changed from this day to that day,
about 1%.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.420
And, of course, we have that for
each of the days in our history.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.860
Now looking at this data, this daily
return data, it's not too revealing.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.600
It's hard to draw any sorts of

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.960
interesting conclusions just by visually
looking at this data from day to day.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.080
And so, there's a number of interesting
ways that we can look at that data, and

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.490
that's what this lesson is all about.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.540
Those two ways are histograms and
scatter plots.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.110
Let's start by taking
a look at histograms.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.879
A histogram is a kind of bar chart
where we plot the number of occurrences

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.720
of each item versus the value.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.540
So the way we accomplish that is,

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:17.270
we split up the range of data
into lots of little bins.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.340
And we count up how many times the data
matches the range across that bin.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.140
So, as an example, if you notice
here we've got several occurrences

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.500
of this value,
which is about the same, and

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.090
those three occurrences
are probably in say, this bin.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.010
So when we go to plot
the histogram overall,

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.700
we would see a bar of
the appropriate height here

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.530
that represents how many times
the data matched that value.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.310
And of course,
we have values in other bins, and so

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.640
the bars in those bins
would have various heights.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.150
And as you gather that
data across all of time,

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.680
a shape emerges of this histogram, and
that provides a lot of information.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.240
So let's consider what that
shape might look like.
