Grant expects that each order he receives will require about 0.1 gallons of

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.767
solution, or 1/10 of a gallon of solution. Grant also wants to have 10 extra

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:14.782
gallons of solution on hand, just in case of emergency. What we're looking for

00:00:14.794 --> 00:00:19.772
now is an equation that describes this situation. For this equation, let's allow

00:00:19.784 --> 00:00:24.227
n to equal the number of expected orders of solution, and let's also let g equal

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.570
the total number of gallons of solution that Grant should order. Which of the

00:00:28.582 --> 00:00:32.925
five equations that I've written down here relates the number of expected orders

00:00:32.937 --> 00:00:36.065
n, to the number of gallons, g, that Grant should order?
