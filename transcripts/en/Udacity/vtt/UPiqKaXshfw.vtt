00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.490
So update's going to be pretty similar to look

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.210
up. So let's start by copying that code and

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.960
seeing how we need to change it. So we

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.560
have lookup. We're going to change it to be update.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.360
Now instead of taking a key as its input, it's going to take a key and a value.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.030
But it's not going to return anything, so we're going to get rid

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.095
of the returns. Right. remember all update is doing is modifying the

00:00:25.095 --> 00:00:29.070
value of entry. So now we still have what we had for

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.110
lookup, we're still getting the bucket and we want to do that.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.360
We want to make sure that we update the value in the

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.650
right bucket. We still need to look through the entries in the

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.200
bucket, to find if one matches. If we find one that matches,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.990
well what we did in lookup, was just return it. And update,

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.640
what we want to do is change the value associated with

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.080
that key. So we are going to have an assignment that replaces

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.030
whatever value is there before with a new value. And now

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.190
instead of returning the value, we want to stop going through the

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.770
loop, and we actually are done with update, so we can

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.690
return here. We found the entry, we updated the value. We

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.470
also need to deal with a case where we didn't find

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.320
the entry. So now we've gone through the loop enough times.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.980
When it was a look-up we just returned none. When it's

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.530
an update what we want to do when the key is not

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.990
already in the table, is add it. So now we're going

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.520
to use, append, to add a new entry to bucket, that has

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.260
the key and the value. So that's how we defined update.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.530
There's certainly lots of other ways to do it, and one

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.090
thing you should be thinking about is, well this is actually

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.150
very similar to look up, right. We duplicated a lot of code.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.410
Maybe there's a way to define update and lookup so

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.530
we don't have to have two copies of the code,

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.230
that scans through the bucket to find the right entry.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.840
We'll leave that as a homework question for this unit.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.740
For now we're going to be happy that we've got correct

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.920
implementations of both lookup and update. And, let's test them.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.070
So, what we did before, we're going to replace the adds

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.280
with updates, and now, the second time, what happened with

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.040
the add was we added an entry, but we could

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.360
never reach that entry because it had the same keyword.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.720
Now we're used update, the second time we should be

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.830
updating that value, and we'll see that the lookup now produces

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.290
the value 27, for the second lookup. That's good, right,

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.500
the first time the value was 23. We did the update,

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.670
we got 27, and we can see that the bucket

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.920
only contains one entry. So this is great, we finished our

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.330
implementation of the hash table. We can do updates that will

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.350
either add new values to the hash table, if they don't

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.920
already exist, or change the value of ones that exist. And

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.260
we can do lookups and lookup will know where to look, which

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.460
bucket to look in to find that key, if it exists.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.450
So this has the great property that as the number of keys

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.740
increase. As long as we increase the numbers of buckets accordingly,

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.020
the time to do both an update and a lookup is constant.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.160
This means the time doesn't increase even as the number of keywords increases,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.120
as long as we increase the number of buckets. So, this size of

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.350
each bucket stays the same size, because the expensive cost of this is

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.360
going through the elements in the bucket looking for the key that matches.
