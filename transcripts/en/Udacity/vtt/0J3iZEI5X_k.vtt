The solution to this absolute value in equality is the interval from negative

00:00:05.082 --> 00:00:10.628
infinity to negative 7 3rds unioned with the interval from 1 to infinity. let's

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.798
see how we got that. When I see an absolute value inequality with a greater than

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:21.029
or equal, I know that I'm going to have a union. Which means that I have to

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:26.394
separate this into two different cases, and connect them with an or. So, I'm

00:00:26.406 --> 00:00:31.657
going to write my two cases right here. The first case is, 3x plus 2 is greater

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.946
than or equal to 5. It's exactly the same as the original problem, without the

00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:42.157
absolute value, and then I need the or. The second case is going to be the

00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:47.174
absolute value or 3x plus 2, and we have to switch the direction of the

00:00:47.186 --> 00:00:52.833
inequality. And we have to change the sign. So, the absolute value of 3x plus 2

00:00:52.845 --> 00:00:58.139
is greater than or equal to 5. Is the same as the compound inequality 3x plus 2

00:00:58.151 --> 00:01:02.970
is greater than or equal to 5, or 3x plus 2 is less than or equal to negative 5.

00:01:03.078 --> 00:01:07.839
Remember, when we're solving compound inequalities, we need to solve each of

00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:13.287
these inequalities independently. So, let's start with this one. I can subtract

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:19.643
2 from both sides, and I get 3x is greater than or equal to 3, and divide both

00:01:19.655 --> 00:01:25.206
sides by 3, and I get x is greater than or equal to 1. For the second

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:31.769
inequality, I do the same thing, by subtracting 2 from both sides, And I get 3x

00:01:31.781 --> 00:01:38.430
is less than or equal to negative 7. Divide both sides by 3 and I get x is less

00:01:38.442 --> 00:01:44.713
than or equal to negative 7 3rds. If I want to draw this on the number line,

00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:51.620
we'll put 0 right here. Here's 1. And negative 7 3rds is equal to negative 2 and

00:01:51.632 --> 00:01:57.340
1 3rd. To graph x is greater than or equal to 1 on the number line I use a

00:01:57.352 --> 00:02:03.320
square bracket and I know I want everything greater than. To graph x is less

00:02:03.332 --> 00:02:09.759
than or equal to negative 2 and 1 3rd I go about negative 2 and a 3rd and, since

00:02:09.771 --> 00:02:15.625
x is less than. Then I want to go in that directions, and that's how we get our

00:02:15.637 --> 00:02:21.428
interval notation here we have negative infinity to negative 7 3rd with a square

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.248
bracket because it's less then, or equal to, and I union that with the interval

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.251
from 1 to infinity again with the square bracket because it's greater than. Are

00:02:33.263 --> 00:02:36.813
equal to. Let's try one more absolute value inequality.
