00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.716
Let's see if we have the skills to solve our original equation. We've learned

00:00:03.716 --> 00:00:08.272
about the greatest common factor, how to factor using special patterns, and how

00:00:08.272 --> 00:00:12.490
to factor by grouping. Can we use any of those techniques on the left-hand side

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.066
to help us solve this equation? Answer these questions using yes or no.
