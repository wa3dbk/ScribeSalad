00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What I want to do is go back to my terminal.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Instead of looking at a GCC bug, we're going to look at an LVM bug.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I believe this is one we already looked at a little bit.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We say clang -02 small.c.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It's going to die with an assertion violation about isa(Val)

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and Unknown live-in to the entry block, and that's assertion failed.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
What we need to do first is check of the lvm people already know about this one.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We're going to go here to their bugzilla and search for this exact string.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
All right. They don't know about this bug, so that's nice.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If we know about a bug and they don't know about it, we can report it.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now we have to go back and make a reduced test case.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
What I'm going to do here is instead of invoking the delta debugger,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
which is this nice extremely general purpose powerful tool,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I'm going to invoke a different tool that's called C reduce,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and it's one produced by my group.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
What it is is an extremely special-purposed delta debugger,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
so it operates on exactly the same delta debugging ideas that the other tool

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
operates by, and it just has extra knowledge embedded in it

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
about how to reduce C programs.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This is going to take a little while, so you don't have to wait for it like I do.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Let's run a time command and just see how long it takes.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
That took about 11 minutes. Not incredibly quick, but not too shabby either.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Remember, this wasn't time that I had to be attending to the computer.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The computer was just doing an automated search algorithm.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Here is the output of the reduced test case.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It's pretty small, so let's check its byte count.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
It has 274 bytes. That's nice.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
What I'm going to do here is make a bug report.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
What I'm going to first do is make sure we know the version of clang.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
It's version 156970.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I'm going to make sure the test case gets included.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I'm going to show clang crashing on it. That's a bug report.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
If I haven't appeared to go through all of the steps that I've narrated to you earlier,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
it's because I've reported a lot of compiler bugs, and I know what I can get away with.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
There we go.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
This includes, I believe, enough information for the LVM people to reproduce the bug.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
It should be good.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I've marked that we're reporting its chunk.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
We just need a name for this bug report.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The bugzilla is trying to help us avoid a duplicate,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and I don't think it's told us about anything that we didn't know.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
In fact, all these are marked as fixed anyway, so we're good. Now let us ship this off.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Now the LVM developers, when they get up in the morning,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
have a new bug report to look at.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
That concludes our data on bug reporting.
