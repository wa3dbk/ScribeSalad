00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:04.559
Okay, that makes sense. When we see a vowel, that means it's the start of a new

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:09.292
vowel group, which would mark that we have another syllable. Any time we see a

00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:14.420
vowel that doesn't have another vowel before it, we want to increment count.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.704
Now I want you to keep stepping until letter is o, and deposit this line where

00:00:18.704 --> 00:00:24.990
we set letter to text.substring. If you keep stepping after that line, what

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.520
happens? Is the first if statement entered? If so, is the second if statement

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.580
entered, is count incremented, is inside vowel group set to true?
