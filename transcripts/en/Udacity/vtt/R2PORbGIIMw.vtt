00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In equilibrium, we had to have a zero rate of change.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The temperature should be staying constant so there's three candidates.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The middle one is a little tricky. Actually, our function never becomes zero.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It jumps, but even if it was continuous, this point would constitute an unstable equilibrium.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If we are below the temperature of ignition, there is no fire and we simply lose heat

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and if we are above the temperature of ignition, there is fire and we gain heat.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This point would be unstable anyway. The lower equilibrium is stable.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If we are below the ambient temperature, we gain heat from the environment.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
If we are above the ambient temperature, we lose heat at the environment. So no problem.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This is stable and the upper one is stable as well. Here we have combustion.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Combustion is going on.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If the temperature was a little lower, the rate of change of the temperature

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
would be positive--it would be moving up.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
If the temperature was a little higher, the rate of change would be negative--we're moving down,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
meaning at this point, we lose as much heat to the environment as we gain from combustion.

00:01:06.000 --> 09:59:59.000
The answer is there's two stable equilibria.
