00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.800
What did you write down, David?

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.120
&gt;&gt; So, in this case,
the only difference between this and

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.470
the previous positive example is that
now it's lunch instead of breakfast.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.070
So, the only thing we're going to
generalize here is that now it can be

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.850
any meal instead of just
being breakfast, but

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.300
we're still going to say that
it has to be Kim's on Friday.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.380
It has to be cheap,
and it can't be vegan.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.540
&gt;&gt; And note that they could have put
here breakfast or lunch, but for

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.380
simplicity has generalized
it to any meal.
