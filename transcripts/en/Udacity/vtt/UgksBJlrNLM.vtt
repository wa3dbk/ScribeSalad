00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.910
You're probably familiar
with Warren Buffett.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.830
He's one of the most
successful investors ever.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.760
He's made a number of insightful
comments over the years,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.920
many of which relate to this class.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.970
One of my favorites is,

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.230
only when the tide goes out do you
discover who's been swimming naked.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.300
That's not the one for
this lesson though.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.940
The one for this lesson is.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.890
Wide diversification is only necessary

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.065
when investors do not
know what they are doing.

00:00:26.065 --> 00:00:29.300
Mr. Buffett is talking about two things.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.440
Investor skill and breadth or
the number of investments.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.550
This lesson is about how investment
performance relates to those

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.360
two factors.
