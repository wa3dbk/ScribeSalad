00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Formally, we define a probability function to be P(X),

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and it's a value that is bounded below and above by 0 and 1.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
X often can take multiple values.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We had the case of 5 grid cells.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Suppose it can only take 2 values--there's only 2 grid cells, x1 and x2.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If the probability for x1 is 0.2, what would be the probability for x2?

00:00:23.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Please enter the number. It's a quiz, obviously.
