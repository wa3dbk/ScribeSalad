00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.550
Great job making it this far into the course.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.790
Let's take a look at the solution to this XORD

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.160
exercise. So here's our parse file function, and you

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.760
can see that what we've done here, is use this

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.990
column slicing trick. We've used the call values method

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.670
on sheet to pull out all of the values in

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.250
column one. Column one being the coast column within

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.460
that data set. Then, we're simply using max and min

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.170
here on this list that we've pulled out, in order to get the max val and min

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.420
val in that entire column. We're using the index

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.340
method on lists, to figure out where that max

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.935
val is in the CV list. Now, because the

00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:43.779
data that we have actually begins on row one

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:47.255
of the spreadsheet rather than row zero, we've got

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:50.760
to add a one here. So that within our

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.390
spreadsheet, we end up with the right position for

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.680
that value, that is to say, the right row

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.330
number. Okay, then what we're going to do here is

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.730
for the position or the row on which the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.520
max value appears, we're going to take the value

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.780
in column zero. That will give us the max

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.650
time. Okay? And then what we're going to do,

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.830
is turn that time, which we'll get as a floating

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.020
point number, into an actual time tuple. We'll

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.929
do that same process with the min value.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.060
In generating our data dictionary that we'll end

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.700
up returning from this function, we can simply

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.530
plug in the realtime, maxval, realmintime, and minval,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.620
and then to get the average, we're simply

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.820
going to calculate it right here, and make

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.300
it the value of this key, avgcoast. Okay,

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.040
let's run this. I just want to point out that I'm using the p print

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.510
module here, so that we get our data printed out in a nicely structured way.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.090
And we can see that we get good values here.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.870
And if you take a look in the spreadsheet itself

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.650
and do something like sort the spreadsheet, you'll see that

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.530
the maximum times and the maximum values are calculated correctly. One

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.980
thing I want to note is that, in our assertion here,

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.080
we're doing a rounding so that we don't have any

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.970
issues with floating point values being slightly off as we

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.810
get further and further to the right of the decimal point.
