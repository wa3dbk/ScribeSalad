00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.701
We know that we need to multiply 3.1 by 10, 21 times. So that means we need to

00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:10.514
move this decimal point to the right 21 times. Let's do it. Okay. I'm going to

00:00:10.514 --> 00:00:15.730
start with our number we have originally, 3.1, and let's get ready to move.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:23.301
Okay, count with me. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

00:00:23.301 --> 00:00:32.011
eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen,

00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:42.137
nineteen, twenty, and twenty one. well that was a lot of work. The exponent is

00:00:42.137 --> 00:00:48.228
21, and I just verified there are in fact 21 loops here. We know that each of

00:00:48.228 --> 00:00:54.230
these empty ones needs a 0 in it. So let me write those in. There we go, this

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.903
is our final number. We've moved the decimal point all the way out here. Turns

00:00:58.903 --> 00:01:02.859
out 3.1 times 10 to the 21. Is a pretty big number.
