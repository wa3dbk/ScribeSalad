Since we've already factored the 3 x out, we want to work with this trinomial.

00:00:04.802 --> 00:00:09.190
This top number should be a times c. A is the coefficient in front of x squared

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:15.060
and c is our constant term. So 12 times negative 2 equals negative 24, this

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.808
choice. The bottom number is the b or the coefficient in front of x, so negative

00:00:20.808 --> 00:00:24.658
5. Great work if you found these two numbers. I know this question was tricky,

00:00:24.658 --> 00:00:28.820
since I threw another polynomial at you. But, we want to make sure we work with

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.617
factoring this quadratic.
