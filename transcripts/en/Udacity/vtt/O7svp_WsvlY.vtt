So one last point I'd like to show you about domains.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.730
Is browsers generally all have a Preferences page. And here I

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.460
am in Chrome's preferences. If I go to Under the Hood,

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.020
and I click on Content Settings, I can actually choose some relevant

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.860
options. Basically for Cookies, we can Allow all data to be

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.615
set. And this basically says, you know, allow all, all cookies to

00:00:19.615 --> 00:00:22.550
be set. Now the next option basically says, Only set cookies

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.275
that exist in this current session. So when I close my browser,

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:27.913
all those cookies will disappear. You know, we can block

00:00:27.913 --> 00:00:31.084
sites from setting, setting any cookies. Or we could block cookies

00:00:31.084 --> 00:00:33.800
or, or websites from setting, setting third party cookies. So

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.990
that means if reddit.com makes a request to google.com, we won't

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.312
accept any google.com cookies. Because our browser says reddit. Even

00:00:41.312 --> 00:00:43.468
though we might make requests you know, for images or, or

00:00:43.468 --> 00:00:47.296
other things from other domains. And you know, another option,

00:00:47.296 --> 00:00:50.445
Clear cookies. So you know, this is kind of well trodden

00:00:50.445 --> 00:00:53.352
ground to set you know, which, which domains are allowed to

00:00:53.352 --> 00:00:57.740
set what cookies. And generally I usually check this, this box. It

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.568
prevents websites from linking to third party data. And then having them

00:01:01.568 --> 00:01:04.959
you know, fill your browser with ad tracking stuff. So anyway, I

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.710
just thought you should be aware that these are, now you have

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.400
more information of how cookie domains work. And what's allowed to set

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.970
what. And you can even restrict it even further, or the user

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.540
can. So you want to be sure that you know, you're not operating

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.910
under the assumption that your cookies may

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.420
always be allowed, and may always be there.
