00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.540
And finally I'd like to show you this
illustration from Intel that summarizes

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.440
the advances in the Intel VT
architecture over the last decade or so.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.340
The lowest set of boxes
summarize the impact

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.950
of the virtualization related
hardware modifications that have been

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.370
added along the three
different dimensions.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.080
The three dimensions are as follows,
vector 1,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.890
refers to any CPU related
modifications and

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.420
this includes things like fixing issues
with non-virtualizable instructions or

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.000
adding support to the CPU for
extended page tables.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.930
Vector 2, refers to modifications
pertaining to the entire chipset,

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.670
such as chipset site support for
technologies like what's called SR-IOV,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.210
that technologies that help with IO
virtualization, or for IO routing and

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.960
mechanisms for direct device access, or
support rather for direct device access.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.460
And then the third vector,
the third dimension in which

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.210
Intel has contributed to the evolution
of virtualization friendly technology,

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.460
is to actually push advances in
the device level technology.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.070
So this is what's happening on the
device as opposed to on the chip you,

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.690
on the chipset or the CPU side.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.340
And with this draws
devices are more easily

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.110
integrated in a virtualized environment.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.480
This includes things like support
on the device for DMA remapping so

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.560
that it can appropriately
DMA into the correct set of

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.760
memory depending on the virtual
machine that it targets.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.650
And to also support the multiple queue,
the multiple logical interfaces

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.380
such that different logical interface
can be given to a different VM.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.800
The architecture versions that
encapsulate these modifications

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.876
are referred to as VT-x for the
modifications along the first vector.

00:01:59.876 --> 00:02:06.260
With a VT-x2, VT-x3 occurring in
subsequent generations of processors.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.290
Then VT-d for the advances along the
second dimension with VT-d following and

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.790
so forth, and then the architecture
modifications along the third vector

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.010
are encapsulated into what's referred to
as IOVs or IO virtualization technology.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.890
And VMDq what stands for
virtual machine device queue's, so

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:29.970
this is device residence support.
