00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.244
So to make this a little
bit more formal,

00:00:02.244 --> 00:00:04.542
we're going to specify sort
of all the elements in HMM.

00:00:04.542 --> 00:00:05.670
You've already sort of seen them.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.360
N is going to be the number of states,
so S1 through SN is our set of states.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.588
So that's like sunny, rainy, snowy.

00:00:14.588 --> 00:00:18.625
And then there is a notion of
a state sequence written as Q.

00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:25.230
And the idea is that Q sub i is
whatever state I'm at at time i, okay?

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.365
So when I say Q sub 3 equals S2,

00:00:28.365 --> 00:00:33.850
what that means is at time step 3,
I'm in the second state, all right?

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.042
Given the state I can talk about
the full specification of an HMM.

00:00:38.042 --> 00:00:41.080
And for whatever reason,
HMMs are referred to as lambda.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.340
It's a triplet made up of three
components that you've all ready seen.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.220
There's a state transition matrix, those
are the A's, the probability of going

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.910
from one state at one time,
given that you were at another state.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.890
There's the observation matrix,
which before,

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.890
I was showing you as a discreet, and
was actually represented as a matrix.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.629
There's also a continuous
version where your output is

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.630
you have a distribution over some
future vector for each state.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.120
So maybe it's you know, you're out
putting a, some sort of a measurement.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.100
And what you say is I've got one
Gaussian in state 1, and a different

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.280
Gaussian in state 2, and a different,
different Gaussian in state 3.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.264
The idea is that for any given output,

00:01:21.264 --> 00:01:25.172
you can talk about the likelihood or
the probability of given that output,

00:01:25.172 --> 00:01:27.417
given that you were in
a particular state.

00:01:27.417 --> 00:01:31.250
And then the last thing you need is
that initial distribution pi, right?

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.061
because it says, what's
the probability of starting at each,

00:01:34.061 --> 00:01:35.110
in a particular state?
