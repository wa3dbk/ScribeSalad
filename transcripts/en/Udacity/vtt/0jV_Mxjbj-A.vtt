00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:07.370
The solution that they took in Andrew is as follows. Only for logging into

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.400
a workstation the user name and password are used. And of course, they have to

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.470
be securely communicated to the server Over

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.170
insecure links, we'll see how that is

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.830
done. But the key point is that username and password is only useful logging in.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.390
Once a user is logged into a workstation, at that point onwards for the

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.080
rest of the log-in session, the intent is to use ephemeral IDs and

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.260
ephemeral keys But all the subsequent

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.050
Venus to vize communication. Recall that Venus

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.830
is the process that resides on the

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.840
virtual workstation, acting as a surrogate for

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.990
the user for file caching. And vize is, of course, the server that

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.480
is living inside A secure environment. And this venus-vize communication

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.890
happens over insecure links, that's where we going to use ephemeral

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.980
ids and keys. So this gives rise to three classes of client-server

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.430
interactions. The first interaction is logging

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.050
in, imagine you're a student, and you're doing

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.540
a course project. What is that you're going to do.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.500
You're going to walk up to a work station and

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.160
log in presenting your username and password to the

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.420
workstation. And this username and password is going

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.750
to be used as the basis for, the client

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.250
server communication that let's you authenticate yourself to the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.450
server. Now once you authenticate yourself to the server

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.720
what are you going to do, well you want to do a cost project, and for

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.740
the cost project you probably need to download

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.290
some files to the server. And that requires that

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.210
Venus that is running on your workstation establish

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.680
an RPC session with the server in order

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.170
to fetch the files that you need to

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.350
work on for your course project. That's the second

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.640
class of client-server communication, establishing an

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.090
RPC session. Now once you establish an

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.700
RPC session, then you can request the files that you want as a user.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.690
As a student you want certain files to be accessed during this RPC session.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.070
You bring those files and once you brought in the file that you want,

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.900
you can close the RPC session, work on your project locally on the workstation.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.260
And once you're done with completing whatever work you needed to do, you

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:52.350
may establish a new RPC session to upload the results,of your work back into the

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:59.060
file server. So the three classes of client-server interactions are logging in,

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.410
which happens exactly once for the entire loin

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.690
session, and RPC session establishment, which may happen several

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.620
times during the time that you're logged into work

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.080
station. Every time you decide oh, I want to

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.980
fetch a new file. Oh, I want to store

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.390
this file back into the server. The third set

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.870
of interaction is the actual file system access during

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.460
the session. Once this RPC session has been established

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.910
by venus with vize, then you as the user,

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.520
you may want to work on a particular file

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.730
You may open a file. At that point, Venus

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.480
will go, using this RPC session, and fetch the

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.590
required file and cache it locally for you to

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.910
use it, and later on, if you close the

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.770
file, at that point, Venus will commit the changes

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.740
that you made to the file to the central

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.660
file server again. So that's the kind of file system operation

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.650
that's the third class of client server interaction. And for both RPC

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.330
session establishment, and for the actual access to the file system

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.020
during an RPC session, we want to use ephemeral ID's and keys.
