00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.250
An IDS typically uses these approaches
to analyze data and detect intrusions.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.570
Anomaly detection, by definition,
it tries to detect what is not normal.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.720
Misuse or signature detection, you
try to find a match of no intrusions.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.310
There are mainly two elements
in anomaly detection.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.840
The first is training or profiling.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.950
The goal is to define or characterize
the normal or expected behavior.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.290
This is accomplished by collecting
data linking to normal activities, and

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.360
applying data analysis
algorithm to construct a model.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.030
The second,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.570
is to evaluate whether an observed
behavior fits the normal profile.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.610
This is accomplished by
analyzing the observed data

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.940
to see whether it fits
the established model.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.350
Misuse or signature detection,

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.080
involves first encoding normal
text into patterns or rules,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.030
and then comparing the current
behavior with these rules or patterns.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.910
To see whether there's a match or not.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.210
Obviously, this approach can only detect
known intrusions or known attacks.
