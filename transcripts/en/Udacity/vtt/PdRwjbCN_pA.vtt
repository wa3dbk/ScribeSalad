00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:08.454
Now, in our callback, we drill down to get the GetUserData function. This will

00:00:08.454 --> 00:00:09.972
actually give us a pointer to the entity that created these physics bodies that

00:00:09.972 --> 00:00:11.568
are touching. Now from here, we start down a new magical rabbit hole. For each

00:00:11.568 --> 00:00:14.389
of the objects that are touching, we need to signal, that a collision has

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.421
occurred to it. We do this by calling a new function, called onTouch, and

00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:22.910
passing it in the other physics body that it's touching. So you can see that

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.430
entity A gets an onTouch function called, passing in body B, and entity B gets

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.098
an on touch function called passing in bodyA. This set up allows each

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:35.124
individual entity to respond to collisions in their own way. So for instance,

00:00:35.124 --> 00:00:38.068
the onTouch of that for missile, would remove five health from the player it'

00:00:38.068 --> 00:00:41.480
colliding with. Or if it's just hitting a wall, it may just decide to

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.939
self-destruct. But we haven't written this onTouch function yet. And in order

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:50.591
to do that, we need to hop all the way back to entity.js and add an onTouch

00:00:50.591 --> 00:00:53.030
function. That allows other units to overload this function with custom logic

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.710
later. It's probably worth pointing out that you should be doing a whole series

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.746
of data checking to ensure that the information given to the post cell function

00:00:59.746 --> 00:01:04.540
is valid. So for example, whether or not body A and body B are valid objects or

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.750
simply null. And whether or not the points of proper entity types and have

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.860
onTouch functions. Now we'll let you graffle through all of these issues in the

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.938
future. But we figured, that we let you get a glimpse at the madness behind the

00:01:16.938 --> 00:01:20.688
mask. So, that means that anyone who defines a physics body should define an

00:01:20.688 --> 00:01:22.120
onTouch function.
