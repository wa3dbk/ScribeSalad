00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.060
Now let's step back a minute and think a little bit more

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.236
about CSV. We've talked about the fact that fields are delimited by

00:00:06.236 --> 00:00:10.400
commas. So what happens if we have a field that actually has

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.020
a comma in it, like for example, this one. This particular Beatles

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.880
album was released on two different labels, one in New Zealand and

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.250
one in the US, so the way this data set has been

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.470
set up, those two different labels are simply separated by a comma

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.050
here. Now based on what we know so far about CSV, or

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.440
I should say what we've discussed so far in the

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.820
class about CSV, this would cause a problem for us

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.890
because our parser would interpret this as a field separator.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.390
Now, the way that the CSV format actually handles this, or

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.210
the way that most applications that deal with CSV format

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.480
actually handle this, is to do something like the following. So

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.400
you can see here that this is the field in

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.220
this actual CSV file. Over here what I've done is simply

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.770
load it inside a Google sheet, but here's a raw

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.475
CSV file. And you can see that the way this

00:00:57.475 --> 00:01:00.700
has been structured is for this particular line, this field

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.775
has been enclosed in quotes. Okay? So what that does is

00:01:04.775 --> 00:01:08.650
indicates that you can ignore field delimiters from here to

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.920
here. So, we've got some choices in terms of what

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.030
we use for quotes, you could use double quotes or

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.670
you can use single quotes. Well, that would cause a problems

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.190
in other ways. You can see here that we have this

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.330
quote character here, single quote here. There's also one here, which

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.880
is actually used as an apostrophe for Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.990
Club Band. So it would be extremely tedious if in our

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.820
Python programs we had to deal with all of these different

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.230
variations of exceptions. And the fact is that though we call

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.620
it CSV, or comma separated values, you can really use any

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.990
delimiter you want here, as long as that character is only used

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.680
for a field delimiter in rows in our dataset.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.640
So as, so often is the case of software

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.490
development, this problem has been abstracted away and solved

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.611
for all of the different variations, the tedious details that

00:01:54.611 --> 00:01:58.380
we might have to deal with in order to work with the format like CSV that has so

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.044
many variations, and asterisks as my friend, Will Cross

00:02:02.044 --> 00:02:07.360
is fond of saying. This is the Python CSV module.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.140
This module deals with CSV formats in a pretty complete

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.790
way. So, let's look at how we use this module. Now,

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.100
what I'm actually going to do here is use the DictReader

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.200
class from this module. This assumes that what we want to do

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.550
is read all of our data into dictionaries, which is

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.590
what we've been doing all along, and what we'll kind of

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.060
continue to do throughout the rest of the course. But

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.980
it has some other pretty cool features as well. For example,

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.150
it assumes that the first row of whatever file we are

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.300
going to read is actually a header row. And that those

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.300
are the names we want to use for fields. So, going

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.480
back to our CSV file, if I scroll up to the

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.470
top, we can see that this first row here is actually

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.730
all of the field labels that we would like for the

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.660
columns in this data set or the fields in this data

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.080
set. So, what this dictionary reader will do for us is as

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.340
it reads in rows, it will create a dictionary for

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.340
each row. The field names will be whatever it found in

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.770
that first row, and it remembers them as we read

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.730
through the data file. And the values then will in turn

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.520
be each of the associated values on each line of

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.710
the file. And again, it also handles things like dealing with

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.380
quote characters, dealing with quoted fields that may commas inside

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.130
of them, and so on. We don't have to worry about

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.090
that at all, using the CSV module. So let's take a

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.100
look at the rest of this code. Essentially we're just opening

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.480
up the data file. We're instantiating a DictReader from the CSV

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.410
module, and then we're simply looping through. Each time through here,

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.830
this class is going to produce a line for us. And

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.110
that line will actually be a dictionary, composed of the appropriate

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.320
fields for that particular line. So then if we scroll down,

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.250
what I'm going to do here is simply print out all of those

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.480
values, okay? So, let's take a look at running

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.390
this piece of code. And again, remember we're using

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.610
the CSV module. Okay, so if we run this,

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.800
the output we get, we'll just look at the second

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.210
to last one here, is a dictionary composed of

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.910
each of the labels that came out from the first

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.090
line of this file. And the field value for

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.250
each one of the fields for this particular row from

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.180
the data file. Okay? And it seamlessly handles for

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.399
us fields that may be quoted on a particular

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:21.519
line, and other nuances that we might see in

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.040
the CSV format, and conveniently stuffs everything into individual dictionaries

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.260
for us. So, whenever you're working with CSV files

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.700
in Python, it's best to use the CSV module,

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.100
because so many of the challenges of working with

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.010
this type of data have already been solved for us.
