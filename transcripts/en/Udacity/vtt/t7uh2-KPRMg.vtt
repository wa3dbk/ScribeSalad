00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.490
To give you an idea of what Salesforce is, we talked to a developer who

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.670
told us how he became a Salesforce developer, and how he uses it every day.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.930
&gt;&gt; I'm David Liu. I'm a Salesforce developer at Google, and

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.110
I dream in Salesforce. I graduated school with a marketing degree.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.820
didn't know how to write a single line of code. But marketing always

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.490
works with sales, and that's how I got started with Salesforce. And just due

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.460
to you know, circumstances on the job, I dabbled a little in code

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.050
and, and I fell in love. It was, it was love at first sight.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.460
and, and from there you know, I just went All the

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.920
way forward with it, and you know I told myself, wow I

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.260
love this so much. You know in, in 20 years time if

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.990
I looked back at my life and, and I didn't know how

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.640
to code, then you know, I'd be really disappointed in myself.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.642
So so I picked up Sales First Coding and, and yeah, now

00:00:54.642 --> 00:00:58.640
I'm doing what I love. Salesforce, it's really like a, like a

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.410
playground. You can build anything you want with it, like I've seen

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.320
people build apps for recruiting I've seen people build video

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.850
games on Salesforce, you can build websites. it's really up

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.590
to your imagination what Salesforce is. There's a lot of

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.230
things you don't have to worry about when you're coding

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.330
in Salesforce. When you're coding in other languages, there's these

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.240
thing call boilerplate code. Just code that you have to

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.780
write thats thats meaningless, that's totally unreadable. That you have

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.940
to write just so that your code works. In sales force,

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.040
every line of code you write is is directly relevant to

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.420
your app. It's all business logic So there's two ways you

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.640
can build things in sales force. You can do the point

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.580
and click way, Or you can code, and, and most of the

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.140
time, you're actually doing a little bit of both. I started

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.030
with point and click. started not knowing anything about coding whatsoever.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.390
The skills that you learn when you're doing point and click,

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.440
it's absolutely super important for coding. you cannot be a good Salesforce

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.760
developer without knowing the point and click stuff really well.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.920
the reason for that is, there's so much you can do

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.200
with point and click. if you can do it without

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.980
code you always want to do it without code. One really cool

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.960
thing about Salesforce is how quickly you can become good

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.380
on the platform. How quickly you can become a good developer

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.280
from not knowing how to code a single line in six

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.570
months time you can probably learn enough to get a job

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.745
as a sales force developer. I love Sales Force, yes.

00:02:21.745 --> 00:02:23.059
