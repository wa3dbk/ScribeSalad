00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.052
Remember that the complex number a plus bi can be graphed on this coordinate

00:00:05.052 --> 00:00:10.039
plane as the point a,b. So, we need to figure out how each of these points is

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:14.996
written in this form, or what a and b are each equal to. The number 7 is equal

00:00:14.996 --> 00:00:19.999
to 7 plus 0i, if you want to write it like this. So it should be the point 7,0,

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:25.341
which is c over here. This makes sense. This is a real number, so it's written

00:00:25.341 --> 00:00:30.623
strictly along the real axis. A similar thing happens for negative 7i, which is

00:00:30.623 --> 00:00:35.617
just an imaginary number. Here, a is equal to 0 since there's no real part to

00:00:35.617 --> 00:00:41.026
this number, so its coordinates should be 0, negative 7, which is this point e.

00:00:41.026 --> 00:00:45.790
Now, negative 7 plus 7i is already written in a plus bi form or it's already

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.777
recognizably written that way. So, its coordinates are negative 7, 7, which is

00:00:51.777 --> 00:00:52.460
point h.
