00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.110
So I'm just going to start out by
giving you a quick overview of

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.980
the main steps that you need to do

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.650
to enable Analytics to give you useful
information about your Android app.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.831
The first thing you're going to
need is an Analytics Account ID.

00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:16.710
And you get that in
the Analytics dashboard UI.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.970
And I'll be showing you how to do that.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.830
Once you know your Analytics Account ID,
you need to add code to your app so

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.700
that your app knows to send
the data to Analytics.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.070
The code's not very difficult, and
we'll be walking through that.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.460
And once your app's started sending
data to Analytics, of course,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.360
then you can use the Analytics dashboard
to look at all the awesome data.
