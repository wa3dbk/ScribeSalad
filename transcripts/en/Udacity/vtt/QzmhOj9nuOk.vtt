00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.980
When I started in game development,

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.390
state of the art graphics
were based on pallet's.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.250
So, you have a certain number of slots
for the different colors you could

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.390
display at once, and
typical screen resolution was tiny.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.720
Imagine how chunky a game would look
at 320 x 240, or even 320 x 200.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.100
Just a few years later, there were
flip phones with higher resolution.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.460
It was certainly a challenge
to make games look good.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.670
Especially when you were limited to 32,
or 64, or even 256 colors.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.300
If you wanted to shade an object,
for example,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.200
you had to make sure to reserve space in
the palette for the color gradations.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.810
Usually just a few inches each for the
major colors like red, yellow, and blue.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.330
It's also made anti-aliasing
tricky because

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.840
it's basically just color blending.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.310
So there goes more of your palette.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.770
At the time we were using dot products
to do rudimentary light source shading.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.530
Everything had a very cartoony
look since the colors didn't

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.000
change smoothly over
the surface of an object, and

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.030
they tended to pop between values
as objects moved in the scene.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.220
We didn't care.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.880
We just thought it was cool that
shapes were more realistic looking,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.910
even if they were really crude.
