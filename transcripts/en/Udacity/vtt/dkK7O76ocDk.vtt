00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
To do this with math, the main operation we need is multiplication.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
There's a few key properties of multiplication that we'll take advantage of.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The first is that it's commutative.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
That means that a times b is always equal to b times a.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This is true on integers.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's also true using any modulus.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This property also holds for powers of powers.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
That means for any integers, a to the b based to the c power,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
well, that's equivalent to a to the b times a to the b times a to the b c times,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
which is equivalent to a to the b times c.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'm just adding powers when we multiply here,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
which is also equivalent to a to the c times b.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We know that from the commutative property of multiplication,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
which is also equivalent to a to the c to the b.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Using the same property here, a to the c, a to the c b times.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
These things are all equivalent, and they're also equivalent

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
with modular multiplication as well.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
That's the main property the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange takes advantage of,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and I'm going to show you the protocol next, and then we'll talk about

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
why it's secure and some of the details in actually implementing it.
