00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.990
HttpURLConnection is one HTTP client

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.350
that you can use to make
HTTP requests in Android.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.560
Now, you can also use
third-party libraries that

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.080
weren't created by Google.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.320
For example, OKHttp is a popular
open-source HTTP client

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.610
created by
the Square Mobile Payments Company.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.720
They've done a lot of
open-source work for Android.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.120
This class helps you send and

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.480
receive data across the web
using an HTTP connection.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.930
Once you have a URL,

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.000
actually opening up an HTTP connection
is actually pretty straightforward.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.160
You start by calling url.openConnection.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.210
Then to actually fire
off the connection, and

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.800
be ready to return results, you go ahead
and you specify the RequestMethod.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.020
In this case,
we're going to use the GET HTTP method.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.630
Then, you go ahead and call Connect and
then finally, you call getInputStream

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.280
on your connection which is going to be
the input stream containing the results.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.720
Now, despite the of
the codes that you see here,

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.150
the Android platform is actually
handling many of the complex networking

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.250
details on to the hood for you.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.370
In other words, Android as an operating
system is actually working with your

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.250
device's hardware to setup connection
and handled some of the physical steps

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.810
that need to happen in order for
the communication to work.
