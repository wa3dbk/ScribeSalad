00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.040
So good job cleaning up the media
player resources as soon as you

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.380
didn't need them anymore.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.780
So you're already following the best
practices of Android development,

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.460
well at least for the most part.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.180
Now I want to tell you some more details
that will require us to modify our code

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.940
just a little bit more.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.370
So the issue is that we've been
operating under the assumption

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.299
that the user will always
stay within our app.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.410
Well what if the user decides to
switch away to say a web browser or

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.440
even head over to a phone call?

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.770
Well if the user is not
actively looking at our app,

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.570
we can't finish executing our code and
clean up the media player resources.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.860
So if the user switches over to several
other apps and never comes back to

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.418
Army Walk app then eventually
Android will destroy our activity.

00:00:40.418 --> 00:00:44.050
So that it can use those resources to
run the more recent apps that the user's

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.950
interacting with.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.660
So as a developer,
we have to be ready for

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.100
the user to leave our
activity at any time.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.110
Or for the system to destroy our
activity because it needs those

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.110
resources for something else.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.250
So for example, in an email app
the developer's responsible for

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.350
storing the latest version
of the user's email draft.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.970
So that when the user returns
to the app, even after days or

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.340
months, it appears as if
they've never left the app.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.570
Now in this case, the developer
should indicate to the system

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.970
that it's interested in knowing when
the user leaves the current activity.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:13.730
And at that point,

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.890
the developer should save off
the latest version of the email draft.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.170
So later when the user
comes back to the activity,

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.150
the email draft should
be populated on screen.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.110
So it would be bad if they came back to
the email draft that they were writing

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.910
and the screen was just completely blank
because the changes that they made

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.490
were never saved off.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.190
So all this behavior is driven
by the need to conserve

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.080
memory resources on a device.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.090
So Android wants to have enough
resources so that the current app that

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.600
the user is interacting with is fast,
responsive and the resources

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.430
aren't wasted on apps that the user
hasn't interacted with in a while.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.570
So in order to provide structure to all
the chaos that could be happening on

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.690
a device, Android has a life cycle
that all the activities can follow.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.360
So the system will handle
transitioning the activity from

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.350
one stage of the lifecycle to another
and it offers call backs so that you as

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.430
a developer can get notified when
these changes happen in your activity.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.480
So when you get notified,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.940
you can take that opportunity to execute
certain instructions that you need.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.630
So let's discuss other states
that the activity can be in.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.360
When a activity is first launched
it's created, and then started, and

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.250
then resumed.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.850
Now, at this point the activity's active
and the user can interact with it.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.400
So as soon as the user moves to
a different activity or a different app,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.960
then this activity moves into a paused
state, and then to a stop state.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.670
And if it is closed out,
then it becomes destroyed.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.800
So if the user comes back to this
activity then it gets restarted,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.640
and we moved back into
the started state and

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.190
now the user can interact
with it once again.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.530
So here I've shown you a simplified
activity lifecycle diagram.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.475
So that you could first grasp a high
level overview of what's happening.

00:02:44.475 --> 00:02:49.120
So in the official Android documentation
in the starting activity section,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.190
we have a full activity
lifecycle diagram here.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.980
So this diagram is a little bit more
complex than the one I showed you

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.960
earlier but the main idea is the same.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.140
So remember that the Android
system is responsible for

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.230
transitioning your activity
into each of these states.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.115
So you as a developer can't control
which state that you're in.

00:03:06.115 --> 00:03:09.380
So starting from here,
when your activity is launched,

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.560
the activity is moved into a created
state using the onCreate method.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.000
And then it's moved into the started
state using the on start method.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.880
So at this point it becomes
visible to the user.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.260
And so from there it's moved into the
resume state via the on resume method.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.860
And in this case the activity
is still visible to the user.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.680
But the user can now start
interacting with the activity.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.270
So here you can display animations,
use sensors like location sensors or

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.390
even use a camera on the device.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.970
So the activity can stay in the resume
state for however long the user is

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.740
looking at the screen, so that could
be minutes or hours or even longer.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.580
Now as soon as your user
switches to a different activity,

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.910
then your activity is paused
via the on pause method, and

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.400
from there it moves into a stop
state via the on stop method.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.760
So at this point the activity is
no longer visible to the user.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.400
So, since you user
can't see the activity.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.870
If the system determines that your
activity is no longer needed,

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.460
the system may destroy your
activity via the on destroy method

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.380
in order to free up
resources on the device, and

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.610
then your activity would
enter the destroyed state.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.769
But otherwise, your activity could
just stay in the stop state.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.670
Then if your user decides to come back
to the activity before it's destroyed,

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.840
then the activity is restarted
via the onRestart method and

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.830
then it moves back into the started
state via the onStart method.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.790
And then finally back into the resume
state via the onResume method.
