00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is a good time to pause and summarize what we've learned so far.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We've learned some theory and some practice.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In theory, we've learned about patterns, which are grammars which describe languages,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
where a language is a set of strings.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We've learned about interpreters over those languages,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and about compilers, which can do the same thing only faster.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
In terms of practice, we've learned that regular expressions are useful for all sorts of things,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and they're a concise language for getting work done.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We've learned that interpreters, including compilers, can be valuable tools,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and that they can be more expressive and more natural to describe a problem

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
in terms of a native language that makes sense for the problem

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
rather than in terms of Python code that doesn't necessarily make sense.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We learned functions are more composable than other things in Python.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
For example, in Python we have expressions, and we have statements.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
They can only be composed by the Python programmer whereas functions

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
can be composed dynamically.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We can take 2 functions and put them together.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We can take f and call g with that and then apply that to some x.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
We can do that for any value of f and g.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We can pass those into a function and manipulate them and have different ones

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
applying to x.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We can't do that with expressions and statements.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
We can do it with the values of expressions, but we can't do it with expressions themselves.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Functions provide a composability that we don't get elsewhere.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Functions also provide control over time, so we can divide up the work that we want to do

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
into do some now and do some later.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
A function allows us to do that.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Expressions and statements don't do that because they just get done at 1 time

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
when they're executed.

00:01:53.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Functions allow us to package up computation that we want to do later.
