00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.630
Now that we got out of the way this

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.460
initial set of basic definitions. Let's go back to our

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.770
main concept, which is software verification. We said that software

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.730
is buggy, and because software is buggy, we need to

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.690
verify the software as much as we can. But how

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.960
can we verify software? There are several ways to verify

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.150
a software system. Among those, we will discuss four mainstream

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.410
approaches. The first one is testing, also called dynamic verification.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.400
The second approach is static verification. The third approach is

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.000
inspections. And finally, we're going to consider a fourth approach which is

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.090
formal proofs of correctness. So what I'm going to do

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.570
next, I'm going to first provide an overview of these approaches and

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.930
then discuss some of them in more depth and please

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.430
note that although we will discuss all four approaches we will

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.350
spend most of our time on software testing. As software

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.850
testing is the most popular and most used approach in industry.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.050
So let's start with our overview and in particular

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.050
with testing. Testing a software system means exercising the system

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.680
to try to make it fail. More precisely, let's consider

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.440
a program. Its input domain, which is the set of

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.990
all the possible inputs for the program and, its output

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.470
domain, which is a set of all the possible corresponding

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.010
outputs. Given this context, we can define what a test

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.360
case is. A test case is a pair that consists

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.090
of a, an input from the input domain D,

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.620
and then, expected output O from the output domain.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.950
And O is the element in the output domain

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.670
that a correct software would produce when ran against I.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.170
We can also define the concept of test suite,

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.840
which is a set of test cases, and we're going to

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.730
use these two concepts of test case and test

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.400
suite quite a bit in the rest of the lessons.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.980
Subject verification, tries to identify specific classes of problems

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.620
in the program. Such as null pointer dereferences. And

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.750
unlike testing, what it does is that it does

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.610
not just consider individual inputs, it instead considers all

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.594
possible inputs for the program. So it consider in

00:01:56.594 --> 00:01:59.366
a sense all possible executions of the program and

00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:02.402
all possible behaviors of the program, that's why we

00:02:02.402 --> 00:02:06.560
save the verification unlike testing it's complete. The 3rd technique

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.755
we are going to consider is inspections,

00:02:08.755 --> 00:02:12.804
and inspections are also called reviews or walkthroughs.

00:02:12.804 --> 00:02:15.010
And unlike the previous techniques, inspections are a

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.660
human intensive activity, more precisely, they are a

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.520
manual and group activity in which several

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.700
people from the organization that developed the software,

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.190
look at the code or other artifacts developed

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.888
during the software production and try to identify

00:02:31.888 --> 00:02:35.950
defects in these artifacts. And interestingly inspections

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.580
have been shown to be quite effective in

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.820
practice and that's the reason why they're used

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.550
quite widely in the industry. Finally, the last

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.100
technique I want to mention is Formal

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.650
Proof (of correctness). Given a software specification, and

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.370
actually a formal specification, so a document that

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.410
formally defines and specifies the behavior, the expected

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.320
behavior of the program. A form of proof of

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.400
correctness proves that the program being verified, actually implements

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.922
the program specification and it does that through a

00:03:07.922 --> 00:03:12.880
sophisticated mathematical analysis of the specifications and of the code.
