00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.709
Direct variation means that two amounts are related such that if one increases,

00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:09.756
the other increases. Or, if one decreases, the other decreases as well. This

00:00:09.756 --> 00:00:13.530
makes sense in terms of working for an hourly wage and earning money. If you

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.272
work less hours, you earn less money. The second type of variation is inverse

00:00:18.272 --> 00:00:22.452
variation. If you work more hours, the amount of free time that you would have

00:00:22.452 --> 00:00:27.481
would decrease. Notice here, one quantity is increasing but the other one would

00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:31.436
be Decreasing. We could also have the relationship reversed, we could work less

00:00:31.436 --> 00:00:35.025
hours, which means we would have more free time. In the rest of this lesson

00:00:35.025 --> 00:00:39.120
we're going to use our knowledge of direct variation and inverse variation to

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.976
solve some problems. But before we get there, let's see if you understand the

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:44.343
difference between the two.
