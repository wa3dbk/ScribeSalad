00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.185
act and think in unique ways that distinguish them from other people. But what

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:15.275
about animals? Do cats, dogs or horses have personality? What about pigs or

00:00:15.275 --> 00:00:21.292
fish or octopi do they? Well mounting scientific evidence suggests that many

00:00:21.292 --> 00:00:25.781
species of mammals, birds, fish and even some invertebrates have unique traits

00:00:25.781 --> 00:00:28.140
of personality.
