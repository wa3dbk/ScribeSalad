00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now it's quiz time just to show that a lot of your knowledge about Python's grammar

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and the grammar fragment I showed you before, will translate into you being able

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to write JavaScript expression.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I've written here four JavaScript expressions--a, b, c, and d--

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and each one contains a blank.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'd like you to fill in each blank with a single token, a single terminal,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that causes the entire expressions to evaluate to True. Try it out.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This is a bit of a puzzle, and you'll sort of have to work backwards.

00:00:31.000 --> 09:59:59.000
What would this blank have to be for 1 plus a blank to be equal to 2?
