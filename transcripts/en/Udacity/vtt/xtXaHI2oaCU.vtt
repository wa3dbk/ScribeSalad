00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.890
The answer is, the first one can be written as an enhanced for loop. These

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.607
other two would require lots of extra counting variables and things to make

00:00:07.607 --> 00:00:12.224
them work that way. This one would be difficult to write as an enhanced for

00:00:12.224 --> 00:00:15.941
loop because it's using the index i to calculate a value, it's also changing

00:00:15.941 --> 00:00:21.106
the values stored in the array. Both of those things are harder to do with an

00:00:21.106 --> 00:00:25.084
enhanced for loop. This one would be hard to do with an enhanced for loop,

00:00:25.084 --> 00:00:29.420
because it's not actually looking at all of the values in order. It starts at

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.132
Index one, and while looking at any one index, it's also looking at the last

00:00:34.132 --> 00:00:39.011
index. In an enhanced for loop, you will only get one at a time, and would have

00:00:39.011 --> 00:00:43.927
to do some fancy trick to remember the last one that you'd seen. This way is

00:00:43.927 --> 00:00:45.109
much simpler.
