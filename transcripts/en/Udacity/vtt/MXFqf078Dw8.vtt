00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So here's one way to solve the question:

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
we're going to define a procedure,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
so we'll define a procedure, is_friend.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It takes a single string as input.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We'll call that the name--that's the name of the person.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We're going to do a test using an "if" statement.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We'll test if the first character of name is equal to an upper case "D".

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.400
If it is, that means the person's a friend,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.000
so we can return True.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If it's not--they're not a friend--

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
we don't need the "else", right--we could just have our return False.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.354
I'm going to keep things more symmetric by using an "else"

00:00:30.354 --> 00:00:35.000
and if the name does not start with a "D", we can return False.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So let's try that.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
With our example, ('Diane'), we get is_friend is True,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and when we try with ('Fred'), we get the output, False.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So this looks like what we want.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This is actually a lot more code than we need.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
There's no reason we have to actually have the "if" expression.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Since the test itself evaluates to a Boolean

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
we could just return right away.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We could return the result of the comparison.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We're doing the equality test,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
if name, index zero--the first character of name--is equal to "D".

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So this has the same meaning, much simpler thing.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.200
Sometimes people think it's unnatural to write expressions like this,

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.000
that when you have test conditions,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
you feel like you need an "if" statement--but it's not required.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
It's much simpler, in this case, to just have the one line

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
where we return the result of the equality test, directly.
