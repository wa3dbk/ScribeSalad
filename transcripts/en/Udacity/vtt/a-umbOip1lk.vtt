00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460
Let's look through a few more of these problems on complexity classes.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.029
Again I would like you to check whichever ones you think are true

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:09.800
and leave unchecked the ones you think are false.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.580
The first one, all problems solvable in exponential time by a deterministic RAM

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.160
take polynomial time on a nondeterministic RAM.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.250
Number 2, it is likely that randomization algorithms can solve some NP-complete

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.250
problems in expected polynomial time.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.790
And finally, if P≠NP, some NP-complete problems do not have constant-factor

00:00:30.790 --> 99:59:59.000
approximation algorithms that run in polynomial time.
