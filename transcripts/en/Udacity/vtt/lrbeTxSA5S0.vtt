00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.390
&gt;&gt; That's good, David. Notice how lexical syntactical semantical analysis

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.560
are all coming together here. The driver does semantic analysis. The driver does

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.830
this frame which captures the semantics of this particular sentence that allows

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.680
us to draw inferences about it. That's why we are use the term semantics here.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.660
So the semantics has been captured by this frame with terms of all of these

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.320
slots. But how do we decide on the fillers? That requires lexical analysis and

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.170
syntactic analysis. So, when we have the word John here, John is a concept and

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.060
a concept is inanimate and that information is coming from a lexicon.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.550
That is the lexicon analysis. And when have a sentence like: John took the book

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.740
from Mary. And from is a preposition and Mary follows immediately after that.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.961
This is capturing part of this syntax of this particular sentence. And

00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:12.930
that is how we derive that the source must be Mary. So

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.500
the semantic syntactical analysis is all working together here.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.690
Notice also how frames and routes are coming together here.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.560
You've seen how frames help us understand the meanings of the stories and

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.860
that is being done part by the rules that are budded inside the slots. So there

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.310
is a rule here which tells us how to extract the agent from the sentence and

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.010
put it inside the slot. Similarly, there's a particular rule here and

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.230
a rule here and each one of these slots may have its own rule. Of course as

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.420
the sentences become complex and these frames become complex, these rules will

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.380
become much more complex and sometimes there will be multiple rules here and

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.270
multiple rules here. And this can become very complicated, very soon.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.890
Another point to notice here is that this capturing the semantics like I said

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.640
earlier and how do we know that. Because I can ask questions. Who has the book?

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.710
Who had the book? What did John take from Mary? And you can answer any of

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.840
these questions using this frame. Once you have this frame,

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.460
question answering becomes possible. Common sense reasoning becomes possible.
