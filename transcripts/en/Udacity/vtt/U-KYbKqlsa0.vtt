00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Finally, it's always a good question whether assertions, in production code,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
should remain enabled or not.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Here are some points to consider. First, failing is better than bad data.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
If your program fails with an assertion, you know that there's an error.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If it simply produces a bad result without actually checking it,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
then this may have far worse consequences than failing.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Second, the more active assertions there are, the easier it is for you to find the defect.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Third, defects in the field are hard to track,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
which means an assertion gives you a chance to find the defect before it goes into the field,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
in particular, in combination with thorough testing.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And even in the field, if assertion are still enabled,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
you still have a far better chance to find defects because,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
well, you get the failure rather than producing bad data.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
On the detractor side, so what speaks against assertions being enabled in production code?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We have performance, performance, performance.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
If you do have a large data structure with lots of global checks and leave this enabled,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
performance will suffer.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
However, there is large number of assertions which impact performance only in a marginal way.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Checking some result is larger or equal than zero, ranges, like things.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
This will not impact performance in a measurable way.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The answer here is to first leave the assertions on

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
then measure which assertions actually do impact performance

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and possibly do turn this off and leave the others enabled.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The second thing is asssertions, when they fail, typically caused the program to crash,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
or at least, aboard execution immediately.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
This is not very user friendly.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
You should give your users a chance to recover

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
even if an assertion finds that something has gone wrong.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
But, then again, if your program crashes because of a failing assertion, what's the alternative?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The alternative is to keep on working with bad data

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and bad data can produce arbitrary and even worse results later.
