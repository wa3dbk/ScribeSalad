00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.390
There are many different styles of review. Here’s a brief list of some notable

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.570
ones. The class resources page points you to further information about them.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.260
What we’ve been talking about are sometimes called Fagan reviews. Fagan was

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.110
an IBM researcher, her, who first studied them and proposed the structuring that

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.980
we’re, we’re talking about. But a a more recent and alternative approach is

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.250
called pair programming, which is part of extreme programming,

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.870
an agile development method and this was studied by Laura, Laurie Williams.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.950
It suggests that review is part is performed synchronously with, with coding or

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.410
developing of an artifact by having a partner looking over the coder's shoulder

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.820
pointing out problems at the time that that coder is, is, is doing his or

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.840
her job or that the designer is doing their design. Another alternative is

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.940
what's called pass-around reviews. These are typically conducted by email.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.050
This is often applied in open source projects where the people aren't collocated

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.630
and the source code management system alerts participants to take a look when

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.850
a new change or new file has been checked into the source control system.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.510
And in any of these approaches there's a possibility of applying tools.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.790
Tools might be differencers to compare versions the source control management

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.400
system itself as I've, as I've indicated, and there're also program analyzer

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.670
tools that can provide enforcement and feedback and examples here are Lint. You

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.750
may have heard of the Lint program or CodeCheck, which is a plugin into Eclipse.
