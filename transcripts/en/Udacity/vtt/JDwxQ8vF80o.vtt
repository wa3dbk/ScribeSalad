00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.918
Let's see how we can access the individual array elements. With arrays, you

00:00:03.918 --> 00:00:08.840
don't call a method to get at an element. Remember with an array list we would

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.439
have called .get, but with an array you use the brackets and you put the index

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:21.266
inside. The values bracket zero, is the equivalent of calling values, dot get

00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:27.300
zero. For an array you use the brackets. For an array list, you use a method.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.684
You use the same notation if you want to store something, into an array. So

00:00:31.684 --> 00:00:37.480
here values bracket zero equals 42 means put the number 42 into the zero slot

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:44.600
of this array. That's a little simpler than with array lists where we would

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.430
have had to call .set(0,42). How can we look at all of the elements of an

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.516
array? That's very similar as with array lists. Here we have a for loop. We

00:00:55.516 --> 00:00:58.590
want to look at values bracket i and i goes from zero to one less than the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.808
length of the array. With an array list we would have called dot size. Note

00:01:03.808 --> 00:01:13.616
that length does not have parentheses. That's just an oddity for historical

00:01:13.616 --> 00:01:17.638
reasons. We simply looked at all of the elements in the array, and as with an

00:01:17.638 --> 00:01:23.320
array list, we can use an enhanced for loop to make this a little simpler.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.490
Here's the equivalent enhanced for loop, over here is our array. We want value

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.135
to assume each of the elements in turn, and then we use it. Note that with the

00:01:33.135 --> 00:01:35.718
enhance for loop, you cant tell any difference between an array and an array

00:01:35.718 --> 00:01:40.388
list. You put the array, array list to the right of the colon, and the variable

00:01:40.388 --> 00:01:45.169
to the left of the colon gets assigned each element in term.
