00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
Let's have a quiz on regularization.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.641
So check the statements that are true.

00:00:04.641 --> 00:00:06.944
Regularization will likely have the most impact when:

00:00:06.944 --> 00:00:12.535
The load is relatively evenly distributed among tasks but with some significant outliers.

00:00:12.535 --> 00:00:16.930
So for example, most U.S. counties contain at most 1 city,

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.290
but there are a few that have dozens of cities.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.658
Or is it the case that regularization will have most impact

00:00:23.658 --> 00:00:26.686
when the load varies wildly from task to task?

00:00:26.686 --> 00:00:30.665
And by wildly I really mean that there's no real average case.

00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:33.336
An example of this would be popularity.

00:00:33.336 --> 00:00:35.972
Some people have claimed that celebrity popularity,

00:00:35.972 --> 00:00:39.838
like if you measure something like number of followers somebody has on Twitter,

00:00:39.838 --> 00:00:44.438
follows a power law graph distribution, and power law looks something like this,

00:00:44.438 --> 00:00:47.549
and if true, then this would mean that at any level of popularity,

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:51.051
a roughly fixed fraction of people will be twice as popular.

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:53.658
Okay so in this case you might say that,

00:00:53.658 --> 00:00:55.925
"Oh, 80% of the people--

00:00:55.925 --> 00:01:01.267
20% of the people have twice as many followers as the remaining 80% of the people below the line,"

00:01:01.267 --> 00:01:06.100
and that becomes true, no matter where you draw the line, so that would be a power law.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.972
And in a case like this, there's no real average case.

00:01:08.972 --> 00:01:13.340
A few very popular people have as many followers as the rest of the world combined.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.170
There's an interesting discussion of this that I found online; I'll put it in the Instructor Notes.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.835
Finally, is it true to say that regularization will likely have the most impact

00:01:21.835 --> 00:01:25.122
when the application can predict load imbalance at run time?

00:01:25.122 --> 00:01:28.567
In other words can predict where and how load imbalance will occur.

00:01:28.567 --> 00:01:32.925
So an example here is that it might be a lot easier to add up the number of cities in a grid cell

00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:35.366
and notice that there's going to be load imbalance

00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:43.933
than to actually perform some heavyweight computation on each city.
