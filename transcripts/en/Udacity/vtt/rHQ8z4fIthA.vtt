00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.760
Okay, so let's do a little exploring and think about the

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.620
mechanics of this problem. The first thing I'd like to know, is

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.590
how do I go about requesting the data I want from this

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.170
website? Again, I'm thinking about how I get to a point where

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.820
I can actually do this programmatically. So most web browsers give

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.250
you the ability to actually inspect individual elements of a webpage, so

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.060
in this case, let's just take a look at that selector. And

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.330
if we do that, we can see all of the options right

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.000
here in the HTML for the page. And based on

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.600
our understanding of HTML, we know that it's these values here

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.940
that we would need to submit as part of our post

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.130
request. Alright, the options for airports look very similar. So instead

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.750
of looking at that, let's take a look at The data

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.970
that's here. Now, a couple things that I want to point out

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.190
here, before we actually look at the HTML again. One is

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.230
that for any given airport, this is reporting both domestic and

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.920
international flights for that airport. Now in my case, I'm not actually

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.090
interested in that distinction. I simply want to know arrivals and departures.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.070
So where does value in both columns, for a given month? I'm

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.410
simply going to add them together. So this is one place that

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.220
I'm doing a little bit of reshaping of the data. It's also

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.820
the case that I've got these totals here in this columns, and

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.250
then at the end of the rows for any given year. I'm

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.670
simply going to ignore those. Again, a little bit of reshaping. Okay.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.198
So let's take a look at these elements. Now as you

00:01:20.198 --> 00:01:23.036
might expect, these are laid out in a table, and if

00:01:23.036 --> 00:01:25.742
I scroll to the top, I can actually see there's a

00:01:25.742 --> 00:01:29.648
class attribute for this particular table here. And this is going to help

00:01:29.648 --> 00:01:32.252
me when it comes time to actually parse this HTML in

00:01:32.252 --> 00:01:36.130
order to extract the data. So we've looked at, both how to

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.940
go about getting the values we're going to need to submit

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.300
in a post request in order to get the data we need.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.410
And then we've looked at once that data is presented to us, or

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.950
in this case, to our program that's going to be accessing the site.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.100
How do we go about finding that data and pulling that data out

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.850
of the HTML? Or at least where is it located in the HTML file?
