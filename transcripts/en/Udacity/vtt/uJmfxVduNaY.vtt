00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:04.046
So taking these 1 at a time--a million threads incrementing a million elements

00:00:04.046 --> 00:00:07.187
does give the correct answer because, in this case, there's a unique element for

00:00:07.187 --> 00:00:09.148
every thread, so there's no conflict.

00:00:09.148 --> 00:00:12.722
So even though we didn't make these atomic increments we're still safe.

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:17.531
A million threads atomically incrementing a million elements, is, of course, also safe.

00:00:17.531 --> 00:00:19.369
So you'll also get the correct answer.

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.858
A million threads incrementing a hundred elements is the same example we saw before.

00:00:22.858 --> 00:00:26.085
And as we saw, that will give the wrong answer, unless we use atomics.

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:29.615
So the next one is not correct. The fourth one is correct.

00:00:29.615 --> 00:00:34.652
And finally, ten million threads atomically incrementing a hundred elements will still be the correct answer,

00:00:34.652 --> 00:00:36.820
So all but one of these give you the correct answer.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.347
Okay, so the more interesting question is how long do each of these options take?

00:00:40.347 --> 00:00:44.814
The fastest, perhaps counter-intuitively, is going to be option 3--

00:00:44.814 --> 00:00:47.367
a million threads writing into a hundred elements.

00:00:47.367 --> 00:00:50.323
And the next fastest would be option 1--

00:00:50.323 --> 00:00:52.456
a million threads writing into a million elements.

00:00:52.456 --> 00:00:59.635
On my laptop, these 2 operations take around 3.2 milliseconds, and 3.4 milliseconds, respectively.

00:00:59.635 --> 00:01:03.016
Of course, it's not a very useful option since it doesn't give the correct answer.

00:01:03.016 --> 00:01:05.275
But it's still interesting to look at what's going on.

00:01:05.282 --> 00:01:09.151
So the reason why this is slightly faster is that you have your million threads all

00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:11.821
trying to write to the same 100 elements.

00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:15.111
Well, those 100 elements occupy a very small fraction of memory,

00:01:15.111 --> 00:01:17.964
and they're all going to fit into a cash line or 2 on this system,

00:01:17.964 --> 00:01:20.926
whereas a million elements is large enough that it's not going to fit in cache.

00:01:20.926 --> 00:01:24.906
You're actually going to have to touch more of the DRAM, where global memory is stored.

00:01:24.906 --> 00:01:30.491
For the same reason, a million threads writing into 100 elements atomically

00:01:30.491 --> 00:01:34.293
is going to be slightly faster than a million threads writing into a million elements.

00:01:34.293 --> 00:01:40.300
So the next fastest is option 4. The next fastest after that is option 2.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.560
And in my system, again, these took 3.6 and 3.8 milliseconds,

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.028
which means the slowest of all options is the one where

00:01:49.028 --> 00:01:51.366
10 million threads write into a hundred elements.

00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:56.255
This is actually 36 milliseconds, so it takes approximately 10 times as long to complete.

00:01:56.255 --> 00:01:58.973
Not surprisingly, there's about 10 times as much going on.

00:01:58.973 --> 00:02:00.980
So you might play around with this code for a little bit.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.114
For example, see what happens to the time as you go to even more threads writing into even fewer elements.

00:02:06.114 --> 00:02:10.531
The big lesson here is that atomic memory operations come with a cost.
