00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.432
We can always simplify powers of i since the pattern continues to repeat

00:00:03.432 --> 00:00:07.920
itself. To find any power of i we simply divide the power of i by four and look

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.610
at the remainder. The remainder will either be 0, 1, 2, or 3 and will determine

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.613
the power of i. For example i to the 12th, we would take the power of 12 and

00:00:18.613 --> 00:00:25.202
divide it by 4. We know 12 divided by 4 equals 3 with a remainder of 0. This

00:00:25.202 --> 00:00:29.538
remainder becomes the new power for i. So we know i to the 12th is really

00:00:29.538 --> 00:00:35.240
equivalent to i to the 0, and anything to the 0 power equals 1. This should

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.240
also make sense since i to the 12th can be written as i to the 4th, times i to

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.482
the 4th, times i to the 4th. This means we really have i to the fourth repeated

00:00:43.482 --> 00:00:48.157
a bunch of times, or really just the multiplication of positive 1. It's easiest

00:00:48.157 --> 00:00:51.406
to simplify any power of i by dividing the power by 4 and looking at the

00:00:51.406 --> 00:00:56.252
remainder, this will be our new power of i. Once we have our power of i, we

00:00:56.252 --> 00:01:00.532
look back to see what it would equal. In this case, we don't need to, since we

00:01:00.532 --> 00:01:05.886
have i to the 0, and anything raised to the zero power equals 1. We know our

00:01:05.886 --> 00:01:09.950
pattern repeats every 4. So if we worked backwards with our pattern. We know i

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.148
to the 0 would equal positive 1. So this should definitely make sense with our

00:01:14.148 --> 00:01:19.782
pattern. So, if I wanted to simplify i to the 39th, I would do 39 divided by 4.

00:01:19.782 --> 00:01:25.780
We know this is 9 remainder 3. This is what I'm interested in. The remainder.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.615
So I know i to 39th is really equal i to the third power. We're going to cycle

00:01:30.615 --> 00:01:35.852
to this pattern of four. Nine times and then ended up with i cube. We know i

00:01:35.852 --> 00:01:39.680
cubed is really equal to negative i. So this power simplifies to negative i. If

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:47.750
I want to simplify i to the 50th. I would divide 50 by 4 which is 12 remainder

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.713
2, so I know i to the 50th is really equal to i squared or negative 1.
