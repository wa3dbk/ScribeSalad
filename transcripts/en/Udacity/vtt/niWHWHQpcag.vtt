00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.065
Let's discuss this solution for our Iron

00:00:02.065 --> 00:00:05.830
Law quiz. The execution time is number of

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.345
instructions in the program 3 times 10 to

00:00:09.345 --> 00:00:12.765
the 9th which is 3 billion, times cycles

00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:19.177
per instruction, in this case times 2 and times the clock cycle time. Now note

00:00:19.177 --> 00:00:22.467
that we have here three gigahertz which is

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:25.761
how many clock cycles we have per second.

00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:32.170
What we need is how many seconds per clock cycle. So the clock cycle

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:38.727
time is 1 over 3 billion. Make sure you remember that this should here be clock

00:00:38.727 --> 00:00:41.754
cycle time. Usually we express processor clocks

00:00:41.754 --> 00:00:44.134
in terms of clock frequency, which is 1

00:00:44.134 --> 00:00:50.920
over time. And conveniently, these two can be crossed out and we get 2 seconds.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.640
So the execution time is 2 seconds.
