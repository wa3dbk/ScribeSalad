00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.019
I'll sign off by showing
you some pair of pandas.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:08.730
We are about to plot two columns
simultaneously on one graph.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.510
That is close and
adjusted close for the Apple stock.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.196
Don't worry about how to extract
multiple columns from the data frame.

00:00:16.196 --> 00:00:19.995
But intuitively you use
a double square brackets and

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:24.740
pass the two column names,
that is Close and Adj Close.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.040
We go ahead and plot this.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.750
Here's the graph.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.600
You can observe two lines.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.160
One is blue, which corresponds
to Close; and one is green,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.420
which corresponds to Adj Close.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.871
Observe that we did not write
code to print the legend, or

00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:42.760
give color to each of the graph lines.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.410
This is the pair of the Python pandas.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.710
The blue line corresponds
to the close value, and

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.310
the green line corresponds to
the adjusted close values.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.710
You will learn in the further
lesson why there is a difference.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.560
That's all for now,
I'll see you in the next lesson.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.210
Happy coding.
