So let's take a quick moment and talk about something else that's very important

00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:07.125
to game development: what format your images are in? Now typically on the

00:00:07.137 --> 00:00:10.329
internet when you find photos or pictures of cats just floating around on random

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:14.525
web pages, it's actually in a JPEG format. JPEG was developed some time ago by a

00:00:14.537 --> 00:00:19.689
joint efforts group from some of the industry's largest contributors. Now when I

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.746
say a while ago, I actually mean back in you know, the early days of the

00:00:22.746 --> 00:00:26.300
internet back when Al Gore still rode the Moon Worm through the plains of Handedoff.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.910
Another type of image format that you can use on the internet today, is actually

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.510
one called PNG. Now where JPEG gives you better size comparison, PNG lacks in

00:00:35.522 --> 00:00:41.155
that department. However, PNG does give you one important feature: transparency.

00:00:41.201 --> 00:00:44.463
JPEG itself gives you better compression formats but doesn't allow you to use

00:00:44.475 --> 00:00:48.478
transparent pixels in your scene, which means the general rule of thumb is if you

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.300
have an image on the internet that doesn't require it to be transparent you

00:00:52.312 --> 00:00:56.941
should probably be using JPEG. If it requires alpha you need to be using PNG.

00:00:56.941 --> 00:01:00.324
Now the cool thing about the internet is that it's always moving forward and new

00:01:00.336 --> 00:01:04.400
technologies are being developed every day to make the experience for end users

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.974
better.

00:01:04.976 --> 00:01:09.245
Besides JPEG and PNG, there's a new image format coming down the pipe called

00:01:09.257 --> 00:01:13.824
WebP. WebP offers and interesting ground. First off, it has compression ratios

00:01:13.836 --> 00:01:18.192
similar if not better in some cases than JPEG but also allows you to have alpha

00:01:18.204 --> 00:01:22.696
transparency supported by PNG. Therefore we have with this new image format the

00:01:22.708 --> 00:01:26.955
ability to get good compression and alpha transparency where we need it. Don't

00:01:26.967 --> 00:01:27.955
you love the internet?
