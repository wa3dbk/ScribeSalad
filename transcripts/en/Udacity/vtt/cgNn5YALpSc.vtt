00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.437
This one would be C. Excellent work if you figured it out. Here, the negative 7

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:08.570
doesn't mean we do the reciprocal. A negative sign in front of a number just

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.957
makes it negative. The actual move to the denominator because the power is

00:00:12.957 --> 00:00:17.745
negative. So we'll have x squared down there. This matches with answer choice C.
