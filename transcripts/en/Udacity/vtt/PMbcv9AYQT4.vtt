00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.790
Now completeness can be difficult to assess. As my

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.720
friend David Silverman is fond of saying, you don't know

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.840
what you don't know. Now in this discussion we're

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.360
not talking about individual fields missing from a record. Instead,

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.720
we're actually talking about missing records. That is to

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.570
say, trying to figure out when it's an entire record

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.400
that's gone missing. So the solution here is very similar

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.080
to the solution for accuracy. Essentially, we need reference data.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.750
So, let me give you an example from something

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.560
I work with on a regular basis. I'm the director

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.320
of education at MongoDB. And part of my role, I'm

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.280
responsible for our certification program. Now, we do things a

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.490
little bit differently than some other technology companies, in that

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.290
our certification exams are delivered entirely online. So, in addition

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.800
to a completed exam record for every test taker. In

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.160
delivering our exams online, we have to have a way

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.730
of proctoring them to ensure the security of the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.600
exam. The way we do that is through a web

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.990
proctoring solution where capture video of the test taker

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.140
session. We capture both video of the test taker themselves,

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.660
using a web cam, as well as screen capture

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.590
for everything that's going on on the test taker's computer

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.260
screen as they're taking our exam. What this means,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.430
then, is that we have three separate data stores that

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.400
need to agree with one another on a couple of

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.154
different things. And here is where we get to the completeness

00:01:21.154 --> 00:01:24.990
example. They must agree on the list of test takers, that

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.400
is to say, if there is a record for a test

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.510
taker in any one of these databases, there must be a

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.790
record for that same test taker in the other two. They

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.250
also need to agree on the duration of the exam session.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.680
So the video, here and here, should be approximately the same

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.070
length and it should agree with the elapsed time that

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.730
we recorded for a test taker. And, of course, these

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.990
have to agree approximately. Within sum Epsilon. Now, you're probably

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.630
thinking what if somebody took an exam and the record doesn't

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.080
exist in any one of these three databases. Well, that's

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.640
exactly right. As I mentioned at the beginning of this, this

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.340
is a difficult problem to address because we don't know

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.710
what we don't know. In that case using the solution that

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.690
we just described we would not detect the missing exam

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.070
record. So, in point of fact, we actually do a couple

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.680
of things in addition to this to ensure completeness for our

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.070
exam records. And those are essentially preventative measures to make sure

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.050
that we can't get into a situation where we haven't captured

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.930
the appropriate exam data for a given test taker. So, to

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.520
wrap this up, as with much of data cleaning, the means

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.710
of auditing completion is situation specific. It really depends on what

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.590
the data is that you are auditing and what reference sources you have access to.
