00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In order to trust the certificate, the client needs to validate that signature.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
To do that it needs to know the corresponding public key.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It needs to know that public key that can be used to decrypt this message.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If it decrypts it, it can check that this hash value is the same as what it computes

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
when it hashes the certificate content itself.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
That is the real problem that public key infrastructure needs to solve.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We need ways of distributing these public keys.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
That's called public key infrastructure, also known as PKI.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We need a way to securely know the public key of the issuer.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Once we know that we can use the certificate to learn the public key of the website we visited.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
How do we know that public key?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Let's look back at the certificate that we got from Google.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
What we see at the top of it is the certificate hierarchy.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We see that we have the google.com certificate, and that's the one we looked at

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and saw that it had this public key.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
That was signed by an issuer, and that issuer was Thawte, and we can click on that.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Now we can see the certificate from Thawte that was used to sign this certificate.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We have this certificate from Thawte. It was issued by VeriSign.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We can check that it's valid. It's valid until 2014.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
That certificate also has a public key.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
It's got a subject identifying Thawte Consulting that generated the key.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It's got a public key. It's also got an RSA key with PKCS.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We can see that public key.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
That's the public key that we can use to validate the certificate that RSA provided.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
We can use that to decrypt the signed hash to validate that certificate.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
This would only be useful if we knew that we could trust this public key.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
How do we trust this public key?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Well, it's got a certificate.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
It's certificate was issued by VeriSign.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We can find VeriSign's public key to verify this one.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
That's the top of the certificate hierarchy here.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
We have a certificate from VeriSign, and if we look at that one--

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
well, it came from VeriSign, and it's got a public key, also an RSA key and this one.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
You'll notice that all of them use 65,537 as their exponent.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The moduli are all different.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
If they weren't different, that would mean they were all using the same public key,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
which would be a pretty serious problem.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
If we look at this key, we can see that it's expiration date is all the way up to 2028.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
It goes back to 1996. This is a very long-lived key.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
This is the key that is the root of our certificate hierarchy.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Here's what we have. We have a certificate that was sent by Google.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
It was signed using a private key owned by Thawte Consulting.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
To validate that we need the corresponding public key, which we get from a certificate

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
that was signed by VeriSign.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
To verify that, we need the public key for VeriSign.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
We have that from a certificate, which says it's VeriSign's.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
How can we trust VeriSign's certificate

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
or do we have to keep going on forever?
