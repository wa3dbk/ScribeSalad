So, what type of question do Cognitive Psychologists ask?

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.430
Can we really multitask? How does our attachment change over

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.510
our lives? Why does my dog learn to salivate when

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.650
I open the door to the cabinet? What does an

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.530
increase in dopamine in my brain do to my mood?

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.140
Now was the shooter having a psychotic episode or was

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.590
he competent to stand trial? Choose which one you think

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.810
psychologists would ask and more than one could be correct.
