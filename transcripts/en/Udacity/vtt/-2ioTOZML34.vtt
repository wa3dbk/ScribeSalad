00:00:00.258 --> 00:00:02.440
So, it seems we can use plus with numbers and we can

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.460
use plus with strings. What if someone tries to use plus with

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.690
a string and a number at the same time? So, suppose my

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.750
name is actually the number 9. Well, when we try and run

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.610
this, what we get is an error. Here's the error we get.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.680
This is a little different from the syntax errors we've seen before.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.600
This is still in the Python grammar. But it's something that doesn't

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.340
make sense. What we tried to do was concatenate a string, which is

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.130
the string My name is, and the number, which is

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.870
the integer 9, and it doesn't make sense to paste

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.910
those together. At least Python doesn't know what it means.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.820
So this produces an error, we can't add numbers and strings

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.225
together. We can multiply strings though, this is a little

00:00:40.225 --> 00:00:43.630
strange. And so, here I'm doing the exclamation point string

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.980
times 12, and what I get is 12 exclamation points.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.720
This is better than having to type them all out. So

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.040
I can change, instead of doing Hello

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.000
name, exclamation point plus exclamation point, I

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.240
could do exclamation point times 3 here. And this would be the Hello Dave with

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.390
3. So if I'm very excited to say hello to myself, I could do

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.720
exclamation point times 38. And then I'll

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.500
get Hello Dave, followed by 38 exclamation points.
