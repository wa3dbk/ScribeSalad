00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.112
a plus b is x minus 4 plus 1 and a minus b is x minus 4 minus 1. Simplifying

00:00:04.112 --> 00:00:08.412
this gives us the quantity x minus 3 times the quantity x minus 5. Please note

00:00:08.412 --> 00:00:12.693
that this is exactly what we got when we factored. So really when compared to

00:00:12.693 --> 00:00:16.939
factoring completing the square was a lot of work in this case. But there are

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.597
plenty of cases where we have expressions that we can't factor in which

00:00:20.597 --> 00:00:24.667
completing the Completing the square will actually help us. It'll make our lives

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:27.832
easier. Here it wasn't really necessary because we could of factored the initial

00:00:27.832 --> 00:00:28.388
expression.
