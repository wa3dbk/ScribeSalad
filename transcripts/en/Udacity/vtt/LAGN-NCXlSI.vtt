00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.744
To get x by itself, we need to subtract b over 2a from both sides. Then, both of

00:00:05.744 --> 00:00:11.248
our fractions on the right-hand side have a denominator of 2a, so it's really

00:00:11.248 --> 00:00:16.709
easy to combine them. This gives us, finally, a final answer of x equals

00:00:16.709 --> 00:00:22.810
negative b, plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac all over 2a.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.737
You can heave a giant sigh of relief now, that was a lot of work and it involved

00:00:27.737 --> 00:00:32.589
some complicated Algebra. I think that in doing this, you had to use almost all

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:36.730
of the skills you've learned in this course so far. So, this is super

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.454
impressive, I am so proud of you. So, what does this mean again? Remember, we

00:00:41.454 --> 00:00:46.948
started out with an equation in this form, a quadratic equation, ax squared plus

00:00:46.948 --> 00:00:51.871
bx plus c equals 0. Working from that, we've solved for x which means that now,

00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:56.459
we have a formula where if we know the coefficients of a quadratic equation

00:00:56.459 --> 00:01:01.069
written in this form, we can find the values of x that satisfy it. In other

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:06.724
words, for any parabola we have, if we can write its equation in standard form,

00:01:06.724 --> 00:01:11.857
ax squared plus bx plus c equals y, then we can set y equal to 0 and find the

00:01:11.857 --> 00:01:17.487
x-intercepts. This is huge, this is incredibly powerful. And we did all of these

00:01:17.487 --> 00:01:22.520
by just completing the square. And, of course, doing some other algebraic

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.651
manipulations.
