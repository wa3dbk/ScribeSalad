00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.020
Traditionally design documentation has included information about the components

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.150
you've carved the system up into, what their responsibilities are,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.000
what their primary data flows are and so on. Other elements of traditional

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.160
documentation include, how you going to deal with performance considerations.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.670
And resource consumption, by resource here we might mean memory,

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.830
we might mean use of peripherals, bandwidth and so on. It that's not enough for

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.560
you, if your organization needs more detail documentation,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.202
you might rely on some IEEE standards, such as standard 1016.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.700
Some of the key elements that the standard add to the list

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.080
that is traditionally used are things like who is the designer? It might be

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.670
nice to know if you have to go back for a question, who was responsible for

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.970
a particular piece of the design. What are the dependencies among the elements?

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.750
Are there hidden assumptions that one component is making about other

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.980
components? What are the tradeoffs among the non-functional constraints?

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.110
How did you decide to take a particular tradeoff? What assumptions are you

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.370
making about your users, about the technology that will be available for

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.830
the hardware, and about the changing customer base? And

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.240
which particular. Views of the software system as your documentation providing.
