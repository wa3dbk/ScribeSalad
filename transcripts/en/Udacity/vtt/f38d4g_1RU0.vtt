00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.250
So, that's the normalized cut approach,
and it's one of the more

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.740
effective methods within the whole
graph-based way of doing segmentation.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.270
The pros are because
it's a graph structure,

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.650
we've got lots of algorithms for
dealing with craft structure.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.600
So, it's a very generic way of doing it,
because you separate out

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.200
this graph structure question from
the affinity matrix computation.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.000
So the affinity matrix is where
you get to play with things,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.650
like your distance functions,
and your feature spaces.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.110
And then, your graph algorithms just
run given that that, that matrix.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.130
So again, it doesn't require
a model of the data distribution.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.220
It just requires a distance
function that respects that.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.600
There are some challenges.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.975
In general, the complexity of dealing
with this can be pretty high,

00:00:43.975 --> 00:00:48.130
because you now have this, these
matrices that are essentially n by n,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.980
where n is the number of pixels.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.810
So you want to be careful exactly
how you manage that complexity.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.720
If you have densely connected graphs,
because you want to allow for

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.150
large regions, et cetera the system
has to work even harder.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.420
And the, the spectral decomposition
approximation to the normalized cut

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.520
is a little bit trickier to do.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.390
And, and then there's this question
about this balancing of the partition.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.800
So you remember, we introduced
the normalization to the min-cut,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.030
in order to not get small pieces,

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.570
because there was a bias towards
small pieces in the algorithm?

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.870
Well, another way of thinking about this
is, we've introduced a preference for

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.375
balanced partitions,
for balanced regions.

00:01:30.375 --> 00:01:34.092
So if you really wanted to have small,
little spots being pulled off of

00:01:34.092 --> 00:01:37.937
something that was bigger, normalized
cut finds that kind of painful,

00:01:37.937 --> 00:01:40.792
because it wants to have
these balanced partitions.

00:01:40.792 --> 00:01:44.022
Having said that, I will say that
it is one of the more effective

00:01:44.022 --> 00:01:47.300
segmentation methods that
people currently use.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.290
And I think it's because it has
this nice dissociation between

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.380
the affinity matrix computation and
the graph segmentation method.
