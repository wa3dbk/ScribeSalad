00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.775
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If we're looking for 2 numbers, a and b, to add to our xes, and our 2

00:00:03.775 --> 00:00:08.299
binomials up here. They need to multiply to equal negative 6. And they need to

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:12.602
add to equal negative 5. This is pretty tricky. When I think about 6 and 5, I

00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:17.210
think about 3 and 2 as numbers that might work. Let's see. If we have negative

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.870
3, and we need to multiply by something to get negative 6. That would be a

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.659
positive 2. But negative 3 plus positive 2 equals negative 1, which is not

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:31.925
negative 5. Hm. We need something different. Well, how about 6 and 1? Negative 6

00:00:31.925 --> 00:00:36.660
times positive 1. There we go. And negative 6 plus 1 equals negative 5, so

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.713
that's perfect. So our factors will be x minus 6, and x plus 1.
