00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.994
Let's practice collecting multiple values. I want to write a program that helps

00:00:03.994 --> 00:00:07.620
a user compute their average time for sprinting 100 meters. Here are the

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.130
beginnings of the average method. The method should be reading floating point

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.330
numbers from the user until the user enters zero and then it should return the

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.287
average of all of the numbers. You can use the average tester main method to

00:00:19.287 --> 00:00:20.819
test as you go along.
