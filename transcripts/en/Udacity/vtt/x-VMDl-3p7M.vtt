00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.858
Okay. So, for a population of size 350 million, how would we find the standard

00:00:05.858 --> 00:00:11.229
deviation of the distribution of sample means? Well, let's start with what we

00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:16.167
know from our simple example so far. Let's calculate the population standard

00:00:16.167 --> 00:00:21.249
deviation sigma, and then, let's also calculate the standard deviation of all

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:25.994
our sample means, let's call this SE. All the sample means are also written at

00:00:25.994 --> 00:00:30.570
the bottom and in iInstructor notes if you want to refer to those. So calculate

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.930
the standard deviation of this population and the standard deviation of all the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.696
sample means, where the sample is size 2.
