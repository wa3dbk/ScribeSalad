00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.430
Now something that I glossed over that I want to return to is,

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:10.270
in finding the minimum and maximum date, I simply accessed the date column.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.380
If you remember, from when we previously inspected our data in the console.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.150
The date column is actually a string representation.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.540
In order to ensure that when we're comparing dates to find the minimum and

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.920
maximum that the comparison actually returns the correct date.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.800
For strings, there may be some ambiguity in what's greater or

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.220
less when referring to a date.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.210
So, to be safe, you should always work with a JavaScript date object itself.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.560
To do so, you can either use d3's built in date parsers,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.135
which I'll show you in just a second,

00:00:44.135 --> 00:00:49.120
in-line in the functions which we need to do any sort of comparison.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.070
Or, since we will most likely always need the date column to be a date object.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.800
We can parse it as we load in the data.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.910
Scrolling to the bottom of the page here,

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.500
we're going to revisit the D3 tab separated value file loading function.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.420
In this case, d3.tsv.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.760
And previously reloaded our data file.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.120
In this case, again, remember it's not simply the World Cup data set but

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.100
it has geographic enhancements to it.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.760
The latitude, the longitude and the home team.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.260
Which once it's loaded will run the draw callback function

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.840
which contains all the code to draw the chart.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.350
One thing that I haven't covered previously, but

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.740
that's very powerful, is that in this function that initially loads the data,

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.410
in addition to the file we're loading and the callback we run, in this

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.600
case draw, once all the data's loaded, we can run an intermediate function.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.140
That can transform our parser data before our draw function gets called.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.620
In this case, this intermediate transformation function that

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.540
we pass functions in much the same way as the functions we

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.770
passed to our extents where the function gets run for every data point.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.200
In our data file.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.240
One at a time.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.000
The argument D in this function is simply a single row of our data file.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.780
And whatever we return from this function is what actually gets passed to

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.330
the call back.
