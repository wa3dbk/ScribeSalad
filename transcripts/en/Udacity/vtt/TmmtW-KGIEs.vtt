00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.640
All right, welcome back to,
Computer Vision.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.166
Today we're going to talk, a little bit
more about some activity recognition,

00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.370
methodology, technology.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.520
In particular, we're going to
focus on Time Series, and, mostly,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.800
we're going to, this part's going to be,
on something called the,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.570
Markov Models and it's, and
its way of representing Time Series.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.980
And then we'll talk a little bit
about how that is applied to vision.
