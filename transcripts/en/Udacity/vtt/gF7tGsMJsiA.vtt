00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.910
So let's see if we know how to use multiple predictors and

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.060
combine their decisions. Suppose that we have a program in

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.960
which a 2-bit predictor works just fine for 95% of our instructions.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.670
A PSHARE predictor works just fine for the same 95% of the instructions,

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.320
plus it also works fine for 2%. That this 2-bit predictor doesn't cover.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.880
So, overall, it works fine for 97% of full instructions, but the 95% here and

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.800
here overlap. A GSHARE predictor, again, works just fine for

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.500
the same 95% that all the other predictors are just fine for.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.400
Plus it works fine for the other 3%. So overall, it's 98% accurate.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.170
95 of those are the same as the 2-bit predictor. But the three that

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.930
it covers in addition to that are not the same. But the three that it covers in

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.750
addition to that are different from the 2% that the PSHARE predictor covers.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.110
So together, these three predictors should be able to correctly predict

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.160
all instructions. So the question for you is how do we combine them.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.450
So the overall predictor that we will use is a, what kind of predictor.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.410
That chooses between a what kind of predictor and what kind of predictor. And

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.620
this last predictor here, itself, will choose between what kind, and

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.910
what kind of predictor. Instead of writing in the names of the predictors.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.000
Just select among the following. So for each of them say if it's A, B, C, D or

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.242
E. A is the 2-bit predictor. B is the PSHARE predictor.

00:01:45.242 --> 00:01:50.090
C is the GSHARE predictor. D is the Tournament predictor.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.836
E is a Hierarchical predictor. And F, is the Return Address Stack.

00:01:55.836 --> 00:02:01.579
So again, for each of these five boxes, put which letter corresponds,

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.110
to the predictor, that is the right answer for that box.
