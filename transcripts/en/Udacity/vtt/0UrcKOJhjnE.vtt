00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.770
Here's the diagonalization trick
applied to Turing machines.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.290
We'll let M1, M2, etcetera,
be the set of all Turing machines.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.730
Turing machines can be
described as strings, so

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.400
there are a countable number of them,
so we can enumerate them like this.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.310
And we'll create a table as before.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.770
I'll define the function
f(i,j) to be one, if machine i

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.890
accepts the description of machine j and
we'll define it as zero otherwise.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.620
For this example I'll fill
out the table somehow.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.190
The actual values aren't
important right now.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.260
Now consider the language L
consisting of string descriptions

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.340
of machines that do not accept
their own descriptions.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.980
And let's add a Turing machine,

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.980
which we'll call ML that recognizes
this language to the grid.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.220
Well, again, we run into a problem.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.730
This row is supposed to
have the opposite values

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.910
of what's along the diagonal.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.190
But what about the diagonal
element of this row?

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.670
What does the machine do when
it's given its own description?

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.710
If it accepts itself,
then ML is not in the language,

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.820
so ML should not have accepted itself.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.150
On the other hand, if ML does not
accept its string representation,

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.260
then ML isn't a language, so ML should
have accepted its string representation.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.420
Thankfully in computability,
the resolution to this paradox

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.680
isn't as hard to see as it is in
set theory or mathematical logic.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.300
We just conclude that
the supposed machine

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.170
ML that recognizes
the language L doesn't exist.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.000
Here, it is natural to object,
well, of course it exists.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.500
I just run M on itself and
if it doesn't accept, we accept.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.620
The problem is that M on itself
might loop, or it might just run for

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.370
a really long time and
there's no way to tell the difference.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.730
The end result, then is that the
language, L, of string descriptions of

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.620
machines that do not accept their own
descriptions is not recognizable.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.490
Recall that in order for a language to
be decidable, both the language and

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.329
it's compliment have to be recognizable.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.919
Since L is not recognizable,
it's also not decidable.

00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:12.170
And neither is it's compliment,

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.600
that is the language where the machine
does accept it's own description.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.380
We'll call this DTM,
D standing for diagonal.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.900
These facts are the foundation for

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.010
everything that we will
argue in this lesson.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.950
So make sure that you
understand all these claims.
