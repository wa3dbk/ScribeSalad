00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.110
Now, this plot might have been a little bit tricky,

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.750
so let's walk through it together. I'll assign age to the

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.540
X parameter, and then I'll assign females divided by males, to

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.820
the Y parameter. This will give me my ratio. And then

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.320
I just need to make sure that I pass my

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.400
newest data frame to data. We'll add a geome line to

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.590
connect the points, and then we'll also add a horizontal line.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.460
This geom_hline will take a couple parameters. We'll set the y-intercept

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.420
to one, the alpha equal to 0.3, and the

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.970
line type equal to two. Running this code, we get

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.890
out ratio plot. We can easily see that for very

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.110
young users, the median female user has over two and

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.510
a half times as many friends as the median male

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.100
user Clearly it was helpful to condition on age, and

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.100
understanding the relationship of gender with friend count. This helped

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.620
assure us this pattern is robust for users of many

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.100
different ages. And it also highlighted where this

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.910
difference is most striking. Now, there are many

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.970
processes that can produce this difference, including the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.410
biased distribution from which this pseudo Facebook data

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.560
was generated. One idea which shows the complexity

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.000
of interpretation here, is that people from particular

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.200
countries who more recently joined Facebook are more

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.390
likely to be male with lower friend counts.
