00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.270
So to familiarize yourself with complexity theory and computability, here's our first quiz.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.060
As in any Udacity course, the quizzes are here to help you see

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.420
if you have understood the content, and they do not count toward your final grade.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.070
So our first quiz will be about familiarizing yourself

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.600
with the areas of computability and complexity theory.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.590
Here I have 3 questions that you could ask in theoretical computer science.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.960
So how fast can a computer find a way between 2 points on a map?

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.900
Can a program decide if another program is malware?

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.700
So, for example, a virus or trojan.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.100
And how much memory is needed to sort a given database?

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.080
What I would like to know from you, for each of these 3 questions here,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.980
is if that question would be studied in computability

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.460
or if that question would be studied in complexity theory.

00:00:49.460 --> 99:59:59.000
Please make your selection for each of these questions.
