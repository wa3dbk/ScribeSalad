00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.700
Let me a show you a series of
examples of what it means to

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.410
take these now images at different
exposure values, to be able to generate

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.720
something equivalent to a stack of
images at different exposure values and

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.129
again, here, we're basically giving
it a lot of different samples.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.950
Again, an underexposed dark image,
you can see the outside.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.890
Now, of course,
I've made it a little brighter,

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.390
more, more, and
now you can actually see in detail.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.770
This was always visible but now more
of the insides are becoming visible and

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.540
as we keep going, you'll notice
that outside gets overexposed and

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.170
some of the insides are also
getting a little overexposed and

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.480
detail is kind of getting lost.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.310
You're getting a little bit
of a halo effect here and

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.860
all that kind of stuff too.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.750
Even more now, actually,
the boundaries are getting lost.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.630
So let's save this as
my stack of images.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.420
What we did in the previous case was we
calibrated but this would, of course,

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.540
could be done for a real image.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.180
Again, in this case, what I basically
did was I took different images and

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.770
note that in this instance,

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.340
I actually have all of these images
aligned because I put them on a tripod.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.450
If they were not on a tripod, what
you would've had to do is, of course,

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.550
do image alignment.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.750
Remember the stuff that we looked
at when we talked about panoramas,

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.410
as we'd have to align
these images together.
