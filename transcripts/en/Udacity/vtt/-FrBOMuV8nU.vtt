00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hi. Welcome back and congratulations! We've made it all the way to Week 7.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We've done a lot along the way, and this week's going to be a little bit different.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
First and most important. We have the final exam.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
There's a bunch of programming problems for you, and you'll see those.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
There won't be any video associated with it--just the questions, so work on those.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I think you'll have fund doing them, and I think you'll be able to handle them all.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
In addition to that, I didn't want to have any extra-heavy materials,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
because you're going to have plenty of work on the final exam.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Instead, we're going to take some field trips.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We're going to go visit with some friends and colleagues of mine

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
who are experts in computer science who use programming everyday

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and have their own views on what the process of computer program design is like.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I think you'll enjoy talking with them. Come on with us.
