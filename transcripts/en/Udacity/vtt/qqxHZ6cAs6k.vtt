00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.790
Now it's important to understand how the application

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.140
cache works together with the http cache. When we

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.500
say that the cache is downloaded or Appcache updates

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.670
the files of the cache, those downloads are still

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.379
following the rules of http caching. If those files

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.000
are already in the http cache, they may come

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.020
from that cache rather than over the network. You

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.550
can still use far-future caching, for example, on files

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.880
that you know won't change often, and when

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.332
the Appcache update system needs a new copy of

00:00:30.332 --> 00:00:32.210
them, it'll pull them out of the http

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.500
cache, not grab them over the network. This gives

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.900
you a two-stage updating system, which can be pretty useful. However,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.260
there is one file that you should never far-future cache. What is it? The

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.750
master HTML page? The manifest file? Or cat videos?
