00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
These are two pretty fundamental problems.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
That's not going to work, so we need to make some improvements here.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The way to solve this problem is to include more randomness in the key here,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
so an attacker who can replace this won't be able to trick the parties into agreeing

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
to a different key, and then they can verify that they've agreed on the same key.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What we're going to do is add extra random nonsense to these steps.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
In addition to the messages, the client will generate a random value--we'll call that rc--

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that will be added to this message.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The server will generate a random value rs that will be added to this message.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This value will still be created.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This is what's call the premaster secret.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
What we're going to send here is going to include a little extra information.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It's still going to include r--the premaster secret. We need to share that with the server.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We're going to pad this.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
This will make search attacks more difficult, prevent some of the weaknesses.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
If this is a message, happens to be a small number.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
We're going to use the PKCS protocol that we talked about in Unit 4

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
to use RSA more securely.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
If this were some other cipher, we could use a different way of padding it.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
We're also going to add to r something about the client version,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and this will be useful for verifying the previous steps have not been tampered with.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Instead of making the key just r,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
the key is going to combine all the randomness that we've used so far.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
The way we'll compute the key, which is now called the master secret,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
is by using a pseudo-random function--this is like a hash function--

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
where what it takes as inputs are the premaster secret--that's r--

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and it also takes a label, which is just identifying this as the master secret,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
which gets combined with the value of rc--the client's randomness--and the value of rs--

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
the servers randomness.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
What H is is a way of using a combination of hash functions where it takes a key

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
as well as the value that you're hashing.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
What it produces is 384 bits, which gets divided into three 128-bit keys.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
One of these will be used as the key for symmetric encryption,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and that's using an algorithm like RC4, typically.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
One of these will become the IV, and that's the initialization vector which we need for CBC--

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
cipher block chaining mode--that we'll use.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We'll talk about the protocol, how it uses that, later.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
The other one would be a key that's used for a keyed hash.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
We've previously talked about hash functions that didn't use a key.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
The important property of the hash function is it gives us a one-way mapping.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
A keyed hash function--that mapping depends on the key.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
One way to think about that, which is not quite the way these work,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
but it's really concatenating that key with the value we're hashing.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
If it's a strong cryptographic hash function, that should be effectively equivalent to a keyed hash function.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
This change means if an active attacker can interfere with this message,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
they still can't control what gets computed here.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
This depends on the randomness used in the previous two steps.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
What happens before the channel is used for anything secure

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
is the client and server need to verify that they got the same key.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
We add a step here to finish the handshake.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
The way that step works is we encrypt the finished message,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
using the key extracted from the master secret.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
That means if any of these values were tampered with

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
that key would be different, the handshake would never be finished,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and there would never be any secure communication sent using that key,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
because both parties verify the handshake before continuing.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
This fixes the first problem.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Now there's no way for the middle attacker to hijack the session.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000
If they tamper with this message, it will be detected when the handshake finish is done

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
using a key that depended on all these values.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Depending on the random values here also prevents replay attacks.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Since new random values are used for each protocol execution,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
there is no way to replay it.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
The key depends on these values that were used previously.
