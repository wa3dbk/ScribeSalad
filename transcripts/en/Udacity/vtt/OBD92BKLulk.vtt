00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.410
So let's see if we understand the
differences between message passing and

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:04.960
shared memory.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.560
If we have a program in which one core
know how to initialize an array and

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.470
then all others need to read the entire
array, then the number of lines

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.340
of code for the data distribution of
the array once it has been initialized.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.370
Does message passing have fewer lines
of code than shared memory for this?

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.160
Does it have about equal
number of lines of code?

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.150
Or do you think that it gets more
lines of code than shared memory,

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.620
in which case write a larger than sign?

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.150
And then once we have
achieved data distribution.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.610
Synchronization that is needed to make
sure that the initialization is done

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.560
before we can read the array adds
how many lines of code in a message

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.790
passing version of the code, and in
the shared memory version of the code?

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.584
You only need to say whether it's 0 or
larger than 0.
