00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.430
So some Comments on Postconditions. First of all, we've only been concerned so

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.080
far with pure functions. And a pure function is one in which the output

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.030
is completely determined by the input. However, in real programming languages,

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.700
computational units like functions, procedures and methods may be impure. For

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.090
impure functions, in addition to describing how the output relates to

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.480
the input you should also indicate any side effect. These include changes to

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.260
global variables and any operations like input and output that

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.400
aren't reflected in the results of the function. And if we're talking about and

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.470
OO. That is, an object oriented programming language, then changes to any

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.850
instance variables of the of, of the object that we're dealing with,

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.270
are also things that we would have to express inside the post conditions. But so

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.940
far, with square root we don't have to worry about that.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.210
And it's also the cates that, that sort is going to be a pure function, so

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.140
we don't have to worry about it there.
