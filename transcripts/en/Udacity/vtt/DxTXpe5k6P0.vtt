00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.286
Here, the correct answer is our negative 5 halves and positive 2. Now that's

00:00:04.286 --> 00:00:07.854
amazing if you got that correct. You've really gained steam in solving

00:00:07.854 --> 00:00:12.860
quadratic equations. We start solving this equation by subtracting 10 from both

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.090
sides. This sets our quadratic equation equal to 0, and now we can try and

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.100
factor. We want to find factors of negative 20 that sum to positive 1. These

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.460
factors are positive 5 and negative 4. We use these coefficients to rewrite our

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.840
middle term of x, and these factoring by grouping to get these factors. We set

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.010
each factor equal to 0, and then solve each equation for x. This gives us a

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.586
solution set of negative 5 halves and positive 2. I hope this was a great

00:00:42.586 --> 00:00:47.070
refresher on solving quadratic equations. In the upcoming lessons, we'll find

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.975
other ways to solve these quadratics. Sometimes they aren't always factorable.
