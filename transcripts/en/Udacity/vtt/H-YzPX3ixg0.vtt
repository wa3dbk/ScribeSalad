00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.490
So, today we discussed frames, which are one of the knowledge

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.200
representations that we'll see throughout this course. We started off by talking

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.050
about the basic structure of frames which involves slots and fillers, and

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.165
we talked about how similar they are to the variables and values that we see in

00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:15.570
object-oriented programming. We then talked about the three main properties of

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.830
frames which are that they represent stereotypes of a certain concept, they

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.950
provide default values, and they can inherit from one another. We then talked

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.270
about frames in terms of other concepts we've already covered in this course.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.270
We talked about how frames are representationally equivalent to semantic nets,

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.310
and we've talked about how frames were actually what we were using when

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.780
we were doing projection systems last lesson. We finally talked about some of

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.620
the advanced reasoning and story understanding that we can do with frames.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.250
Now we're going to move to a topic called learning by recording cases,

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.740
where we learn from individual cases or individual experiences. But

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.280
if you're very interested in frames, you might want to jump forward to

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.430
our lessons on understanding common sense reasoning and scripts.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.270
This will all very heavily leverage what we've learned about frames today
