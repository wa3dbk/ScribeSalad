00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.110
So after having looped through,

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:07.010
after having iterated through the entire
dataset, millions and millions of tags.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.700
Okay?

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.560
Then what I'm going to do is print out
the data that I found for my audit.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.480
Okay?
So it actually takes a little while for

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.415
that to run.

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:17.085
So I've run it already.

00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:17.675
Okay.

00:00:17.675 --> 00:00:19.505
And here's what the output looks like.

00:00:19.505 --> 00:00:24.365
Okay so there actually aren't
really that many unusual values.

00:00:24.365 --> 00:00:26.219
What I find is, so
in the United States, and

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:29.279
this is going to vary from one country
to another, in the United States,

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.755
we number certain types of roads.

00:00:30.755 --> 00:00:32.555
So this would be a US highway.

00:00:32.555 --> 00:00:33.879
United States highway.

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.210
Same thing with 53, 59,
and so on, all right?

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.840
So that's why I'm seeing these as keys,
all right?

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.350
Now this is odd.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.750
My guess is, these look like zip codes
to me, or postal codes, all right?

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.570
Another road number.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.440
And then I'm seeing
different forms of avenue.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.950
And as I move through this,
here's a good example of a set for

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.220
this particular key value here for
court.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.680
Okay, so these are all of the different
uses of CT as an abbreviation for

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.910
court in this particular dataset.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.290
Okay, and

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.480
as I scroll through this, I see
the rest of the unusual street types.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.410
Okay, now what I have to decide,
and basically this

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.580
is the process that you're going to
follow through the next few exercises,

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.520
is, which of these are okay and which of
them do I need to do something about?

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.730
South Avenue L,

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.960
that's actually a correct way of
representing a street name, there's

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.870
nothing wrong with that it's just
that it wasn't expected in my audit.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:30.600
It's okay though,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.660
I would probably not want to do anything
to change how this is represented.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.550
On the other hand, I don't really
like all caps abbreviations.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.760
So I would probably transform
all of the abbreviations

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.786
into the specific word
that that represents.

00:01:47.786 --> 00:01:53.015
So, for example,
PKWY is an abbreviation for

00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:57.055
Parkway okay, so
that's what I would probably use there.

00:01:57.055 --> 00:02:02.612
All right and the same with other
abbreviations that we find here, street,

00:02:02.612 --> 00:02:04.032
terrace, and so on.

00:02:04.032 --> 00:02:06.822
Okay, so your general process for

00:02:06.822 --> 00:02:12.002
the exercises that follow is going to be
to write some code, to audit the data,

00:02:12.002 --> 00:02:16.752
and then decide what type of fixes
you want to apply to that data.

00:02:16.752 --> 00:02:19.382
And then write the code that
actually performs the fix.
