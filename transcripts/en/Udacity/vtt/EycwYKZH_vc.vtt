00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.505
We want the absolute value of f to be greater than 5, or the distance of f from

00:00:04.517 --> 00:00:09.035
zero to be larger than 5. If f were here, it wouldn't be more than 5 units away,

00:00:09.137 --> 00:00:13.475
so this number line is out. If f were out here, beyond negative 5, then the

00:00:13.487 --> 00:00:18.089
distance to zero would definitely be more than 5. So, this is part of the

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:23.037
solution. But there are also other values over here, like 6 and 7, which have a

00:00:23.049 --> 00:00:27.864
distance greater than 5. So, we want both of these regions. If you chose this

00:00:27.876 --> 00:00:32.812
one, nice work. Any number in either region, this one or this one, would work.
