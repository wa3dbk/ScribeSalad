00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.300
Suppose you wrote an application called chocolate

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.070
chooser, that implements the chocolate back in

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.620
API using endpoints. The app ID for

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.490
chocolate chooser is choc-appID, the client ID

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.149
is 123choc. Now let's suppose someone else

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.910
writes an application called, let's say, devastating

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.170
desserts that uses JavaScript to access the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.791
chocolate API. The app ID is dev-desserts, and

00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:32.140
the client ID is 123devdes. And this devastating

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.580
desserts application is all about the UI, so

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.150
it doesn't have any back end API. So

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.700
now let's think about the API definition for

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.890
chocolate API in the chocolate chooser application. So

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.770
here we've got the API definition. The name

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.480
is chocolate API version V1. The scopes is

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.990
email. This basically mean, that we're going to be

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.000
using the user's email. It's up to you to tell us what would

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.200
the client ID be here. And go ahead and just enter a specific value.
