00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.660
Georgia Tech is the first university
to offer a FHIR platform for

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.560
students to develop and
test their innovative ideas.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.270
It provides access to
synthetic health data for

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.260
some 10,000 make believe chronic
disease patients like Marla.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.230
You access that data using
some key FHIR resources, for

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.020
which we've implemented the ability,
with some limitations,

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.290
to create, read, update,
and delete, called CRUD.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.420
You'll also have access to
the SMART on FHIR app platform.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.560
You'll form teams,
each of which will turn its innovation

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.089
into at least a working prototype using
FHIR as the source of patient data.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.130
Each team will be assigned to a TA,

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.570
who will help resolve any technical
issues and answer any questions.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.110
If you want one, we'll try and

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.430
connect you with a domain expert
relevant to your project.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.510
It's important that each team have
people with the right set of skills.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.200
So we'll be providing assistance
to you to form effective teams.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.190
We'll discuss FHIR in lesson 5B, but
I suggest you get started exploring it

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.700
now by visiting the websites I've
listed in the instructor's notes.
