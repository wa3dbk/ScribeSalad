00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.380
The proliferation of mobile devices has
revolutionized a number of industries,

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.300
and education is no different.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.630
One of the real big strengths in
mobile devices is their ubiquity.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.240
Most of our students already have
these kinds of mobile devices

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.520
in their pocket right now,
with them at all times.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.010
And that gives us a real opportunity
to create some really interesting

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.290
learning activities.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.550
So, for example,
if a student's at a national park or

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.700
a Civil War battlefield, they can have
their mobile device guide them around

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.200
the battlefield telling them different
things that happened at different times,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.460
complete with animation and voice-overs.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.150
So there's real opportunities to create
some really interesting learning

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.780
experiences.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.620
As a new father, I'm very grateful for
the use of this technology in this way,

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.460
because my daughter gets a phone
call from Elmo every day, and

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.770
it just makes her face light
up whenever it happens.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.500
So I'm very appreciative of
the possibility to use educational

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.370
technology in cahoots
with mobile devices.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.520
But there are other things
to mobile devices as well.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.540
There are different
features that they have.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.380
They're different than anything
we've dealt with in the past.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.950
They have a GPS.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:53.790
They have a camera.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.150
They have motion sensors.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.955
And all of these things can be used
to create some really interesting

00:00:57.955 --> 00:01:00.110
educational experiences and
different domains.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.450
So what we're going to talk about
in this class is a lot about how

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.860
the ubiquity of mobile devices can be
leveraged to create unique experiences,

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.770
but also about how some of those
other features can be used in

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.720
other context as well.
