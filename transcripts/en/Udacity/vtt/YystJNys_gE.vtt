00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
To compute the total harvest is simply take care of by how much it changes in the current step

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
then add this to the total amount.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This is the result and you can see that there is not a single combination of start and end time,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but rather a line of combinations, all of which work similarly well.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So if you transform this 2-dimensional view into a 3-dimensional view, it would look like

00:00:25.000 --> 09:59:59.000
the reach of a mountain, not a single peak of a mountain.
