00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.290
So, one of the things I wish I
knew before I had got out and

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.920
chased the money, was just how
long this was going to take.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.783
It took twice as long as I had suspected
it was going to take and multiple times,

00:00:13.783 --> 00:00:17.990
more energy than I thought I was
going to put into it overall.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.555
And unfortunately, the results of
that was it took that energy out of

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:24.615
what we were building
into the business itself.

00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:28.875
So effectively we had suspended our
business operations in favor of chasing

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:32.012
money that would help us grow
our business operations.

00:00:32.012 --> 00:00:35.225
Kind of a counter intuitive
thing to do overall.
