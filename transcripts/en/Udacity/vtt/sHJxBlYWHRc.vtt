00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.650
In this lesson, we examined
the working of touring machines.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.010
And if you completed all the exercises,
you should have a strong sense of how to

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.480
use them to compute functions and
decide languages.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.700
We've also seen how unlike some
simpler models of computation,

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.820
touring machines don't
necessarily halt on all inputs.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.140
This forced us to distinguish
between language deciders and

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.820
language recognizers.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.210
Eventually, we'll see how
this problem of halting or

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.600
not halting will be the key to
understanding the limits of computation.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.009
&gt;&gt; We've shown Turing machines
can test the quality of strings,

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.010
not something that can be computed
by simpler models like finite or

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.290
pushdown automata that you might have
seen in your undergraduate classes.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.650
But equality is a rather simple problem.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.150
Can Turing machines solve the complex
tasks that we have our computers do?

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.600
Can a Turing machine do your taxes,
or play a great game of chess?

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.100
Next lesson we'll see that Turing
machines can indeed solve any problem

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.510
that our computers can solve, and truly
do capture the idea of computation.
