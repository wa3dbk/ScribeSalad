00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.484
There are always 12 months in every year. So if someone is one year old, then

00:00:04.484 --> 00:00:09.540
they're going to be 12 months old. If someone is two years old, they'll be 24

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.290
months old. If someone is four point five years old, they'll be 54 months old.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.393
This data falls along a straight line. And therefore, r is 1.
