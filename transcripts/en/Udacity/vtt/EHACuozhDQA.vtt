00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.430
And the correct answer is we see two values in the URL,

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.050
the value we submitted and the value we hardcoded in our code.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.090
So let's take a quick look at this again.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.200
Recall that in our code, I added this extra input type hidden, name equals food,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.300
which matches this name and the value eggs, hardcoded.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.000
And then in our browser, when I click steak, the URL updates to have both steak,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.020
the one we've just added, and eggs in the URL.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.340
Let's try a few more examples while we're here.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.837
Let me try adding pizza.

00:00:31.837 --> 00:00:35.669
You can see steak, the one that came from us, changed to pizza, and

00:00:35.669 --> 00:00:37.330
eggs remained.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.950
Let's see also what happens if I type in eggs.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.280
Now we get eggs twice.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.560
So you can see we always have the value that was in our hidden elements

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.810
in the URL and then what came from the user is also there.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.730
But we can't add multiple things quite yet.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.530
To be honest with you, I wasn't actually sure what was going to happen when I

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.900
was writing this lesson plan.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.870
Just happened to work out in a, in a way that I could make a nice example.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.580
And just goes to show you, you know, some of the stuff is a little tricky, but

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.610
it's very easy to just play around in your editor and

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.680
in your browser to actually, you know, see what happens.
