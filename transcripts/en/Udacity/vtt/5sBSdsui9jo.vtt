Remember, when we start this problem we always start this by identifying our

00:00:04.117 --> 00:00:08.300
unknown and in this case it was the angle. We don't know the angle, so we call

00:00:08.312 --> 00:00:12.505
it x. Next we want to identify an equation in words. The supplement of an angle

00:00:12.517 --> 00:00:16.550
is 40 more than twice its complement. These words actually represents our

00:00:16.562 --> 00:00:20.405
equation. We have the supplement on the left and 40 more than twice the

00:00:20.417 --> 00:00:24.943
complement on the right. This word is often serves as the word equals. This

00:00:24.955 --> 00:00:29.763
allows us to set the supplement equal to 40 more than twice the compliment. The

00:00:29.775 --> 00:00:34.583
supplement of our unknown angle would be 180 minus x, and the compliment of our

00:00:34.595 --> 00:00:39.292
unknown angle would be 90 minus x. Now we solve this equation like before. We

00:00:39.304 --> 00:00:44.275
distribute the positive 2 to get 180 minus 2x. Then we combine like terms to get

00:00:44.287 --> 00:00:48.765
220. Next, we add 2x to both sides and we get 180 plus x equals 220. I've

00:00:48.777 --> 00:00:53.620
rewritten this statement over here and my last step, I just subtract 180 from

00:00:53.632 --> 00:00:58.460
both sides. So x is 40 degrees. If you got that one right, great work. You've

00:00:58.472 --> 00:01:03.725
really come a long way in understanding equations and expressions. This stuff is

00:01:03.737 --> 00:01:08.490
pretty tough. The last thing we want to do is make sure our answer is correct.

00:01:08.597 --> 00:01:13.515
The supplement of 40 degrees is 140 degrees, since these two add up to 180. And

00:01:13.527 --> 00:01:18.440
the compliment of our angle is 50 degrees. So let's compare these results with

00:01:18.452 --> 00:01:23.340
what we've started with. Is this complement 40 more than twice our supplement?

00:01:23.532 --> 00:01:29.621
If I double the complement, I get 100 degrees. And if I add 40 to it, I get 140

00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:32.940
degrees. So, yeah, that's my supplement.
