00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.050
LOINC was developed and is maintained by
the Regenstrief Institute in Indiana,

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.550
but is used virtually worldwide.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.210
Each code is for a laboratory test or
a clinical observation and

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.550
is a number with up to seven digits.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.850
While the codes themselves
are deceptively simple,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.430
they contain a lot of information
detailed in their names which,

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.240
as shown here, are divided into five or
six main parts separated by colons.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.440
In this example of the first part
the analyte, our substance of interest,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.896
is glucose.

00:00:34.896 --> 00:00:39.300
We can see that it was determined two
hours after the patient consumed 100

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.170
grams of glucose because the first part
of the name is divided into subparts,

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.220
separated by a caret.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.280
Here there are two subparts,
but there could be three.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.380
The first subpart, glucose,
could also contain multiple levels

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.780
of increasing specification
separated by dots.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.070
The third and fourth parts,
the time aspect, Pt,

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.400
means a point in time
rather than a time range.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.550
And the system sample,
Ser/Plas, indicates

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.310
that the test was performed on the serum
or plasma components of a blood sample,

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.630
can be modified by a separate subpart,
again separated by a caret.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.410
This table is a more detailed
explanation of each of the parts

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.920
of the name.
