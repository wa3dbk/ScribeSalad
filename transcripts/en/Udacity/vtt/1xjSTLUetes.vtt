00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.945
So this transparency is what I want to use to kind of

00:00:02.945 --> 00:00:05.720
introduce the term of alpha-blending.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.700
Let's see what that means.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.260
So by doing a multiplication that I have done here with 0.34 before each and

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.262
every image, what I've done is basically added kind of

00:00:17.262 --> 00:00:20.670
a [INAUDIBLE] do a mixing of different types of things.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.690
So basically what I've done is I've made the original image,

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.530
compared to the next one, transparent by 34%.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.870
So in essence transparency is what an alpha is referred to as.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.960
So in essence what actually that means is I've actually converted and given each

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.980
one of them and made each of them transparent by 34% from the original image.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.871
This is referred to as an alpha and

00:00:46.871 --> 00:00:50.910
it usually varies from 0 to 1 whereas 0 is completely invisible.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.660
Remember if I multiplied by 0 here you would not have

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.840
seen Leonardo Da Vinci at all.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.090
If I multiply by 1 you would have seen him completely visible.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.830
Of course it would have had changes to your dynamic range of the pixel values

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.960
here, but this guy, Mr. Da Vinci, would have been perfectly visible.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.510
And similarly I could play around with these numbers for all of them.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.380
So alpha varies from 1, 0 to 1, where 0 is invisible and 1 is fully visible.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.212
So, in essence,

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:22.324
one of the ways we could do this is now basically add another layer.

00:01:22.324 --> 00:01:25.750
So RGB up to three layers of the image or three channels.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.265
An alpha could be another channel, which would have values from 0 to 1.

00:01:29.265 --> 00:01:34.890
And RGB would have, of course, then since the values from 0 to 255.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.450
This additional number, alpha value, could be also be computed and put inside

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.700
those channels or kept separately and actually dealt with as a different mask.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.670
And this is an interesting way of being able to now create a separate mask,

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.780
which we will then be able to play around with for different applications.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.700
Again, something we will come back to as we look at many examples.
