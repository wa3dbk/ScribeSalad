00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.240
I stated earlier that two of
the most important geometric

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.980
properties of a vector are its
magnitude and its direction.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.240
These two terms are suggestive of the
mathematical concepts they represent.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.640
The magnitude of a vector refers to
how much movement it quantifies, and

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.420
the direction of a vector
refers to where the director's

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.360
movement is pointed.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.860
Now let's see how to define
these concepts more formally.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.870
If we think of a vector as an arrow
from one point to another,

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.270
the magnitude of the vector is
the length of the arrow, that is,

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.060
the distance between
the two points it connects.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.800
To calculate distance,
we can use the Pythagorean formula.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.290
In two dimensions, we can make
a right triangle by taking one leg

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.870
to be along the x-axis,
one leg to be along the y-axis, and

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.460
the hypotenuse to be the segment
between the two points in question.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.200
The length of the horizontal leg is
the difference between the x-coordinates

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.600
of the points, and the length of the
vertical leg is the difference between

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.510
the y-coordinates of the points.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.630
Then, by the Pythagorean formula,
the length of the hypotenuse squared

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.850
is the sum of the squared
lengths of the legs.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.780
Now let's interpret this
in terms of the vector.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.710
The coordinates of the vector give the
difference between the coordinates of

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.410
the points the vector connects,
and the length of the vector

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.810
corresponds to the length of
the hypotenuse of the triangle.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.140
So the length of the vector squared

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.840
is the sum of the squares
of its coordinates.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.710
In other words, the magnitude of v

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.340
is the square root of its x-coordinates
squared plus its y-coordinates squared.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.220
Note that we use the double bars around
a vector as notation for its magnitude.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.320
A generalization of this formula
holds true in higher dimensions too.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.859
If v is a vector in n-dimensional space,
and

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:50.537
we call its coordinates v1, v2,
up through vn, then the magnitude of

00:01:50.537 --> 00:01:55.587
v is the square root of the sum of
the squares of its coordinates.

00:01:55.587 --> 00:02:01.407
Now, using the notion of magnitude,
we can define the direction of a vector.

00:02:01.407 --> 00:02:05.307
Notice that all vectors pointing in the
same direction are scaled versions of

00:02:05.307 --> 00:02:06.420
each other.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.160
This vector, v2, is twice
the length of this vector, v1, and

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.960
this vector, v3,
is a third of the length of v1.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.690
So, for
each possible direction of vector,

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.290
we have a whole class of vectors
pointing in that direction.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.550
So, to define the direction of a vector,

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.448
we will choose a canonical or
representative element from each class.

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:33.480
For simplicity, we'll use the vector
of magnitude one from each class.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.060
We'll call these vectors
the unit vectors,

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.860
since they each have
a length of one unit each.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.620
The process of finding the unit vector
pointing in the same direction as

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.380
a given vector is called normalization.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.580
Normalization has two steps.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.220
If we want to normalize the vector, v,
the first step is to find its magnitude.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.060
The second step is then to
perform a scalar multiplication.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.440
We multiply v by the number
one over the magnitude of v.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.620
This scales the vector up or down,
so that its length becomes one.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.460
So, if we wanted to normalize
the vector, v equals -1, 1,

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.180
1, we first find its length.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.925
The magnitude of v equals the square
root of -1 squared, plus 1 squared,

00:03:17.925 --> 00:03:21.277
plus 1 squared,
which equals the square root of 3.

00:03:21.277 --> 00:03:26.197
Then we multiply v by 1
over the square root of 3.

00:03:26.197 --> 00:03:30.847
The resulting vector, u,
would be -1 over the square root of 3,

00:03:30.847 --> 00:03:34.950
1 over the square root of 3,
1 over the square root of 3.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.690
We can check that u is actually a unit
vector by computing its magnitude.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.585
In this case, the length of u is the
square root of -1 over square root of 3

00:03:44.585 --> 00:03:49.560
squared, plus 1 over square root of
3 squared, plus 1 over square root of

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.616
3 squared, which equals the square
root of one-third, plus one-third,

00:03:54.616 --> 00:03:59.100
plus one-third, which is the square
root of 1, which is also 1.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.940
Since u has a magnitude of 1,
it is a unit vector.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.280
It is the unit vector pointing
in the same direction as v, so

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.780
u is the normalization of v.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.880
I should note one last point.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.810
If all the coordinates of a vector
are zero, we call that vector

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.579
the zero vector, denoted as the number
zero with an arrow above it.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.010
The zero vector is a vector
indicating no change.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.960
Note that the magnitude
of the zero vector is 0.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.180
However, what happens if we try
to normalize the zero vector?

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.150
We would end up dividing
by a magnitude of 0,

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.470
which causes all sorts of problems.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.220
So we simply say that the zero
vector has no normalization.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.860
Another way to interpret this is that
the zero vector has no direction.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.890
Just as it doesn't make sense to ask
which way a stationary car is moving.
