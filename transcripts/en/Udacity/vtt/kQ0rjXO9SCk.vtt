00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.260
So we'll have another quiz about variables. This one's a little tricky. So

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.480
the question is, what is the value of seconds after running this code? The

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.600
code has two assignment statements. The first one assigns to minutes, the value

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.920
of minutes plus 1. The second one assigns to seconds, the value of minutes times

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:25.180
60. Possible answers, 0, 60, 120 or error?

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.510
Like the previous one, see if you can guess what the answer

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.050
is yourself. You can always try running the code in the Python interpreter.
