00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This finishes the lecture part of CS373, my basic introduction to robotic AI.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Even though we haven't done the final exam yet,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I want to congratulate you for getting this far.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The fact you got this far means you are really likely a very amazing student.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
You put a lot of work into this--I know this.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It took me a lot of work to make those classes, but it probably took you even more to digest them.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I hope you learned a lot and had a lot of fun

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and you feel empowered to program robots better than before.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
What I taught you, I believe, is the very basic set of methods that any roboticist

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
should know about programming any robot intelligently.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
All of those robots have tracking problems, state estimation problems,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
planning problems, and control problems--be it a surgical robot, be it a robot maid,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
or your intelligent future household robot ,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
or even a flying robot, such as an autonomous plane.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I want to thank you for being with us so far.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The rest of this unit contains extra information on SLAM.

00:01:00.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Otherwise, I'll just see you on the final.
