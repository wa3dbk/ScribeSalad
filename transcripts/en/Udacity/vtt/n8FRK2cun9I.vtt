Before we proceed with our discussion of

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.410
interdomain traffic engineering, let's take a brief quiz

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.550
reminding ourselves about the differences between intradomain routing

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.490
and interdomain routing. Which of the following are

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.990
examples of interdomain routing? Peering between two

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.510
internet service providers. Peering between a university network,

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.390
and its ISP. Peering at an internet exchange

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.180
point. Routing inside a data center. Or routing

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.100
across multiple data centers. Please again, check all that apply.
