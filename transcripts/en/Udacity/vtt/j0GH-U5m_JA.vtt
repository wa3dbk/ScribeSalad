I hope you've gained some insights into factoring more quickly using these

00:00:03.642 --> 00:00:07.160
patterns. Before we get to some practice on this factoring, let's review our

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.590
thinking. First we want to decide if there's a GCF. If there is, we should

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.503
factor it out first and keep it on the outside. If there's not a GCF, then we

00:00:15.503 --> 00:00:19.715
should ask is there a special pattern here? The special patterns make our life a

00:00:19.715 --> 00:00:23.911
little bit easier and we can use these to identify the factors. If there's not a

00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:27.816
special pattern, we want to use factoring by grouping. We can pull out common

00:00:27.816 --> 00:00:32.496
factors from four terms and then pull out another common factor from those two

00:00:32.496 --> 00:00:32.973
terms.
