00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.560
So you're all comfortable
with your home directory, but

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.130
surely there's more to this
computer than just that.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:05.939
Right?

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:07.750
Oh yeah, there is a lot more.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.480
So let's start exploring some
of the other areas of the Linux

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.790
operating system.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.400
We'll do this by cding to the top
level root folder with cd /.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.200
If we ls -al this directory, we'll see
that there's a lot of content here.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.500
We're definitely not going to
cover all of these, but

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.010
we'll discuss the most
important folders.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.740
We're already familiar with home,
but there are two other important

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.640
directories where you'll be making
lots of changes and editing files.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.290
Etc is where configuration files live.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.550
As we start setting up our web and

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.270
database server, we'll be modifying
some files within this directory.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.400
Var is for variable files.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.100
Which is kind of an odd name.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.830
Variable files are simply files
that you expect to grow or

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.190
change in size over time.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.250
You'll typically find system and
application logs within this directory.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.600
There are a few other directories that
are that are important for you to know,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.840
but you probably won't be modifying or
directly interacting with them.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.770
Bin is where executable
binaries are stored,

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.070
that are accessible by all users.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.310
These are applications that you run,

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.380
like the LS command we've
used a few times already.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.370
If you were to list
the contents of this directory,

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.810
you would actually see there's
a file called LS within it.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.330
SBin is very similar to bin, except
that these binaries are to only be

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.670
used by the route user for system
administration and maintenance purposes.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.600
We'll discuss some of the applications
within this directory a bit later.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.400
Lib is for

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.460
libraries that support the binaries
that are located around the system.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.330
Finally, usr is for user programs.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.720
This could seem a bit confusing
compared to the bin directory.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.070
The difference isn't that important.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.770
The only difference really is that
the binaries within bin are required for

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.870
a boot-up and
system maintenance processes,

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.230
and the binaries in usr necessarily
aren't required for that.
