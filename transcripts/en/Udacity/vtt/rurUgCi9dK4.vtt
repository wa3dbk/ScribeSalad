00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And, of course, there are much more sophisticated pre-processing rules

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
than the one that we have discussed here,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
which, unfortunately, lie outside the scope of this course.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.700
But there's one final question about pre-processing

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.000
that I would like to discuss with you, and that is when to apply pre-processing.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.500
And this is one you'll have to think through a bit.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.000
Is it before starting the search tree--of course,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.500
you start the algorithm and not the tree, but you know what I mean.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.000
Is it at each level of the search tree?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Is it regularly during the search tree algorithm?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Or is it after the search tree is completed?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So, again, you might have to think these through a little bit

00:00:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and then please check each one that is correct.
