00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.765
For this problem, x would equal positive 1. Nice effort if you got this one

00:00:04.765 --> 00:00:09.123
correct. To start solving this equation, we want to isolate the radical on one

00:00:09.123 --> 00:00:14.188
side, so we need to get rid of the subtraction of 1 here. We add 1 to both

00:00:14.188 --> 00:00:20.238
sides of the equation to get the 4th root of 3x minus 2 equals 1. We want to

00:00:20.238 --> 00:00:25.015
undo this 4th root. So we raise both sides of the equation to the 4th power.

00:00:25.015 --> 00:00:29.735
This leaves us with 3x minus 2 on the left, and 1 to the 4th, or just 1 on the

00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:35.878
right. We add 2 to both sides of the equation to get 3x equals positive 3. And

00:00:35.878 --> 00:00:41.130
finally, to get x by itself, we divide by the coefficient 3 to get x equals 1.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.934
To be sure this is correct, we check this in the original equation. We

00:00:45.934 --> 00:00:50.750
substitute x with the value of positive 1, and then try and check. Here, we'll

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.668
get a 4th root, a positive 1. And we know the 4th root of 1 is just 1. Then we

00:00:55.668 --> 00:01:00.076
subtract to get 0 equals 0. So yes, this answer checks, which means this is our

00:01:00.076 --> 00:01:01.230
solution.
