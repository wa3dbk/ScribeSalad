00:00:00.118 --> 00:00:03.350
How are you doing with all the stuff
we've looked at up to this point?

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.220
You should have a good grasp on how
the components we've looked at so

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.850
far all fit together.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.800
Where the data gets sent and
how the data appears in the template.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.460
Remember don't get overwhelmed with
all of the different parts of angular.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.880
Just like with lego bricks,
each new component is its own unit and

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.980
snaps on to some other component.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.510
As you're working with the new
component just try to mentally

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.090
place it in this map.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.320
Then try and make the connections
between it and the other components.
