00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.800
That's a bit of a pain. Here is how you convince

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.800
the Java compiler to do it anyway. This is a very strange

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.850
syntax, whose origins are somewhere in the mist of time of

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.780
programming languages and we won't dwell on that. But here is what

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.200
you need to do. This value here, is of type double.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.010
Now we don't want it to be in double. We want it

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.830
to be in integer. And then you have to put the

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.400
name of the type that you want and, put parentheses around it.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.340
And put it before the expression you want to

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.650
convert. What now happens is, this expression here is

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.880
computed. The fractional part is discarded. The integer

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.860
part, is moved over here. This operation is called

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.210
a cast. That's a curious name, are we

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.670
casting out a fishing rod? Is it cast around

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.580
a broken a foot? The cast of characters in a play? Well I guess it's mostly like

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.720
the latter, becaues we have this value here.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.230
That actually is a, fractional number and we want to

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.610
cast it, not as the hero in the play

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.410
but as an integer. Whatever, that's just what it's

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.950
called. Every once in a while, you need

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.330
to do this. You have, something that's not of

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.610
the type that you want, you want to change its

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.310
type and, the cast notation does that for us.
