00:00:00.072 --> 00:00:02.960
We will also look at how tools can improve software phases,

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.660
the software activities, and can support software development tasks in general.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.890
And this is something that I will repeat over and over

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.340
in the class, tools and automation are fundamental, in software engineering.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.910
And they're fundamental for improving productivity, not only efficiency but also

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.820
effectiveness of our activities in the software development process. So let

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.110
me go back to one of the diagrams that I showed

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.170
you before. If you remember we had this qualititive diagram in which

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.170
we were showing that one of the issues that led to the

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.350
software crisis was the fact that developers' productivity was not able to

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.580
keep up with the software size and complexity, with the growth in

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.750
the importance and the complexity of software. What tools can help us

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.150
to do is to change this and basically move this curve from

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.950
this original position up here. So that it gets closer and closer

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.970
to what we need to develop the software that we need to

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.230
build. So let me discuss examples on how tools can improve productivity.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.970
For example, if we are talking about development, think about

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.890
what kind of improvement it was to go from punch

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.440
cards to modern IDEs. If we're talking about languages, think

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.210
about of how much more productive developers became when going from

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.830
writing machine code to writing code in high-level languages. And

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.750
finally, if we talk about debugging, which is a very important

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.140
and expensive activity, moving from the use of print lines

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.060
to the use of symbolic debuggers dramatically improve the effectiveness and

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.810
efficiency of development. And these are just some of the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.050
tools that we will discuss in the rest of the class

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.350
and notice that we will also use the tools in practice.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.290
So we will use the tools before projects and also during

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.153
the lessons and for assignments. In particular, we will use

00:01:30.153 --> 00:01:33.920
three main kinds of tools. The first type is IDE's. And

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.140
I'm pretty sure you're familiar with IDE's. These are integrated development

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.250
environments. So, advanced editors in which you can write, compile, run,

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.950
and debug and even test your code. We'll also use a

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.190
version control system, systems that allow you to save, and restore, and

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.750
check the differences between different versions of the code, in particular

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.950
we will be working with git. We will also be looking at

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.460
other kinds of tools like coverage and verification tools. These are

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.310
tools that can help you during testing and I'm a big fan

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.710
of these tools, so I'm really going to stress the usefulness

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.530
of these tools and how you should use them in your development.
