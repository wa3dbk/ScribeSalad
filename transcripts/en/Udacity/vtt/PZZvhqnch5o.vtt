00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.410
So the first technique that we will consider is Tomasulo's algorithm.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.950
It's really one of the first techniques for out-of-order execution and

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.830
now it's more than 40 years old. It was used in the old IBM 360 machines,

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.360
which are now, again, more than 40 years old.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.730
What it does is it determines which instructions have inputs ready so

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.360
that they can go in the next cycle and which instructions still have to wait for

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.040
their inputs to be produced. It also includes a form of register renaming, and

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.595
it is surprisingly similar to what we actually use today as far as

00:00:30.595 --> 00:00:34.350
out-of-order execution is concerned. So although this is more than 40 years old,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.380
it actually is very useful to know how it works because it's kind of like

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.240
the first approach, so it's simpler than what we use today, but it really well

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.610
explains what's going on. The differences between Tomasulo's algorithm and

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.420
what is used today are only that in the olden days,

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.960
when Tomasulo's algorithm was implemented, they did that only for

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.490
floating point instructions, while today, we do it for all instructions. Also,

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.600
they had relatively few instructions in the window that they're looking at,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.459
meaning they only really looked over some small number of instructions into the,

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.880
you know, future instructions that need to be executed well today.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.860
We look at hundreds instructions past the one we are still executing.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.260
In the olden days, exception handling for

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.490
floating point instructions was not such a big problem, because they were only

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.140
considering really execution of kind of floating point extensive applications.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.880
And you know, those will be programmed and so on, and you would usually run one

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.430
program at a time. If there is an exception, you could do some drastic measures.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.840
Today, process include explicit support for exception handling that we will see

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.000
later. So we first again look at how the Tomasulo's algorithm did it and

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.700
then we consider how today's processors do these additional things.
