00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.360
That might have been tricky. The answer should look something like this. There

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.942
might be other ways to do it, but I think this is the simplest one. If you

00:00:05.942 --> 00:00:10.245
didn't get this, it's okay. There's more practice coming up. There are some

00:00:10.245 --> 00:00:13.740
subtletles to how this method works, so let's go through an example. Let's say

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.610
we have two variables, one for Maria and one for Jamesha. Each of those should

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.030
contain a person object with a name and friends. We have string objects. For

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.290
Maria's name, Maria's current friends, Jamesha's name and Jamesha's current

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.470
friends. Let's say we call maria.addFriend(jamesha). We call this method on the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.110
maria object and we pass in as an argument the Jamesha object. Now, when this

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.320
line runs, the first thing that it does is creates a new string from these

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.890
ones. This will be the new string that's created. It's going to put together

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.150
friends, friend.name, and a space. Friends is the friends of the maria object

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.520
because that's what we called the method on. So, we go to the Maria object, and

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.146
friends is currently just TJ, with a space. friend.name is the friend, the

00:01:02.146 --> 00:01:07.540
argument, which was the Jamesha object, dot name, which is Jamesha. And the

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.962
space is just a space. So, when these strings get put together, it'll look like

00:01:11.962 --> 00:01:18.599
TJ Jamesha. Now the string created by this part will be assigned into the

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:23.170
friends variable. So, the old reference will go away and a new one will be

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.180
created. And now, Jamesha appears in the friends of Maria. The old friends

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.780
string that contained just TJ might still be around. And it hasn't changed, but

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.342
the friends variable in the Maria object now contains a reference to a

00:01:36.342 --> 00:01:38.259
different string.
