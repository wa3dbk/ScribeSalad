00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.280
So let's look at the solution for our latency and throughput quiz.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.770
We have a website that has 2 servers. A server takes a millisecond to process

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:16.059
an order, so the latency of an order is clearly 1 millisecond.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.360
That's how long it takes from the time the order arrives until the time it

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.420
is actually served. The throughput of a single server, because it

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.060
cannot do anything else while processing the order, is going to be one order

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.670
per millisecond or a 1000 orders per second. But we have two such servers, so

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.010
we can process 2000 orders per second. So this illustrates again

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.080
the situation where the throughput is not just equal to 1 over the latency.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.490
If it were like that, we would have only 1000 orders per second. But we can

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.550
buy more throughput, simply through replication of service in this case and thus

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.960
achieve a higher throughput than the latency of a single server would indicate.
