It definitely is a problem if there's a network failure

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.560
between the nodes and they can't talk to one another.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.640
It's also a problem if we had a disk failure,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.830
on an individual data node. It's not a problem that some

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.010
nodes are unused, they'll be used by data later. It's

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.890
also not a problem that some of the block sizes

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.780
are different. It is a problem if we were to

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.450
lose the disk on the name node and lose our metadata.
