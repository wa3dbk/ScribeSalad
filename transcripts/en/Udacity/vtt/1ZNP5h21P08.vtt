There are a variety of different approaches to implementing generalization in

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.040
object oriented languages.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.500
One that we just alluded to, is inheritance that follows specific rules.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.880
Second, you could just simply use a single class that has some kind of flag

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.740
that indicates whether a particular instance is of a certain type, and you might

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.410
have multiple types and the fly could have multiple different, different values.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.170
If you did that you would then be hiding the child data that particular type

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.270
inside that that that class as indicated by the flag.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.060
In Java you could use interfaces or enums which are two mechanisms that

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.160
allow you that enforce the rules that I've that I've laid out,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.980
you can use the state pattern when we get to design patterns you'll see.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.360
That there might be situations where you want

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.640
to have some flexibility that's not provided by using strict sub-classing.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.470
For example imagine that you're implementing a, application having to

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.690
do with a library and the library might have different categories of books.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.210
It might have one-week books, two-weeks books,

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.620
four-week books, and it would, might be natural to say well,

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.870
I'll have three subclasses of the, of the class book.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.090
But what happens when a one-week book becomes a two-week book?

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.370
And auditory language is you can't change the class of something.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:29.030
Once you've established as as being of a class, it's, it's there for ever.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.840
So the state patterns allow, allows you to have a way to have

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.840
dynamically be able to adjust the class of an object.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.160
And then for languages like C++ that have multiple inheritance, this gives you

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.050
the, the ability to specify the properties that you wish to inherit in more

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.760
than one class and be able to inherit from those classes just what you need.
