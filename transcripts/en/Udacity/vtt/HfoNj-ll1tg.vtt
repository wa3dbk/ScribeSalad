00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.010
Let's consider the following graph and suppose we want to find a shortest tour for this graph,

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.860
and in order to help with that, we first find the minimum spanning tree for the graph.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.810
So let's mark the edges that are part of the minimum spanning tree in purple here like so.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.490
So, if you are to take a tour along this minimum spanning tree, let's say starting at A,

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.770
we might do something like this starting at A then through D and G and back to D

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:32.670
through E through H back to E, B, C, F, and then all the way back along the route, back up to A.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.760
So, maybe you can see that there are some redundancies in this tour,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.140
for example, we go to D back down to G and then back up to D.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.520
So, instead of going along this tree route, let's optimize a bit,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.540
but instead of always following the minimum spanning tree,

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.520
let's compute this tree route first,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.860
but then, instead of following it, we look at the next vertex in the tree route that we haven't gone to yet

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.930
and we take the shortest path there.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.840
So, for example, we would start out at A and then the next vertex along the path is D, so we go there,

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.910
and then G, so we go there,

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.490
but then the next vertex that we haven't visited yet along the tree path is E not D

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.990
and we can go there just by short circuiting here.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.460
So we cut D out and go straight to E and then we'd go to H,

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.780
and again, the next unvisited vertex along the tree path is B not E,

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.280
but there's no shorter path in this from H to B, so we would still follow it in this case.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.770
Then C and F would still be unvisited, so we would follow them exactly,

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.060
but then the next unvisited vertex,

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.910
well, is all the way back at A since we'd just say that the first vertex is unvisited.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.390
Well then, what we really want is the shortest path from F to A not necessarily along the tree route

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.240
and you can see that shortest path is actually along up here.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.160
So, instead of following this tree path,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.040
we have a slightly shorter tour that sticks close to the tree path

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.110
but it doesn't necessarily follow it exactly.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.200
Now, my questions then are what percentage improvement do we get

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.600
in this tour versus the original tree path?

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.389
And second, what approximation factor do we achieve in this specific instance?

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:13.140
Now remember, in order to figure out the approximation factor,

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.060
you'll need to calculate the optimal tour length for this graph.

00:02:17.060 --> 99:59:59.000
Please input your answers in the two boxes.
