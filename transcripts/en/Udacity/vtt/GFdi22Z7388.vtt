00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.090
Before we get back to Marla,

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.770
there's one thing you should
know about chronic disease.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.770
Medical problems like the flu and
most other infections or

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.270
fractures are called
acute medical problems.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.137
Because they either go away or can be
cured in a relatively short time frame.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.640
Chronic problems are,
by definition, not curable.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.095
The best we can do is help the patient
manage them so they don't get worse and

00:00:30.095 --> 00:00:33.330
the often terrible complications
of these diseases,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.220
including death either don't occur or
are delayed.
