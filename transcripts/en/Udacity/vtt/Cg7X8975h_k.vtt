00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.525
Now you might have been tempted to write that our linear factor was x minus one

00:00:03.525 --> 00:00:08.825
half, since if we set this equal to 0 and solve for x we get one half. However

00:00:08.825 --> 00:00:13.831
I want an integer coefficient in constant terms here. This way we can transform

00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:18.623
our linear factor to be like that. Is by multiplying both sides by 2, since

00:00:18.623 --> 00:00:23.194
that's the denominator of our fraction here. If we do that, we end up with a

00:00:23.194 --> 00:00:27.958
linear factor instead of 2x minus 1. We can double check, and sure enough, the

00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:32.914
greatest common factor between 2 and negative 1, is 1. Perfect, this must be

00:00:32.914 --> 00:00:34.659
one of our linear factors.
