00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.530
Try multiplying these two fractions together. You'll want to factor the

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.287
numerators and denominators first, and then, cancel any factors that reduce to

00:00:08.287 --> 00:00:12.833
one. Write your answer here and leave it in factored form. For example, if your

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:16.373
fraction multiplies to this, you don't want to multiply your two factors

00:00:16.373 --> 00:00:18.983
together in the numerator. Just leave them factored.
