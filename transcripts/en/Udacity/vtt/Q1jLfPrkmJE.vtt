00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here is a candidate answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Remember list comprehensions start and end

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
with the square brackets that mean I'm making a list.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I want to print out x cubed for every x in 0 to 99, but we can get that with range 100.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But I only want to print it out if x is even, and to do that, I will compute the remainder

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
when x is divided by 2 if that remainder is 0,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
then x was even, x cubed to be less than 20.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
In fact, there are only two of these 0 cubed and 2 cubed.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
As soon as we get up even to 4,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
4 cubed is 64, which is already much higher than 20.

00:00:32.000 --> 09:59:59.000
A very short list comprehended down from a very large one.
