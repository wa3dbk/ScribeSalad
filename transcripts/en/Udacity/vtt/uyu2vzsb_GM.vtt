00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.620
So we just finished lesson zero, which

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.500
was an introduction. In this lesson, lesson one,

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.870
we will build two main projects while

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.420
using functions. Now, towards the end of this

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.920
lesson we will present a scenario where

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.400
functions won't quite present a very eloquent solution.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.190
That will pave the way for us to learn new stuff in lesson two and three.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.700
&gt;&gt; Now if you feel extremely

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.600
comfortable with functions and understand their limitations

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.460
completely you should consider moving on to the next lesson, however

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.860
if you feel like you want to learn more about functions

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.420
in the Python programming language, continue to take this lesson, watch

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.140
the next video, we will use it to write our first program.
