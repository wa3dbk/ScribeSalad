00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.280
Dot voting or zen voting allows you and
your team to zero in on the best ideas.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.920
This activity is actually
a part of the decide stage, but

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.970
it can follow the crazy 8s or
any rapid sketching that you do.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.470
In zen voting, you lay out all
the sketches on a table or

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.120
you tape them to a wall.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.050
Then, you give everyone a limited number
of sticker dots, usually two or three.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.610
And you have people silently pick the
best ideas by placing their sticker dot

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.820
on that sketch.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.050
It's important for the voting to be
silent, so people can choose without

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.340
being easily persuaded by
the loudest person in the room.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.700
After voting, you and
your team can discuss the best ideas.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.790
Take a minute to think
about your sketches and

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.640
the example sketch that was
provided from the Crazy 8s.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.900
Which two ideas did you like the best?

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.490
