00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.030
In this lesson we examined in more
detail exactly how data from multiple

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.380
EHR systems can be queried and
aggregated for diverse purposes,

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.800
from quality reporting to
advanced clinical research.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.660
All of these technologies serve the
essential role of providing a framework

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.420
over the many non inoperable
EHR systems deployed today.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.710
Taken together they illustrate different
technological solutions, each of which

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.510
is optimized for a specific problem in
a specific cross institutional context.
