Great job so far, this is pretty complicated stuff. To wrap up this lesson we're

00:00:06.131 --> 00:00:10.289
going to do a little experiment and it's going to be awesome if you guys

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:15.460
participate. Together we're all going to generate sampling distributions of size

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.832
1, 5, and t0. So here's what we're going to do. Pick a number, any number

00:00:20.832 --> 00:00:25.723
between 1 and 1048. Click the link to access the Klout score data, and then find

00:00:25.723 --> 00:00:31.098
the Klout score in the row of the number you picked. So if you picked the number

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:36.926
786, for example, go to row 786, find what Klout score that is, then write it

00:00:36.926 --> 00:00:43.278
down. Next,pick 5 numbers between 1 and 1048, find the Klout scores in these

00:00:43.278 --> 00:00:49.476
rows, take the average, and then write this number down. Finally, repeat this

00:00:49.476 --> 00:00:54.896
process with ten numbers. So you should get three numbers. Write these numbers

00:00:54.896 --> 00:00:59.518
in the Google form, with the link below. So essentially, we're going to get a

00:00:59.518 --> 00:01:04.717
bunch of means, depending on how many of you guys participate. So let's say 1000

00:01:04.717 --> 00:01:10.140
of you participate. Then we'll have 1000 Klout scores. Which we'll then create a

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.692
distribution for. And this should look like the population distribution. And

00:01:14.692 --> 00:01:22.179
we'll also have 1000 means, of samples of size five. And we'll have 1000 means

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:27.481
from samples of size 10. Then we'll be able to graph each of these sampling

00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:32.337
distributions and see if it turns out how we theoretically would have expected.

00:01:32.338 --> 00:01:36.763
So time for your last quiz of this lesson. Is this going to be awesome?
