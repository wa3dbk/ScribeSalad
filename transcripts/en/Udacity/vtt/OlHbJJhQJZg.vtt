00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
Now back to our initial question.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.440
What does all of this mean for Alice, Bob, and Carol?

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.410
We have already seen that

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.480
the problems they are trying to solve are contained in NP

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.730
and so what we could now try is

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.130
to show that their problems are actually

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.020
NP complete.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.010
To do that, what we need to do is

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.000
we need to reduce SAT

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.200
to one of their problems,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.350
and we're going to do this with clique.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.960
It's also possible to do this with vertex cover or independent set,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.630
but clique is actually one of the easier ones to see.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.930
And now what we need to show is

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.100
for any given instance of SAT,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.770
so for any Boolean formula, if you will,

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.470
we can transform it

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.150
into an input for the clique problem

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.200
in polynomial time such that clique

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.320
as a decision problem will say yes

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.470
if the Boolean formula has a satisfying assignment

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.320
and no otherwise,

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.290
and once we achieve this, we know that clique is NP complete

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.670
and since we have already seen there are polynomial time reductions

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.930
between clique, vertex, and independent set,

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.459
if clique is NP complete,

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:07.770
then these 2 problems here are also NP complete

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.220
which of course will mean that

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.360
not only will Bob be very unhappy about this,

00:01:11.360 --> 99:59:59.000
but Alice and Carol will be in this together, as well.
