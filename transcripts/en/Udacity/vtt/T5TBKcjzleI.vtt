00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:11.232
If you put this data in order, you have 38,150, 41,290, 48,670, 53,160, 57,320,

00:00:11.232 --> 00:00:19.288
and 500,000. And then if we cancel out the first and last, second to first,

00:00:19.288 --> 00:00:24.334
second to last. We can't cross out these two, then we're left with nothing. Or

00:00:24.334 --> 00:00:28.621
we could include both of them, but we can't have two medians. So in that case we

00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:32.800
take the number exactly in the middle of these two. What is this number? Put

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.795
your answer here.
