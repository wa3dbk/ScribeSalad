You might be wondering where the 30 and the 11 come from in the number puzzle.

00:00:04.158 --> 00:00:08.726
Well we actually multiply the coefficient of the x squared term and the constant

00:00:08.726 --> 00:00:13.111
term together to get this top number. This bottom number 11 comes from our x

00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:17.668
term. Whenever we want to factor a trinomial we can set up a number puzzle and

00:00:17.668 --> 00:00:23.038
then find the two factors we need to rewrite the x term. So, I can rewrite this

00:00:23.038 --> 00:00:30.014
expression as x squared plus 5x plus 6x plus 30. We can rewrite the 11x as 5x

00:00:30.014 --> 00:00:36.094
and 6x. The 2 numbers come from our number puzzle. By rewriting this x term as

00:00:36.094 --> 00:00:41.496
5x plus 6x we can use factoring by grouping. I remove an x from the first 2

00:00:41.496 --> 00:00:46.850
terms and a six from the second two terms. And whoa, look at that, our factored

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.188
form. So for any quadratic trinomial, we can try this process to factor it. We

00:00:52.188 --> 00:00:57.280
can find two factors of a times c, that sum to the middle number b. We'll

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.033
rewrite the middle term using those factors and then try factoring by grouping.
