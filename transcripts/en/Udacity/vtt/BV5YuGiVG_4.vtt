00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is that it'd better be d.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The reason for that is that's what the private key is.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The private key includes the secret d.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The public key includes e.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If we want the private key to be secret and hard for an adversary to guess,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
it's got to include something that is unpredictable.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
That will be the value of d.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
N, again, is part of the public key, so that doesn't provide any security for the private key.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Notice from this that since e is public, it's okay if e is computed in a predictable way.

00:00:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
In fact, e is often chosen to be a small value.
