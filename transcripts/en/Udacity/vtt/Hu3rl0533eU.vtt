00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.931
So the first successful
pitch meeting was very cool.

00:00:04.931 --> 00:00:07.260
We made a lot of progress.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.750
We had terms set up and we decided
that we were going to meet again and

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.680
going to bring my co-founders and
we're going to sign term sheet,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.630
and I came to that
meeting like a winner.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.380
Hey, I'm here.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.820
Where's the money?

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.370
Those are the co-founders,
let's get on with it.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:34.830
And the investor looked at me and said,
Norm, I'm not in your pocket, you know.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.590
I think that you're going to get
three or four more investors

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.730
that will commit the same amount
of money, and then we'll proceed.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.620
I don't know any more investors.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.380
I just got introduced to you by
someone that I'm working with.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.010
But we did, we did that.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.120
We went and brought more investors
to participate in the same round and

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.680
he eventually gave me the money and
he became one of my dearest friends and

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.690
that was the story of
the first investor.
