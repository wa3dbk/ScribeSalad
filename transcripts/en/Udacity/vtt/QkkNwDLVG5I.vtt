00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This notion of causality is important in debugging

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
because when you fix a defect we want to make sure to think first.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We want to make sure that the defect is actually error, that is it is wrong.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We also want to make sure that the defect causes the failure if A is the defect and B is the failure.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We want to make sure that if the defect hadn't been there then the failure must not occur either.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And these are the two things we need to show when we fix a defect.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In order to make sure that the defect is an error, we must show how to correct it

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and to show that the defect causes the failure,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
we must show that the failure no longer occurs after we have changed it.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It is important to show both the defect is an error and the cause

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
in order to avoid situations in which a defect only is an error but does not cause the failure

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
or that something causes the failure but is not an error.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Let's look at the these. First, you can have an error that's not a cause.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Here's you, looking at your program and you look at the program and find tons and tons of errors.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Here's one, here's one, and there's one and you fix them and you think you're done,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
but you don't know whether any of these actually fixes the problem

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
because it may well be that these errors you find that none of them actually causes the failure.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
It simply means that after any fix you need to verify whether your fix actually did the trick

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and better yet before the fix, you should be able to precisely predict

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
that your change will actually fix the failure.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The second category is causes that are not errors.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
If you think of our Mozilla example for instance, we found that the select tech in the input

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
causes Mozilla to crash when printing, however, this is just a cause, it is not an error.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
This is perfectly legal html input and at the very least some input that

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Mozilla should normally be able to cope with.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
In particular Mozilla should not crash on any input.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
What we have here is the cause, but we haven't find the error yet.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000
The error is somewhere in the, code probably in the piece of code that handles the printing of select tags.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
We can have errors that are not causes and causes that are not errors.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The goal in debugging is to find errors that actually caused the failure.
