00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.303
Why is this transformation a good idea?

00:00:02.303 --> 00:00:03.974
We still have to share the information

00:00:03.974 --> 00:00:07.443
for a source object up here across all these threads.

00:00:07.443 --> 00:00:09.746
That doesn't change from our previous implementation.

00:00:09.746 --> 00:00:14.211
But now we don't have to share any destination object information at all,

00:00:14.211 --> 00:00:17.986
because 1 thread is completely responsible for 1 destination object,

00:00:17.986 --> 00:00:21.956
so we can load that object's information directly into that thread's local storage.

00:00:21.956 --> 00:00:26.861
And we don't have to communicate between threads to sum up individual forces.

00:00:26.861 --> 00:00:29.494
So it used to be we had P different threads here,

00:00:29.494 --> 00:00:33.170
and we had to communicate between those P threads to add up all these forces.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.800
Now because we only have 1 thread that's responsible for all these forces,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.806
we don't have to do any communication between threads at all.

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:44.244
That thread can just accumulate all of the partial results in its local storage.

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:46.913
So the result is a faster implementation overall.

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:52.250
Dave discussed this technique generically in the last unit, Unit 5, and he used the term privatization.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.920
So in making this transformation,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.223
is the amount of parallelism now increased, decreased, or kept constant from the previous implementation?
