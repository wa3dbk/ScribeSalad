00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
In principle, of course, you know by now

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
how to show that a problem is NP-complete

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
because we have already shown this in the last unit for 4 different problems.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We have shown the NP-completeness for vertex cover,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
we have shown the NP-completeness for clique,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
we have shown the NP-completeness for independent set,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and then for SAT, the mother of all NP-complete problems if you will.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So for showing NP-completeness, there is always 2 steps.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
First you have to show that your problem is in NP,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
which means that a nondeterministic RAM

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
can solve your problem in polynomial time,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and later in this course we will meet some problems

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
actually that are worse than NP-complete problems,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
so it's often a very simple step,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but it's one that you have to go through

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
because you might be dealing with even harder problems although that is unlikely.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And the second step was finding a polynomial time reduction

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
from another problem that is known to be NP-complete

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
using the ideas that Cook and Levin had for their famous Cook-Levin theorem.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Then we showed that clique is NP-complete by reducing SAT to clique.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And then from our first unit,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
we already knew that clique, vertex cover,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and independent set are all very closely connected to each other.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So you can basically reduce these problems to each other

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
in any order or way that you want

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
because they are so closely related.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I would like to do a brief quiz with you,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
which is a little bit subjective although I think you'll likely agree with me,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and what I would like you to tell me is

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
how difficult you found those reductions that we have encountered so far.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So showing that SAT is NP-complete,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
showing that clique is NP-complete,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and then showing that vertex cover and independent set are NP-complete,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and I would like you to rank these

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
3 reductions that we have had so far by difficulty

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
where 1 means easiest,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
3 means most difficult, and you can guess what 2 means.

00:01:51.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So please rank the difficulty of those reductions that we have encountered so far.
