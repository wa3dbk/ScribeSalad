00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.940
Right, I am a little
bit stuck right now.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:10.580
So what I do when I have a bug, and I
can't quite pin down what's causing it,

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.830
I make the feature that's broken,
simpler.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.910
So I take out, take components out

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.740
until I have a working feature again and
then I gradually add them back in.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.268
And then each one that I add back in,
I'm tweaking to fix it.

00:00:32.268 --> 00:00:34.427
&gt;&gt; Gosh, there's a lot of
different ways to be stuck.

00:00:34.427 --> 00:00:38.681
But if I'm writing something that has a
lot of calculation and somehow it's not

00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:43.125
coming through the way I expected,
sometimes it's best just to start over.

00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:46.575
There can be something powerful about
starting again with a blank slate, and

00:00:46.575 --> 00:00:48.365
rewriting something.

00:00:48.365 --> 00:00:51.175
&gt;&gt; Sometimes when I get stuck
in the developing process

00:00:51.175 --> 00:00:53.890
because I'm frustrated or
I just don't really,

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.930
I can't see how to get from where
I am to where I want to go.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.450
I find the smallest possible thing
that I know I can get done, and

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.100
I just go after that.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.320
And a lot of times just closing
that tiny little gap, that easy

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.470
chore that had to be done, is enough
to just sort of get you going again.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.750
&gt;&gt; So when I get stuck, it kind of
depends on the mood or the reason.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.730
A lot of times I get stuck because I'm
just using poor debugging practices,

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:20.880
and being lazy,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.350
instead of actually digging through the
debugger and finding out what's wrong.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.370
Other times, if its more of
an inspiration thing, I'll just go for

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.020
a walk, get outside, get away
from the computer for a while and

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.710
then come back to the project.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.650
&gt;&gt; So when I get stuck,

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.200
my first instinct is to go to
the team that I'm working with.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.960
I find that everybody
has different skills and

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.580
different expertise, and
leveraging that is to your benefit.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.440
So a quick hey,
have you seen this before?

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.740
Do you have a fix for it,
is always worth a try.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.770
Barring that, I go to Google, and

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.100
normally it spits out something
like StackOverflow.com.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.260
But sometimes it also goes to
the Apple documentation, and

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.440
just carefully reading the methods
that are provided to you,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.420
the properties that are provided to you,
and trying to find a way

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.300
around the problem instead of through
the problem can often help fix your bug.
