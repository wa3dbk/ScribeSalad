00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.670
So, to get a better sense of how timing works,

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.530
I've defined a procedure spin loop. Spin loop starts by

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.780
initializing the variable i to zero and then it goes

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.610
through a loop n times, each time through the loop is

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.180
just adds one to i. So that'll run for longer,

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.090
we can, by picking the value of n, make it

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.680
go through the loop any number of times. So, let's

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.480
try that. So I'll try running the loop 1,000 times and

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:33.940
now we get no result, and the time it took is 0.0001 seconds. So, about a tenth

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.370
of a millisecond. Let's try it with a

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.030
larger number of executions, so now I am going

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.700
to increase the number of iterations by ten,

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.100
so the value of n's multiplied by ten. And

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.070
if we see that now, the time is, is higher, the time is increased to about six

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.760
tenths of a millisecond and we can keep increasing

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.350
the time, so let's try looping 100,000 times. And

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.140
we see if the time increases. And the time

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.155
increased by about a factor of ten. Between looping

00:01:02.155 --> 00:01:05.650
10,000 times and looping 100,000 times. And we'll try

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.550
one more time. Let's go for a million. If

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.670
we go for a million times, now we're up

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.120
to 0.05. So, five hundredths of a second, or

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.830
55 milliseconds. To loop a million times. Still pretty fast, right? We're going

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.920
through that loop a million times. It's still much less than a second.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.007
What's important is, we can see that well, the time changes depending on

00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:28.090
the input. As we increase the input

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.680
to spin loop, the time increases accordingly.
