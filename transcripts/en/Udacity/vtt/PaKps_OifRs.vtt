00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.460
The sixth section describes the method that you use to conduct the study.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.390
This includes the number of trials or

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.290
measurement devices and tools, any randomization techniques were appropriate,

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.000
and number of significant digits you used in your measurements and so on.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.270
This should also include an explicit statement of which subjects will be run,

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.610
and the arguments used for each of your trials. For example if you were studying

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.690
the relationship of performance to grid size, you would want to specify what

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.370
different grid sizes you will be using. The section should also briefly

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.710
describe any statistical techniques you will use, for example linear regression
