00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.940
Take this hypothetical example of twins raised in different environments, their

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.845
nature is the exact same, meaning their genetics are the same. But this one had

00:00:08.845 --> 00:00:16.200
access to music guitars and music lessons, this one didn't. So this one became

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.415
a rock star, this one not so much. That's the difference between nature and

00:00:21.415 --> 00:00:22.080
nurture.
