Melissa would need six hours to edit the film and Carlos would only need four

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.251
hours. Great thinking if you found these two answers. We'll start solving this

00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:12.582
equation by multiplying through by the LCD two and 4 tenths times x times x

00:00:12.582 --> 00:00:18.629
plus 2. The product of these three denominators. When we multiply through by

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:22.837
the LCD, we can simplify each of the terms. The first term reduces to two and

00:00:22.837 --> 00:00:27.768
four tenths times x plus two. The second term reduces to two and four tenths

00:00:27.768 --> 00:00:33.641
times x And the last term simply reduces to x times x plus 2. We distribute 2

00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:39.800
and 4 10ths to get these two terms, and we distribute x to get these two terms.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.225
Next we combine 2 and 4 10ths x, and 2 and 4 10ths x to get 4 and 8 10ths times

00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:49.250
x. Now to clear these decimals, I'm going to go ahead and multiply through by a

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.982
factor of 10. When we multiply through by 10, we'll get 48x48 8, 10x squared,

00:00:55.982 --> 00:01:00.692
and 20x. Now we're ready to move these two terms, to the right hand side of our

00:01:00.692 --> 00:01:03.606
equation, so we can get 0 on the left side, and a quadratic expression on the

00:01:03.606 --> 00:01:09.150
right hand side. Now, we're ready to divide this equation by 2 since all these

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.018
coefficients are even. When we divide each of these terms by 2, we'll get this

00:01:14.018 --> 00:01:19.600
new equation. Now we can factor. When we use factoring by grouping, we get the

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.245
factors 5x plus 6 and x minus 4. We set each factor equal to 0 and then we can

00:01:25.245 --> 00:01:30.481
solve for the values of X. X can equal positive 4 or X can equal negative 6

00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:36.350
fifths. We know X to the amount of time it takes for Carlos to edit the film.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.140
So, it would take him 4 hours we don't use this choice since it's negative.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.930
That wouldn't make sense with our concept of time. So, since it takes Carlos 4

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.026
hours, it must take Melissa 6 hours. We know this is true since x was 4, which

00:01:51.026 --> 00:01:56.272
is the amount of time it takes Carlos. And Melissa was X plus 2, two more hours

00:01:56.272 --> 00:02:01.490
than Carlos. If you are ever unsure, go back to the original problem. We knew

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.408
Carlos time was represented by X, so he would take four hours to edit the film.

00:02:06.408 --> 00:02:10.127
Melissa takes two hours longer than Carlos so that means that she needs six

00:02:10.127 --> 00:02:15.434
hours in order to edit the film. I know this one was tough, so great work if

00:02:15.434 --> 00:02:16.830
you got it right.
