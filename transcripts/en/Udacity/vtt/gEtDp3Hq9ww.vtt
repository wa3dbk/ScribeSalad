00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.570
At MIT in the early 1980s, a bright
young iconoclast named Danny Hillis was

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.780
trying to build a new super computer.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:07.970
He called it a connection machine.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.430
It looked something like this.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.900
You can tell it's a super computer
because its covered in blinky lights.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.080
Fun fact about these lights, they would
actually blink according to where

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.800
communication was
happening in the system.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.510
I don't know why we don't make
computers anymore with blinking lights.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.160
We really should.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.400
Anyway Hillis's PhD dissertation on
the connection machine is one of my

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.980
all time favorites.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.090
In fact it even won
the doctoral dissertation award

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.350
from the association of
computing machinery in 1985.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.450
That's one of the highest
honors a CSPHD can receive.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.364
Now the kicker is that it won this
award despite its concluding chapter.

00:00:49.404 --> 00:00:52.738
New computer architectures and
their relationship to physics or

00:00:52.738 --> 00:00:54.465
why computer science is no good.

00:00:54.465 --> 00:00:58.951
[NOISE] That's right,
but the best CS PhD of

00:00:58.951 --> 00:01:03.819
1985 poo-pooed the entire discipline.

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:08.290
Now, Hillis was critiquing parallel
algorithms research of the time.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.220
He argued that,
at the end of the day, an algorithm

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.990
has to run on a physical machine which
has to obey the laws of physics.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.680
Yet algorithms researchers were,
in his opinion,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.650
abstracting away way too many details
about the physical costs of computation.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.140
Now Hillis was worried
about the speed of light

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.440
which fundamentally limits how
fast information can travel.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.160
But today you could easily imagine
the melting butter experiment

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.020
as a physical cost
that we largely ignore.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.520
But should we?

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.930
The answer Answer is a resounding,
I don't know, but

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.530
I do think Hillis might
have been on to something.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.450
So what I want to do in this lesson is
to start from this line of thinking and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.320
ask what would it mean to consider
physical costs in designing

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.830
an algorithm?
