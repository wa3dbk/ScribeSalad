00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.360
Why do we need, a language that goes beyond the diagrams?

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.750
The diagrams are great, at describing structural relationships.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.816
We'll see with state charts, that they can also describe some behavior, but

00:00:13.816 --> 00:00:18.280
there's, there're times when you need to be more precise, particularly about

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.010
the functional details. Of exactly what it means for this particular component,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:30.140
to do this particular task. OCL extends UML, with class in variance.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.040
With descriptions, precise descriptions of operations in terms of pre and

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.240
post conditions. And they can also be used as guards on transitions in

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.320
state chart diagrams, which we'll see, subsequently in the term.
