00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.510
It's important to consider these
values you set these parameters to,

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.470
as they can have a huge
impact on battery life.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.050
As we saw with the priorities and

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.080
coarseness, battery usage is impacted
by which sensors you activate.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.490
However and maybe with a bigger
impact is the interval that you use,

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.010
consider how often you really
want to read the sensors.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.210
In this case, you can see we ping them
once a second, which isn't too bad.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.810
But do you really need
that level of accuracy?

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.690
What would happen if you
were more accurate and

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:31.950
pinged them a hundred times a second?

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.730
What would your app experience
be like if you ping them

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.040
once every ten minutes instead?

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.930
These are the type of questions
that you need to consider for

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.140
your users, when designing an app
that uses location services.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.210
So for example, an app for
a hockey coach might want very frequent

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.850
updates of players' locations
on the ice during a game.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.310
So the coach can plot
that data after the game,

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.550
to see the players' effectiveness.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.980
Conversely, an app that tells
you if your kids are home yet

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.210
might only need to check your location
details a few times per hour.
