00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.944
So now let's put this in general terms. Let's say we get some sample mean, X

00:00:06.944 --> 00:00:12.786
bar, after an intervention some sort. So in the case of our example we've been

00:00:12.786 --> 00:00:17.274
using the intervention is the Bieber Tweeter and we want to find the population

00:00:17.274 --> 00:00:22.899
mean after the intervention. And it can be anything ranging from here to here.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:31.175
So long as this sample mean is one of the 95% within 1.96 standard deviations of

00:00:31.175 --> 00:00:39.365
the mean, and remember that one standard deviation is the standard error. The

00:00:39.365 --> 00:00:44.398
population standard deviation divided by root n. So first of all what's our

00:00:44.398 --> 00:00:52.663
point estimate? Is it mew sub i, mew, 1.96, or z bar sub i.?
