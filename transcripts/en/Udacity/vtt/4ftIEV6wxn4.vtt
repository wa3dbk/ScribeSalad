So, Lauren just mentioned that depression is a very common symptom of war

00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:08.102
veterans. So, let's move on now, and talk about major depressive disorder. But

00:00:08.102 --> 00:00:12.662
before we do so, remember that there's a continuum in all disorders. So from

00:00:12.662 --> 00:00:17.025
the everyday fluctuations to the disordered. Same is true for depression. In

00:00:17.025 --> 00:00:20.275
fact, think also about what's happened in your own life when something bad has

00:00:20.275 --> 00:00:24.754
happened. maybe you failed an exam or a boyfriend or girlfriend broke up with

00:00:24.754 --> 00:00:28.694
you. For me, it was in 2009 for instance, when my mother passed away, I was

00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:33.273
really upset for quite a while. But these things are not necessarily

00:00:33.273 --> 00:00:38.314
depression. They're normal everyday fluctuations. So what are the criteria for

00:00:38.314 --> 00:00:42.320
major depression? And for that we're going to move over to Lauren and she's

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.743
going to tell us.
