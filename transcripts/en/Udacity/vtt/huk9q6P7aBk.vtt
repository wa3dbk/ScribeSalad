00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.893
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We know that we could graph the equation like before. Here's the graph and we

00:00:04.893 --> 00:00:09.795
can see if the y intercept 200 is right here. Our slope is 100 because you save

00:00:09.795 --> 00:00:14.537
$100 for every month that goes by. Another way of saying that is our y value

00:00:14.537 --> 00:00:19.297
increase by 100 for every month that passes. But this equation tells a very

00:00:19.297 --> 00:00:24.021
narrow story. It assumes that you save exactly $100 each month. But what if you

00:00:24.021 --> 00:00:28.629
saved more than that? Is there a way to represent this in a, on a graph? Let's

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:33.336
try and figure that out together. First, let's consider a few points. Which of

00:00:33.336 --> 00:00:37.830
these points would represent a time when we saved more than $100 in a month?

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.715
Check all the boxes that apply.
