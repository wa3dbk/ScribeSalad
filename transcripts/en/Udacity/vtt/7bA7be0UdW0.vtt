00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.375
So, what's the simplest polynomial function that we can create from the three

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:07.666
factors we just found? Note that the only factors this polynomial function will

00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:11.684
have are these three, it won't have any others. You don't need to expand or

00:00:11.684 --> 00:00:15.183
simplify the expression, just write it in factored form right here.
